They asked the price of some knives in the window? I said they were 1s. 9d. each. I went to the window, took them out, and showed them one with two blades. They said they only wanted one blade. I turned to look for one - They went out of the shop quickly, and said, they were sorry to trouble me-nobody else was in the shop. I missed a pocketbook that laid on the counter between us. I went out in pursuit, ran round several streets, and found them in Grafton-street, they began to walk-they had been running before. I lost sight of them again, and found them in St. James-street, crossing into Park-lane - I there secured the prisoner - he was with the other man. I asked him, if he had not got something that did not belong to him? I found a map of London in his pocket, which I know to be mine. I took him into Mr. Middleton's shop, and found the pocket-book and memorandum-book on him, which I knew to be mine-the pocket-book was manufactured by myself, and has my private mark; it cost me 10s. 6d., and the map 9s.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man in Oxford-street, we went to Bond-street - he wanted to buy a knife. I went into the shop with him. The prosecutor said he had none to suit us. In passing along the street, the man gave me the things to dispose of for him.</p>

             humbly implores your Lordship to take into your humane consideration the hardships he has undergone. He had no intention of deserting when he left the ship, he fell overboard by accident; had it been designedly, there were six sentries on deck, who would have fired at him. He was six hours and a half in the water, and was so exhausted, that it was several days before he was sufficiently recovered to endeavour to regain the vessel. He then went over in a boat to Rio Janeiro, but found the ship had sailed, and he then got over to Buenos Ayres, where he worked for a printer during a period of three years. He has no doubt but that the returns of the ship at the Secretary of State's office suppose him to be drowned, and the captain of the Fanny he believes is not in England. He hopes these circumstances will have some weight towards mitigating his sentence.]</p>

On the 17th of October I was coming to town to attend the funeral of my son, and met the prisoner on the other side of Barnet - He was standing in the road, and said he was going to town - I said I was going there also, and we walked together. As we went along he pulled out a handkerchief, and offered it to me for 1s. - I bought it of him out of charity, as he said he was in distress. I pulled out my purse, which had 30s. in it, to pay him - He said I had got some money. On arriving at Barnet we had a pint of beer. When we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280006"/>through Whetstone, we came on the road towards Coneyhatch, he said there was a public-house down the road, that he knew the person, and we could have a good bed there-it was then between six and seven o'clock; he said it was the sign of the Orange-tree. I found it was a long way, and said we might as well have gone to Highgate - He said he knew a short road, which would take us to Highgate. When we got on Finchley Common, as I was getting over some rails I fell down and hurt myself, I fell backwards into a ditch - I was quite sober. He came to me - I thought he was going to help me up, but he rolled me over, and said, "Your money, or your life!" He held me down, unbuttoned my breeches-pocket, took out my purse, and ran away - He also took my stick, and left me his. I got up, got into the road as well as I could, and told the patrol what had happened, as well as I could, for I could hardly speak, and he went in search of the prisoner. In about an hour he brought the prisoner in custody to me at a public-house where I waited. They brought my stick to me, I knew it to be mine. They then took me into a room, and told me to shake hands with the man. I went up to him, and said, "Old friend, you did not think of seeing me again so soon." I knew him to be the man. When he was with me he had a smock-frock on, but it was off when he was brought to me. He had told me he was quite broken down.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol on the Finchley-road. The prosecutor came up the road, he appeared as if he could hardly speak. He gave me this account, and I went in pursuit of the man, who he said had taken 30s. and had taken his stick by mistake. I rode about a mile and a quarter, and met Ford. In consequence of information we went about a quarter of a mile, and overtook the prisoner just by the Wellington public-house, going towards town. I asked him where he came from? he said from St. Alban's. I asked him what he had done with his smock-frock? he said he had had none on. I asked him if he had been near Coney-hatch? he said No. I told him if he put his hand to his pocket I would shoot him. As I was taking him to the public-house he said he had a smock-frock. I asked him what he had under his arm? he said, they were his things-(it was the smock-frock.) I found a canvas bag on him, containing 31s. 6d. in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. We fetched the prosecutor to the Wellington, public-house, and showed him a stick which the prisoner had, he claimed it immediately. I then took him into the room where the prosecutor was, with six other men, and told him to shake hands with the man who had robbed him - He immediately went up to the prisoner, and said, "Ah! is that you?"</p>

            . I live at Edgley, in Berkshire. On a Friday, at the beginning of October, I saw the prisoner going through Uxbridge, riding on a gelding; I had received information, and asked him if he was going to Croydon fair, he said he was; the horse appeared very much fatigued. I said, "You have travelled very hard." He said he had come from Oxford. I said no more, but rode on to Hillingdon. The prisoner afterwards came there, and in consequence of what passed he was taken into custody. He told me that his master was coming on to the Ram Inn, in Smithfield, with three more horses. I went and enquired for his master, but could hear nothing of him. I returned to the prisoner, he asked me if I had seen his master? I said, Yes, as much as you expected that I should. He burst into tears, and said he was drawn into it. I said, "What then, did you steal it?" He said, Yes; he stole it that night off Abingdon common.</p>

I have not the least doubt of it, as it corresponded in size and every thing-it was a very particular one. The four heifers were worth 30l. or 40l. After this I heard the prisoners were in custody.</p>

I knew him before-he lived in our parish, and went by the name of Cripps. I said I was sorry to see him there. He said he could assure me the beasts were not mine, for mine were larger than those that were in his possession, and that he received them from a man of the name of Grey, at Hoddesdon, who gave him 2s. a head for driving them.</p>

            . I am a salesman at Smithfield. I received the three heifers to sell for the prisoner, Cripps, on the 24th of September, about six o'clock in the morning, he said he had brought them to me for sale. One of them was a black heifer, with a white stripe down the back. I asked him who they belonged to? he said

Almost immediately after I had sold them, the prisoner, Cripps, applied to me for payment. I asked him if he had an order from his master? he said he had not. I told him I could not pay him without an order, unless he referred me to a respectable person, which would satisfy me. He referred me to a man - I was not satisfied, and would not pay him. He went away, saying he would get an order from his master. About nine o'clock that night I saw him in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoners in custody at the Compter, a little after eight o'clock of the night they were taken. Cripps said he had a letter, which he must show to Mr. Curtis. I told him he could not go from there that night. He said he could not be locked up until he had seen Mr. Curtis - He said he must produce the letter to him immediately for payment for some beasts. He took a letter from his waistcoat-pocket. Mr. Teague was present, and opened it in the prisoner's presence-the wafer was quite wet. He read it, and told the prisoners he thought it did not come from a gentleman. I locked them up.</p>

             re-examined. Hoddesdon is about two miles from my house-there is no person of the name of Gray living in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>EDWARD HOLMES. I am a porter. On the 25th of September I was at the Coach and Horses, public-house, in Kingsland-road, and saw both the prisoners there. They asked a man named Stark, to write a letter for them - They spoke as if they were in company together - I believe Cripps spoke. Stark wrote the letter for them-this excited my suspicion. I followed them out of the house to the Golden Lion, public-house, in Smithfield-it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. Cripps sat in the middle box, and Burton sat in the next. I took them into custody at the house. I heard Stark read over part of the letter to them.</p>
               <p>AMBROSE STARK. I am a wine-cooper, and live at the Coach and Horses. I wrote the letter for the prisoners. A man named Cannon first asked me to write it. They said they both came to town with the beasts, and were to take the money back to their master - They were strangers to me. They asked me to write a letter demanding payment, and told me to sign it, "Gray." I should not have wrote it, but Cannon, who was the hostler at the inn, said he knew them, and had lived at Hoddesdon with them. I delivered it to Burton.</p>
               <p>TINGAY'S Defence. I was at Hoddesdon - A man inquired for a person to drive some bullocks, and said his name was Gray. He said he would give 2s. a head; that he would deliver them to me next day, and if I was not at Hoddesdon at eight o'clock, he would leave them at the George Inn for me. I was to bring the money to the Sun, at Waltham. I did not think they were the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>BURTON'S Defence. I met the other prisoner, whom I had not seen for four years, and went and had some porter with him. He said he had brought some beasts from Hoddesdon.</p>

When he brought the dung out it appeared very heavy - I told him so; he said dung was very heavy-he could hardly get it out of the shop. The barrow was mended at the leg-Jones brought the same barrow back. The prisoner came back in about ten minutes, in a great perspiration.

He said he was to pledge the fire-irons for 3l., and was to redeem some clothes pledged before, and to give him the balance. I asked him where Smith gave him the irons? he said, at the Queen's-head, public-house, at the corner of Ormond-street. I asked him where his manufactory was? he, on the other side of Fleet-street. I told him to leave the fire-irons, and send Smith to me, as I did not like his story. In a few minutes the prisoner, Riley, came, whom I had known by the name of Smith. He appeared very much hurt at my detaining the fire-irons, and not sending the money by his porter as he desired. I asked him where he bought the goods, as I was not satisfied? he said he bought them of Mr. Livermore, an ironmonger, in Oxford-street, and he would bring me the bill and receipt on Monday morning, at twelve o'clock-this was on Saturday. He redeemed some clothes which he had pledged with me in the name of Smith. I kept the fire-irons. He did not come on Monday. I went to Mr. Livermore in consequence of what I heard - I went round to several shops, and among others to the prosecutor's, he claimed them.</p>

               <p>CATHERINE WILLER. I am a widow, and live at Poplar; I have two single men lodge with me, nobody else. On Tuesday, the 6th of October, I left home about six o'clock in the evening, and left nobody at home-the door has a spring lock. I left the lock on the spring-the house was made quite fast. One of the lodgers had a key of the door. I returned home about ten minutes after seven o'clock, and found the street - door opened, apparently with a false key. I missed a gown out of the room, and a carpet off the floor-neither of my lodgers had returned. About half-past eight o'clock, the lodger who had the key came home, he is a locker-up at the West India Docks-it was his usual time for coming home.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH LOWE. On the 20th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going to Bow with my little boy. There was a crowd of people at a funeral in the road. I was getting out of the crowd, which I did for six or eight yards, and was hustled by several persons, running against me, both on my right and left side-my child was forced from me at the time. I received a blow on my right shoulder, turned round, and at that moment the prisoner, Knight, pulled my watch from my fob, I saw it in his hand. The gang consisted of about twenty persons. I saw Knight pass my watch to Evans, who held his hand out to receive it. In my hurry to secure Knight, I will not swear I saw the watch go into Evans's hand, but immediately as I collared Knight, Evans rushed up, I collared him - He tried to rescue himself from me. The gang kicked me so, that my legs were bruised up to my knees, and I was terribly beat about in my body. The other part of the gang rushed in and said, "D-n your eyes, let him go, you b-g-r!" - They rescued Evans from me. I kept hold of Knight, and called for assistance. Welfare came, and I told him I was robbed. I never let Knight go, Gray also came to my assistance. The gang then became quite desperate, and bricks and stones flew in all directions. I received several blows myself, and the officers had their heads cut. We got him into a public-house with great difficulty, where he was hand-cuffed. The mob surrounded the house, and said they would rescue him if they lost their lives. I went out to look for my child. Next morning, I found Evans at the office. I should know two or three more of the gang if I could see them. My watch was not found. I saw it in Knight's hand, and Evans holding his hand out to receive it. I do not know whether he got it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You never saw them before - A. No. Evans escaped. I can positively swear he is the man, his person is so particular.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WELFARE. I am a constable of the Borough. On the 20th of September I was attending an odd-fellows' funeral, in Whitechapel-road. I saw the mob, and heard the alarm - I went up, and found the prosecutor surrounded by a gang. He was beat about most terribly, and so was I. I took Knight from him-the gang followed us with bricks and stones. I took him to the public-house-Evans had escaped, but I took him again the same night. Lowe saw him next morning, and swore to him immediately. He had escaped before I came up - I had not seem him there.</p>
               <p>JOHN TAYLOR. I am a porter, and live in Whitechapel. I was at the funeral, and saw the prisoner, Knight, go up to the prosecutor, put his hand on his shoulder, and take his watch out. His companions surrounded him. I was pushed about, and received a cut in my hand with a stone. The prosecutor collared Knight-the gang were using him very violently.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see Evans, the mob was so great - He might have been there.</p>

I came up, being told of the robbery, Welfare had hold of Knight - I laid hold of him; one of the gang collared me, and tried to take him from me - I knocked that man down. We went on; when we got to Baker's-row, a gang, consisting of twenty or thirty persons, surrounded us, and assailed us with sticks and stones. I saw Evans in the crowd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>JOHN DYER. I am a headborough of Mile End. I was attending the funeral. There was an alarm, I went to the spot, and found Knight in the custody of Gray, he endeavoured to get away; the mob followed and assailed us with stones and bricks; opposite the King's Head the officers received several wounds. I was very much beaten. I saw Evans throwing stones, or in the attitude of throwing them; my head was desperately cut, and my body hurt. The mob cried out, "Rescue!" I was obliged to retire into a court.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DOBSON. I am a headborough. I was at my own door, and heard the mob crying out "Rescue, Rescue!" I ran for assistance. I went to the watch-house, and received Evans in charge.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner in the prosecutors' back-room on the two pair of stairs, he was at a drawer. I came down, he followed me-while I was telling my brother he left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw him in the room - He came down immediately.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHAW. I am a constable of Aldgate. I searched the prisoner, and found two watches, four guineas, seven 7s. pieces, a 1l. note, and 34s. in silver on him. Next day I went on board a ship, which was bound for America, and got his chest - He claimed the things in it. I found a silver spoon marked IE, which the prosecutors' claimed. I found a memorandum in his pocket of the money which was lost out of the drawer. The ship was to sail in two days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said the chest was his</p>

             re-examined. The watch is my brother's, I bought it for him; it has my private mark on it-the spoon is also my brother's. The memorandum of the property which was in my drawer is in my own hand-writing, and was with the property. We hold the lease of the house jointly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The money was my brother's private property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not discharge a man on suspicion of the robbery - A. A man was discharged for stealing lead before the robbery. Nobody had any business in the room; I slept in the room myself. Two drawers were opened, but nine of them had the locks picked-the property was in two drawers. The prisoner had worked a month in the house, but never had any business in that room. I had seen the property about three months before.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 27th of October, about ten minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, I was alone in the shop-the prisoner came in. Three men had come in before-one of them went out before the prisoner came in, the other two remained till the prisoner came in - They appeared to be acquainted. One of them asked for a pair of gloves - He laid a whip on the counter. I showed him some gloves-the other man had a great-coat hanging on his arm, and stood behind the one who asked for the gloves, the prisoner walked up and down the shop. After I had shown the gloves, the man with the great-coat said he would go and get the cart ready. He took up the other man's whip, and went out-then the prisoner came, spoke to the man, and said the gloves were good ones, and walked about the shop-the stockings were on the other counter, which was behind the men, and near to the prisoner. I showed the man three different pairs of gloves, he paid for one pair, which came to 3s. - all three then went out together. Immediately after they went out, I missed twelve pair of stockings off the counter. i got the boy next door to mind the shop, and went to look for them up the Old Jewry, which is two doors from the shop, and saw the four men turn out of Dove-court into the Old Jewry - I knew them again, I am certain the prisoner is one of them. I stopped at the top of the court. Just as they came up to me, I laid hold of the prisoner's coat, and said, "You have got some stockings of our's." One of the men ran up against me, and pushed me from the prisoner, he got away. I followed him, calling Stop thief! he turned back into Grocer's Hall-court into the Poultry, and was stopped opposite the court. I saw him drop the stockings at the bottom of the court, I picked them up. I never lost sight of him, and am certain he is one of the men. I do not know what became of the other three men. I did not see the stockings taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am certain he is the man - I took particular notice of him. My master's house is in the parish of St. Mary Colechurch.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL JONES. I live in Grocer's Hall-court. I heard the cry of Stop thief! ran out, and saw the prisoner run down Dove-court. As he passed me he dropped the parcel-the last witness picked it up. The prisoner ran into Keats's shop - I never lost sight of him. Kelly brought the bundle into the shop, and said the prisoner was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280015"/>man who robbed him, and that three others were with him - He denied it.</p>

               <p>EDWARD INSKIP. I am an artificial flower-maker, and live in Addle-street. On the 10th of October I was in Newgate-street - the passage was obstructed by the unloading of a waggon. After the truss was removed, I saw the prosecutor collar a man, and charge him with stealing his handkerchief-the man offered to be searched. I observed a porter pointing toward Cheapside; I looked round, and saw the prisoner standing against a warehouse just by, and saw something yellow under his jacket behind. I turned round, and told the prosecutor, who was there, pointing to the prisoner, and looking at him. He shook himself, and I saw the handkerchief fall on the pavement from him-nobody else was near him. The prosecutor collared him, and picked it up.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was going up Holborn, and saw the prisoner, with another person, near Middle-row, following the prosecutor. When they came to a window which had a light in it they stopped to let him pass, then made up to him again, and followed him down Fetter-lane. I crossed over on the other side of the way, just as the prosecutor came opposite a grocer's shop. I saw the other man take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, and give it to the prisoner, who was close by. I ran over, and seized the prisoner - They were then about a yard before him, the other ran off. I told the prosecutor he had lost his handkerchief. I took the prisoner into the grocer's shop, and found the handkerchief under his coat.</p>

On Friday, the 9th of October, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was going out; the deceased came past me, and asked me how I was? I saw a man standing behind her, and asked her if it was her husband? she said Yes. He came forward, and asked her if she would go home? she said, "Go along!" and moved her hand. He walked past us, turned back, and said, "Nance, come home, for you are drunk." She said, "If I am drunk, it is by prostituting myself for an idle fellow like you"-upon which he came forward with great violence, and forced something to her side - I did not see what was in his hand. She staggered a little on her left side, fell on her back, and called to me to take the knife out of her two or three times, but I never moved, I was so alarmed. She pulled her clothes up - I saw her bowels gush out. The prisoner never ran away, but said, "Here I am, to be taken as a prisoner, if you choose to take me." Several persons gathered round - I saw no more.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Lawrence-yard. I was standing about a yard behind the deceased, opposite Lawrence-yard - She was talking to Diamond. The prisoner was standing on the right side of the deceased, talking to her in a low tone of voice - I could not hear what he said. I heard her say, "If I am drunk, it is with wh-r-g for you all day." I observed the prisoner put his right hand up to his side, as if to put his hand in his waistcoat-pocket. He walked up to the deceased - I saw something in his right hand - I could not see what it was. He went up to her, and made a violent plunge at her belly - She staggered backward, and screamed out "I am murdered!" She staggered very near to me - She turned very near upon her half-face, and exclaimed, "Oh my G-d! will any body take the knife out of me?" She was then staggering. I observed the blood streaming down her thigh, but saw no weapon. I lifted up my right hand to assist her-she staggered from me, fell on her left side, and rolled on her back, and made use of the same expression as before.</p>
               <p>Q.What became of the prisoner - A. I saw him near the wall - He had moved a very little way; he extended his arms out, and said, "Here I am, I am not going to run away, any body may take me." I went for a constable; I could not find him, returned, and met the prisoner in the custody of two men near the spot. I found the deceased where I had left her, lying on her back, and her bowels coming out of her side-she was put on a shutter, and taken away. I saw her afterwards, before the Coroner's inquisition - She was dead.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live in George-street, Sloane-street. I was crossing the road, heard the alarm of the murder, and the deceased say,"Take the knife out of me." I saw her lying on the ground, her bowels were coming out. The prisoner stood just-by, and said, I am the person, take me. I took him to the watch-house. As we were going along, he said, let me go, I will not run away, I have thrown the knife into the road. I had seen them both about ten minutes before in my street - they had been having a few words; he struck her with a bundle which was in his hand, and kicked her; she did nothing but cried-it appeared a casual quarrel. At the watch-house the prisoner said it was through jealousy.</p>

I live near Lawrence-yard, and keep a stand in Jew's-row, about twenty yards from Lawrence-yard; I heard a dreadful scream, went to the spot, saw the deceased lying with her clothes up, and her bowels out-several people were there. The prisoner was standing at a little distance, with his hands out. I said, "Losch, you have murdered your wife, you have stabbed her." He said, "Yes, I have, and you may take me; I do not mean to run away." I got before him to prevent his running away, and called the last witness, who secured him - He did not attempt to get away. About ten minutes after I saw several people going to look for the knife; I found one near the gutter, two or three feet from where the deceased had laid. I gave it to Maybank.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MAVBANK. I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoner was brought to me about ten munutes after eight o'clock.

On the 10th of October, about five o'clock, I was walking on the pavement opposite his room, and saw him fall from his shop-board-nobody but him and the prisoner were in the room. There was a cry of murder! I believe it was the deceased that called. I stepped up to the window, and saw the prisoner beating him with the sleeve-board; he was on the ground, on his side. I heard him cry - I immediately drew the sash of the window up; it was shut before - I looked in, and said "In the name of G-d don't kill the man." I turned round, and called the people-they came. The deceased was laying by the fire. I saw blood, or black, on his eye. The prisoner caught him by the shoulder, turned him over on his stomach, and said"D-n your head, you old rogue, I will flog your a-s." He immediately gave him four or five slaps with the flat side of a sleeve-board, not very hard. He immediately put the sleeve-board down, and flew out of the window, which I had opened, and said "D-n your old eyes, I have not half done with you yet." He went four or five yards toward the racket-ground in a terrible passion. I returned, went on the pavement, and talked with one Dougle. He then returned to the window. I told Greaves to go in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You went there in consequence of the deceased crying out - A. Yes. I saw blood, or black, on his eye - I cannot say that there was any wound. I saw no blow struck on his head.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREAVES. I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I saw several persons standing round the deceased's window. The prisoner was addressing himself to the others, telling them how Learwood had used him, by finding two letters, and giving them to Lewis. He said he had wipped his backside with the sleeve-board, had pulled him off the shop-board, and he would not forget that in a hurry - He appeared in a passion. He jumped down into the deceased's room again, and said, "You know pon did give him the letter." I jumped down myself-the deceased was then standing by the fire-place-the discourse was chiefly about the letter - He did not then strike him, but only threatened him. He said, "I have not done with you yet, and I will serve you out again, when I have proved that you did give him the letter." He went out of the room. The deceased put his hand to his thigh, and said, "I don't know, but I believe you have done for me now." The prisoner and I left the room together.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I was looking out of my room window, which is above Learwood's, and saw several people there, saying, do not hurt the man. I heard a man crying out, as if he was in pain. I ran out of my room, and lifted the deceased off the floor - He was laying on his side-nobody was with him. I put him in a chair-the prisoner was at the window. I heard what passed, and asked Learwood how he came in that situation; he was a minute and a half before he could answer me. - I saw black coming all round his left eye. He said, Daly had been beating him. I asked, for what-Daly said, for picking up a letter, and giving it to a fellow prisoner. I asked the deceased if it was true? - he said several times, that he knew nothing about any letter whatever, the prisoner then came into the room, through the window, and said, "How can you deny it, when you told me on the shop-board, that you thought it no harm?" The room is below the pavement. The prisoner said he ought to be the last person to serve him so, for he had rendered him a great service about twelve months ago. I left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When you picked the deceased up in what state was he - A. He was on his side. He did not complain of any thing. I put him in a chair - He was insensible for a minute and a half. All he said was, that Daly had been beating him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the prisoner say he had been giving him two or three slaps for his ingratitude - A. He did; the deceased did not contradict it.

The prisoner came into my room - I saw him go into Learwood's room, he remained there three or four minutes, talking very loud. He came out, and went in again in a few minutes. He appeared in a much greater passion than at first; he came in about five minutes. I heard a great noise, but paid no attention. He came to the sink, and drank some water, returned into the deceased's room, and shut the door-(he always shut the door when he went in).

             BERESFORD. I am a prisoner in the Fleet, and the husband of the last witness. I was in the racketground, on the 10th of October, about five o'clock, and heard somebody say, "Don't go to kill the man, for G-d's sake!" I turned round, looked at Learwood's window, saw the prisoner in the room, and Learwood on the floor. The prisoner had the sleeve-board in one hand, and held<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280018"/>the deceased with the other, either by the collar or arm; he appeared in the act of pulling the deceased. I only saw him strike one blow on the breech. The prisoner afterwards came through the window into the racket-ground, and explained to the persons assembled his reasons for doing it. He said, "he had pulled him off the board, and had given the old scoundrel a good cobbing on the a-s;" and I think he said he had richly deserved it, and in pulling him off the board he had scratched his eye a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. At that time nothing serious was thought-A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, as soon as it was discovered that the man was in danger, he used every means he could to do him good - A. Yes, he sent for Mr. Astley Cooper, and gave him every assistance.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PACEY. I am a prisoner in the Fleet. I heard somebody cry out, ran to the window, and saw the deceased lying down, and the prisoner with the sleeve-board in his hands - He struck him on the breech with it, with both hands, as hard as he could. He came out of the window, and said he had smacked his a-s three times with the sleeve-board, and he would not forget that presently. He then swore a bitter oath, and said, "I wish had killed him outright."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How many persons were by at the time he made use of that expression - A. A great many. I dare say some of those now present heard it.</p>

It was afterwards discovered that my name was not inserted in the list which was given to the Coroner.</p>

            . I am a prisoner in the Fleet, and a surgeon. A few minutes after nine o'clock at night, on Saturday, the 19th of October, I was called in to see the deceased, who was on his bed, partly undressed. I found he had been sick - He was totally insensible, and in a strong paralysis, and a discolouration of his eye; the museles of his face were much distorted, and his tongue hanging partly out of his mouth. I understood he had received some injury on his head. I had him put on a chair, and examined his head; I could find no depression of the skull, but was still persuaded he had received some injury in his head. I found his pulse at 66, and that on his left wrist much more languid than the other. I bled him freely, upon which he breathed much freer, the paralysis gave way, and he appeared relieved. I ordered a warm bath, which was immediately brought. I attempted to give him medicine, but he could not swallow - I staid with him till ten o'clock. At eleven I visited him again, and found his pulse at 76-at twelve it was at 96. At five o'clock next morning I visited him, and found it at 150. I was so alarmed that I determined upon opening the temporal artery on the side opposite to the injured part, and bled him freely, which materially relieved them - I found him very dangerous. Between eleven and twelve o'clock further advice came. I should have said, that between nine and ten o'clock that morning the prisoner came into the room, and appeared anxious to know how the man was. I told him he could not survive forty-eight hours from the time of the inquiry - He appeared greatly alarmed. I told him I should be very sorry to be in the situation of the person who caused it - He said he was the person, and was very sorry for it, and inquired what he could do. I told him to send for good advice - He asked who I would recommend? I recommended Mr. Astley Cooper, or Mr. Abernethy; he said he would do it, and left the room. Soon after, the friends of the deceased desired I would go and request the prisoner not to come into the room any more. I went, and told him. He said, "What would you have me do?" I again advised him to write to a gentleman to come to his assistance. He immediately took a sheet of paper, and wrote something - I left the room. The man died between seven and eight o'clock on Monday morning. Mr. Delagarde saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion, what was the cause of his death - A. I saw his body opened, and have no hesitation in saying my opinion is, that he died from an internal injury on the brain, occasioned by external violence. I ought to have said some conversation passed between me and the prisoner about the injury he had received. I told him my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280019"/>opinion was, that it was in consequnece of the injury he had received on his head. He said he did not strike him on the head, he only struck him on the b-ks-de. He said it could not be from his striking him, it must have been from the fall from the window-seat, which was the shop-board. I said I could not think that, for the room was carpeted very thickly, and he was not seated above three feet six inches from the floor. He said, then it must have been against the bed-post. I said I did not see exactly how that could be, but it must have been from a violent blow. There was a bed within six inches of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What description of external violence do you believe occasioned the injury - A. On dissection I observed a rupture on the dura mater, which must have been from a blow - A blow on the eye in an oblique direction, I think, would have occasioned it. I could discover no external bruise, except on the eye. There were between two and three ounces of extravasated blood, which would depress the brain. This might have arisen from a blow on the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. It is a stone floor-there was a very thick bag under the carpet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you time to give your examination deliberately before the Coroner - A. No, I had time to give it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Coroner any thing about any intercourse between you and the prisoner, except about his expressing his great anxiety for the safety of the deceased - A. Yes, I did. Mr. Shelton seemed to wish to cut the matter short, and to come to the essential points.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any account about the blow, and the probable fall from the shop-board - A. I did. I heard my examination read over before I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will read your deposition over to you-(read) - A. That is correct as far as it goes.</p>
               <p>The deposition did not state any conversation on the subject.</p>

             DELAGARDE. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On Sunday, the 11th of October, at eleven o'clock in the morning, I was called in to see the deceased; he was laying in a state of insensibility, and in such a state as argued that a great injury must have been done to the brain - I considered him in great danger. Several other medical persons were there. We all thought he laboured under symptoms of depression and concussion - He died. I examined the head. The cause of his death was internal injury, arising from external violence, which must have been considerable.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did it appear to have been inflicted - A. On the left eye. A blow or a fall would have occasioned it, if they had been inflicted with sufficient force - I am not able to say which. I did not observe the floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find any fracture of the brain under the part where the external violence appeared - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the sleeve-board to have been used with both hands, in the violent manner represented, would it not have fractured the bone - A. It might have produced the injury by fracturing the bone. The fall would have caused it as likely.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The room is only carpeted in the middle, full five feet are left bare. I was standing in the ground, Dougle came to me, and asked if I had not lost a letter, I said I had - He said, he saw the deceased with it, that he read it to him, and he advised the deceased to give it to him; but he said, he would give it to Lewis, as I was at variance with him, and that he saw him give it to Lewis. I said, I did not think it possible, I went into the deceased's room, and asked him how he could treat me so - He said he did not think it any harm. I told him he ought to be punished for it. I called him a scoundrel. He called me a liar. I told him I would go to Lewis, and if he did not return it, I would complain. He was getting off his shop-board, and fell off, on the bare stcnes. I was going out of the room, went to assist him, and put him on a chair - I told him bad as it was, it was what he deserved - We kept talking about the letter for a quarter of an hour. He called me a liar again - I caught hold of him, and beat him on the b-ks-de with the sleeve-board.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES HARMER. I am the prisoner's solictior. I attended the inquisition taken by Mr. Shelton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mead in the room - A. I do not remember it-the room was very much crouded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Coroner make the declaration, that if anybody present knew any thing of the facts, he was ready to hear them - A. He did repeatedly and loudly. Mr. Shelton had a list of persons supposed to know any thing about it. After examining them, he made this declaration. One or two came forward in consequence of his solicitation; every body could hear him. He called out loudly and repeatedly. I heard Hargraves examined - He has stated more to-day than what he did before the Coroner. He did not say a word about any conversation between him and the prisoner, as to the cause of his death. The Coroner has taken down all that he said. Nothing about the conversation about his falling from the shop-board, or anything else was said. It is untrue that the Coroner wished him to shorten the matter, and did not take every thing down. <rs id="t18181028-42-verdict250" type="verdictDescription">

On the 28th of September she was in a very good state of health. On Sunday, the 27th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my mother's house with three baskets-(she attends the markets). She said she was locked out of her lodgings, and had no where to go to. My father said she might go to bed with the children - She said she did not wish to disturb them; she laid on the floor till the morning - She was sober. Between five and six o'clock she got up. My father dressed the child-it was playing about the room. The prisoner fetched a quartern and a half of gin, and gave my father and mother a glass - They went to Covent Garden-market; the prisoner fetched another quartern of gin, and offered my wife a glass, she refused it; I also refused it, and she threw it over me in bed. The child said she was going to Covent Garden, and asked the prisoner if she was going? she said Yes; I will take you to your father and mother-they went out together, between six and seven o'clock; between eight and nine she brought the child home intoxicated-it did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280020"/>appear much so then. She got sick afterwards, vomited, and was very ill. She was put to bed, but got up again in a few minutes; the vomiting and purging returned - She went to sleep again, and awoke in about an hour. We sent for the doctor-it died about twenty minutes after eight o'clock that night. The prisoner left the house about an hour after she brought it home; she did not appear very sober. She said the child had taken two glasses of gin, one of rum, and two-pennyworth of peppermint, part of two pots of porter, and a small drop of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say where she had it - A. She mentioned the Rose and Crown, as one public-house. She always appeared very kind to the child.</p>
               <p>ELLEN DUGGAN. I am the wife of the last witness, the prisoner went out with the child, and returned about half-past eight o'clock; the child was quite intoxicated-it had a fit in the bed. The prisoner said she gave it two glasses of gin, one of rum, and two-penny worth of peppermint, and some wine. I confirm the statement of my husband.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE DUGGAN. The deceased was my sister; the prisoner returned with her between eight and nine o'clock-she was drunk, and very ill, I went out and returned about six o'clock; I told the prisoner, she ought to be ashamed, to give the child so much liquor. She said, she would give it more by and by, when she got better of this.</p>
               <p>-WOOD. I keep the Rose and Crown, in Broad-street, St. Giles's. The prisoner came to my house, with the child, about a quarter after eight o'clock, and called for a glass of gin, which she gave to the child-the child asked if she was to drink it off? The prisoner said Yes. I said it would take her breath away-the child however drank it off. She gave it nothing more.</p>

            . I attend St. George's Hospital. On the 30th of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I examined the body of the deceased-the stomach and the intestines were inflamed. I could discover no appearance of poison having been given to the child. She appeared healthy.</p>
               <p>Q. From the inflammation, if she had taken the quantity of liquor it would be likely to produce death - A. The stomach would exhibit the appearances I found; it would cause vomiting and purging before death. One glass of gin taken by such a child, at one draught, would produce these appearances.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were in the habit of giving the child liquor. I gave it a glass, and did not think it would hurt.</p>

He refused. I observed him shifting gold from one pocket to another. I searched him, and found the property stated in the indictment on him, which is mine, and worth above 40s.</p>

She came up again, and said the housekeeper was there - She took them from me. I said I did not like to leave them without the money. She said she would go down and hear what they said. She came up again, and said, "You are to go and fetch the bill, and bring two mourning caps." I went back, and returned to the kitchen with the bill. They said they knew nothing about it; but that a woman had left some bonnets. I could neither get the bonnets nor money. I never saw the prisoner again till I saw her at the office.</p>
               <p>ANN ODELL. I am cook to Mr. Astley Cooper, who lives in Spring-gardens. The prisoner had no situation in my master's establishment, not was she sent out by any of the servants to buy any thing. A woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came to our house on the 5th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a name that I did not know. She returned in a few minutes with some bonnets, and asked me if she might leave them until she returned from Finsbury-square. She said she came from Brompton. She left them. I went out, returned in a few minutes, and they were gone.</p>

Hopkins gave me the parcel to take to Manchester-street, to show the gentleman. I met the prisoner at Charing-cross, he asked if I came from Mr. Jackson's, I said Yes. We walked as far as Lancaster-court, Strand. He then said I must give him the handkerchiefs to show to his aunt, who he said lived up the court. He took them, and told me to go to 24, Exeter-street, and inquire for his mother and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280022"/>wait there till he returned. I went and inquired for Mrs. Williams, as I had known the prisoner by that name. I could find no such person. He never brought either the goods or money. He was taken some time after.</p>

On the 10th of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming down Church-court, Basinghall-street, with a bundle under his arm. He appeared to know me. Suspecting him, I stopped him, and asked what he had in the bundle? He said he had nothing. I said I must see what it was, and found twenty-four buff shawls, and twelve pounds of thread. I asked where he brought it from, he made no answer. I told him he had robbed his master. He said he had, and was sorry for it; it was the first time, and he hoped he should be forgiven. I went to his house near Crown-street, Finsbury-square, the lower part is a haberdasher's shop. He told me who his master was. I went and told the prosecutor.</p>

He went into the cellar and took a piece of meat down which was his own. I called him to me and asked what was in his hat. I took it off, and found three pounds of sugar in it.

On the 16th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was called down, and found a young man in the shop, who asked for three sheets of gilt-edge paper. We do not retail goods. I suspected something, looked round, and missed a bundle of paper. I did not see the prisoner in the shop. I ran out, and saw the prisoner going out of the yard, with the bundle of paper on his shoulder. I overtook him about the middle of Ludgate-hill. I stopped him, and asked where he got it? He said I had no business with him, that he was a stranger, and was employed to carry it. I took him back. It cost us above 3l. He was quite alone.</p>

He passed the place where the rope was. I went up to the boat, which stopped at Cotton's wharf, and found three-quarters of a hundred weight of rope in it, which was alongside a sloop-one part of the rope was in the sloop, and the other in the boat. I took the prisoner. The captain of the vessel jumped out of the boat, or I should have taken him. The rope was fastened to the pile,</p>

They caught hold of me with their arms, round my waist, and said, "Stand back, countryman, you are not used to London, mind the cart." At that moment I felt my watch drawn from my fob - I saw it in the prisoner's hand; there were three others with him. I immediately laid hold of him - He got from me, and ran away.

I turned round, and saw the prisoner running very fast, he knocked three or four people doen, by running against them. I collared him, he got from me - I collared him again, and held him fast. The prosecutor was pursuing about three yards behind him, and said he was the man who took the watch out of his fob. The prisoner said, he had not got it. The prosecutor said he never lost sight of him, that he saw him put his hand behind him with it. The prisoner replied that he had not got it. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

I saw two of them keeping the prosecutor in conversation, while the prisoner and another were rifling his pockets. I watched the prisoner, and his companions down an alley. They returned to the prosecutor just as a cart came up, which prevented my seeing them. He gave the alarm, I followed the prisoner, and saw him taken. I am certain he was with the others. I did not see the watch taken.</p>

The deceased, Wakeley, was in another box - He was rather drunk; he had a few words with them, then went to their box, stripped off his jacket, and wanted to fight - They were quarrelling for five or six minutes. After that the prisoner, Fuller, came across the settle, and began fighting. I went to Rayner, and said, "Don't put a big good man against a little good man-it is a pity for them to fight." He got up, and wished Fuller to fight-he is his uncle. He said he should beat my brains out after he had done with the deceased-the deceased fell under. Fuller got up, set-to again, and the deceased fell against the edge of the settle - He got up no more. I went to Rayner, and said," You have made a pretty job of it, here is a dead man for you to look at." He said, "Let him die and be d-d!" Fuller appeared very sorry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I have heard that Wakeley was a good fighter, and had fought many pitched battles. I was three boxes from them.</p>

On the 8th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for four pounds of candles, which came to 4s. 2d.; she tendered me a 1l. bank note. I observed it was dated the 13th of August, and having taken two forged notes of that date sometime before, I suspected that was one of the same stamp. I asked her where she lived. She said her name was Smith, and she lived at No. 16, Love-lane, which I wrote on the note in her presence-(looking at one). This is it; it has my writing on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. I told her I suspected it was a forgery, and I must detain it. I desired her to walk in, and sent for an officer. Gandar came and took her in a few minutes. I told him, in her presence, the circumstance of my having taken two forged notes before, and I suspected that also was a forgery. She said she hoped it was not, and appeared a little embarrassed. I then told him I should not give her in charge, but I would accompany him and her, to see if she lived at the place she had described. We all three went out, and went towards Love-lane. I had given Gandar the note.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were going did any conversation pass - A. She was in the officer's custody, I was a few paces behind. The officer turned round to me, and said, in her hearing, that it was of no use to go to the place, as she had told him she did not live there. She was taken into custody, and taken to Shadwell Office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I gave you the note, but gave you no address till I was at the watch-house - A. She gave me the address, and I wrote it on the note before I sent for the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 8th of October I was called to the prosecutrix's house, and found the prisoner there, with the last witness and Mrs. MacCann. Mr. MacCann produced the note, with the name of Smith, No. 16, Love-lane, written on it; it was not dry when I arrived. We went towards Love-lane with the prisoner. When we got about twenty yards from the house, the prisoner said she did not live where she had given the direction to Mr. MacCann. She did not then say where she did live. I took her to the watch-house, searched, and found 7s. or 8s. in silver, and some halfpence, on her, and gave her in charge of the officers. MacCann gave me the note, I marked it-(looking at one). This is it.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Wardour-street. On a Saturday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop, and bought tea and sugar, which came to 2s. 9d. She gave the last witness a 1l., note, which he handed to me. I asked her name and address, she said Jones, No.5, Compton-street. After I had marked it on the note, I said to her, Jones, No.5, Compton-street, she made answer, "close by here." I then told her I did not like the appearance of the note, and she must wait until I sent to No. 5, Compton-street, to see if she lived there. I directed a young man in the shop to go there, she heard it and said she would go herself. I told her she must wait until the young man returned, to know if the address was correct; she said no, she would go herself; I told her she must stay. She immediately ran out of the shop. I called out "Stop thief!" and went to the shop-door. She was running away. The watchman brought her back with a man (looking at a note). This is the note; it has the name and address on it, with my initials.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. When you told her it was a bad note, did not she say that her husband gave it her, and she was sorry for it - A. She said she was sorry it was a bad note; but she did not say it was given to her by her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say that her husband, who was at the door, gave it to her - A.No, she did not. My street - door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time she left the shop until she was brought back - A. Not three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. A man was taken up with her - A. Yes, and kept in custody till within a few days.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she say anything about her husband, before she ran away - A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DEAKER. I am a watchman. I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" on the 29th of August, as I was coming up Princes-street, towards Wardour-street. I saw a man crying out "Stop thief!-Stop her!" I saw the prisoner and a man running before the rest. I pursued and took the prisoner about the middle of Compton-street - the man immediately knocked me down; I still kept hold of her, and gave the man in charge of another watchman. We took them both to the prosecutor; he said the prisoner was the woman, and gave her in charge. I took her and the man to the watch-house, when they got there, the man said she was his wife. When he was being searched, he said his name was Jones, and she also said her name was Jones. Next day I took them before the magistrate; as we went along the man said, in her hearing, that he gave her the note, and be believed that she never had one penny but what he gave her. He told the magistrate, in her hearing, that her name was Farmillo, and she gave the same name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. They were running close together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you first saw them, what distance were they from the prosecutor's house - A.About thirty or forty yards. They were running from the prosecutor's house. The man gave his name as Jones, at first; he was kept in custody for knocking me down. They spoke as man and wife.</p>
               <p>CHARLES VANDEIAN. I live at No. 5, Old Compton-street, Soho, on the 29th of August, it is near Wardour-street. The prisoner did not live at my house; I do not know her.</p>
               <p>RICHARD FILKINS. On the 29th of August I lived at No. 5, Little Compton-street, Soho, near Wardour-street. The prisoner did not lodge at my house; I do not know her.</p>
               <p>MARY PENNER. On the 29th of August I lived at No.5, New Compton-street. The prisoner never lodged with me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am a bank note inspector-(looking at the note.) It is forged in all its parts, in paper, plate, ink, and signature. It is signed "A.Consett," but it is not his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read. See Indiciment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The shopman said it was 7s. tea; it was 8s. black tea. My husband gave me the note, and told me the name and direction that I was to put on it, which I did. He was standing at the shop-door, and told me to go in and buy the tea and sugar. I obeyed him, as by law and duty I am bound to do. I believe his handwriting is on the note.</p>

My servant then said she had taken one of him about half an hour before. He was present. I asked her if she could identify the note. She said Yes; and brought it to me, I knew it to be forged. He denied passing it. I asked his address; he said Gilbert Warren, at Mr. Bays, egg-dealer, Leadenhall-market. I endorsed the notes with the address he gave me-(looking at two.) These are them. I sent for Mr. Bays, he came while the prisoner was there, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had not lived with him for four years. He made no reply to it. I had him taken into custody. He was searched in my presence, and some silver found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He referred you to Mr. Bays to know who he was - A. He said that he then lived with Mr. Bays.</p>

I gave him a check for 197l. 10s., deducting the discount of the bill. He gave me the bill - I afterwards sent it to Messrs. Snow and Paul's.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you less wages on account of living in the house - A. Yes. On the 19th of October I left the lodge about ten o'clock, I fastened every thing up. I returned about twelve, and found the window broken open. There were footmarks of somebody in the house. I missed my watch, which was safe when I went out. The prisoner worked on the premises, and knew the house very well. I gave the alarm - He entered the premises. I thought he changed colour, when I said somebody must have been in who knew the premises. I compared his shoes, and thought they fitted the marks on the table-the marks of the nails corresponded with the shoes, which made me suspect him-they tallied exactly; he was then taken into custody, and said the watch was in a shed on his premises.</p>

They separated me from the man, who ran off with my watch. I called out Stop thief! and kept my eye upon him till he got to the corner of the street.

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Bear-street, heard the cry of Stop thief! turned round, and saw the prisoner, Ray, running, and the prosecutor pursuing him, calling Stop thief! I seized him, we struggled, and both fell - I held him, and gave him in charge. He was the only person that I saw running - He was running exceedingly fast, and tried to rescue himself from me.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS RHIND. I am a tailor. I was crossing Bear-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw Ray running at the end of the street into the square. White seized him both fell in the scuffle. I ran up, and held him down till he was secured. I saw the prisoner, Edwards, and another man, forcing their way through the crowd. Edwards came up to the prisoner, Ray, took off his hat, and said, "Give it to me!" I looked down, heard the watch jingle in his hat, and seized his hand with the watch in it. Somebody said,"Start!" he said, "I cannot." I took him down Bear-street. Taylor came up and held his hands - A scuffle ensued, and in the scuffle he dropped the watch, and I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Edwards receive the watch from Ray in his hat-Yes.</p>

I took it into Mr. Taylor's shop, and gave it to him. After I picked it up it was snatched at twice.</p>

            . I lodge in the same room with the prosecutor. On Wednesday night, the 22d of October, between twelve and one o'clock, I came home, opened the door, and found the prisoner in the room. I asked him who and what he was? he made me no answer. I collared him, said he was a thief, and insisted on knowing what he was. He said he knew Ryan, who lived there, and sat down on Ryan's box - A woman brought a light. As soon as he saw the light he started off, leaving his hat behind him. He returned between four and five o'clock for his hat-one of the lodgers gave it out to him-we did not then know that anything had been stolen. When Ryan got up the theft was discovered, We went to look for the prisoner, and found him at the George, public-house, in Chick-lane. He rushed out of the house, I laid hold of him - He resisted very much, the constable secured him. He said, "Let me go, and I will give you every thing, except a waistcoat, which I have sold."</p>

On the 25th of October, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner took a lodging at my house for the night, and said she was going by one of the coaches. She slept in a single-bedded room, No. 23-the bed was in a proper state the day before. I went into the room immediately after she came down, and found the bed very deficient in feathers as well as the bolster. As the servants said she appeared bulky, I stopped her, told her she had my property, and requested she would give it up. After some time, she gave me two bags of feathers, which were slung round her, before and behind-the feathers weighted 25lbs. The ticking had been ripped up, and sewed up again with different thread.</p>

There was also 7l. in bank notes, in a little box, which was in my trunk. I left my room, as I had got a situation. On the 20th I called, and went to my box, every thing was then safe; I locked and corded it again-Tucker used to sleep in the room. On the 27th I went to fetch my box away, found it had been robbed-it was forced open. On the Sunday following I saw one of my shirts, a pair of boot-garters, and one glove, which were with the other things.</p>

            , who rents the house, which is in the parish of St. Ethelberga. On the 20th of September the prisoner came to lodge in my house, and slept in the same room where the prosecutor's box was. Tucker also slept there. The prisoner remained there from the Monday until Sunday morning; on the Friday he came to ask for Tucker, and said he wanted him to go to Seven Oaks with some horses. Tucker went on Saturday morning, the 26th-the prisoner was then the only person sleeping in the room. The next morning the prosecutor came, and discovered the robbery-the prisoner was in the room when Tucker went away, and left that day without giving me notice, or paying me. When he first came he said he was out of a situation. Another man, named Day, slept in the room, he went out at five o'clock in the morning, and returned at night. He left about a fortnight ago. I knew he was going to leave.</p>
               <p>JOHN TUCKER. I lodged in the same room, with Day and the prosecutor - the prisoner lodged there after the prosecutor left. On the Saturday he desired me to go to the Leaping Bar, public-house, Blackfriars-road, to take two pair of horses to Seven Oaks, for Mr. Harris; I found there were none to go-when I returned he was gone. I never saw him again until he was taken. Next morning the prosecutor came, and missed his property.</p>

               <p>ELEANOR HRATT. I live in Hosier-lane, with my mother. On Saturday three weeks, the day the prisoner was taken, he asked me to wash a shirt and a pair of stockings for him; I only knew him a few days before this. He took a lodging in our front garrel, said he was short of money, and asked me to pledge the shirt for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with him - A. Yes, in Drury-lane, not at my mother's. I pledged the shirt at Turner's, in Catherine-street; they knew me, and put it down in my name; I gave him the duplicate and money, he left the duplicate in the room where we lived - I had not lived a week with him; he was taken up the same day.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BOND. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in St. Paul's Church-yard, on Saturday night; I said, "Bull, how do you do?'. He said, "Is there anything against me, Bond?" I said, "Yes, you must go with me;" which he did. He said he lodged in Drurylane, and told me to ask for Eleanor Hiatt - I found her there, in bed. I also found a pair of boot-garters, a glove, and the duplicate of the shirt, in a small box. The prisoner told me himself, that he sold all the things to a man, spent the money; and that he lost 4l. in one night.</p>
               <p>JOHN CREFFIELD re-examined. The shirt, glove, and garters are mine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence.</p>

I kept my eye on him, as I had seen the pocket-book in his hand. I ran round the waggon, took him, and told him he was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280031"/>man who had the pocket-book; he said he had not got it, and asked me to search him.

I asked him his address, he said Davis, tailor, Bridgewater-square, Barbican, which I wrote on the note,(looking at one) this is it. I told him it was bad, and asked him who he took it of. He said, of Mr. Silvester, at the blanket warehouse. Goswell-street. I asked him if he had any money to pay for the tea, he said he had only one shilling, I returned him the note, and he left the shop. I afterwards thought he might offer it elsewhere, I followed him down Butcherhall-lane, I there met Honey - He secured him - I never lost sight of him. Nobody had joined him.</p>

            . I am a constable, I took the prisoner in charge in Butcherhall-lane, by the desire of Mr. Eagleton. I told him I must go and see if he had given a right address to the note, as Mr. Eagleton had said, he said he took it of Silvester. I told him I knew no blanket warehouse, in Aldersgate-street. He, said, "What! you an officer and not know Silvester's". I said there was one in Goswell-street. He said that was it, he supposed. We took him there, and found Mr. Silvester at the Horse-shoe public-house, We enquired of the landlord if Mr. Silvester was there; he said he did not know. On my repeating the name, Mr. Silvester came out, and I asked him, if he had given the prisoner a 1l. note that day - He hesitated and said, he had paid him a great deal of money; but did not say he had paid him any that day. I asked the prisoner to let Mr. Silvester see it. He took it out of his pocketbook, and handed it to Mr. Silvester - He looked at it and said he did not think it was a bad one. The prisoner said, "Do not you know that you paid it to me to day, for a pair of breeches." He made no answer, but seemed a good deal confused, and shewed the note to several people in the room. A person on looking at it, said he would lay me a bottle of wine that it was a good one; another said he wished he had a hundred of them. I said, if he had, he would have reason to be sorry for it - He was holding it up, and told me to look at the water mark. I took it from him, and told the prisoner he must go back with me. He sat down, said he should not, and called for a pint of beer-it was not brought. He got up in a minute or two. I said, "We will go to your lodgings." He took me to a house in Bridgewater-gardens, which is a different place from Bridgewater-square-the square is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280032"/>very respectable place. The house he took me to, is an old iron shop, with a curtain across it to separate the bed from the shop. He called to a man, and said, "Mr. Newman you know me very well." I said "does he lodge here?"-the man gave no answer. I asked again, he then said, he is a great deal here. I could not get from him whether the prisoner lodged there or not. I told the prisoner he must go back with me to Mr. Eagleton - He said he would be d-n-d if he would, and he said would have a pint of beer. which he did. He then said he would not go without a coach - I got one. They wanted to persuade him to go - He got up, and attempted to go round a passage - I seized him, he resisted. We did not get into the coach. When we got a little way he was quiet. I took him to Mr. Eagleton, and then to the Compter. As we went along, he said he was taken ill all of a sudden - He gave me a blow as hard as he could, and ran away. I pursued, and secured him immediately (looks at a note). this is it, I marked it,</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Did not Mr. Newman say I carried on business there - A. No. - Bridgewater-square and Bridgewater-gardens are separated from each other by a street.</p>
               <p>HARRIET LACK. I live at No. 41, Bridgewater-gardens. The last witness brought the prisoner there - He did not live there, nor had he lived there for the last nine months before, as I have lived there that time. Newman lodged there-the prisoner carried on no business there.</p>
               <p>MARY BROWN. I have kept the house No. 41, Bridgewater-gardens for eighteen years, Newman and the last witness lodged there-the prisoner did-not carry on any business there. I have seen him there, but not at work.</p>

            , the servants. Braid had lived with me three years, and Owen one year. While my husband was abroad, I went twice to visit my daughters, one lives at Clapham, and the other at Brixton. I remained three days at each place.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you pay your first visit - A. On the 14th of September. I left Owen and Braid in care of the house. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18181028-80-deflabel470" type="occupation">private watchman</rs>

On Tuesday, the 6th of October, I went to bed at twelve o'clock - I had ordered the two servants to bed before that. At half-past two the prisoner sprang his rattle, which alarmed me - I got up, opened my bed-room window, and rang my bell-Owen came.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to you - A. I asked what was the matter - She knocked at my door-when I found it was her, I opened it. She said thieves were in the house, that two of them came to her bedside, with their faces blackened, that one of them remained, holding a pistol over her, and threatening that he would blow her brains' out, if she stirred - She said that she remained in that situation half an hour, when the watchman sprang his rattle, and the man who stood over her, cursed himself, and said, he must be off - She said she was alarmed. As I opened my door to let her in, I saw Braid with the poker across his shoulder, and the prisoner with him - They were coming up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your plate-chest usually kept - A. In the two pair of stairs back room-it is a wooden box. I had seen it two or three days before, it then had no appearance of anything having been done to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280033"/>Q. When you went into the room next morning, did you miss any plate - A. Yes to a considerable amount; I missed a silver coffee-pot, worth 20l., a tankard worth above 2l., and the other things stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the prisoner employed by Mr. Clulow - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After the plate was missed, did your servant maid make any confession to you - A. Not to me, it was to the officer. I had seen my plate all safe together within the space of two months before. I keep an inventory of it - I occasionally called it over.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How lately had you seen the coffee-pot - A. I realy do not know; I saw it when I saw the rest, in the paper that it was wrapped in, which was in the drawing-room, in the morning-it was not there the night before. My spoons are all made to pattern, and have a crest on them.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Camden-street, next door to Mr. Clulow. On the morning of the 7th of October, I was alarmed about half-past two o'clock, by the springing of the watchman's rattle. I looked out of my back window, and saw a great light launch on the balcony. I called out, what is the matter, the prisoner cried out, very distinctly, come and see what is the matter. I made haste and went to the prosecutor's house. In the drawing-room, I saw a sheet spread upon a blanket, and several knives and forks laid on it, as if they were put there to be packed up. The prisoner looked into the plate-chest, which was open-the nails were drawn, and the lock hanging to it. He unfolded a paper, and found a large marrow-spoon in it. There was some bread, mutton, and a knife on the sideboard, as if the robbers had been regaling themselves. A window was broken, and a ladder put across the wall, which separated my house from the prosecutor's-one foot of the ladder was on the fence wall. The window came down to the floor, and had no fastening. I said there was no necessity for breaking the window to get in, as it could have been pushed up, nor could a hand be got through the hole that was broken-there were candles in the room-the prisoner was in the room, and Braid was on the stones, without his shoes and stockings - He ouly had his shirt on, with the collar undone, and appeared as if he was frightened to death; as if he had been alarmed, and got out of bed. I commended the prisoner for his activity on the occasion, and always respected him, as I thought him a very active watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew him some years - A. Yes, he always bore a good character. He once detected a man breaking into one of my houses, and was rewarded by the gentlemen.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am conductor of the patrol of Bow-street. On the 7th of October, about seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house in Kentish-town, and said there had been a robbery at the prosecutor's house. I went with him to Davis, one of my men, and we all three went to the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account Mr. Wallis gave, of the situation of the room - A. It is correct.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give you - A. He said that he saw a light in the kitchen, about half-past two o'clock-he saw a man was there, and he thought they were robbing the house, he knocked at the door, and sprang his rattle-that in two or three minutes the servant, named Joseph, let him in, he went down stairs, with him, and found the back premises open, and a ladder on the wall, which led up to the drawing-room balcony; that he then went up stairs, and saw the things strewed about the room - He said the plate-chest was on the sofa, and a pane of glass broken in the drawing-room window. I examined the house, with Davis, but could find no marks of violence, excepting the one pane broken in the window. The glass was all over the carpet. I went to the plate-chest, and found the nails drawn, and the lock hanging to it-things remained in this situation till that day week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner apprehended on that day week - A. Yes; I sent him on a message, and then told him I suspected him of the robbery, and must take him into custody. He asked what Joe (meaning the footman), had said? I told him what he had said he would state before the magistrate. I searched him, and found a watch, a gold seal and key, and two 1l. notes, on him. I have kept the seal. He said he knew bl-dy well who had the plate, for it was the old Jew. I then went with Davis to his lodgings, No. 7, Caroline-street, Camden-town; and in a drawer in his bed-room, I found a frilled shirt, marked C, in red-it appeared that another letter had been taken out; it was on the 15th. I found nothing else that day. He was taken to the office. Next day I searched his house again, and found eight silver tea-spoons, three with the crest - A lion; two with the eypher C, and three with the crest erased. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he said it was an old Jew who had the plate, did he afterwards tell you any more about it - A. Yes; he said, at the office, that it was old Mike and I knew him well, and have known himsome years. I had the seal, which I found on the prisoner - I have seen one like it in the possession of Mike-it has no impression; he often showed me things; he showed me one like it about a fortnight or three weeks before I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive an earthen pot from Mr. Clulow - A. Yes, it contained four 1l. notes and three duplicates, made out in the name of Joseph Braid. I took Braid into custody the same day. He took me on the 15th to a court in Petticoat-lane, where Mike lived; he took me into a front room, up one pair of stairs, where I found Mike with his wife and daughter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew nothing of the robbery until the prisoner informed you, and took you to the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him a week after, you had before had some conversation with Braid - A. Yes, with both the servants. Braid did not confess in my presence, my man told me what he had said. I had examined both the servants before their master, and told them it must be somebody in the house. Braid then denied any knowledge of it. Since the prisoner has been in custody, Braid has told me part of the story again, not before, he had told me he had received some money of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him into custody before you took the prisoner - A. Yes, I took him on the Tuesday night. I took Owen and the prisoner the next day. Before I took 
               <persName id="t18181028-80-person602">Morris</persName>
             I had sent him with a letter upon the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280034"/>Q. Did he know the servants were in custody before you took him - A. Yes; I have known him five or six years; he bore a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You sent him to the prosecutor's son-in-law with a letter, after the others were in custody, and he knew it - A. Yes; he brought an answer back, which he was ordered to do, delivered the message to Mrs. Clulow at her house, and then I took him.</p>

            . I was footman to Mr. Clulow, and had been so for upwards of three years. Owen was my fellow-servant. My master was gone abroad, and my mistress went occasionally from home, leaving us in care of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 15th of September, did you and Owen go to the Play - A. Yes, we went to the Play, and left the house in the care of Dennis, who is my uncle.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after that had you any conversation with the prisoner about what happened that night - A. Yes; a fortnight after, he called me into the Hope and Anchor, public-house, and said he had something to tell me; that it was a very serious thing, and I should be obliged to be taken up when my master came home; and that he was afraid to tell me, lest I should split-which means telling. I promised I would not say anything about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you what had taken place - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pass over that; the next day did he tell you what was to be done - A. Yes; he said there would be no other way of getting over it, than this, which was-to break open the house. I was to call him in at twelve o'clock at night, and he would do it as if it had been broken open; then at half-past two he would give a false alarm; but that he would have some more plate first.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the false alarm did this conversation take place - A. It was two or three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he tell you - A. He said he would have some more plate first. He sent me up on Sunday morning, before the alarm, to fetch some plate down-it was in a chest in my master's bed-room. I fetched it down in a half-peck measure, and took it to him in the stable-yard. I took a silver tankard, silver coffee-pot, three silver salt-cellars, some spoons and forks-he was in my master's stable-yard ready to receive them. He put all that he could about his person, and I took the rest. He told me to follow him, and said he was going to Angelcourt, Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he was going to - A. Not till he got there. When he got there he said he was going to Old Mike. We went up to the first floor - He was not at home. We staid about half an hour, he then came in. A young woman and a young man left the room, leaving us three together.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you afterwards to meet anywhere - A. Yes, we were to meet that day, at two o'clock, at the prisoner's house, in Caroline-street, for the money that the plate fetched. I went there, and met Mike, and the prisoner there. I saw Mike put a handful of notes into the prisoner's hand - We all had some gin Mike then left, and the prisoner gave me six 1l. notes, and told me to be sure to put them where they would never be found. I spent two, and put the other four in an earthen pot, and buried it in my master's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress come home on that Sunday - A. No, on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anything of the prisoner, and Mike on the Monday - A. Yes, at the Cock in Somers'-town. I bought a razor, and a small pin of Mike, and the prisoner bought a seal and a key. Those produced are the same,</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Morris, did he inquire if your mistress was come home - A. Yes, I told him she had come home that day, he said it must be done that night for fear my master should come home. The house was to be broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. What directions did he give you about it then - A. I was to let him in when he called twelve, and to be sure not to go to sleep. He told me to shut the dog up in the scullery, for fear he should bite him, which I did. I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, before my mistress. When the prisoner cried twelve o'clock, I got up and let him in through the area-gate, and through the kitchen. The key of the area gate, hung in the back parlour. We went up stairs. after pulling off our shoes. I went into my master's back bed-room, and brought down the plate-chest from there, and put it on the sofa, in the back drawing-room. I brought down some blankets, sheets, shirts, and handkerchiefs of my master's. We took the plate out of the chest, put them in the blanket, and tied them up as if they were ready to be taken away. We also took down two mirror glasses, and tied them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anything done with a ladder - A. It was set on a wall at the back of the house, and led up to the balcony. Some bread and meat were brought up and put on the table, with a knife. Two candles were put in the drawing-room, one in master's bed-room, and one in the kitchen; they were all alight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Morris give you any direction to say any thing to Owen - A. Yes; he told me to tell her to say, that two men came up, with their faces blackened, and threatened to blow her brains out if she offered to stir. I told her so immediately as I came home on the Sunday. I had told her what he had told me had happened, while we were at the Play. We went to Astley's.</p>
               <p>Q. All this being done, what then happened - A. At half-past one o'clock I let the prisoner out. He told me to be sure and not go to sleep, and that he would give the alarm at half-past two o'clock, and spring his rattle, which he did; I got up and let him in; he went down stairs and undone the back door. I went up stairs, following him with the kitchen poker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any plate left in your care, besides what was in the chest - A. Yes, some tea-spoons. (Looking at those produced.) These are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after the alarm was given, did Mr. Clulow, junior, show you an earthen jug - A. Yes, there were duplicates in it, and four 1l. notes, which belonged to me; they were the notes which the prisoner gave me for my share. I was taken up by Smith, and went with him to

               <p>Q. Had your uncle ever been to the house before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280035"/>night you went to the Play - A. Yes, he had been to see me. He went no further than the kitchen. He slept in the house the night we went to the Play, and two nights before that, with me in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. On this night you went to the Play and let him sleep in the house by himself the while - A. Yes. I never showed him the plate-chest; it was kept up two pair of stairs, in my master's back bed-room. It was not concealed. There were other boxes there and furniture. We set out about four o'clock to go to the Play-went over Westminster-bridge to Astley's-called at No. 1, Upper Harley-street, to see an acquaintance of Owen's. We had tea there. A gentleman named Smith keeps the house. We left there, and went straight to the theatre, and got there before the performance began, which was at half-past six.</p>
               <p>Q. What entertainment did you see - A. I cannot remember the name of it. We remained there till it was over, and got home at half past twelve o'clock. We staid no where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank tea with you - A. Owen, and her acquaintance, whose name was Sarah Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home you knew nothing of the robbery being committed, or thought of it - A. No; I never had the least notion of anything of the kind, until a fortnight after. My uncle had called to speak to me after-the robbery and left again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the Hope and Anchor, besides you and the prisoner - A. Nobody. I went to get a pint of beer, and the prisoner called me to him. I was then innocent of any robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. And the first thing he said was, that you would be hung if you did not do something - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say."Why, how can that be?" - A. Yes. He said he would tell me, if I promised not to tell; and if he told me, I could get over it. I asked him to be so good as to tell me. He said he would tell me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you nothing else till the morning - A. No. I told Owen he had said so. He told me afterwards that night. When next morning came, he said nothing could be done but breaking open the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you over night - A. He said I should be taken up, when my master came home. And would I split if he told me? I said No. After some time, he told me my uncle had been breaking open the plate-chest, and taking some plate out, the night we were at the Play, and to be sure and say nothing about it. I asked what they had taken; he said he did not know, but my uncle would tell me. That was all he said that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had your mistress been at home in the fortnight - A. She had been at home; she slept in the front room, which communicates with the back room, where the plate-chest was, all the fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been particularly acquainted with the prisoner before - A. Yes, I have often been to the Hope and Anchor to speak to him. The spoons had been in my care, for common use; they were not kept in the plate-chest.</p>
               <p>Q. When he advised you to make this contrivance, did you not say, "What have I to do with all this?" - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me the agreement was made on Sunday to break open the house - A.On the Sunday that the plate was taken to the Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that did the first conversation take place - A.About a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the second parcel of plate - A. Yes. The prisoner sent me after it. Owen knew nothing but what I told her.</p>
               <p>Q. He took you to the Jew on Sunday; you was never there before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell about the seal and key, till it was found on the prisoner - A. I was taken up before I said anything about the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you came to the prosecutor - A. With Mr. Childs, a solicitor, in the Borough; before that, at Bethnal-green.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he afterwards tell you to do any thing - A. Yes; he said the watchman and his uncle had been plundering the house the night we were at the Play, and it would be very serious, and the way they must get over it would be to lay the house open as if it had been robbed. He told me to say that two sailors had entered my bed-room with black faces.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell Mrs. Clulow, the night the alarm was given - A. I went to her door, and said thieves had been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after you had been told what to say - A. Yes, I met him in Gloucester-place, Camden-town; he spoke to me, and I said "Watchman, I had rather that this which you have said to my fellow-servant had not taken place." He said I must be very foolish, for it could be done very easy.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you had any conversatin with him about the evidence you were to give here - A. No. He told me to mind and speak the truth, and I told him so too, that was all we said. I knew nothing of the transaction till after it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What night did you go to the Play - A.On a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. How many places did you go to before you went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280036"/>there - A. Nowhere, except to the public-house, which we went to as the doors of the play-house were not open. I am certain we stopped no where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had your tea before you went out - A.We did not stop to have ten anywhere.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no acquaintance in Harley-street, or near Mary-le-bone-A. I have an acquaintance in Upper Harley-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call on her that afternoon - A. Yes, I rang the bell for her, she came out, we went into the hall but did not stop. Her name is Sarah Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body has said you went there and drank tea, it would not be true - A. We remained about ten minutes with her, in the house-keeper's room; we had a cup of tea while we were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not say so before - A. I did not understand you. I thought you asked if we had tea before we left home. Braid paid for us both at the theatre. We remained there till it was over, and got home at half-past twelve o'clock; Braid's uncle was then sitting up. I observed nothing particular for a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress did not sleep in the room where the plate-chest was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Braid tell you any thing on the night he had been with the prisoner - A. Yes, he told me the same night that the watchman had told him, at the Hope and Anchor, that he, the prisoner, and his uncle had plundered the house the night we were at the Play, and that the prisoner said it would be a very serious thing when my master came home, and they must lay the house open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his uncle after that - A. Not at all. He was gone into the country. I saw him two or three nights after he slept in the house, nothing passed then about this.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did Braid tell you about laying the house open before it was done - A. About a week before, I think. My mistress was at home at the time he said the watchman told him not to tell me anything about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason for it - A. He said the watchman had a wife and family, and desired me to say this, on account of his wife and family. Braid said that he should be brought into it, as he was left in care of the house. Braid never told me he had taken plate out of the chest. I knew nothing about the spoons.</p>
               <p>BRAID re-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before you was taken up was the money given by the Jew - A.About a week. I did not redeem anything after I received the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pledge for the amount of 4s. on the 3d of October, as appears by one of your duplicates, if you had 6l. - A. I think it was before I received the money. The jug had been buried about a week before my master dug it up.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was it Saturday or Sunday that you received the money - A. On the Sunday before the alarm was given, which was on Tuesday night, the 6th. I received the money on the 4th. I was taken on the 13th, which was the day the alarm was given.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. They were pledged on the day before you received the money - A. Yes.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Caroline-street, Camden-town. The prisoner lodged with me. I have seen a Jew, named Mike, calling on him. I remember the day the alarm of the robbery was given.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday before that, was he at home - A. He came home at eleven o'clock in the morning, and went out. I saw him at home again at one o'clock, Mike, the Jew, was with him; Braid came in. It was on Sunday the 4th of October.</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES HARMER. I am solicitor to this prosecution. When the prisoner was apprehended, in his way from the watch-house to Bow-street, he said Braid had more money than the 4l. which had been found in the garden. That Braid was concerned in selling the plate to the Jew, and he could prove that Braid had been at the house on the Sunday to meet the Jew.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say that Braid committed the robbery, and applied to him to assist in getting rid of the property-A. No.</p>

On Sunday the 4th of October, about half past eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came and bought a pennyworth of honey. He gave me 6d. I gave him the change, and he went away. In about half an hour Wright called me into the shop; I found the prisoner there. He said he saw him take money out of the till. The prisoner denied it, and said he had been round the counter, to pick up his hat. We took him into the counting-house; he fell on his knees, said he had robbed the till of 8s. which he took out of his pocket. I said he must have taken more, as I knew what was in the till. He shook his clothes, and 4s. 6d. fell out.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WRIGHT. I am assistant to the prosecutor. I was returning home, when I came to the shop-door I saw the prisoner behind the counter. Nobody else was in the shop. I waited outside to watch; saw him come round the counter on his hands and knees, get up, and was walking out. I went in and asked what he had been doing. He said nothing; that his hat had fallen over the counter, and he went round to fetch it. I called Batson, who took him into the counting-house. He fell on his knees, begged for mercy, and took 8s. out of his pocket, and said that was what he had taken. We said he had more, he got up, shook himself, and 4s. 6d. fell out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in distress. The prosecutor said he would forgive me. He told me to call next day, which I did, and he gave me some victuals; told me to call again, which I did, and was taken.</p>
               <p>BATSON re-examined. He told the prosecutor such a pitiful story that he let him go, after giving him a supper, and told him to call again. On further inquiry he thought proper to prosecute him.</p>

I went out and took the prisoner outside the door. I asked what he had got. He said he had something to sell. I took his bag from him, and found my four candlesticks in it. He ran away, and was secured immediately. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 16th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming over Tower-hill. It rained very hard; I stood under the Excise gateway. The prosecutor was laying down in the wet. The prisoner came by; I asked him to help me to take him under the gateway out of the wet, which he did, and then went away for eight or nine minutes, when he returned and said "What? is he not gone yet?" I told him he wanted a coach to take him home, and sent a boy who stood by me for one, which he did, and the coachman refused to take him. I sent for another, which came, and the prisoner assisted me to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280038"/>coach-door with him. After getting him up two of the steps, he fell head-foremost into the coach. The prisoner got in to lift him up. I thought he was a long while about it. I looked round, and saw the prisoner's hand in the prosecutor's left hand inside coat-pocket. I saw him pull the pocket-book out, and put it into his own left hand side-pocket. I told the coachman of it. When the prisoner came down the steps, we secured him, and charged him with it; he denied it. I took a pocket-book and catalogue from him. There was a gas-light over the gateway, opposite the coach.</p>

In consequence of some suspicious, which I communicated to my master on the 13th of October, I was ordered to watch the prisoner - he came after breakfast, pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and put them in a drawer in the kitchen, and went up stairs to work-the white lead, which the paint was made with, was my master's property, and kept in the kitchen. After he was gone I examined his coat and waistcoat, about eleven o'clock, but found nothing in any of the pockets. I examined them again about half-past eleven o'clock, and found 2lbs. of white lead in his waistcoat pocket. He had been down stairs two or three times after I had examined his pockets. I told my master. When the prisoner came down stairs, after he had put his coat and waistcoat on, and was going out, my master called him back, and said he suspected he had some lead about him-he denied it. He then pulled the lead out of his pocket, and said it was not his master's, but it was a piece he brought from home to do a little job with. I had searched his pockets before, and they were empty. The prosecutor told the prisoner it was not his. The prisoner then said he thought it was no harm to take so small a quantity.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS WINSLAND. I am a painter and glazier-the prisoner was employed by me to paint the house with Butler. I supplied him with white lead every morning to use. Finding my stock deficient, I ordered Butler to watch him. I was afterwards in the kitchen, and charged him with having white lead about him - He denied it. I insisted on having him searched - He then produced the white lead, which I claimed; he said it was mine, and he saw no impropriety in taking so small a quantity-it was worth 1s. I went to his house, and found white lead there in three pots, which had no water over it, which is not the state it ought to be kept in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You found 2lbs. on him - A. Yes. I did not allow my men to take it for themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say he might go away - A. No, he went away. I refused to pay him his wages.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked two months with the prosecutor. I had a job to do in Lombard-street, and told Butler I had brought my basket full of materials for it. I used to leave my things openly there - He agreed to work with me. He began to be jealous, and told my master I was working for myself. I took it to do the job with.</p>

I collared him - He struck me three times<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280039"/>and asked me what I wanted? I said I wanted my hat-he took off his own, and said, "Is this your's?" He tried to get away - I held him fast; a fireman took him. I have never found it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BECK. I was at the fire, and saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's hat off, and put it on another boy's head. The prosecutor turned round, and took the prisoner-a fireman took him from the prosecutor. He struck the prosecutor three times-the blood ran down his face.</p>

The prisoner came in to buy a glass for a show. I said I had nobody to serve him, he said he would call in half an hour-he went round on my left hand, and went out. In about five minutes I missed the microscope and case. I informed the officer. I am certain the prisoner is the boy who came into the shop. The microscope was safe when he came in, and nobody came in after till I missed it.</p>

My suspicions were excited by a person endeavouring to keep pace with me. I was going to look round at him, when he started, and ran by me. I immediately put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief. I ran after the man who had passed me. He turned up Brownlow-street, and as he turned I saw him throw my handkerchief down. Some persons who were coming down the street, put themselves in his way. He endeavoured to turn back again into Holborn - I laid hold of him, and took him to the office. Almost at that instant my handkerchief was put into my hand. I am certain he is the man who threw it away-nobody came between us all the time.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280040"/>Q. On the night of the 6th of October you was at home - A. Yes, and was alarmed about half-past two o'clock in the morning, by the prisoner, Morris, who was the watchman, springing his rattle. I got up, rang my bell, Owen came to the door, and said the house had been broken open by thieves, that two men came to her bedroom, with their faces blacked, and each had a pistol in his hand, and threatened to blow her brains out if she stirred.</p>
               <p>Q. Presently after did you see Morris and Braid coming up stairs-A. I saw Braid with the poker in his hand; I did not see Morris, but heard his voice. My plate-chest was kept in the back-room up two pair of stairs. I had silver forks, spoons, salt-cellars, and labels in the chest; next morning I found I had lost a considerable quantity of plate, to the value of between 100l. and 200l., among which were the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I was servant ta Mr. Clulow, and had been so for three years. Owen and I were left in the care of the house while my mistress was out. On the 15th of September she and I went to Astley's together, and left the house in the care of the prisoner Dennis, who is my uncle. We both returned at half-past twelve o'clock, and found the house, apparently, as we had left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after that did Morris tell you of anything that had happened on the night you went to the Play - A. Yes, a fortnight after the 15th, he told me, in our absence at the Play, he and my uncle had broken open the plate-chest, and I was to ask my uncle what they had taken out-he said they had taken some out.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some scheme was laid between you and him, about some future robbery of the house - A. Yes; the next morning we agreed that a false alarm should be given that the house had been robbed; he said there would be no other way of getting over it, than pretending that the house had been broken open. I was to let him in at twelve o'clock at night, to put the house as if it had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of Tuesday the 6th, at what time did you go to bed - A. Between ten and eleven o'clock. I got up at twelve, and let Morris in, through the area, as he was calling twelve. We went up stairs, brought down the plate-chest, put it on the sofa in the drawing-room, and some blankets, sheets, and a pocket-handkerchief we put some plate into the blanket, and tied it up, to give it the appearance of their being packed up to take away. We also tied up two mirror glasses, put two lights in the drawing-room, one in my master's bed-room, and one in the kitchen. We put a knife, with some bread and cold meat, on the drawing-room table, to appear as if the thieves had been regaling themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a dog - A. Yes; Morris told me to shut it in the scullery, for fear it should bite or bark, which I did. The dog had once bit Morris in the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. All this being done, did you let Morris out - A. Yes, after he had placed a ladder on the wall, to lead up to the balcony of the back drawing-room window, and broken a pane of glass in the window, to appear as if they had entered at the back of the house-we got the ladder out of the back kitchen. I let him out. He was to give a false alarm at half-past two o'clock, which he did, by knocking at the door and springing his rattle; in two or three minutes I let him in. He ran down stairs, opened the back doors, I followed him, and came up stairs with the kitchen poker in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Morris tell you to say anything to Owen - A. Yes, he told me to tell her to say that two men came to her bedside with black faces, and threatened to blow out her brains if she stirred or moved. I was taken up when some duplicates of mine were found, and told this story.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You tell it to save yourself from being hung - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are swearing against your uncle - A. I am telling the truth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any conversation with your uncle-A. Not any.</p>
               <p>MRS. CLULOW re-examined. I saw the dog loose at the bottom of the stairs that night, but did not see it next morning.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS WALLIS. I live next door to the prosecutor. I was alarmed by the knocking, and went to the prosecutor's house. I have heard the account Braid has given of the arrangements that were made, and found every thing as he has said, except the plate being tied up, it lay opon on the blanket when I was there-every thing else is correct.</p>
               <p>EMMA OWEN. I was servant to the prosecutor. I lived one year there. I went to the Play with Braid; we went out about four o'clock and returned about half-past twelve-we left Dennis in the house, and found him there when we came back. We left no person there but him.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after that did Braid give you any directions about a sham robbery - A. Yes; he said Morris had been speaking to him about the things which had been taken out of the chest, and that I was to say that two men had entered my bed-room, dressed like sailors, with black faces, and pistols in their hands. I told Mrs. Clulow so the night the alarm was given.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to Morris about this - A. Yes; the day before the alarm was given I saw him. He said,"Well, cook," I said, "This thing you have been proposing to my fellow-servant I had much rather should not be done." He said, I must be very foolish, for it might be done very easily. I consented to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have now come from the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a patrol of Bow-street. Morris, Braid, and Owen were taken up for this robbery. In consequence of information which I received, on the 15th of October, I went to Chelmsford, and apprehended the prisoner, Dennis. I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Camden-town. I afterwards went with him to the White Hart, public-house, Braid's father was sitting there, and said, to him, "How could you bring my poor boy into such trouble as this?. He then confessed, that he and the watchman, Morris, committed the robbery at Mr. Clulow's, Camden-town, while Joe and his fellow-servant were gone to the Play. He said that he and Morris went all over the house, and opened all the drawers and closets-that at last they came to a box, that Morris got hold of it, found it was very heavy; that

             the nails out of the lock, and said with an oath, "Here is good booty!"-that Morris wanted to take the chest, with the whole of the plate, but he would not agree to that, as he said they would be hung. I said nothing to induce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280041"/>him to confess. After this conversation with his brother, I asked him what plate he had taken? he said, about a dozen silver table-spoons, about a dozen silver forks, five labels, and three salt-cellars with two handles. I asked him what he did with them? he said that next morning he and the watchman went to look for Old Mike, the Jew - They walked for some considerable time, but could not find him. At last, they got into a narrow passage, leading into Whitechapel, and on making inquiry for Old Mike, the man of whom they inquired asked them if they had got anything to sell? he and the watchman said they had, and showed him what they had got, when the Jew they had shewn them to offered 3l. 15s. for the whole-that the watchman refused to take that, and then he gave them 4l. - that the watchman gave him 1l., and that was all he had. He said no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure you held him out no inducement - A. I did not. He knew I was an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he did it from a feeling of contrition - A. When the father said he had brought his boy into trouble, he told this. He did not say he was sorry.</p>
               <p>MRS. CLULOW. My salt-cellars had double handles.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BRAID re-examined. Q. The morning after you returned from the Play did anybody call for your uncle-A. Morris called for him next morning. He went away, and told me he was going to take a letter for Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. After Morris told you what had been done, did you look at the plate-chest - A. Yes, and found the nails had been drawn.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOWSKILL. I live at No. 7, Caroline-street, Camden-town, the prisoner, Morris, lodged with me. I heard of the reported robbery at Mr. Clulow's on the Wednesday morning. On the Sunday afternoon before that, I saw a Jew, called Old Mike, at Morris's apartments, I afterwards saw the same Jew at Bow-street. Braid came in after him, and was with him there - They were altogether in Morris's apartment.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am a patrol of Bow-street. I took Morris into custody. I went and examined the premises, and found nothing to induce me to think they had been broken open-the window was broken. I afterwards took Morris, in consequence of what had happened, about a week after. When I took him he asked me what Joe had said? - (he knew Braid was in custody) - I told him what he had said would be stated before the magistrate. He said he knew bl-dy well who had the plate, that it was the old Jew.</p>
               <p>MORRIS'S Defence. I never said such words to Smith, nor was I ever in the house with Dennis.</p>
               <p>DENNIS'S Defence. I was never up stairs in the house higher than the parlour.</p>

On the 28th of October, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw my bed-room door move; I went in, and found the prisoner behind the door. I ran down and called the waiter, who secured him before he got to the staircase door. My trunk was taken off the chair, and put on the floor, turned upside down, and every thing taken out, and packed up ready to be taken away-he had no business there.</p>

There was a knock at the door, I asked who was there? a voice answered,"A friend!" I opened it, and the prisoner and another woman came in. I refused serving them it being late. They pressed so hard for a glass of gin, saying they were cold, that I served them, and then the other woman went out. The prisoner took hold of my coat, and made an indecent proposition to me, which I refused, and took her by the arm to turn her out, at which time, I suppose, she must have robbed me - She went out immediately. Just before they came in I was looking over my notes, and marking them. I had 170l. in my pocket-book, in the notes stated in the indictment. I was perfectly sober. I had counted my notes before my family went to bed, and put them altogether into my pocket-book, which I put into my pocket.</p>

About ten minutes before one o'clock in the morning, I saw a man go by the grapehouse, and cross the garden to the tool-house - He did not return as we expected. We heard a noise, and directly heard the engine-pump unscrewed. We went out and saw the prisoner run from where the noise was; we pursued him round the garden. I ran across, met and stopped him by presenting a pistol at him - He had an edge-bill, which he held in a threatening attitude. Rawbone came up and we secured him. I asked what he had been doing to the engine. He said he had done nothing to it, we took him towards the engine, and found the pump taken from the carriage, and carried five or six yards from it - A piece of pipe was found five or six yards from the engine in the way he had run. We called the gardener up-he sent for a constable, and locked the door. The prisoner then said I suppose you are not afraid of my running away, now the door is locked - I said we were not. We walked towards the grape-house. I told Rawbone to look at the other door, the prisoner then quickened his pace. I took him by the hand, he struck me a violent blow on the cheek I presented my pistol at him, and said I would shoot him if he ran - He rushed at me, and seized the pistol - We had a violent strnggle together. Rawbone came up, and we secured him again. In taking him through the door near to where he struck me, I found the lock had been taken off - I had locked it myself at eleven o'clock that night. We gave him in charge at the watch-house, the branch of the engine was quite lost. The apples and onions were found near the pump.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAWBONE. I was in the wash-house, and saw the prisoner, he must have got over the wall - He passed the grape-house, and went to the tool-house - We heard the engine-pump unscrewed. We went out, and saw him run from the place - We pursued, and secured him. We found some apples and onions taken from the tool-house, and put into a bag which was not my master's-it was left just by the engine-pump - We locked the door, and went towards another door. While I was trying it the prisoner struck Butler - I ran to his assistance, and found the prisoner had hold of the pistol, trying to get it from him - I rescued him. I found the lock had been broken off the door.</p>

I made further application to a man named Fuller, who drove the Waltham coach, to whom she referred me. She came on the 4th of September, and brought no trunk, saying, she came from Waltham, and as soon as she got a little settled, she should send for her clothes. I repeatedly told her to go for her clothes. At the end of a fortnight she went out, at my request, to fetch them. She returned at half-past eleven o'clock at night without them, as she said the person where she had been to fetch them was out. I expressed my disapprobation at it. She said, "Do not say anything to me about it; I am so hurt at the person's being out, that I have cried all the way home." Next day I told her I insisted on her fetching them, as I did not like her to be wearing her fellow-servant's clothes. In the evening I asked why she did not go and fetch them, as I did not like her to come home so late as she did last night. She said"I am going for good then." I asked what she meant by that? She said she had taken it into her head, and she would go that evening. I asked her reasons for going away in that manner? In a short time she went away. I owed her some wages; she did not apply for them. I did not see her afterwards till she was in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. While she was in your service, had you in your possession two 5l. notes - A. Yes; they were in a pocketbook in my bed-room drawer. I saw them safe on the 7th and 8th of September. She left me on the 22d. I had not taken them out. It was separate from all other money, as it belonged to some money, I being executrix to my father. I never had any dealings with Griffiths or Dutton. I marked the notes, and should know them again. - (Looking at two.)-These are them. I searched, and missed them the evening she went away. She was taken three or four days after.</p>

I was informed some raw silk had been thrown overboard. A man, named Tayler, gave me some hanks of silk. I saw some more found behind one of the water-tubs. I asked Reynolds how he could think of throwing the silk overboard? He said he thought the cargo would be seized. We had twenty-three bales on board. I found four bales had been plundered. The seams of two were cut open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Brazier left the ship on the 14th, and never returned to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q.Reynolds said he threw it over, lest the ship should be seized - A. Yes. He did not say that it was part of the cargo.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BLYTHE. I am a Thames Police surveyor. On the 15th of October, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I went on board the ship, and found Lock and Reynolds there. I found two hanks of raw silk in Lock's mattrass, and fourteen under a water-cask. I asked Reynolds where his chest and bedding were? He said they were at Mr. Webber's, in Cottage-row, Poplar. I found them there. As we went along, he said he had got some silk in his bed, which he had taken ashore, and that a man, named Lewis, gave it to him. I found nine hanks in his bed. Locks said he took the silk out of the bag before it was thrown overboard.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. The sailors never buy raw silk.</p>
               <p>JOHN WELCH. I am a mariner, and was on board the ship. The day after we arrived at Blackwall, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw Reynolds with a bag of raw silk. Lock was present. I asked Reynolds where he found it? He said he found it in the forecastle, and was going to throw it overboard, for fear of the officers. Reynolds was below. Lock handed it to him. They threw it over in a basket. I told the mate.</p>

About eleven o'clock at night I was returning home-my pocket-book was in my outside coat pocket, it contained a bill of exchange for 95l. 12s., drawn by Hooling of Liverpool, on George Oliphant, of Manchester, payable at Lowden's Watling-street - my money was loose in my waistcoat pocket.

I crossed over opposite to them, that they might not see me. They got to the Corner of London-wall-Hunt-tried to go towards Fore-street - they dragged him down London-wall. I immediately ran round Fore-street, and met them at the other end. I concealed myself in a doorway, and saw them all three, they were still with the prosecutor - one of them took him by the neck, and pushed him against the wall, the other two rifled his pockets - I heard silver rattle, which they took out of his pockets. They then took him as far as the Castle Inn, Moorgate, and left him-they then came back to where they had robbed him- I heard them with the money - I thought they were dividing it - They were all stooping. Just at that time Acott came up, I told him to wait while I ran round. Before I got half round, Acott fell on them-one of them ran by me. Acott called out Stop thief! I followed him-he knocked me down, and ran away. I saw the other two run towards Moorfields. I pursued and the prisoner was taken - I am sure he was one of them. I picked up the pocket-book within twenty yards of where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw the three men with the prosecutor was anybody else in sight - A. No; there were nothing but papers in the pocket-book when I found it-it laid open, and the cards and papers were laying loosely by it in the kennel</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes-It was a dark night- I saw them rifling his pockets. The pocket-book was tied round with a piece of tape.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIRTON. I am a police officer. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house-the last witness gave me the pocket-book; soon afterwards I found the tape under a lamp, between Moorfields and Coleman-street; it appeared to have been torn off the book.</p>

               <p>CHRISTOPHER ACOTT. I am a patrol. On the 29th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was standing on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280045"/>the pavement at Moorgate, Markwell came to me-he appeared alarmed, and pointed to the corner of Moorgate, leading to Coleman-street. I went to the corner, and saw the prisoner and two others - I did not see the prosecutor, they must have left him. They were close together, with their heads stooping against the wall, and looking over some papers - I saw what they were after, and thought they had drawn somebody, and were taking stock. I sprung upon them, asked them what they were about, and collared two of them-the prisoner was one of them, I knew him before. The third man drew back, and was in the act of throwing something towards Coleman-street. I thought it was a blow levelled at me, and drew the prisoner round to meet it to save myself - He immediately came closer, and a general scuffle ensued; nobody came to my assistance, and they got away. I called out Stop thief! and followed them to the corner, and finding a blow which I had received on the head affected me, I stopped. In about five minutes the prisoner was brought to me - I am sure he is the man I took before. When I gave up the pursuit I returned to the spot where I saw them together, and picked up some papers, which the prosecutor claimed-the prisoner was taken to the watch-house. I got a light, went out to the spot again, and picked up a piece of red tape, and a pattern of calico, which the prosecutor also claimed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You said "they had drawn somebody, and were taking stock" - A. It is a common expression.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HUNT re-examined. The papers and pattern were in my pocket-book.</p>

On the 8th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was standing by the window-the prisoner took the boots off the hook by the door, came into the shop, asked me if I would take them in pledge, and then asked me to buy them. I said we were not pawnbrokers. I did not see him take them. Two gentlemen came to the door - I went round to them. The prisoner put the boots into his bosom, buttoned them up, and was going out - I then missed the boots from the door, stopped him, and asked him to let me see them, as I should know them by the private mark at the bottom. He said they were not our's. I gave him in charge. I am certain they hung at the door just before, and have my master's hand-writing on them.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH POWIS. I am a Thames Police surveyor. On Tuesday, the 11th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was on the river, passing St. Catherine's, and saw a sack being handed from the <placeName id="t18181028-108-crimeloc625">ship Union</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18181028-108-crimeloc625" type="placeName" value="ship Union"/>

                        targets="t18181028-108-off623 t18181028-108-crimeloc625"/> to the Prosperous-the Prosperous laid alongside the Union. I and Gaskin, who was with me, went alongside three Ware barges, which laid by the Union; we then boarded the Union, which was Warner's vessel, he was on board. I asked him what was in the sack which he had been handing over? he said he did not know of anything, and that there was nobody else on board. On searching, I found a man apparently asleep in the forecastle. I then boarded the Prosperous, and found Gullen and Woodyard on deck, the hatches were off. I found three sacks under the hatches, containing eight bushels of barley - They appeared like the sack I saw pass from the Union; the Prosperous was laden with flour. I boarded the Union again, and asked Warner what his cargo consisted of? he said it was barley - I found it was so-it lay in the fore-hold, in bulk, and not in sacks-it appeared as if barley had been taken out. I compared that in the sack with the bulk,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280046"/>they appeared the same sample. I then went on board the Prosperous, saw Warren there, and asked him if he had any grain there? he said, None. I said there were three sacks down in the fore-hold; he said, If so it was wrong, it had no business there. The vessel was a sloop of ninety tons. I said I was going to take Gullen-Warren said he would pass his word for him. I took Gullen, Warner, and the barley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go anywhere to take Warren - A. Yes, on the 20th of October I went to Malden, in Essex, found him at his house, and told him I apprehended him for the barley. He said Warner had asked him to have a few bushels of sweepings, and he did not know it was barley till he saw it at the office. He had attended two examinations at the office. The barley was quite clean, the same as the bulk.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you went on board Warren, was at tea with his daughter, below in the cabin - A. Yes, another man was with them. The transaction was at the head of the ship. I desired Warren to attend the examination, and he did.</p>
               <p>Q. At any of these hearings was any charge made against him - A. No; I knew his ship was going away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you see who the persons were that were handing the sack over - A.No, My sight is bad.</p>
               <p>JOHN GASKIN. I was with Powis, and saw the prisoner, Warner, hand a sack from the Union to Gullen in the Prosperous, and informed Powis. We went on board, and saw nobody but Warner in the Union-Gullen was in the Prosperous, there were two men and a boy on deck. I saw them when I was in the boat, and never lost sight of them till I got on board. If they had left the vessel I must have seen them. I went on board the Union, and asked Warner who was there, what they had been handing from one vessel to the other in the sack? he said, "Nothing at all - He had no knowledge of any thing" I went on board the Prosperous, and saw Warren, Gullen, Woodyard, and another boy. I found the hatches shut, and asked Gullen what it was he had received from Warner? he said he had received nothing, nor did he know anything of it. Warren then walked down stairs - He said nothing to me. I told Gullen. I knew better, and would see-(he had heard me talk with Warner.) I took up the hatches, and found three sacks - I asked Gullen what they contained? he said he knew nothing about them. Powis went down to Warner. The sacks contained clean barley, which appeared of the same quality as the bulk in the Union. The Prosperous was laden with flour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Union appear to have discharged part of her cargo - A. It had. There were about sixty quarters left.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for Warren to have been on board without seeing these things handed in - A. No, he must have seen it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many persons could you discover on the deck of the Prosperous - A. I am certain there were four; there were two lads, one boy, and the captain-those were all that I saw. The vessels were aground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe Warren was the only man on deck - He was at the quarters, the others were at the bows. Warren attended the examination voluntarily until his vessel left.</p>

            . I was a mariner on board the Prosperous-the crew consisted of four hands-Warren as master, Pairman the mate, Woodyard and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday you was taken were you on board the vessel in the morning - A. Yes; at one o'clock I went ashore with Woodyard, returned to the vessel at half-past three, and found Warren, the captain, on deck by himself. He asked Woodyard if he had seen the new bridge yet? he said No. and asked me to go with him - I refused, as it was wet. As soon as I came on board, I saw Warren had left the fore-hatch up a little way, and Warner came up the forecastle of the Union with a sack on his back; he reached over to our vessel, and put it on board our ship, I took it of him-Warren saw it; he did not ask what it was, the sack was full. I put it down the fore-hatches; I moved the hatch to put it down, as Warren had not moved it sufficiently - He saw me put it down, but said nothing about it. Warner went below in his own vessel, and Warren sent the boy for half a gallon of beer. When the boy returned, Warner came up with another sack, reached over, and I took that of him also, and put it down the forehatch. Warren was then on deck, but asked no questions. Warner brought up another sack full, I took that of him as before-Warren was still on deck. We drank the beer between the times of putting down the sacks. Master, I, the boy, and Warner drank-master poured it out, and handed it over to Warner in the Union. Warren never asked a question about the sacks. He went down into the cabin as soon as the officers came on board.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the sacks in - A. I thought they were for my master. When the officers were coming on board, Warner said to Warren, "There is the police!" I was taken up for this, and examined twice, but I said nothing about Warren.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anything pass between you and Warren after you was taken up - A. He sent me 5s. over the vessel before I was taken away, as I had no money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you come from to-day - A. From the House of Correction. Woodyard and I have been together there; we have not talked about this only now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked about what you should say when you gave evidence - A. No. It was all done after I went on board. I put the sacks down, thinking they were my master's. The sacks were put down before the officers came, it was not long after.</p>
               <p>Q. Five shillings were handed to you - A. Yes; more than that was due to me for wages. The mate was in the cabin all the while, he did not come up until the police officers came.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw your master before the magistrate, and said nothing about him - A. Yes, twice; I was not asked if I had anything to say.</p>
               <p>JOHN GASKIN re-examined. When Warren was present, did you state what you had seen - A. Yes, I said Warren was on board.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gullen asked what he had to say - A. Yes, at the first and second examinations. Warren was not asked about it.</p>

             (in continuation). Q. How long might it be from the first sack coming down until the officers came on board - A. It might be an hour. Warren<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280047"/>went below now and then, during the time; he was on deck when the sacks were brought on board. I was never asked what I had to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went before the magistrate the third time, did you tell anybody that you would swear against Warren - A. There was a sailor in the prison; I told him I might as well clear myself, as I was innocent of it. I was asked if I had anything to say, and told this story.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WOODYARD. I was on board the Prosperous. I had been drinking a little with Gullen, I returned about half-past three o'clock with Gullen, at the time Warren was on deck, nobody else. He asked me if I had seen the new bridge? I asked Gullen to go with me - We did not go. Master sent me ashore for half a gallon of beer; when I came back master was in the cabin; he came on deck after that. I saw Warner give Gullen two sacks, one after the other, he put them down the forehold, where the hatches were off; when I came on board we all drank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Warner drink - A. He was not near enough to drink, he was on the deck of his vessel. Master was on deck when the sacks were put down.</p>
               <p>Q. You was sent to the same prison with Warren - A. Yes; Gullen was sent to another prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went ashore with Gullen - A. Yes; I saw no sack put on board before I went out for the beer - I only saw three put on board. I believe Warren was walking about the deck while they were being put down; the greatest part of the beer was drank in the cabin. It was all drank before the sacks came on board. Master was on deck when the officers came. I heard nothing said about the police.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Warren was on deck smoking his pipe when the sacks came on board, did he inquire about them - A. No, we had no barley belonging to our cargo our cargo was in the main-hold.</p>
               <p>MR. JOSEPH KING. I am in partnership with John Greenside, the cargo was consigned to us. The owners are

            , JUN. My father lives in the Hampstead-road, and deals in pigeons and birds. On Saturday, the 11th of October the prisoner brought a great many pigeons to sell, some were in a hamper, and some in a sack, my mother would not buy them of him. I was afterwards informed that they were stolen, and met the prisoner in the New-road, on the Monday. I went home and told my father, he went and took him.</p>
               <p>PHILIP CASTANG, SEN. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and met him in the New-road, my son pointed him out to me. I went to him, and said I understood he was the man who had been to my house on Saturday with some pigeons; I asked him what he had done with them? he said they were all sold. I said I should like to buy some if he would show me where he had sold them; he hesitated a little. I said I understood they were stolen, and unless he took me to where he had sold them, I would take him to Bow-street. In our way to the house where they where he ran from me, about half-way down Burton-crescent; I overtook him, and took him to the watchhouse; he then said they were at Stevens's, at Battle-bridge. Salmon and I went there, and inquired of Mrs. Stevens - We found fifty in the first-floor back-room; the prisoner afterwards saw them, and said they were those he had sold.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SALMON. I am an officer. On the 11th of October I was informed the pigeons were lost. I left word at Castang's that they were stolen; on the Monday morning he told me some had been offered to his wife. I found the prisoner at the watch-house. I went with him to Stevens's, as he said they were there. I found fifty-nine there in a back room.</p>
               <p>JAMES FULLER. On the 9th of October I met the prisoner at Twickenham-common, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, going towards the prosecutrix's house, which was three miles further; I think he had a basket with him; I have known him many years, and am certain he is the man. I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>JOHN GREENHILL. On Saturday, about one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners about two hundred yards from the prosecutrix's house, with a basket - He wished my master good night.</p>

About eleven o'clock that night I found him in a shed on Hampstead Heath, and told him I understood he had a great deal of money about him. He said he had not got a farthing about him. I found a watch on him. I found a pocket-book in his breeches, between his thighs, with three 5l. notes in it. I asked him how he got them? He said he found them near Battle-bridge.

On the 16th of October, about one o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by the watchman, and found that a man had broken into my school-room. I went down, and found the side window had been cut, by which means he had entered. I unlocked the school-room door, went in, and ordered the prisoner out. He was in the school-room. He came out and begged pardon for what he had done. I got a light, and found the articles stated in the indictment gathered together. My desk was broken open, to get the coins and scales out.</p>

               <p>DAVID PULLINGER. On the 17th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming along, at the end of Tothill-street, Westminster, with a heavy load on my shoulder, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner with two others. He came into the passage leading to the <placeName id="t18181028-113-crimeloc655">Almonry</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18181028-113-crimeloc655" type="placeName" value="Almonry"/>

As soon as I came to the end, the prisoner came before me, and drew my watch out of my pocket. He ran back through the passage. I called out "Stop him!" A soldier collared him in the passage. He got from him. I laid down my load, and followed him into Dean-street, but lost him. I took him two days after. I am sure he is the man. I had seen him about before. I never found my watch.</p>
               <p>JOHN JONES. I am in the third regiment of Guards. I was standing at the end of the passage, and saw the prosecutor come by with two boxes on his back. The prisoner followed him to the other end of the passage. I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" The prisoner then ran back. I collared him, and asked what he was running for? He asked what that was to me, and got from me. I am sure he is the man. I knew him before.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SPENDLOVE. I am a dealer in harness, and live in Crawford-street. On the 24th of September, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in Oxford-street. They said they had two chaise-harness and four saddles, for sale. I told them where I lived. They said they would bring them in a coach by ten o'clock. Knowing Primrose, I got two officers from Marlborough-street to attend at my house. About half-past nine o'clock Primrose knocked at the door and said, "We have only got the two chaise-harness, but the four saddles you shall have in the morning." He made use of a bad expression, and said he would make a good thing of it for me and himself too before the winter was out. While he was speaking, Martin came to the door and called the coach up, which was two or three doors off, and pulled the harness out of two flour sacks which were in the coach. They put them at the top of my kitchen stairs. Primrose turned them out, and said he wanted three guineas for them. called the officers down.</p>

            . On the 12th of October, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner, with another lad. They passed me. There was a boy looking at them. I went home with a sack which I had with me, then returned and followed them. They saw me, and the prisoner threw some lead through a broken railing, in two bundles, and ran away. I pursued them about thirty yards, but finding they got a-head of me, I returned and got the bundles out of the railings. I took one bundle to the watch-house. The watchman was calling past eight o'clock. I got a light and found the other bundle of lead, and took that to the watch-house. Each man had a bundle of lead; they weighed 84lbs. together. I am certain the prisoner was one of them. I have known him three years.</p>

I took them to the Turk's Head to give them some liquor - I took out my pocketbook to pay for it, and pulled out a 10l.; and a 5l. bank note, besides a 1l. bank note, which I paid away - I then walked up a lane with them. I went up a one pair of stairs into a room with the prisoner - my back was towards her. In a few minutes I turned round and missed her - I also missed my pocket-book and money out of my jacket pocket, which was safe when I entered the room. I afterwards found her in custody in Field-lane-the other girl had given information - I am sure she is the woman. I was quite sober.</p>

She said that she had got rid of the whole of the money, and she gave the 10l. note to a jew in Cow-cross, with whom she cohabited, and bought clothes with the rest.</p>

I asked him what the two sacks weighed together? he said, "I made a mistake in the first, it only weighed twenty-three stone four pounds, which makes it twenty-eight stone four pounds together." I said it must have weighed more - He said it did not. I went to Morgan's, where he sold the fat, and asked him, in the prisoner's presence, what the first sack weighed? he said twenty-eight stone four pounds, and that the prisoner had only brought one sack. The prisoner said that nobody was present when he brought the second lot. At last he said the first sack was heavy, and he put it down by the Black Horse, public-house. Rose came out, put it in another sack, and while he took one sack, another person came with the other. I afterwards found it at Wilmot's, at the corner of Great Russell-street, in one of my sacks-it weighed six stone four pounds. The prisoner fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>GEORGE IFGRAY. I am a watchman. On the 19th of September, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of the Vinegar-yard, into Bowling-green-lane, with a bag - I followed her, and asked her what was in the bag? she said they were rags. I found it contained the articles stated in the indictment - She said they were her own, and she had been washing them in a ditch. She then cried, and said she was without father or mother, and had been destitute of a home for two years,</p>

He had pulled out two tills, which contained a quantity of halfpence, and silver. I ran to the door, and shut him in-my neighbours came to my assistance - He dropped the money on the floor - He had taken the silver, and left the halfpence - He had his shoes off.</p>

On the 26th of September the linen hung in my garden to bleach, in the evening it was taken off the lines, and put in a washing tub in the courtyard, at the top of the garden, Next morning it was taken - I found the prisoner, in custody with it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PORTER. I am a watchman at Holloway. I saw the prisoner Mason about half-past four o'clock in the morning, with a bag on his back; I asked him what the bag contained; he said he did not know. I found it was wet linen - He said a man gave it to him to carry, and was to meet him in a brick-field, and was to give him sixpence, and a good breakfast, for his trouble. As I was taking him to the watch-house he said he would tell me the truth, and where I could find the man; but if the man knew it he would kill him - He said that he sent him forward, and said he would go and get a bag of fowls, and another bag of linen. I took the constable to the brick-field, to see the man, and found a man looking to see if anybody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280053"/>was coming-Beak was with him. The man saw us, and said, "D-n their eyes! here they come, run off my boy." They both ran into the fields-the man escaped. I took Break, and asked him where the other bag was, he said he did not know. I took him back to where they ran from, and found another bag of linen covered over with straw. I have never found the man.</p>

Having changed my clothes to go into morning, I did not remember having it until after I left; It certainly would have been better if I had given it to the prosecutor, but I did not.</p>

On the 14th of September, in the evening, the prisoners came to my house together, and had gin and cloves to the amount of 8d. They gave my wife 1s. She gave them 4d. In about a minute afterwards a woman came in with shrimps. They paid her 1s. she brought it to me. I said it was bad, and took both the shillings to the prisoners, threw them on the table, and said, "How can you offer me such rubbish as this?" Thompson took them up, began jinking them, and said she did not think them bad, and asked Williams if he had any money? He laid half-a-crown on the table. I took it up, and, I believe, Thompson took up the bad shillings. One of them did. I sent for an officer. They left the house immediately, and I followed them. They all stopped and talked together opposite a chemist's shop. Thompson then crossed over and bought some apples of a woman, the others walked on, and stopped at the corner of Duke-street; she then joined them, and all walked on towards Houndsditch. Davis came up and took them.</p>
               <p>EDWARD DAVIS. I am a beadle. I took the prisoners to the watch-house, and found three bad shillings, five good ones, and two half-crowns, on Williams; two half-crowns, eleven good shillings, and one bad one mixed with them, on Myers, and a bad one in a coal-box just behind her; she was within reach of it. Bacon called out, that she was secreting something in her mouth. I found a bad shilling and a good sixpence in her hand, which was up at her mouth. At this moment an apple-woman came in and said, it was the sixpence she had given her in change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280055"/>for a bad shilling, which she produced. She said she received it from Myers.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he ever obtain from you any written order, authorizing him to receive those goods - A. No; the order is not my hand-writing. Mr. Dixon charged me with them, and I discovered it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had received an order from Mr. Burslem, and received the goods. After this I met a man who is now capitally convicted at Kingston. He gave me the order, and asked me to receive the goods, and said he would see me in half an hour. I got the things, gave them to him, and have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 21st of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man driving ten pigs. They passed me by Mill-hill, which is about ten miles from town. I walked by the side of them. I afterwards went on towards Hampstead, and saw them again about ten o'clock. The other man was then gone. I asked the prisoner to drink with me, which he did. I collared him, and said I suspected the pigs were stolen. I took him into a back room, and wrote down what he said. - (Reads.)"He said he bought them of Mr. Housely, of Becclesway, for 22l. 10s., on the 14th of October. That his name was Field, of Blackfriars'-road." I found a dead fowl and a knife in his pocket. The pigs were very much fatigued; they could not stand on their legs for two days.</p>

He lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280056"/>with me until the 10th of March, and then left me without giving any reason. He went out one morning, said he was going to look for work, and never returned - I did not know he was going to leave me. I was with child by him at the time; the child was born two months ago in St. Martin's workhouse. The prisoner took a few of my things, and made away with the chief of my clothes to support himself while he was with me.</p>

Next morning, about twenty minutes after seven, I saw them in Mr. Mellish's field, going as if from an hedge, towards a large moat. I came up to them, each of them had a parcel under his arm. They ran when I first saw them, but when I came up to them they walked. I said; "D-n you, you shall not have that, now; so you may put it down." I did not then see who they were, as I was behind them. Short turned round, and said, "D-n you, what I have found I have a right to keep." I said he should not have it. Markwell kept going on. I followed them to a large piece of deep clear water. Short got before Markwell, and threw his parcel into the water; Markwell put his down, and came up and hit me in the face, and said, "D-n your eyes, Jack, I will kill you!" I then knew him, and said I was sorry to see him there; I did not want to know him. I staggered at the blow, but did not fall. To prevent them doing me any harm, I told him Mr. Porser was coming round with his men; he then offered to shake hands with me, and said he was sorry he had hit me, and desired me to say nothing about it. I left them, and met my wife; in consequence of what she said I went to the hedge where I saw them go from, found two boxes broken open, six quartern loaves, and several pieces of bread; a direction was torn off one of the boxes, and thrown into the hedge, with the prosecutor's, Bluck, name upon it. About half an hour after I found nine pin-cloths and a coat, in the water; another man pulled out two legs of mutton. I afterwards found another coat.</p>

I noticed footsteps in the yard, and laid a board over them, to prevent their being disturbed-the prisoner had worked for me two or three days before; next day he came to me for a job; I refused him. As as soon he was gone I compared the footmarks he then made with the others, and they exactly corresponded both in the number and distance of the nails, and the length and breadth of the foot. There were some nails deficient in one of the shoes, it agreed with that also. I traced the footsteps for a mile and a half, which led me very near to his house. I did not prosecute him then, being afraid of the expence, but having been robbed again I was determined to do it. I searched his lodgings last Tuesday week, and found the articles stated in the indictment there - He lived there in March also - I had lost more, I was at Highgate when he was taken at work in a saw-pit-my saw was found just by the pit - He said it was not his, his fellow workman said it was. He then said it was his, and he bought it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You lost them in March - A. Yes; he is a sawyer - I can swear to the saw.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HUNT. I am servant to the prosecutor. He covered the footmarks. Next day the prisoner came - I compared the footsteps he made that day, with the others - They corresponded exactly.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Oxford-street. On the 29th of September, about eleven o'clock at night. I saw the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder - I followed him about a hundred yards, and then asked him what he had got in his basket? he put it on the pavement, and said it was lead, which he had brought from a house at Kilburn, which was being repaired, and was going to take it to his master, Mr. Wilson, No. 27, Newman-street. I said I thought it was odd he should carry it at that late hour. He said I might go to his master with him - He said, perhaps I thought he stole it. I took him to the watch-house. I then went to No. 27, Newman-street-no such person lived there. Next morning I found they were the prosecutor's nails-the hinges were with them.</p>

On the 21st of October, in the evening, I was returning from Hampstead, the prisoner overtook me - He was driving a hackney coach; he asked me if I was going to town? I said Yes; he asked what part? I said to Marylebone; he said he lived in Tottenham-court-road, and was going that way, and asked if I would ride, which I did. He turned round into the Islington road, I told him to let me out, as he was taking me the wrong road, He said he was only going to the next house to bargain for a horse, and was coming back again. He went on, and stopped at the house; he then went to another house, opened the coach-door, and asked if I would get out a bit, as he was going to bargain for a horse again, which I did. He said I might leave; my box in the coach, but I took it with me. He stopped at the house a few minutes. had a pint of beer, and asked me to drink, I refused. I had part of a glass of gin, and some bread and cheese. He got on the box, and I into the coach with my box; he turned the coach round, and by the light of the lamp I saw he had another man on the box. He drove a little way, then the other man opened the door, and told me to get out, for they were at their journeys end; I got out. and wished him a good night. I had got but a little way before the prisoner came and drove his hand into my box. and took out the articles stated in the indictment-it was a bandbox; Mr. Williams was coming by, and took him to the watch-house. One of the caps was found in his hat.</p>

I had not gone three steps before the man advanced and thrust his hand into the prosecutrix's box, which was slung on her left arm - He immediately ran across into the passage at the corner of the Crown and Woolpack, public-house. I pursued, hearing the prosecutrix say she was robbed; the other man left her, and said "He shall not rob you, I will fetch him back;" he followed the other man into the passage. I went over, and found it was a thoroughfare. I returned to the entrance of the court, and found the prosecutrix there. I inquired for the coachman, as I thought, from what she said, he must know something of it; a man belonging to another coach came. She said he was not the man, that she wanted the man belonging to the coach which had put her down-in a minute or two she said the prisoner was the man; he was standing with his back against the wall, with his coat tucked up behind him. I questioned him about the robbery, told him I was convinced he knew something about it, and I would have him taken before a magistrate; I desired the people who were round to send for an officer. He was very abusive, tried to get away, and pushed the prosecutrix before him, as if he was acquainted with her; the moment he dropped the tail of his coat I was convinced, from his dress, that he was the man who had robbed the prosecutrix. A man came, and took him to the watch-house. Brown found a cap in the crown of his hat, which the prosecutrix claimed.</p>

On the 21st of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was at breakfast - I left my front parlour to go into the kitchen. I returned, and saw a man's hand in the window, taking a spoon off the table - I also missed the sugar-tongs. I saw a man running from the house, a gentleman pursued, and brought the prisoner back, who I believe to be the man by his dress and figure.</p>
               <p>FORTUNE GUILLOIS. I was in Mary-street, and saw the prisoner and another young man, in a brown coat, at the prosecutrix's door, a gentleman came out, and both ran away, the prisoner turned to the left, and the other man turned to the right. The gentleman called out Stop thief! I pursued - He jumped over a pailing, and then over a ditch. I cried out Stop thief! but could not follow him. About three days after I was attacked by the young man in a brown coat - He struck me several times, and said if I appeared against the prisoner, he would be the death of me - I am certain the prisoner is the man, he was taken about five minutes after the robbery, in the field, by the constable. I had him in sight all the way till he got over the pailings, I then lost sight of him for a minute.</p>
               <p>JAMES BIRK. I am a constable. I heard the last witness cry stop thief! and followed the prisoner down the road; he turned up Edward-street, jumped over the pales, and then over a ditch; I went over after him, ran round the ditch, and two men stopped him in the Regency-park. I brought him back, and am positive he is the man. I found nothing on him.</p>

               <p>WALTER CLARK. I am a smith, and live in Sherard-street, Golden-square. I was in a room commanding a view of the Park, and saw the prosecutor sleeping on the grass - I saw the prisoner put his hand to the prosecutor's pocket several times, and take a piece of paper out - He then got up and walked away. I ran out, awoke the prosecutor, and told him of it. The prisoner turned round, and saw me; I said he had been robbing the man - He denied it. When I took him to the prosecutor, he said he did take it, and if I would give him time he would find it, as he had dropped it. We gave him half an hour to find it, but he could not.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BLACKBURN. I am a pawnbroker, and live on Saffron-hill, On the 11th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought the table-cloth to pledge. I observed it was rough dried, and noticed his name was different to the initials. He said he lived in New-street, Shoe-lane, and his mother, who was ill in bed, had sent him to pledge it. I said I thought it was stolen - He denied it. I returned it to him, and followed to see if he went to where he said he lived; he put it under his coat as soon as he got out of the shop, and I gave him in charge.</p>

On Sunday, the 11th of October, I went into the kitchen, about ten o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner there. I was informed she was an acquaintance of one of my servants, and was a servant out of place. I did not object to her remaining there all day. She left at ten o'clock at night. On Tuesday I found her in the kitchen again, about ten o'clock in the morning. I was going to speak to her. Seeing me, she said to the servant, "Where is Patience? for I wish to be off." Patience was the servant who knew her. The milk-pot had been used at breakfast that morning; in the evening I missed it and a table-spoon. She might have taken the spoon on the Sunday.</p>

In the summer I went to France, and left the-prisoner and his wife in care of my house and furniture, which I kept an inventory of. I returned about the latter end of October, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I went to the prisoner's lodgings and found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was absent five weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280063"/>Q.Was any demand made by him for wages-A. Yes; He summoned me, before he left, for wages. When he left he asked me to search his boxes.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH DAVIS. I am char-woman to the prosecutor. The prisoner and his wife were left in care of the house. Before the prosecutor left, they cut off a piece of baize which laid over the carpet, as it was too large. The same piece was found in his trunk.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say anything to you about any furniture - A.Before the prosecutor left, he came into the kitchen when the prisoner's children were there, and asked whose children they were; the prisoner's wife said they were mine. Next morning I asked her, in the prisoner's presence, how she could say so; she said if I would take an empty room, she would furnish it, and supply me with coals and candles, if I would keep her children out of the prosecutor's sight, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before that night - A. No. The next morning he made the proposition to me.</p>

On the 14th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, while I was at supper I saw the prisoner in the shop, leaning over the counter, at the till. I ran into the shop, he was then standing upright, and asked if I sold pigtail tobacco? I said No. He then asked for a quarter of an ounce of returns, and threw down 6d. for it. I went to give him change, and found the till was not quite close, and there was only two shillings and two sixpences left. My wife said she had taken none out. I had been to it just before, there was then several shillings and sixpences in it. I sent for an officer, who searched the prisoner, and found four shillings and three sixpences on him.</p>

               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am an officer. On the 24th of October I was at the end of Gracechurch-street, and saw Ward with another man. Ward had a bag - They were together, and walked very fast. I followed, and stopped Ward, the other ran away. I found some bristles in Ward's bag, and took him to the watch-house; in consequence of what he said, I went to Mr. Mathews - We went together to Ward, and in consequence of what he said, we went to the prisoner, Bryant's house, in Brown's-lane, Spitalfields-(she keeps the house)-Lecore lives with her, and carries on the business; they are brushmakers-it was between ten and eleven o'clock at night; Lecore was shutting up the shutters. When he saw me he came into the shop-Bryant was behind the counter. Mr. Mathews asked him if he had received any bristles from his porter? (they must both have heard it.) Lecore said that some came in on Wednesday, and the receipt was on the file to show the delivery of them. He then asked me if I had a search-warrant? I said No, and if he was an honest man there would be no occasion for it. Mathews asked him where he kept his bristles? he pointed to the place. Mathews then asked him if he had any Archangel bristles? he said No. I went to the cupboard in the shop, pulled out four or five bundles of bristles, and showed them to Mr. Mathews. He said he could swear to one bundle, but could say nothing about the others. I asked them who they bought it of? both the prisoners were present. Lecore said, "You must find that out." I took it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Both the prisoners attended at the Mansion-house to hear Ward examined. The business belongs to Bryant-Lecore manages it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOREN. I live with Mr. Mathews, who is a brush-maker and bristle-merchant; the prisoners are both brush-makers, and have been customers at our house for many years. In consequence of what Ward had said I accompanied Mr. Mathews to the prisoner's house-Lecore was shutting up shop. I went in, Bryant was behind the counter. I asked Lecore if he had had any bristles in on Wednesday? he said he had, and he would produce the receipt - He produced the receipt for a few which I had sold him on the Wednesday night. They were dressed hairs, and these were rough as they are imported, I told him the receipt was correct, and asked him if he had any Archangel bristles in the house? - Bryant heard it. He said, "Not any, nor have I had any for sometime." I then asked him if he had any rough hairs of any description? he said he had a few - I examined them. I found a bundle of Archangel bristles among them. Immediately that I saw them I said I knew them-it is a very particular article. Mr. Mathews had a quantity of them. We sold none of the kind to the prisoners. I asked Lecore where he got them? he said, "There is the thing - You must find that out." Neither of them gave me any account of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bryant say anything - A. She said she knew nothing of them-that she knew our porter had been there on Wednesday with some bristles, but she knew nothing of those.</p>

            . The bristles are Archangel bristles, and of a peculiar kind, undressed. On the 21st of October, I had a quantity of them - A great quantity has been sold, but all, I believe, were sold in the country-none were sold to the prisoners - They were worth 3s. per pound.

               <p>JOHN WARD. I lived about five months with Mr. Mathews as porter - I went to the prisoners' house one day with some goods from Mr. Mathews, about two months ago. As I was going out Lecore asked me if I wanted a job, this was in the street? I said "No, I have got one." He said "You have been to my house, have not you?" I said Yes. He asked me if I would have a drop of beer? I thanked him, went to a public-house, and had some. He then said, anything that I could get from Mr. Mathews's, bristles, or anything else, he would buy them of me. I said I would not get them, and went home. My master dealt in brushes also. At another time I went to his house with more goods from my master-Bryant was present, and heard what he said. Lecore asked me if I had got any bristles, or any thing else? I told him No. Bryant said nothing. He asked me why I did not? for if I got anything he would take it of me - I refused, and went home. Then another porter, named Thomas, went - He is the man who ran away when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of anything that was said to you by him, did you take anything to Lecore's - A. Yes, on Wednesday, the 21st of October, at dinner-time, I took one bundle. I had nothing to take there from my master. Thomas took one bundle of bristles out of the warehouse, my master had not given it to him, and I took them to Lecore's about one o'clock-both the prisoners were present in the shop-Thomas was with me. I told them we had got some bristles - They took them of us, and gave us 12s. for them; they weighed them, and made them 6lbs. Bryant counted the money, and Lecore handed it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q, You was convicted of robbing your master - A. Yes; I told about it directly I was taken. The bristles were tied up as those now produced.</p>
               <p>LECORE'S Defence. The bristles are tied up differently to when they were before the magistrate. They do not weigh 6lbs.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER re-examined. They came undone, and I tied them up again as before.</p>

In about ten minutes I missed two 1l. notes out of my breeches-pocket, which were there when I went into the room-nobody but us were there. I called the watch, and the prisoner, Griffiths, came to the door, and tried to break it open-he said he was a watchman - I refused to let him in. He got in at the window, and opened the door for the girl to escape - He pulled her from me. We scuffled together, and all three fell. I saw his hand under me, taking something from her - He ran away; I gave the girl in charge. I have never recovered my notes.</p>

On the 16th of September, between nine and ten o'clock at night, the copper was safe in an out-house in the yard; next morning, about ten o'clock, I missed the carpet, and found the copper pulled down, and taken away, They must have got over three gardens to get at the out-house. On the 20th of September I saw them at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 17th of September the prisoner passed me in Great Russell-street with the copper on his head, the carpet was tied round it - I stopped him. He said he brought it from Hampstead; after that he said he bought them of a man in the road, and then that he found them in Harper's-fields. I afterwards fitted the copper to the prosecutrix's place, and it corresponded exactly.</p>
