            . I live at Cashel in the County of Tipperary, in Ireland. I first became acquainted with the prisoner the latter end of May, 1815; he stopped nearly a week at my father's house before he married my sister Mary - I was present at the marriage at my father's; my sister Julia, my brother, my father and many other witnesses were present. The Reverend Doctor Wright married them, he is now dead - he was a Roman Catholic priest; my sister and the prisoner were both of that religion.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that was the prisoner's religion - A. He brought a certificate to Doctor Wright, stating that he was a Catholic. I never saw him at a Catholic chapel before he married her - he represented himself as a Catholic by bringing a certificate from his parish priest; he always passed as a Catholic, and always joined in our religious duties, particularly in the Rosary, which is family prayer, and he said he had a brother in the Maynooth College educating for a priest. After the marriage ceremony they both lived together and cohabited at my father's house, as man and wife, for a week, and then he got a part of my sister's fortune, and went to Dublin, wrote a letter, and then his wife and a married sister went to him. The prisoner returned to my father's house about a year afterwards and stopped about a fortnight; Mrs. Burke was not with him - she has two children, one of them is now at my mother's; my father is dead. The prisoner failed in business afterwards, and applied to us for money, 20 l. was given him - I have seen my father give him 100 l. note at one time. My sister Mary is now living, I saw her here to day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was your father - A. A leather merchant. The prisoner was a <rs id="t18220703-2-deflabel4" type="occupation">publican and grocer</rs>

My father and all his family are Catholics. They were married about nine o'clock in the evening, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not as late as twelve o'clock - A. Yes I will; it was after eight o'clock, for it was just duskish, and in the month of June.

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and live at Springfield, in the County of Tipperary - I am older than him. He was brought up a Protestant. I did not know him up to the time of his marriage with Miss Butler, as he frequently was at school, and I was brought up at home - I was very young when my father died. I had not known much of him for some time before the marriage, as he was apprenticed at Carlow, and went from there to Dublin. I was at Butler's on the day this affair took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen your brother before that day - A. I saw him the evening before, I met him in the street - I dined with him at Butler's on this day, we dined after nightfall; it was on the 11th of June, seven years ago. After dinner my brother was neither drunk nor can I say he was sober.

             the father of this young woman, said he wished to give him one of his daughters - I do not know which. I forbid Butler to have anything to do with him because he was not a man that was fit, as he was a Protestant.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done upon that - A. They drank hard and played at cards, and sent for those clergymen, the parish priest, and his coadjutor.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they drink before they sent for the priest - A. About three or four hours. Wright the Catholic was the priest. They came, as I suppose, with intent to marry him. They sat down and drank hard, then called him, and asked him to comply with them.</p>
               <p>Q. To comply with what - A. With the Catholic church, to go to confession I suppose, to become a Catholic; he said he would not; he was not sober. Wright came out and declined marrying him, and said he had nothing to do with him he might go home - I desired him to get up, and come home to his mother's place, which is about fifteen miles off; he stood up to come, and then Butler stood up and said, neither he, nor I, nor the priest should go away, till we parted on good terms and drank more - then they all got as I suppose stupidly drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there did you see any ceremony of marriage performed by any body - A. None whatever. I went away between one and two o'clock in the morning; I was drunk then - my brother came out into the street with me; I wanted him to come away with me, but finding him so drunk and unable, he remained there. I did not go to Butler's again for three years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your brother stay at Butler's after this - A. I do not know that he went back to Butler's. I had a letter from him afterwards, and met him at Temple-moore, about a lease, and he said he would go home to Dublin;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030005"/>this was two days after. Temple-moore is about fifteen miles from Cashel - he need not go through Cashel again to go to Dublin. I was never at his house at Dublin afterwards. He was in the grocery, wine, and spirit business I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You are a Catholic - A. Yes. I lived at that time at a place called Girthley-bowl, in the parish of Baracilla, seventeen miles from Cashel.</p>
               <p>Q. What brought you to Cashel - A. My brother wrote me word that his mare had strayed away from Cashel, and I went to look after her, and met him in the street; he had found her - he did not come to me, he wrote and told me I should find him at a first cousin's house of mine in Cashel - I went and found he had just left there, and found him in the street - I found the mare at Butler's; I went there with him to call for the mare, and was invited in to take something - I did not know that he was residing at Butler's house.</p>
               <p>Q. I give you notice that there are parties in Court who were present on this occasion; on your oath was not the invitation an invitation to be present at the marriage - A. On my oath it was not, I had no more notion of a marriage than I have of going home in a boat from this place.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost sight of your brother for many years before this - A. Yes; I cannot exactly tell how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not seven - A. I cannot swear. I was very young when I left the country - I had heard nothing of him whatever till he wrote to say his mare had strayed; nothing else brought us together. My mother was a Catholic; my father died before my brother was born. My mother has always been a Catholic - I was only at Cashel on the evening of the 11th, and remained there the day following till two o'clock in the morning of the 13th, as he got drunk and could not go home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day of the week did you first go there - A. On the 11th, Sunday - that was the night the card-playing took place.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You had no idea of the marriage - A. Not the least. I staid all next day, and did not leave till two o'clock in the morning of the 13th, for I did not get up till twelve, and then fell to drinking and playing at cards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When they tried to entrap your brother, how came you to leave him with such company - A. I thought if I did not go myself I should be turned out.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. I give you notice that you will be contradicted if you deny this; but, on the oath you have taken, did you not give your brother away - A. I did not at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give your brother away in marriage either on the 11th or 12th to

               <p>Q. Were you sober at breakfast - A. Just betwixt and between, neither drunk nor sober, sometimes sober and sometimes drunk. I dined with the family, that was about ten o'clock at night. I think - I was not sober at dinner; we breakfasted at ten o'clock in the morning. I eat nothing between ten o'clock in the morning and ten at night, but had plenty to drink. I did not see Doctor Wright before Monday. I have a brother named John.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your brothers went to Maynooth College - A. My brother Tom; he is not a Catholic; I do not know whether he did go to College, but if any of my brothers did it must be him, as he was the only one fit to go, as he knew Latin - he is gone to America.</p>
               <p>Q. You came away from Butler's between one and two o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 13th - A. Yes. I left my brother in the street, he was stupidly drunk, and I told him to go to his cousins.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go with him - A. He was drunk, but able to walk. He slept at Butler's on Sunday night.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and am five or six years older than him - my father was dead when he was born; I have known him from his birth, except for three years while he has been in London. He was always a Protestant of the Church of England. I knew him in 1815, he was a Protestant then - I always was a Protestant; John goes to mass, but I think he is a Protestant in principle. I have known the prisoner go to mass, but only out of curiosity - he and I went one Good Friday, eight or nine years ago, in Dublin. My brother Tom was educated at the Revered Mr. Jordan's, who is a minister of the Protestant faith; I never knew him go elsewhere - he was always a Protestant; he was a private tutor for sometime, and then went to Dublin, and was about getting into Trinity College, and some years after he went to America on an adventure. I firmly believe he never was at Maynooth College. I generally went to a Protestant Church, and the prisoner constantly went with me when we lived at the same place. This happened in 1814 and 1815.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. What way of life were you in - A. I superintended the cellars of Messrs. Delapier, wine merchants to His late Majesty; since that I have been in Price and Co's. service; I now sell wine bottles on commission, and support myself with that and what I have saved in service. I have left Ireland about seven years; I left after his marriage. Until I came to England there were not twelve months passed but what I saw my brother. I suppose I saw him at least six times a year. I came to England three years before him - I did not see him for three years and a half after his marriage. I lived at Dublin for about a month after his marriage, and called on him once or twice - I never saw him at a Catholic chapel there with his wife; I never saw her with him - I lived with my mother when the prisoner was born.

               <p>"D - n you, keep your hand out of my pocket;" this was two hours before the present transaction. About twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock, I saw him again, I had been watching him; I observed him standing three or four yards on the left hand side of a gentleman, who had a watch in his pocket; I saw the seal and ribbon, and the prisoner was looking at it - when the trumpet sounded, and the King coming out of the house, the prisoner shifted to the right of the gentleman, and as the carriage drew near, the prisoner clapped his hands just against the gentleman's ears, and hissed; he then threw his arms round the gentleman who was huzzaing, and made a pull at the watch, but did not succeed in getting it - the carriage came nearly up; he made a second attempt, but did not succeed; then the carriage came close up, and the gentleman took his hat off and held it up huzzaing, and then he succeeded in getting it out - I was about a quarter of a yard from the the prisoner; I said to the gentleman,</p>
               <p>"You are robbed, follow me," he said</p>
               <p>"No, my guard chain has saved it" - I secured the prisoner, he made great resistance, and said he was the King's servant. I took him towards Street's public-house, in Bow-street, a mob followed us; I put him in the house, and called out for the gentleman who lost his watch; nobody answered. He got the watch out of the pocket, but never separated it from the person.</p>

            . On the 25th of March, I was at the Horse and Groom, public-house, Kingston. The prisoner and one Sturkey were there - one asked the other if he had seen Dummy, which meant Walton; one of them said No, and shortly after Walton came in; they enquired for the ragman, meaning Shaw, and between twelve and one o'clock the ragman came; Walton and Taylor went out together, and came back together in a quarter of an hour, with a bag containing copper, and sold it to the ragman for 4 s. 6 d.; he weighed it, and took bag and all - they said they had liked to have lost it, for there were some boys birds nesting in the ditch; the prisoner had a knife, which was notched - he said it was the first time he had ever been in such a thing, and would never do it again. He was talking to Walton and Sturkey.</p>

On the 10th, while he was working there I was giving one of the students change for a sovereign; the student said what a number I had got there - I said there was 50 l. I do not know whether the prisoner heard it - the prisoner returned a little before one o'clock on the 12th, which was our dinner hour. I saw the gold in the bag in the drawer that morning, between nine and ten o'clock, and on returning from dinner to the study, I found it locked as I had left it - I unlocked it, and found the handle of a razor on the floor, my desk broken open, and the money gone - I did not see the prisoner again till the 10th of June, when Tufts brought him down to Hackney - I said I knew him, and asked if he did not know me; he said Yes; I said</p>
               <p>"You know these studies," he said Yes - I said</p>
               <p>"You are the person that painted them," he said Yes; I then got into a coach with him, and on our way from Hackney in the coach, I asked him how he came to commit the offence; he said he would not answer any question of that kind, but begged me to spare his life. The study is at the bottom of the garden; it is attached to the dwelling-house by two walls, and inclosed with the premises by a wall all round.</p>

I changed him two sovereigns out of it - I asked where he got the money; he said he had an uncle dead in the country, who had left him 50 l. He drank a 5 s. bowl of punch, and went away. I saw no more of him till the 10th of June. I saw him at my door - I asked him in; he had no shirt on, and appeared distressed. I went out to buy him a shirt and handkerchief - I told him there were hand-bills out against him for a robbery that he had done; he said he saw it pasted up in the Borough - I said he must go with me to the place, which he was willing to do; I said I did not know where the house was - he said I will shew you. We took a coach, and he said he hoped I would beg for his life, for it was the first crime that ever he did - he took me to Mr. Collison's; he ordered the coachman to pull up at the door.

On Wednesday, the 9th of June, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the Coffee-room, and had a glass of rum and water, he had a tea spoon with it. In about ten minutes the waiter intimated his suspicion - I watched the prisoner through a window which looked into the Coffee-room, and saw him looking very intently into a large cupboard in the Coffee-room - he then walked up and down the room twice; I sent for Smith, the officer, who waited in the room, and in about half an hour the prisoner came out; I told him, after what I had seen, I must have him searched, and gave him to Smith. He wanted to return to the Coffee-room, but I prevented him. I saw the officer find a table spoon in his side pocket - there were table spoons placed in different parts of the room. It had the letters R. A. on it, which are the initials of a person who kept the house formerly. He said nothing.</p>

She came in about six o'clock in the evening; a piece of Valentia was on the counter, but not near where she stood; we never sell less than a piece. She came to pay for some scarfs which she had looked out the night before, and delivered me the pattern of a cheque to match. I had occasion to go round the counter, some distance from where she stood, to match it. She had the scarfs in her hand; there was no other person in the warehouse. While I was endeavouring to match the pattern, I saw her snatch the Valentia off a pile, and put it under her gown; she could not have taken it by mistake for the scarfs, as it was much larger than them, and a good distance off. I went to her, and said she had taken what she ought not; she denied taking anything. I laid hold of her; a scuffle ensued; she then took it from under her gown, and threw it round behind the counter. I rang the bell for Mr. Merrick, and sent for a constable; she was detained.

            . I am waiter at a gentleman's; I live in Titchbourne-court; the prosecutor's office window is exactly opposite my house. On Sunday, the 2d of June, I got up about ten minutes past five o'clock; I went out at my door, and about ten minutes after I went out again, and saw the window-shutter had been removed, and rested on the cill; I moved the shutter, looked in, and saw a man walking about the place; there was a lad, about eighteen years old, at the bottom of the court, walking about towards Holborn. I watched him for more than a quarter of an hour; he passed my door towards Whetstone-park; I went in, put on my coat, and followed him, and when I got to the top of the court he was gone. I had not been absent more than two minutes. I saw a man shutting the printing-office windows in Whetstone-park; I said it was very improper that he should be shutting the windows that time in the morning; it was then a few minutes after six o'clock; he said something which I did not understand, and went off westward, towards Queen-street; he had a black coat on, and I believe black trowsers. The prisoner is very much like the man, but I cannot swear to him. There was a tall man close to the window while he was shutting it up; he and I examined the window, and found the shutter shut and one bar up. We had seen the man fasten that bar; we took it down, and found the lines cut and the sash taken out; it stood inside. I went and alarmed Mr. Hansard, and went round the premises with him. The stranger went after the man, and I have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Castle-street, Oxford-market. On Sunday morning, the 2d of June, about five o'clock, I went out to take a walk; I was in company with Gillon and Fielder, in Old Compton-street, Soho, about a quarter past six o'clock, and saw the prisoner there with the barometer under his arm, wrapped up in an apron, going westward. A boy came after him, and told him to make haste, for there was somebody coming after him; he then hurried on, and kept looking back. We followed him to Crown-court. I went up and asked him if he had the barometer to sell; he said Yes, but he thought I had not money enough to give for it. I then said I thought he had not got it honestly, and asked where he lived, and where he was going with it. He said he would shew me; he went on about fifty yards to an old iron shop in Crown-court, and was going to turn in there. I collared him and said, if that was where he lived, I should take him to, the watch-house. The shop door was open; he resisted, but the other two helped me to secure him. We took him to St. Ann's, watch-house, and while we were waiting for the watch-house keeper to get up, he rushed by and ran off with the barometer. We pursued him, and he threw it away. Fielder picked it up. We took him in Nassau-street, without losing sight of him, and took him back to the watch-house. We then went to look after the boy, and a woman pointed out the clock; it was in a basket, at the corner of Frith-street, in Old Compton-street. I found the maker's name on the barometer, which led me to the prosecutor. He wore a black coat and dark trowsers. I knew him before.</p>

The watch-house door was not open, and I went towards the door again, when they took me. They would not go after the man who gave them to me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 28th of May, a few minutes before two o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Jermyn-street with a bundle; I asked what he had got; he said broken meat, which he had from the Old London Hotel; that his father was an artist, and had once been in good circumstances. I walked to the corner of St. James's-street with him, and he put down the bundle; a leveret fell out. Several people pressed me to let him go, and I did. I met a gentleman, and then returned and took him again; he had got nearly one hundred yards when I overtook him; he was offering a coachman 5 s. to take him to Fulham; the coachman wanted 10 s.; they parted. I took him to the watch-house. A few minutes before five o'clock the prosecutor's servants came to look at the bundle. There was a cup in it, which I produce. When I first saw him he was half a mile from Mr. Adair's.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I alarmed the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner at twenty minutes past two o'clock that morning with another young man; they walked by me towards the Strand, both with bundles, as I thought, under their coats. I turned to look after them, and they both ran; I followed them and sprung my rattle, and heard something fall like glass about the middle of Catherine-street. I pursued them into the Strand; they turned into Wellington-street; the prisoner turned to the right, and the other to the left. I went down under the bridge to the left in pursuit of them, and as I came round under the arch I met the prisoner; his mouth and nose were bleeding; I secured him. I am sure he is one of the two I saw before, it was twilight; I never saw his face till I took him. He was only out of my sight while he went down the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see where they came from in Catherine-street - A. No; they came down the middle of the street. I took him to Catherine-street, and when I returned Fitzgerald had the clock, and said in his presence that a girl of the town found it, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw his face till you took him - A. No; they were out of my sight in crossing the Strand. I noticed that his dress was dark, and when I took him I found he had a snuff-coloured surtout on; he was flurried, and appeared out of breath. I supposed that a public-house had been robbed, and on trying M'Gowan's door, it opened; there were no marks of violence on it.</p>

               <p>"Don't touch him, he is a cooper." I did not know him. They pushed me about, and I received a blow from the fist of one of them, which knocked me down; my hat came off in the fall. I got up; four or five others came up and shoved me about, and struck me several times. The head-borough came up and took the prisoner. Four or five men came up; they said nothing; I do not know that any of them took the hat; my pockets were not touched; they said nothing about any money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The four or five men were boys - A. Some were rather bigger than the prisoner. I was rather in liquor; I did not run against the prisoner to my knowledge; I pulled my jacket off to fight them.</p>

I followed her into the room; there was a light there; Chimes put it out. All four prisoners were in the room. Collesa took me and threw me on the bed. I knew it was him by his voice; I knew him, and he knew me. Tindle then came up to me, and put his hand into my pocket and took my money out. I knew both their voices; they both came here in the same ship with me. He took coin, value fifteen rupees, one half-crown, six shillings, and three penny-pieces. I am sure he took them away. The women did not touch me. Sapple put the candle out. I took hold of one of the men by the hand, and they directly caught me by the pocket. I hallooed out, and Tindle took a knife and threatened me if I made a noise; and when I found they would not let me out, I took Tindle by the arms and dragged him down stairs into the street. A watchman came, and I gave him into custody. I then gave Sapple and Collosa in charge; but Chimes ran away. They were taken to the watch-house. I am certain that they took my money.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 3d of June there was a noise in the street between the prosecutor and the prisoner Chimes. The prosecutor said he had been robbed. I asked Chimes what he was talking about, she said that he said he had been robbed, but it was false. The people who stood by said something; I then went into Sapple's room, and brought the male prisoners down; I did not see either of them with a knife. I went in again, and brought Sapple out of her room. Chimes had gone away before I came down. I put them in the watch-house. No knife was found in the room. The house is in Cornwall-street, St. George in the East.</p>
               <p>COURT to CARDER. Q. How do you know that Tindle had a knife - A. He had it in his jacket pocket; it was such a knife as sailors use. I took hold of his arm, and could feel that he had it.</p>
               <p>CHIMES'S Defence. I can prove he gave me the turban to take care of, and in five minutes he asked me for it again. I gave it him, and afterwards went to Sapple's room. He came up, and beat these men about dreadfully. They did nothing to him. Sapple called for assistance, and the landlord came up and turned him out, and he said he was robbed of 3 l.; he said I had better go home, for he would have all three that night.</p>
               <p>TINDLE'S Defence. I was in the room; he followed Collosa up, and struck me; he endeavoured to get from him; he was very much in liquor, and said he was robbed. I had pawned my jacket a few days before to lend him money, and how could he have all this money?</p>

Sapple said he wanted to fight the other man; he came into the passage, and waited there; I suppose he wanted the other man to come down, but I could not understand what he said.

Mr. Winder was gone before me; I went to see the procession, and returned about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, and found the door locked; I saw nobody there; I had left my gown hanging on a nail, and the petticoat on the bed. I went to the Swan, public-house, in Coleman-street, to wait till my aunt returned, and in about ten minutes I returned to the house again - I had two friends whom I left at the bottom of the court; I went up stairs, and saw the prisoner just coming out of the room door, with his foot on the first step; the door was ajar, I did not see anything in his possession; he walked by me. There is no higher stairs in the house, nor any other room door on that floor. I went forward to the door to see if my aunt was come, and was much alarmed - the gowns were thrown behind the door; mine had been moved some distance from where I hung it. Mrs. Windser's gown was also there; my gown was not much worn. I called Stop thief! but he got away - I pursued him; I lost sight of him after he got out of the house, but saw him three or four minutes after in custody of Read. I am sure he is the same man I saw coming out of the door.</p>

             is my partner. On the 24th of May, Dart and Douglas came into the shop between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and asked to see some lace; Markham shewed them three pieces - they bought nothing; they had not been in the shop, five minutes before Collins came in - I saw looks exchanged between them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030015"/>and after Collins came in we missed a piece of lace - I said one of the three must have taken it; Collins denied all knowledge of the other two, or that she had taken it; they staid in the shop. Only three pieces were shewn to them, and there was no more within their reach. The officer searched them - I was not present then; the officer afterwards produced six yards of lace, which had our shop mark on it, and was one of the pieces which had been shewn them,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. They staid in the shop half an hour, though they knew it was missed - A. Yes. It was not on a card; I thought it might have stuck on their clothes, and looked, and am certain it had not; the officer brought it in from the street. Dart offered to be searched before the officer came.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and searched them, but found nothing; I searched Dart and Douglas more particularly than Collins. No conversation passed between them. I was in the room for quarter of an hour. It could not have been on any part of the outside of their clothes. I fetched Brown, who examined their shoes, but found nothing. We took them to the watch-house, that they might be searched by a female. I took hold of Collins, and kept her out of the regular pathway, to avoid the crowd. Somebody called out that it was found; the lace was produced; it was found in the way Collins went; the others did not go in that track. Collins was about three yards from the spot where it was found; the prosecutrix offered to let them go if they would give it up.</p>

I was the first up, and had gone to bed last the night before. I left the door bolted; I found it shut-to and on the latch; I found the top part of the bar unbolted, and the large parlour window a little open; it never would fasten very secure. I had left it close down the night before, and fastened it with a screw in the middle. I do not know how they could get it open; it was done by somebody outside; the glass was not taken out; there were footmarks under the window outside; they must have got in that way, but how they unscrewed the door I cannot tell. I had left some halfpence and penny-pieces in the till; I do not know the amount; they were gone, and nearly a gallon of brandy was gone out of the bar, out of a small cask. The key of the cellar hung in the bar, and eight bottles of wine were taken from there, and also some eggs.</p>

            . I am a labouring man. I was taken up about this business myself, for being with the prisoner. I was sleeping in Mrs. Grove's left; he came there and trod on me, at three o'clock in the morning of Saturday. I got up at eight o'clock in the morning and left him there; he slept there always; I went no where with him; I only know that he came there at three o'clock - it was getting light. He came up to me at Mr. Southall's about half-past nine o'clock, and then he had about 14 s. in halfpence, and seventeen eggs. We went to the Rose and Crown public-house, and then to Mr. Atkins's the butcher, and got two pounds of beefsteaks: we then went to the Rose and Crown, and had the steaks and eggs cooked. I asked him where he got them; he said he bought them of Mr. Fleming, the grocer, and that he took the money from Mr. Upton, where he had been at work; he is a coal merchant; he worked there three or four days; he asked me to give him 1 s. in silver for halfpence, which I did; another man also gave him 1 s. for halfpence; he then went to the landlord, (Parker) and got 3 s. for halfpence - and afterwards six more shillings; I was in custody three days for this; I paid my part towards the steaks, having 6 s. of my own. On the Friday night he asked me to go with him to rob Mr. Elworth's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to propose that to you - A. I do not know - I did not go - I was intimate with him; we slept in the same loft. I was in Mr. Routh's service as a haymaker - I did not know where he got the eggs from. He said he took seven bottles of rum from Mrs. Elgar.</p>

I was looking through a window, and saw her open a drawer from which two pair of stays had been taken the preceding week; she shut it again without taking anything; I immediately went up to my husband, and afterwards resumed my place on the staircase, and while she left the room to go down stairs for her pail, I went and looked in the drawer, and at the top of it was a large pasteboard, which nearly covered it, and at the top of that was a few rules and the shears; I observed that there was nothing about the room. I went back to the staircase, and she returned with her pail. I missed her for some time; I could not see her for five minutes. I heard a rustling like jeans being unfolded; I went down to the back room door, and saw her at the first drawer in the foreman's room; I went in as she was shutting the drawer - I asked what she was doing; she said merely putting in some pieces of jean which laid about. I said there were none laying about a few minutes before, for I had been down there, and that she had no business at the drawer. I asked her what she had taken from it the preceding Sunday; she said nothing. I said I was satisfied of her being the thief who had taken all we had lost, it being within the time she had worked for us; she said she had touched nothing. I said there was an officer down stairs ready to take her, and left her (there was no officer) - she finished her work, and in the intermediate time Mr. Gould sent for our foreman to examine the drawers. I, Mr. Gould, and the foreman, went in to examine them. I found two pieces of jean in the drawer I saw her at; they measured four yards and a half each; I do not know where they were before. She came into my service on the 28th of February.</p>

            . I was called; I found a mob, and the prosecutor holding Capps by the arms; he gave charge of her for robbing him. I took the other two about twenty minutes after, the fighting was over when I got there. He said in Capps's presence that he was robbed of 4 s., a half-crown, and 6 d.; she denied having any money, but at the watch-house I found half-a-crown in her hand; she threw it down on the bench when I was going to search her. The prosecutor was very much smeared with blood, which came from his nose; he had a black eye, and his head was beat; he did not appear the least tipsy. I saw Carroll and Smith round there when I went up.</p>

            . I live near Wellington-court. On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030017"/>Sunday morning, the 16th of June, I stood at my door, and saw Read come down towards the court, and another girl, (neither of the prisoners) had laid hold of him by the arm; and as he walked by the court she shoved him up the court. Capps who stood under the archway immediately came up, and put her hand in his waistcoat pocket; I did not see her touch him before that. The prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"I will not be robbed, and will not let you go;" he held her by the hand. While he was wrestling with her, the other two prisoners came down the court towards him; one of them cried,</p>
               <p>"Let her go;" he said he would not; and one of them said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not, we will knock your b - y head off." The other two came up after her hand was in his pocket.</p>

             re-examined. I saw no woman till I saw Capps, that I recollect - one might be walking by my side, but Capps stood at the entrance of the passage, and fixed on me. I was knocked down so immediately, that I hardly knew what was done at first. Capps's hand was in my pocket at the time Smith gave me the blow.</p>
               <p>CAPPS'S Defence.

These women seeing him ill-use me, came up, and he struck them.</p>
               <p>SMITH's Defence. Carroll and I were sitting at our door, and seeing a crowd at the end of the court, we went up, and the prosecutor was holding this woman. I said,</p>
               <p>"Do not ill-use her - take her to the watch-house, if she has done wrong."</p>

I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the three men running, the prisoners and another, they came over a gate about nine feet high; I pursued them both, and had to jump over a ditch. Kerns ran into a field, and Marsh into a nursery ground; in about ten minutes I saw Kerns laying among the oats in the field, and took him. I saw the plate picked up twelve yards from him. While I was pursuing Kerns, I saw him throw a handkerchief into the ditch; I stopped to take it up, or I should have had him then - I produce it. I found Marsh afterwards at Mr. Thomas's house - I found nothing on him. Kerns denied that the handkerchief was his. I am sure of both of them; I was close to all three, and saw their faces. I think the salts worth 20 s. each, the dessert spoons 5 s. each, and the table spoons 30 s. - they are not found. The tea spoons are worth 5 s. each.</p>

The prisoner was more than fourteen years in my employment; he left early in March 1820, to go into business on his own account; he took a shop in Bethnal-green Road. I gave him credit to the amount of 400 l. or 500 l. On the 3d of June last, I received information, and on the 4th I went to his shop in Bethnal-green Road; before I entered, I saw some lawns in the window, which I knew to be mine. I then went in with Mr. Thomas and Mr. Hines; the prisoner was out, he was sent for, and came in a few minutes. I told him I wished to see the lawns which were in his window; he brought part of them; I told him they were my property, and had never been sold to him, and I had reason to believe there was a considerable quantity more goods, and I insisted on seeing them; I said he knew what belonged to me, and I expected him to produce them; this passed in a little back room adjoining the shop. I went into the shop myself, looked about, and desired him to take down some Irish linens, muslins, and a paper containing India muslins, and some shawls; these were taken down, and I claimed them from private marks by which I knew them; I said he must have taken them while he was in my employ, and I had never sold them; there was a considerable quantity of them placed together; he made no answer how he got them; he was so confused, that I thought he was incapable. All the articles stated in the indictment were found there on that day, except the diaper, but that is not a tenth part of what was found; I am positive I never sold them to him; I have since asked him how he came possessed of them, he made no answer. I have never held out any hopes or promises to him; the goods I claimed were put up in a wrapper, and afterwards, by his written permission, removed to my house; the value in the indictment is something below their real value. I told him my debt was twice the amount of any person's, and therefore I insisted on having a warrant of attorney for 300 l., as he owed me 400 l.; I said I should then stand equal with the rest of the creditors. I got the warrant on the 5th, and took out the execution next day. I then informed the creditors, and gave up my warrant to distribute the effects equally - I only took it out to secure the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you not obtained from him since, an assignment of all his book debts and property of every description, to the amount of nearly 1500 l. - A. It is under 1000 l.; the assignment was for the benefit of all his creditors - I never promised to take no steps against him, if he made this assignment. I did not promise not to put the warrant of attorney in force for six months. I had him apprehended about a month after the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not proceed instantly against him - A. It was partly my own convenience, and a wish to obtain the goods. We had a consultation whether we should take him this Session or the next; he was taken the night before last. I have had intercourse with him, from time to time; he has applied to me about it - I said I had nothing to say to him at present. No promise of any kind was held out to him - I did not object to an attorney attending on his behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Do none of the goods you sell go out with your mark - A. Certainly.</p>

            . I was once in the service of the prosecutor, and about two months ago I went to assist the prisoner in his business, and noticed a great number of goods that were Mr. Mitchell's, and mentioned it to Lewis: they had Mitchell's mark on them.</p>

Three or four years, and while the prisoner lived there, I was clerk; he knew I was acquainted with the goods - but cannot say whether he knew I was acquainted with the mark.

            . (In continuation.) When the first parcel was found, he was asked to produce his invoices; he brought invoices, and they contained none of these goods; the prisoner called a few days after at my house, and requested me to wait on Mr. Mitchell, to intercede for his forgiveness, and not to prosecute him; I told him I could not think of that, but I did at last, and afterwards saw him, and told him the prosecutor would make no promises. He asked my advice - I advised him to give up all the goods which he had fraudulently obtained, as without that he could not expect clemency; he said, he did not know what he should do; he should be ruined, and what would become of his wife and family; this conversation was about a week after the 4th of June; he called on me repeatedly about my interceding with Mr. Mitchell.</p>

Myself and my husband, and two other men besides the prisoner, were in the room; there was only one man there when I first went in; the prisoner asked if I had seen a young woman whom he described; I said no; he then said he was a country farmer just come from Wales, and had received 1100 l. at the Bank the day before; he pulled out some guineas and Bank notes, to shew that he had money; he dropped one note, and one of the two men picked it up, and said it was a 5 l. note; he gave it to the prisoner; we told him he should be careful of his money, and not throw it about. Then the man who took us there offered to play a game with the prisoner with three chalks, and putting halfpence under a pot, they asked my husband to put his hand on the top of the pot, which he did, and then he lifted it up; the other man who took us there called heads or tails, and he won a sovereign of the prisoner; he put the sovereign on his finger, and said he would treat the company with it, either with wine or brandy and water, (the landlord had brought a pen and ink before the gambling began, for the man to write the directions of the ship.) The man played another game with the prisoner for another sovereign, and won again - he offered to return all he had won, as he said, he did not wish to keep it, as he might as well have won 20 l. as 2 l.; the prisoner began to abuse us all, and said we were all poor people, and had no money, and meant to rob him, and that he had plenty of money, if we had none.

I gave him over to the beadle. I stopped him in the passage before he got out; he gave me no reason for running away with them. One of the other persons ran away, and the one my husband collared got away; the prisoner was taken into a grocer's shop, and immediately began to tear up some papers, which I thought were notes. After we had been to Guildhall, he said he hoped we would not hurt him, and what did I want more than my money? I said I did not want more; he said he hoped I would not be hard with him.</p>

            . On Tuesday last, I and my wife were together; we met a man who took us to the Falcon public-house about getting a ship; the man went into the public-house with us. There was another man in the room; and in about ten minutes the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer, and enquired after a woman, who he said he had given 10 l. to, and said he was a farmer come from Wales - that he had been to the Bank and received 1100 l. He began to flash his money about - he had gold and sovereigns. A note dropped out, and the man who gave me the direction picked it up, and said he should be careful of it, and gave it him, saying it was a 5 l. note; the prisoner pulled his gold out again, and began to grumble with the man. I laid my hand on the pot, as they asked me; they made three chalks, and covered it with a pot, and put a halfpenny under it. I did not bet with them; the prisoner lost a sovereign; the man gave it him again, and told him to be more careful of his money. The prisoner then said we were all a set of beggars and wished to rob him. My wife took up the direction and put it in her pocket-book; she took out the notes; I said,</p>
               <p>"Let them see the notes, that we are not poor, nor mean to rob them." The man who gave me the direction snatched them out of her hand, and put them into the prisoner's hat; the prisoner immediately took them, and was putting them in his pocket; I jumped up and seized the man, and told my wife to take care of the prisoner, who was going out of the room - she got into the passage, he gave my wife the two notes; the man who was in the room started off, the other men was at the street door with me, I let go of him to secure the prisoner, I shoved him into a shop, and then that man came up to strike me; I should know him again if I saw him; my wife fetched a constable while I held the prisoner. Our notes were new, and quite clean; the prisoner gave her one that was endorsed, the other appeared to be my own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You proposed to shew the notes - A. Yes. She did not put them on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went to the door, was it not to call the landlord - A. No. He said,</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier. I was going to dinner, and saw the prosecutor and his wife hurrying the prisoner into a grocer's shop; they said he he had taken two 5 l. Bank notes from the wife; he said, They had got their money, and thought that was quite sufficient, and hoped they would do no more; the constable searched them, and the prisoner took out some papers like Bank notes, and attempted to destroy them, but was prevented; but he succeeded in tearing some of them. I saw the duplicate of a watch and four seals found on him; also, ten guineas, a sovereign, a foreign coin, a ten-pound note, and two five-pound notes.</p>

            . I am the street keeper. I took charge of him; I was going to search him - I found a 10 l. Bank note, two 5 l. notes, ten guineas, and a foreign gold coin and a sovereign, and some papers. One was a shilling note, and three or four flash notes. The money found on him was returned to him.</p>

I saw Norris standing close by him; he said it was merely a lark, that it was just a cry of Stop thief! among themselves - I took him to the watch-house; he resisted, but very little. I searched them both, but found nothing on them.</p>

            , Esq. lodged at Nos. 23 and 25; No. 23 was his bed-room - I went in, and saw him standing with a pair of Mr. Luttrell's boots in his hands, by the drawers; he saw me, and directly dropped them - I did not touch him, he looked so respectable. I went down to fetch Mr. Renand, and as we were coming up stairs to look after him, he was coming down; we stopped him to know his business - he said he wanted to see Colonel

             was gone out of town; he said he was a friend of Colonel Shaw's, and had frequently met him at Colonel Shaw's; we asked what he went into a gentleman's bed-room for; he said for a particular purpose, and we let him go. Upon examining the room we found the boots on the floor, but no appearance of his having been there for the purpose he stated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The boots were not gone - A. No, but they were moved off the drawers, and put on the floor. I can swear the boots are Mr. Luttrell's, and know his Christian names, as they are entered in our ledger. He took the boots out of town, and sent them back when the prisoner was taken.</p>

             at Colonel Shaw's. I asked his name, he said Lientenant Rowan, of the same regiment. I told him he had been in a gentleman's room; he said he had - I asked why; he said for a necessary purpose. I said that was very improper, and if he had asked the waiter, he would have shewn him a proper place. The waiter had not told me about the boots, and I let him go - I went up to No. 23 immediately he was gone, and found he had not done as he said - I made further enquiry, and got a search warrant, which led to this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The waiter did not tell you of the boots - A. Not till after he was gone. I found the boots in the middle of the floor.</p>

We had come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030024"/>out of Leicestershire about a month before; he was living at his father's, and I at mine, in York-street, Westminster. I was to meet him in the park by appointment; he was going into the Infirmary. I was never in the park before of a night, but was there once in the day-time. He came to meet me, as my father and he had had words, and he did not like to come there; we were to meet a little before eleven o'clock. As I was walking along, a man dressed like a soldier, and the prisoner, came out from under some trees; the prisoner had a dark frock on; they both took hold of me, and said nothing, but dragged me under the trees; I cried out Murder! as loud as I could several times. They stopped me about four yards from the trees. Neither of them said anything; but when they got me under the trees, the soldier robbed me of the shawl off my neck, and cut my pocket from my side; there was nothing but a small pen-knife and a key in it. The soldier then said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"We are two comrades;" and the prisoner said to him,</p>
               <p>"You be off," and the soldier immediately ran away across the park, and the prisoner went about twenty yards from me and changed his dress; he put on a white smock-frock. I continued making an alarm, and two gentlemen came up and took him, while he was putting his arm into the frock. I was laying on the ground and could not get up, they hurt me so; they dragged me on the ground; they had pulled me down. The prisoner used me worse than the soldier, by dragging me about, which hurt my side very much; and when the gentlemen held me up I fell down again, from the hurt I received and the fright together; they said nothing to me; I had never seen either of them before. My bonnet came off with their dragging me. The prisoner's other dress laid on the ground; he tried to take it up, when the gentlemen came up and secured him. I am sure he is the man. He took nothing from me, but the soldier did; here is the gown I had on at the time (producing it); it is torn, and all green with the grass.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Adam-street. I was coming through the Park, just by the new monument, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock, and heard a woman scream Murder! several times; the voice came from under some trees near the milk-house. I was alarmed, and did not like to go alone; but a gentleman came up soon after, and ran with me; I got up to the woman first, and did not see any more of the gentleman. Just as I was making up to her, she was coming out of the grove of trees, with her hair all down, and her bonnet in her hand, and said she had been robbed by a soldier and another man. I looked round and saw a man in white, about ten yards from her; I thought it was a woman, and said,</p>
               <p>"What woman is that with you;" she said it was a man. I went up to him (it was the prisoner), and asked why he did not help the woman while she was crying out murder; he said it was nothing to him, but her calling out murder had caused him to lose his money. Directly she came up she said he was one of the men who had robbed her; he had not got his frock completely on, and had a loose bundle laying before him; he took it up loose as it was, and ran towards Piccadilly gate. I and the prosecutrix ran after him, and Dawson met him and secured him. The woman was not able to run, so I took her by the hand.</p>

            . I was in the park; I heard the woman cry out Murder! and saw the prisoner running, and these two running after him. I ran across and secured him. I brought him into Piccadilly. Howlett and the prosecutrix came up, and she said that was the man who helped to rob her.</p>
               <p>JOHN WORMWOOD. I am constable of the night. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house. The soldier cannot be found. The prisoner's bundle was brought to the watch-house; it is a black smockfrock and two soldier's jackets. I do not know that he is a soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday evening I was enquiring for a lodging about a quarter past nine o'clock. I bought this new frock and jacket, having had money given me to go into the country. I had a 1 l. note from the Royal Hotel. I inquired for lodgings about Westminster, and the last place I enquired at was about forty yards from the Park; and as I could get none, and thinking that if I travelled on the road with the bundle I might be stopped for stealing it, I determined to sleep in the Park, and took off my frock, and in came a young woman (the prosecutrix) arm-in-arm with a soldier. They looked at me, and I did not wonder at it, as it might look suspicious to see me changing my clothes. Directly after I saw her sitting down with a stout man; she directly called out Master, master! and I thought to myself, if I go to assist her, I shall get abused and insulted, and perhaps robbed of my clothes. Well, he kept scrambling with her for five minutes, then got up, and came by me swearing, and she calling after him; he had a brown coat and light breeches on, and appeared a smith, or something of the kind. Directly after that, a soldier came up and asked what was the matter, and she told him her case; he spoke kindly to her, and asked her all about it. He laid down by her for two or three minutes; they then got up and came near me, and looked at me; then the soldier said,</p>
               <p>"Ah! Yorkshire, what country." I said I did not know what country I came from. The prosecutrix had hold of his hand, and she had something in her hand - he was taking it from her. She said,</p>
               <p>"It is mine" - and he said it was his. She said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you take my part;" I said,</p>
               <p>"What do I know about it - how am I to know which is right." Well, he went behind her, took her under the arms, and dragged her round, but did not hurt her; he then took her bonnet, and set off; she said to me,</p>
               <p>"You are no man, or you would take a woman's part;" I said I should get into trouble if I did - I was sorry to see her ill-treated, but he was a man of more strength than me. Well, she grumbled at me and went on. I took up my things and went a few yards into the trees; she followed up to me. This young man came up, and she told him I would not take her part; then another man came up, and two or three more; they began to search me, and I said I should lose my money. Then they said,</p>
               <p>"Where is the woman's handkerchief or shawl?" They began to hawl my things over, and took hold of me. I said,</p>
               <p>"Let us go to the light." A sergeant came, and the girl said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a deserter - here is his jacket and waistcoat." Well, they determined to take me before a watchman, and met one, who said he would have nothing to do in it. They took me to the same public-house where I had enquired for a lodging, and the landlord and landlady both said I had been there about a lodging. I told them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030025"/>to search me there - they would not. At last they met another watchman, who took me in charge. The young man threatened me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You bl - y rogue, I will pay you;" I said I had injured nobody, and the innocent had nothing to fear. Well, they took me to a watch-house; several people bolted in after me - they laid very heavy charges against me, and called me a Methodist, and things of that sort. The beadle searched me at the watch-house, and found nothing on me but my money, which they counted before me, and said if I spoke a word they would strike and beat me. They locked me down stairs without a drop of water, and when the girl came to have her trial, she had another gown on.</p>

            . I am a harness-maker. I was about two yards behind the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner run down the passage - the watch was in his hand; I did not see him again till he was in the watch-house. I am positive of him by his dress - he had a fustian jacket and white apron tucked round him. When he ran down the passage, two young fellows ran up to him. There was a good gaslight.</p>

               <p>"It is not me, watchman, I am only running like the rest" - there were some people running before him. The prosecutor came up in a moment, and declared that he was the lad.</p>

He called for a pint of beer, and drank to the prisoner, and asked him to lend him a shilling, saying that he had no money; he lent him one. Then the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"Let us have six-penny worth of rum and water." Lowick was going to sleep - the prisoner held the rum and water to his mouth, and put some into his mouth, and the rest ran down his bosom, but he fell asleep directly. I then saw the prisoner put his right hand into Lowick's right-hand pocket, and turn all his money out, and put it on the table; he was going to count it, but seeing me look at him, he put it all into his own right-hand pocket, and kept asking Lowick to drink more; but he was so stupified, he could not answer him. I then saw him take his watch; he was going to put it in his own pocket, but I said,</p>
               <p>"Stop, that is not yours - you have robbed the man of his money before." I called the landlord, and wanted him to give the landlord the money and watch to keep for the prosecutor; he said I was a liar, and struck at me two or three times; he gave the watch to the landlord, but denied having the money. I sent for an officer. Betts came, and asked him what money he had in his pocket when he came from home; he said 7 s. or 7 s. 6 d., not more; and if he had more, it was not his. Betts found in his right-hand breeches pocket 14 s., four sixpences, and one penny. He said nothing; he was rather tipsy, but knew what he was about.</p>

               <p>"Good morning, it is a warm morning," and passed me - he was a stranger. I was alarmed, and went into the parlour and sat down for about three minutes, and do not know where he went. I told my husband, and then went into the yard and met him again at the top of the kitchen stairs, with these things in his hand - they had been left in the front kitchen - he was going out at the private door which leads into a court. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are a thief," and tried to catch hold of him; he pushed by me, and rushed into the court; I pursued him, calling Stop thief! and he was taken with the bundle in his hand. I am sure of his person - I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a brick-maker. I was a constable about five weeks ago - my time is now out. On the 10th of June I was in Newport-street, and saw the prisoners together at the bottom of that street. I had an umbrella over my head; they passed me and walked on; I crossed over - they walked side by side; I saw Grant with two or three accomplices at Mr. Byrne's pocket; he took a handkerchief from the pocket, and gave it to M'Carthy; I went up and laid hold of M'Carthy - he threw the handkerchief down, and while I was stooping to take it up, he hit me - I called Mr. Byrne, who claimed it. - Bradbury, who was with me, took Grant. I am sure of them.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India Company's service, at the tea warehouse in Cutler-street. On Saturday, the 18th of May, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and presented me a permit for four chests of tea, one of which was No. 8720 - he said he came from Mr. Goodey for a chest of tea, that he was his porter, and this one chest was wanted immediately to go into the country by a waggon, and that the carman was gone to the Docks, and would call for the other three on his return; I believed this account and delivered it to him; he took it away on his head. This was about half-past two o'clock. Goodey's carman called a quarter of an hour after, and wanted four chests; I told him one was delivered to their porter. I had told the prisoner to take the permit with him, to prevent its being seized - he said his order was to leave it with me. On Monday I saw him in custody. I am certain of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not know Mr. Goodey - A. No. I should not have delivered it unless he had produced the permit. I knew Goodey by name. The permit is obtained at the Permit-office. There is never any other document brought to me.</p>

On Monday, the 17th of June, I made a communication to Plank the officer, at Marlborough-street - and on Thursday morning the prisoner delivered an anonymous note into my hand - (looks at it) this is it, and the envelope; he said he had it from the cook - I told him he had been robbing me.</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. MEREDITH.</p>
               <p>"Sir, You are suspected of having robbed Messrs. Todd - the writer overheard a conversation between Mr. Todd and one of the Officers of Marlborough-street. One of the housemaids is also implicated."</p>
               <p>This letter was enclosed in an envelope, and directed</p>
               <p>"For the Cook."</p>
               <p>Mr. COPE. The cook is in the shop in the day-time, and sleeps in Castle-street; he said it came from Castle-street, from the area. I told him I was informed he was robbing me - and had appointed two men to come that day and the next with marked money, and I was sorry he had found it out so soon; but as he had I must send for an officer. I sent for Plank, and kept the prisoner in my presence. Plank searched his drawer and trunks - which we opened with his own key; and immediately that it opened, the prisoner took up two parcels and gave them to me - I was going to open them. One contained a piece of ribbon directed to Humphries; he said he had taken that himself down to his sister, that it would not do, and he brought it back; there was a paper inside it with a bill of parcels of his own making. When goods are sent from our house, the bill is made out by one person and examined by a second, and signed with his initials, and the date put to it. The other parcel contained six fans; he said he meant to take them to his sister, for he thought they would suit her trade. I asked if they were entered anywhere, and if any person besides himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030029"/>knew it? he said No - they were wrapt in separate papers; there was a paper with writing on it in the ribbon parcel, which appeared to be his own writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Todd and Co. carry on very extensive business in the City - A. Yes. Mr. Todd has no concern with the house in Oxford-street. I have heard since this, that the prisoner's sister keeps a small shop at Walton on Thames - and he told me three or four weeks before, that a parcel was for his sister at Walton. I did not find fault with him for selling her goods. I often send goods on approbation in town, but not in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Middleton of Tunbridge-wells - A. I understand he is a customer of mine - I received an order from him last week; it was addressed to Meredith. I ordered the goods to be sent.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner could have taken the things out of his box before he brought you the letter - A. Certainly. I have a boy named Wiggins, who has a relation at Walton; the prisoner asked leave for him to go to Walton one Sunday. The prisoner said the ribbon was sent to his sister for a club, but not being the colour, he brought it back himself, and had forgotten to put it back.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What was the parcel which you knew went to his sister - A. Four parasols. All goods which go out should be entered by the clerk.</p>

            . My parents live at Walton; I dined there on Whit-Sunday. On the 26th of May, I brought one parcel from the prisoner's sister; it contained Norwich crape - her name is Humphries. I had strict orders to keep it from Mr. Cope, or any of the young men; but to return it to him as a secret. I gave it to him on Sunday evening, and told him next day in the shop, that it was spotted, and therefore returned. I have brought nothing else from his sister's.</p>

On the 1st of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I was going home, and passed the prisoner Nicholls in Norton-falgate, about a quarter-past one o'clock - I had my recollection about me - I was not at all intoxicated; Nicholls overtook me in Shoreditch, and asked me to go home with her; I refused, and gave her a shilling to go away, but she would not; she followed me all the way down Kingsland-road; she took my arm.

I did not push her away when she spoke to me - for I was afraid, for I saw two men in Shoreditch, who I thought belonged to her; she still kept hold of my arm; the first watchman I came to I asked to see me to the next box - I did not tell him I suspected the prisoner, as I understood he was a private watchman, and could not go; she kept laying hold of my arm. I sat down on the step of a public-house to rest; she sat down on the step also. I did not see the other two men after leaving Shoreditch; I fell into a dose; I only had two or three glasses of beer and a pint of porter; when I awoke, I found it was just three o'clock; she was gone then.

            . I am in the silk business, and live in Spital-square. I was passing by Mr. Richards's between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner and two other boys looking at this dress - the biggest boy jumped up and pulled it down, and gave it to the prisoner, who ran down the street with it under his arm. I was fetched to the watch-house next morning, and found the prisoner there. I am certain of him - I kept him in sight a long time.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner on the evening of the 17th of June, about half past eight o'clock, from the description Mr. Young gave me. I found nothing on him. I was surrounded and ill-used in taking him - it was in a house in Spital-fields, kept by one Levy, where a number of these boys live.</p>

I found these things in the basket, with some lettuces - he said he bought them all together for two pots of beer.</p>

            . I am a fisherman, and live next door to Westbrook, and Stroud lives next door to him. On the night of the 1st of June, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was awoke by a noise - I opened the window, looked out, and saw Westbrook in his yard, within about a yard of his own door; it was moon-light - I said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo! Thomas, what are you up to now?" he made no answer, but put himself against his back door, as if to hide himself, and in five or ten minutes returned, and I heard him say,</p>
               <p>"D - n it, it won't do, Tom, for Barrenger has opened his window, and seen me." Stroud was at that time up in Mr. Broxholm's loft. I heard a trampling on the sticks. He picked up something, and threw it into the loft window - I then saw Stroud come out of the loft window. I am positive of him, and believe Westbrook to be the other man, but will not swear to him. The man was in his yard, but his brother lodges with him, and they are nearly alike. Next morning Mr. Broxholm called on me; I would not tell him anything about it, as I was afraid of my life. I have a doubt whether it was Westbrook; he spoke very low, I could not distinguish his voice. I am certain of Stroud.</p>

I had just put a five shilling piece in the till, and there were some shillings there; I returned to the bar in about a minute, and saw his hand in the till - and saw some money in his hand. I knocked him on the wrist, and the five shilling piece fell from his hand into the till; I said,</p>

I called my father, and then he let me have the shilling out of his hand. I asked what he was doing at the till - he said he was looking for bad money; my father let him go away, and in about a quarter of an hour had him taken up; he is a constable himself.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Luke's. On the 5th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner going down Golden-lane with the copper on his head; I followed him into a marine store shop in Playhouse-yard with it, and asked where he got it; he said he knew nothing at all about it. I asked the woman of the shop if it was hers - she hesitated a long while, and wanted to fetch her husband. I said I would have an answer; and at last she said it did. I told her to be very careful what she was about, as she knew me - her name is Hulmer; she then said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you the truth, it does not." I took the prisoner to the watch-house, and found the padlock in his coat pocket; he said he picked it up a morning or two ago, but did not say where. I found two keys and a knife on him, which appear to have been used at brickwork; and in his inner coat pocket I found a skeleton key. We advertised and found out Mr. Gough.</p>

On the 5th of June, at seven o'clock at night, the prisoner came into a pawnbroker's shop in Gray's Inn-lane, where I was, with a plough in one hand and a coat in the other - he wanted to pawn the plough. I asked how he came by it - he said it was his own, and ran out, fell down, and I caught him. I found a letter in the coat, directed to Morgan; he appeared distressed.</p>

On the 27th of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and bought some net, which came to 4 s.; she then asked to see some muslin, which I shewed her. A lady came in at the time, which took off my attention, as I was the only person in the shop. I observed her putting her hand into her pocket in a flurry. I shewed her the muslin, and called down one of the men to fetch Mr. Veall from the other shop. The prisoner said she could not wait, and would call again about the muslin; she paid for the net, which I gave her in a paper, and as she went out I called her. She said she could not stop - I went and brought her back, and told her I suspected she had some net which did not belong to her (there was a box on the counter with remnants in it) - she said she was certain she had not, and would take her oath of it; she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out two handkerchiefs, and in the middle of one I just saw the end of the lace - it was on a small roller on the counter - she then said she had taken it up by mistake.</p>

On the 7th of June, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's apartments, and heard him sawing up one of the sashes - I knocked at the door - he put it away before he let me in; it was an old sash, with the glass in it; and in his work bench I found the skeleton keys. I found the wood-work of some more sashes there. I took him to the Office - could find no owner, and he was discharged. I afterwards compared the sash to one of Mr. Tanner's houses - it fitted exactly, and two holes in it corresponded with the fellow sash which was left in. On the 19th of June I took him again; he had then removed to Broad-yard, Golden-lane; he at first said he got the sash from his master, in Shoreditch.</p>

I do not know what he said to my mistress's sister when he brought it back, but before he said he knew nothing of it. He was apprehended next morning when he came to the house. I had urged him to return it, if he had it, and said if he had pawned it I would redeem it; he said he had made enquiry about it, and in about twenty minutes he came and said,</p>

               <p>"Mary, will you stand my friend?" - he said it was pawned for 7 s., and I advanced him 7 s. 6 d. to get it.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the 12th of June, about three o'clock, I was in John-street, and saw the prisoner and another boy; they passed me, and looked back. I suspected the prisoner had something in his apron, and followed them; the other touched him on the shoulder, and they ran off into Flying Horse-yard; I laid hold of the prisoner with this soap. He said his mother gave it him, and he was going to take it to her again - he threw it all down; I gathered it up, put it in my pocket, and took him to the watch-house. I went in the direction he had come, and found out Morris.</p>

            , who lives in the Edgware-road. On the 1st of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I left the kitchen a few minutes, and on my return saw the prisoner come from the closet where this mug is kept - I asked what he did there; he turned, and asked if Mr. Jones lived there, and as he went up the area steps I saw the mug under his coat - I had put it in the closet a few minutes before. I alarmed the painters who were at work, but they could not overtake him. I am certain he is the man. I observed his face and dress. The mug has not been found; he had a brown coat and trowsers, and a leather apron on.</p>

I asked if he knew anybody in Gower-street; he said No. I then asked if he knew any one in Francis-street; he said No; he said he was a linen-draper from Newport Pannel. I asked him if he could refer me to anybody who knew him; he said he could, and asked me what made me put so many questions to him; I said I was looking for a person, and he seemed to answer the description - and asked if he would walk to a person who would give an account of him. As he was not willing to go, I asked if he would walk with me to Francis-street, and that would satisfy my suspicious; he came out to go, and went with me through Queen-square, and going through the passage into Southampton-street, he asked if I was an officer. I said Yes - he said he thought he knew my business; I said,</p>

            , is it not?" he said Yes; and he supposed it was about the wax candles - and asked where Bradshaw was; I said in custody - he said he was sorry for it. I told him to be cautious what he said; he told me that he was in Rhodes's-fields, where they were making hay, and two men came up to him heavily laden, and said they had some goods to dispose of, if he would buy them, as they were in want of money; he found they were candles - they asked 5 l. for them; he offered them 2 l., and gave it them; that they said they had brought them from Northampton.</p>

            . I am an Excise-officer; my office is on the first floor of Bradshaw's house. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 25th of May, I was called out of my office by Bradshaw. I went into the parlour and saw Valentine. Bradshaw said he was buying candles of Valentine, and wished me to write the receipt for him; he gave me a stamp. I then asked Valentine if he sold the candles for himself, or for anybody else; he said not for himself, but for

I handed the receipt to Valentine to sign, which he did, and I went away.</p>

On the 25th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030043"/>May, Pain came about this; I went to Stevens's shop in Tottenham-court-road, and found some candles; in consequence of what he said, we went to Bradshaw's, and found one hundred and thirty-two pounds of candles there; there was a number of papers laying about; he gave up the candles immediately, with the receipt; and said he bought them of a young man who was then in the parlour.

I told him they were very old and stale. I consulted my uncle, and told him he ought not to give more than 2 s., for I would only give him 2 s. 2 d.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police. On the 22d of June, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house in Sharp's-buildings, Aldgate, and saw him - I produced my warrant to search his house; he accompanied me - I went into the cellar a second time with him, and found some boards standing up; I desired them to be removed, and behind them I found pieces of a tea chest cut up; and in the coal cellar I found the remainder of a chest - I said,</p>
               <p>"This appears to be a tea chest, and fresh cut up;" he said he bought it of a man at the door the day before, and had it cut up. He had before this asked me what I came for - I did not tell him then, but when I found this, I said I came to find a chest of tea, and having found the chest, I supposed I should soon find the tea. I then went into the kitchen, and, on opening the door of the water closet, I found the seat wet, which was not so shortly before, as I had been in; I lifted up the lid, and there found the tea on the soil, all loose. I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you say to this? Here is the tea? How did you get it?" He said,</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of it." His wife was there, and said it might all have been avoided; he told her to hold her tongue. I have picked out pieces of the chest which had marks on them.</p>

In January last, the male prisoner took a front room on my first floor, furnished, at 5 s. a week - his wife came with him; they stopped about two months; he was away a good deal in the day-time. They left the room on a Monday, and owed me a month's rent - they gave no notice - I examined the room about two hours after, and missed a blanket; also some of the feathers were taken from the bed, and the hole sewn up with cotton. I cannot say how many are gone. They were taken up in June.</p>

On Friday, about half-past nine o'clock, they went up stairs as if to go to bed, and twenty minutes after I found they were gone. I missed two watches and a table spoon - the watches hung up in a glass cupboard, in a room on the ground floor - I missed the shirts from a drawer. I pursued them in a cart to Barnet, and described them to the patrol - next day I found them in custody at Barnet, with all the things except one watch.</p>

The prisoner came and asked for a job for his father; I said I wanted him to make an apron - I gave him a dashing iron and leather to cover it, to take to his father, to line the iron with. I expected he would bring it back. Next morning Hughes came to me; I went with him to the watch-house, and found the prisoner and iron; he directed me to Half-moon-alley, in Bishopsgate-street, where I found the leather. I had given them to him about the middle of the day. I believe his father does not pay proper attention to him.</p>

            . I live in Miller's-buildings, Stepney-fields. On the 10th of June, I sent my child to school with her beads on; she is five years and nine months old. The school is seven or eight doors off; she came home at twelve o'clock. I heard her knock at the door - I was opening it, and heard her call out violently,</p>
               <p>"My beads, my beads! a boy has stolen them and run away." I had a baby in my arms; I put it down, and ran out, and saw the prisoner about twenty yards from the door, running in a field; a woman stopped him; I came up - he said he stopped to take up a piece of rag by the child, but did not take the beads. I saw the necklace found in the field - a great many boys came round, and rescued him from me; but Scales stopped him.</p>

            . My father keeps the Arrow, public-house, at Stratford. On the 25th of March, at about one o'clock in the morning, I was returning from the Adelphi Theatre with Murrell - Metcalf laid hold of us by the collar in Gray's Inn-lane, and producing a staff to Murrell, wished to know what he had about him. Murrell asked his reason for it - Metcalf then collared me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let us see what you have got, young fellow;" - he took us into the Peacock, public-house; he called Poole across the way to him by the name of Jack; then Metcalf took a handkerchief out of my side pocket; he also took two from Murrell's pocket and one from his hat - this was in the Peacock, behind the bar; Pool stood by his side. He then asked me to have something to drink; I said I did not care, and a shilling's worth of shrub was called for, which I paid for. Then Metcalf tied our hands together, and took us as far as Hatton-garden. Both I and Murrell had told him where they could find us - this was in the street - they untied our hands. We then went down somewhere to see if there was a house open, to have something more to drink, and none being open, they took us back to the Peacock, where we had six-pennyworth more liquor, which I paid for - Some females were there, who had walked behind us all the way as their companions. Metcalf asked what they would take to drink - they said some porter; the landlord said he could not draw it, for he wanted to shut up, but they might take some in a can with them; half a gallon was drawn, which I paid for, and Metcalf carried the can to a house in Charlotte-buildings, where the women accompanied us. Poole and the two females sat down on the bed, and told us to sit down too - we did, on a chair. We kept drinking the porter for about half an hour - Murrell kept saying he wanted to go home. The girls stopped behind, and the prisoners said they would see us part of the way - they came down as far as Fleet-market with us.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen did you pass in the way - A. I do not know. They wished us Good night, and returned up towards Smithfield, and we went towards Snow-hill. I did not ask for the handkerchief. Poole told me to come next day to No. 10, Duke's-court, Clerkenwell, for them. I wished to get home, so I did not ask for it. I thought he meant to steal it - he gave us a false direction. I have seen my handkerchief since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you complain to any officer - A. No, not till three months after.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 16th of June, about half-past five o'clock, I was coming up Wardour-street, and saw Harris in company with another person, (not Stevenson) standing against the house in Holland-street. I passed down Wardour-street; Harris came to the corner and watched me. I went to St. Ann's watch-house, and got assistance. I returned in ten minutes with Foxhall and another; and in Berwick-street we saw Stevenson with this pipe on his shoulder, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030048"/>water running from it; he saw us, and went down Maidenhead-passage; we went round and stopped him in Hopkins-court, with it. We asked where he got it - he made no answer. I locked him in the watch-house, and returned to the house, and found the door open. I left Foxhall in charge, while I fetched another officer. The door appeared to have been opened by a chisel; we found part of the lead stolen from the roof of the house, and the pipe gone. The prisoner had fifty-five pounds of pipe, which we compared, and it fitted in every respect, and must have come from that house. The water was all running about the place; Harris came next morning and brought Stevenson his breakfast. I said I had seen him against the house, and suspected he was concerned. I had seen them together before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is Gook here - A. No. There is a warrant out against him by Mr. Parkins; he knows more than any officer in the job. It was half-past five o'clock when I saw Harris. I have seen him with pick pockets before. It was Sunday morning, and I was taking a walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you frequently go out to seek what you call a job - A. No. Stevenson said he knew where he got the lead from.</p>

Bidgood applied to me on Sunday morning; I accompanied him, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, round Berwick-street, and saw Stevenson with the lead pipe on his shoulder, and an apron round it, and the water running down his back; we went round Hopkins-court, and stopped him with it; he went down Maidenhead-passage; we took him to the watch-house. We then went to No. 7, Holland-street, and found the door ajar, wrenched by some instrument; the pipe had been taken from the passage running from the kitchen to the area; we fitted the pipe to the place, and a piece left in the wall fitted it; it weighed fifty six pounds. Bidgood asked him where he got it; he made no answer. He (Bidgood) then said, he dare say it came from No. 7, Holland-street; he said he knew where it came from.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was a quarter past five o'clock - A. I am, for I was getting up, as I had lost the use of my limbs, and was advised to walk in the Park. We had locked the door at night, and kept the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was he taken up - A. Next morning. He sleeps on our second floor, and we in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take particular notice of the time - A. I had some doctor's stuff to take every two hours, and was to take it at five o'clock, and I noticed the clock which is in our room, as I wanted to see how far I could walk, and promised to be in at seven o'clock; I got home by a quarter past seven.

               <p>Q. How came you to walk two hours with this bad foot - A. The doctor ordered exercise. I used to sit down in the Park.</p>
