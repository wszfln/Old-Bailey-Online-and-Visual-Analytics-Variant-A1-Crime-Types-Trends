                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, and a Director of the Deposit and General Life Assurance Company—that Company was esta<lb/>blished in the year 1851, I think, but we did not do business before the summer of 1852—the prisoner was appointed secretary to the Company about Aug., 1852, at a salary of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I frequently attended the meetings of the Board, as frequently as I possibly could—it was the pri<lb/>soner's duty always to attend the Board—if he stated that money was required to pay any particular account, the course was for him to prepare a cheque, which was signed by the Board, and given to him to countersign, and give to the party to whom it was to be paid—up to July, 1854, we had no doubt whatever as to the prisoner's honesty—we signed cheques upon his statement that they were required—we did not rely upon his statement; he produced accounts showing that such cheques were required—the course of business is this: there is a committee of Directors, called the General Purposes Committee; that committee met the day before the Board; the secretary laid before the committee any accounts for which he required payments; if they were approved by the committee, the cheques were prepared ready for the Board the following day, and were generally signed by the Board without much discussion at the Board; when signed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020002"/>
               <p>they were given to the secretary for his counter signature, and to be given to the parties—we had two bankers, Messrs. Hopkinson and the Com<lb/>mercial Bank—the prisoner's private banker was the London and County Bank—until the examination before the Alderman, I had no knowledge whatever of the minute about paying money in to his own banker's—that minute was on 15th Sept., 1853, during the long vacation, so that I was pro<lb/>bably out of town at the time—on 22nd July, 1854, circumstances had come to my knowledge which led me to believe that certain cheques which he had had, had not gone in the course intended—spoke to the prisoner about those cheques, and one other cheque for 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which should have gone to Birmingham—the result of it was this, that I saw there had been some great irregularity in the matter, and I wrote, or caused to be written, a letter to the Company for whom those cheques were intended, and told him that if the reply to that letter should be of the character I expected, and which would show that the cheques had not been properly appro<lb/>priated, I should feel it my duty to propose his dismissal, unless he rendered it unnecessary by resigning—he ultimately threw himself upon our mercy, and resigned—he gave in a written resignation—at that time I was not aware that he had done other than appropriated our money; I knew of nothing wrong but those particular transactions which I alluded to there—I did not in the least suspect him of dishonesty at that time; I thought it was mere irregularity; I thought he had done wrong, but I never suspected his honesty—I thought, in fact, that he had temporarily used our cheque with the intention of repaying it, without retaining it—his wife and family resided in the upper part of the house—he was allowed to remain on the premises for some little time—I have no recollection of a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being given to him—I know nothing personally about the cheques in question, unless it should appear by the minutes that I was present when they were signed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) this is the prisoners handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was from Bevan to Thomas, dated July</hi> 1, 1854, <hi rend="italic">in which the following passage occurred</hi>:—"Dr. Crocker will have a cheque next week for his fees without fail")</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did he come into your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About July or Aug., 1852, I think it was—in July last, I had a con<lb/>versation with, him about some cheques for 201<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think the prisoner was tried for stealing those cheques at the last Session; he was acquitted—I gave evidence against him in reference to those three cheques—I was examined for about two hours—when Mr. Bevan joined the Company, we had about two policies; by his exertions he raised the business to about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was to a considerable degree owing to his exertions—I give him great credit for his industry and zeal, I wish him to have the advantage of everything—our increase was made to appear 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not myself believe it ever was that—I believe that statement was publicly made, but it turned out not to be correct—statements of that kind are necessarily made from the information of our officers—I take as much trouble as I can to see that we make accurate statements to the public, but I do not go through the books, and compare every particular figure—we believed the statements made to us by the prisoner to be correct, and acted upon them—we had other clerks, but everybody was under his supervision; not everything, but all the clerks were—our accounts are audited before they are published, by the regular auditors of the Company; they have access to the vouchers, books, and other documents—it is their duty to act faithfully—I do not recollect the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020003"/>
               <p>particular statement of the income of the Company being upwards of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe there has been some such statement (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this is one of our reports—I believed it was true according to the books—Mr. Bevan has been publicly thanked by the Directors for his exertions—it was his duty to make excursions to provincial towns when he was sent, to establish branches—on those journeys considerable expenses were incurred, which were always paid to him by us on his return—I do not believe he used constantly to advance money for those purposes—he had a cheque before he went if he wanted it—I do not believe that in repeated instances he has not been paid amounts of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until he returned—I think we have now eight Directors—I have seen three Directors here to-day besides myself—they all take an active part in the Company—no one always attends, but all attend—Mr. Knox, the accountant, is a cousin of Mr. Knox, the Director—he went into the matter with the prisoner by the direction of the Board; that was in July or Aug., very soon after Mr. Bevan was dismissed—I believe after he left our Company, he became Secretary to another Company; the Universal Provident—I do not think he was Secretary to that Company at the time we got a warrant for his apprehension—I remember observing that his name disappeared from the Company's advertisements, and I attributed it to the fact of his going through the Insolvent Court—he had been Secretary, I think, not for so long as six months—I do not know when he became Secretary; his name first appeared as a Director—we never communicated his defalcations to that Company—they never made any inquiry of us—Mr. Neison, our Actuary, did not give him a character, to my knowledge—I thought it a most remarkable thing that no application was made to us—I did not know that the prisoner was constantly in the habit of paying cheques that were drawn by the Board into his own banker's, and drawing cheques on his own bankers for the purposes of the Company—I had not the slightest suspicion of it, until a bundle of cheques were put into my hands at the examination at Guildhall—Mr. Knox, the accountant, has since investigated the prisoner's banking account, and I have seen the results; I have not a copy of it—those investigations have been rendered necessary in consequence of what occurred at Guildhall; I believe it was in consequence of the cheques you put into my hand—I have on one occasion been paid my fees as a Director by a cheque of the prisoner's—a cheque was drawn for a larger amount—I do not know that he paid that cheque into his banker's; he gave me a cheque of his own for my fees; I took it—I think it is very probable that other Directors did the same—I was a member of the Finance Committee—I did not audit the accounts; they were audited by the Auditors—the accounts were only audited periodically; once a year, I think—I do not think the number of cheques issued was examined with the vouchers—the cash book is here—the banker's pass book was produced at each meeting, for the purpose of seeing what the balance at our bankers was—Mr. Barnes was Chairman of the Finance Committee—I do not think he invariably signed the cash book, "Examined, and found correct"—I did not trouble my head upon that particular point—we had the banker's book before us, to see what he had received and paid during the month—we sat once a month—if a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to pay an individual, at the proper time for auditing the accounts the voucher would be forthcoming, or would be inquired for; we do not want vouchers every week—we did not leave he distribution of all the cheques we gave, entirely to the discretion and judgment of the prisoner—if a cheque was drawn for A, it was given to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020004"/>
               <p>him to pay to A—the expression which the prisoner used at the interview in July was, "I admit there have been great irregularities in that particular transaction, "not" in the accounts"—it referred to the transactions with the Home Counties' Assurance Company—he did not say that he might have been guilty of irregularity in the accounts, but he never had any intention of defrauding the Company—he said there had been irregu<lb/>larity in the particular transaction, but he had no intention of defrauding the Company, and I believed him at the time—I was most reluctant to think him dishonest—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is Mr. Poole's writing; he is a Director—I did not see it, or know of its being written, at the time—I never saw it before—I know nothing about it—all letters written by the Company are, or ought to be, copied into a letter book—if Mr. Poole, a Director, had written a letter by the authority of the Company, it would appear in the letter book in the ordinary course—I should presume from this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) that the cheque for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was discovered in Aug.—I know that Mr. Bevan has gone to Birmingham, and limerick, and Dublin, on the business of the Company, but I cannot say at what date—I do not know that on that occasion no money was paid to him for his expenses until he returned—he has never to my knowledge drawn cheques upon his own bankers for his expenses, and been reimbursed by the Company—a good deal of the business was necessarily left in the prisoner's hands—the Board only met once a week, and business must be attended to—I frequently found fault with him for extravagance in his expenses—I remember a dinner being given by the Company; it was very much against my will—I do not think it cost upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it cost a great deal more than it ought, but it is only fair to say that it was done at the prisoner's instigation—I dined there—I think it was a mistake, that is all I say about it—I did not know of any cheque drawn by the prisoner on his own account for expenses at Dublin—I am sure he never drew any by our authority—we opposed Mr. Bevan in the Insolvent Court—I have been told that his petition was defeated on the ground that he had not properly described himself—I was not present—I think we first consulted Mr. Hobler about Aug. or Sept. last year—I have no knowledge of any applica<lb/>tion being made by Mr. Knox to the prisoner, that he should put an advertisement in the paper, stating that the sole cause of his resignation was his having obtained a superior appointment—I have heard of it—Mr. Knox had communication with him, to my knowledge, and with the know<lb/>ledge of the Board—Mr. Knox knew something of Mr. Bevan's family—I do not think that the furniture which the prisoner left behind was worth much—a cheque was given to him upon his representation that he had not a penny to go away with; and we allowed Mrs. Bevan to take away her piano, and anything that she said was hers—I believe she is a lady of the highest respectability—she has been living with her father; he is a person of respectability and means—the only transaction between Mr. Neison and Mr. Bevan that I knew of, was the one which I told you of on the former occasion, the prisoner stated to us that Mr. Neison owed him money, and he gave us an order upon Mr. Neison for 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he said Mr. Neison owed him—when he left he said he was anxious to make all the reparation in his power, and admitting he owed us a great deal of money, he gave us among other things an order on Mr. Neison to pay us a certain sum of money, which he said he owed him—I know nothing of the prisoner advancing money to Mr. Coode, a Director, except from his own statement—he said so; I have not made inquiries as to the truth of it—I do not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020005"/>
               <p>know whether Mr. Coode is here—he ceased to be a Director long before Mr. Bevan resigned—immediately after the prisoner passed through the Insolvent Court, he brought an action against the Company for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I believe he issued a writ on the very day he was discharged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bo you know that instructions were given to oppose Mr. Bevan in the Insolvent Court on the ground of fraud? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—at the time the prisoner gave the order on Mr. Neison, he did not say anything about any travelling expenses that we owed him—at the time he threw himself on our mercy, he did not say a single syllable about travelling ex<lb/>penses; I believe it was entirely an after thought—I never heard of it until some months afterwards, when he brought in that statement to Mr. Knox—there was only one instance in which my fees were paid by the pri<lb/>soner's cheque; one large cheque was drawn for the fees of the Directors in the aggregate—I have reason to believe that the prisoner paid that cheque into his banker's, and subdivided it, and gave his own cheques—I think the cheque given to me was in Nov., 1853—1 know it was given to me when I paid my premium; I gave him my cheque, and took his—I have been told that the larger cheque was drawn in June, 1853; I do not know the—we discovered that the date of the receipt for the 207<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque was very consider<lb/>ably subsequent to the date of the cheque, and that the cheque itself had gone in a channel in which it ought not to have gone in the ordinary way—I did not know that that cheque had been appropriated towards the prisoner's purposes, and that the subsequent payment was by a cheque of ours; I can<lb/>not tell when it was I learnt that; it was afterwards, when the agents account came in; it might have been two or three months afterwards—the other two charges related to the Home Counties—I found there were irre<lb/>gularities with regard to them on 22nd July; we found then that they had been misappropriated—the cheques for the Home Counties were drawn to pay money that was due to them, and we found out in July that those cheques had gone away, and we had not the receipts—I found that subsequently money had been paid to the Home Counties, to the amount of those cheques—the accounts were made up from the books, as they were presented by Mr. Bevan—there was no other means of judging of the accuracy of the accounts, except by comparing the books with the vouchers—if an account appeared in the book showing a certain amount due to Dr. Crocker, and a receipt was produced for that precise sum; it would, of course, be taken that they balanced one another—we have no means of testing the truth, except by writing to every individual; the receipt is a sufficient voucher—from the production of the receipt the Auditor would believe that the amount had been paid—we should have no means of discovering any fraud, unless we suspected anything—there was no suspicion at the time these accounts were audited.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Bristol. I was agent for the Deposit Company there—my business was originally that of an accountant; I became agent for the Company first in Nov., 1852, at Cardiff, and in Sept, 1853, I was their agent at Bristol—I know Dr. Crocker; he was the Com<lb/>pany's medical officer at Bristol—I do not remember whether his account for sixteen guineas was delivered to me; if I did receive it, I sent it up to the Company—there was an account of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of his; I do not recol<lb/>lect whether I sent that up—on 25th March, 1854, I was in town—I went to the Company's premises in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, and saw Mr. Bevan there—Mr. Bevan said as I was in London, I might as well sign a receipt for Dr. Crocker's fees, and a cheque should be sent for them; I think this was in the morning (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this is my signature; it is dated 25th March, 1854—(<hi rend="italic">read: "</hi> Received from the Deposit and General Life Assurance Company the sum of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. being the amount of Dr. Crocker's account for medical fees up to and inclusive of 27th Feb., 1854, as per bill")—I signed that in consequence of the prisoner's assurance that the cheque should be sent down—Dr. Crocker has been paid subsequently, and Dr. M'Dermott also; he has no claim on the Company—Dr. Crocker sued the Company for the balance—the cheque was never sent to me, nor the money—I frequently in my letters to Mr. Bevan requested a cheque to be sent—these letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>) are my writing—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. George Knox stated that these letters were found among the papers at the Company's office</hi>)—I have no doubt that I received a letter from the prisoner on 1st July, 1854—I have it here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I have to say that I am in litigation with the Com<lb/>pany, and it contains some matters—I have not been examined by either party, and I do not know the business I am called upon; it may be produc<lb/>tive of mischief to me in another case—it is a letter from the prisoner about Dr. Crocker's fees—these letters are my writing—I think I was in town in April, at the general meeting—it is more than probable that I was in town on 7th June, 1854; I was in town very often—I signed the receipt for Dr. M'Dermott's fees, seventeen guineas—the body of the cheque is tilled up by a clerk, Mr. Kendall; the date of it is 7th June, 1854—I signed that at Mr. Bevan's instance—I believe a similar remark was made that a cheque should be sent to Dr. M'Dermott; I never heard anything more about it—I did not trouble further—it is very likely that I spoke to him on that occasion about the other cheque that had not been sent; I cannot charge my memory with it, it is so long since—I frequently mentioned it in my letters to Mr. Bevan, because I was in daily contact with Dr. Crocker, and I knew that he had not received his cheque—I believe the letters I wrote were referred to on 7th June.</p>

               <p>to that I had never known him—I have not brought my account books with me, relating to the money I received from time to time—something was stated upon the endorsement on the subpoena about bringing them—I did not bring them, because I do not see why I should; it was simply a request that I would, "Will you be kind enough to bring all papers and books with you?"—I have not got the subpoena with me—yes, here is the subpoena; it says, "Will you be good enough?"—I have not brought them; I have left them at home—Mr. Bevan always paid me moneys on account of the Company by his own cheques; I think I had not more than three or four cheques of the Company's in my life—I was in town on 25th March—I received from him at that time two pieces of paper—I afterwards received two sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon those pieces of paper—that was a private transaction between Mr. Bevan and myself—I paid the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to a Mr. Cody, of Bath, to whom I owed something for furniture, and the other for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid into my own banker's—it is very likely that I have received other pieces of paper of the same kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember in April, 1854, receiving any money in any way through Mr. Bevan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot remember the dates, I have not the books with me—the cheques he paid me I paid into my banker's, and drew upon them, they had nothing to do with the Company; it was a private transaction between Mr. Bevan and myself—I gave him my draft at a month, I think for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and allowed him to receive my salary quarterly—it was an accommodation to me of course, he lent me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave him a bill for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a month, and allowed him to receive my salary by the quarter; he charged me no interest—no reference was made to the cheque for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at that time, that I am aware of—I could not permit him to retain a cheque that was not my own—I do not believe that passed, I have no recollection of anything of the kind; I will not swear positively—I cannot remember it—I believe I have not received a sum of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bankers at Bristol, in exchange for any piece of paper—I know Stuckey and Co., bankers, of Bristol—Mr. Bevan sent me down a draft of his at six weeks, for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when he was in difficulties, and asked me to discount it—I did not receive that money—I swear that, the bill was never discounted—I swear that I have never received value for that bill—I know the handwriting of some portion of the firm of Stuckey and Co. (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I have no, doubt this is the writing of one of the clerks; I do not know the hand<lb/>writing, it has evidently gone through the post—I swear I have never received value to the amount of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Stuckey and Co., in reference to that draft; it was never discounted—I have a claim against the Company—the Company have never sought to saddle me with this 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or the seventeen guineas—I signed a receipt for the seventeen guineas—I Went with Mr. Bevan and Mr. Perks to limerick and Dublin—Mr. Perks tells me that he has got a claim against the Company—both his claims and mine have been referred—the same attorney is acting for us—Mr. Perks was exa<lb/>mined here on the last trial—I went with Mr. Bevan to Dublin, and some other places—those excursions were attended with considerable expense—at Oldham, particularly, a large meeting was held there; we were then travelling on behalf of the Company—Mr. Bevan paid my expenses—he paid all the expenses—I know that he paid his own cheque at Oldham; I cannot remem<lb/>ber the amount, I simply charged my travelling expenses—my train hire I paid myself, but the tavern expenses were all paid by Mr. Bevan (<hi rend="italic">looking at some cheques</hi>)—I know a cheque was paid to the waiter at the Palatine Hotel, by Mr. Bevan, I saw it paid for the expenses—I was at Ham's Royal</p>

               <p>Hotel, at Bristol, when Mr. Princeps and Mr. Coode were there, I was in<lb/>vited there by them, they were Directors of the Company—Mr. Princeps's son was there, and Mrs. Coode; Mr. Bevan paid the whole account—I think it was in September, 1853—I think the bill was shown to me—I do not remember whether I saw any of the Directors when I came up to town after Mr. Bevan's resignation—I saw Mr. Cracknell at Bristol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any one of the Directors ever tell you that Mr. Bevan had resigned in a pet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; something of that kind was said—it was one of the Direc<lb/>tors said so distinctly; I do not remember which it was—I was never re<lb/>quested by any of the Directors to hush up the matter of Bevan's resig<lb/>nation—I do not remember anything being said to me about keeping quiet, I had to do with Mr. Bevan, not with the Directors.</p>

               <p>with the Board to prevent any criminal proceedings being taken against him—I told him that I felt certain if we did so, he would go on in the same reckless way he had done since he sent in his resignation, to injure the Com<lb/>pany—he assured me that he would not do so, and in order to make that assurance more certain, he signed on the second occasion a document in which he admitted his appropriation of the moneys of the Company; and stated, I think, that he would make good the deficiencies whenever he could, or, so soon as he could—that was on the assurance that all the defalcations were then known, and in fact appeared on the face of the cash book itself, with the exception of a few additional items that were not in the cash book; and upon the assurance that there were no deficiencies connected with our agencies, and further that he would do nothing to injure the Company—I said that if I found there were other defalcations than those that were known, or if he attempted to take our agents, or injure the Company in any way, I should consider my pledge not to use the document free; within a week afterwards an advertisement appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, signed by Mr. Bevan, which evidently was intended to injure the Company in my view of it; the reading of it to me at all events was, that he had left the Company for some reason connected with the Company, not connected with himself—I told his wife that I felt free from the engagement I had given to Mr. Bevan, and that I should certainly now advise the Company to take pro<lb/>eeedings against him—in consequence of that he called upon me again, and Assured me that the advertisement was not so intended, and stated that he would put in an advertisement that would remove that effect from the leading of it, and upon that occasion I did sketch out an advertisement for him to insert in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, merely stating that having obtained a superior appointment, he had resigned his situation to the Deposit Com<lb/>pany—it did not state that he had left for no other cause—I stated this at the last trial—I have not got the advertisement here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-terrace, West<lb/>green, Tottenham. The prisoner was in my service for three months—I discharged her on Sunday night, 24th June, for stopping out after time—I had told her I should not allow her to come into my house—I had warned her about it on two previous occasions—she left with an order from me to return the next day for her box and money—she did not come till Tuesday morning, imme<lb/>diately after I had gone out—I had left orders that her box should not be given to her, nor should she be paid till she came in the evening and saw me—I had called at the station, and a policeman came to my house—the prisoner came about 7 o'clock in the evening, and I told her that some one had been robbing me, and I was anxious that she should be perfectly clear, and if she would allow me to see her box I could give her a character—I asked her if she had any objection to have her box searched—she said she had no reason against having her box searched, but, on the contrary, I was welcome to search her box, there was nothing in it—I told the other servant to call the policeman, and he came and went up stairs with me and the prisoner to search</p>

               <p>her box—she opened her box herself, and turned out a number of things, and endeavoured to secrete those things belonging to me under her dress—we found a towel marked with my name, and two handkerchiefs belonging to my wife, with her mark on them, and a number of other things, my pro<lb/>perty, with no mark—I gave her in charge—some starch was found, which she placed under her shawl—when she was requested to stand up and shake herself, these things fell—the towel and handkerchief appeared to be my property—I said, "There is no doubt now, Delaney, who has been robbing me, and I have no alternative, in justice to society and myself, but to give you into charge"—I cannot recollect anything that she said—she brought back a petticoat of her mistress's that she stated she had been wearing—she stated something afterwards at the police court about the towel and handkerchiefs—she might say something to my wife about the towel and handkerchiefs when we found them, but nothing that I recollect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal porter, in the service of Lee and Company, who trade under the name of the North London Coal Depdt—the depot runs along the railway about 200 yards, along the Kingaland station—some palings run along the top of the embankment—I know the prisoner, and have driven him off the line before—last Thursday evening, at a few minutes past 6 o'clock, I was on the line, walking towards the station, and saw the prisoner creep under the palings from outside, and as I walked towards him, he walked underneath a stage, picked up this iron chair (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and laid it on the rail; a train was passing me at the time—he then turned back again—I was about seventy yards off; and walked to<lb/>wards him—he must have seen the train; it was coming up at the time he laid the chair on the rail, and he turned back directly he had done it, and went out through the same hole that he came in by—the train made a noise in coming along—he was creeping up the bank as the train passed, and the fence was over his head—the stage is close to the fence—I was seventy yards from the stage when I saw him, and I kept coming nearer—I was fifty or sixty yards from him when the train passed—I saw the life guard of the engine strike the chair, and saw the chair fly away—I then went in pursuit of the boy; he was not out of my sight above two or three seconds; I am confident of him; I have seen him frequently—I found him concealing himself behind a big stone; he had just got through the fence, and as soon as he saw me, ha went behind the stone—I went up, and said, "You are the boy I want, you have just been on the line"—he said, "You are a liar"</p>

               <p>—I had driven him off the line two or three tiroes before—he has got through that hole two or three times—the children have scratched the dirt away underneath the palings, and then they slip themselves underneath—it has only been there a short time—I did not inform the Company of it, because I was not employed by them, but by Mr. Lee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fireman on No. 4, North London engine. I was with the train out of London, at a quarter past 6 o'clock this day—I shut off the steam about 500 yards before we get to the Kingsland station—I did so on this occasion, and when we got about 200 yards from the station, I said to my mate, "Hold, we are off the line" (we were not off the line)—as we came to the chair the iron life guard knocked it off, but if it had not been high enough to have been struck by the life guard it must have thrown the engine off the line—the life guard comes down within three or four inches of the rail, but it does not always succeed, it is according how it lies—if the wheel of the engine had struck the chair, it would have thrown us off and endangered the safety of the passengers—when I saw the chair I used the screw, more than I should have done if I had been going to pull up at the station—I attribute our escape from the danger to my extra exertions to pull up the train—the faster we were going the greater would be the danger—when I saw the chair, I put the break on much earlier than I other-wise should have done, and by that, mitigated the risk.</p>

I knew the deceased Hannah Bell, for about two months—I lodged in the same house with her for three weeks, at No. 2, Five Bell-alley, Limehouse; it is a bad house—on Monday evening, 11th June, I went to that house with two men, be<lb/>tween 5 and 6 o'clock—the deceased was at home—she kept company with one of the men down stairs, and I went up stairs with the others—I was talking to the man just inside the room door when the prisoner followed me up, took hold of the man and threw him down stairs, and cut his mouth—I do not think I had ever seen the prisoner before that day—I do not think he was very drunk, he did not seem to be drunk, he was able to beat us very well—after he had thrown the man down stairs, he commenced beating him; I begged of. him not to kill the man, and he caught hold of the hair of my head, threw me down, and began to kick me—the deceased came to my assistance; we were then down stairs, I had come down after the man; she endeavoured to prevent the prisoner from ill using me, and he took hold of her two arms and struck her with his fist on the breast or stomach, I do not know which; she fell from that blow—I believe she fell down side-ways, I do not think she fell partly on her knees—he then lifted his foot as if to kick her, I do not know that he did kick her—I then left the room, went outside the door, and the prisoner followed me, took me by the hair of my head, pulled me down, and commenced jumping upon me before the door—I was saved from him, and went in doors, and he then went away—in a very short time the deceased came into my room—she then had a big lump on her jaw—Mrs. Slaughter, who lives in the same court, came in with her; she was struggling to walk, she walked with difficulty—when she came in she got faint, and fell back on the boards—she told Mrs. Slaughter to bring her some vinegar—she fainted—Mrs. Slaughter and I laid her on the bed, and she got some vinegar and bathed her head—T did not hear her speak any more—I laid down on the bed with her—I was not long on the bed before Mrs. Slaughter came back, and told me that the prisoner was coming back, I then went out—I think that was between 8 and 9 o'clock—I left the deceased on the bed <hi rend="italic">in a faint</hi>—I came back at a quarter past 12 o'clock—I went in with a policeman, and found the deceased dead on the bed.</p>

I said that I was going after some money for some work that I had taken home, and I wanted bread for the children—he said he knew my husband had been idle—I said, "I hear you have been idle to day;" he said, "Yes, I have, but it is for my own satisfaction, and that I will have before I sleep"—I asked who had been offending him; he said that b——wh——, <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi> Robinson, and he would have her life and the wh——'s life that was with her—I begged of him to go home to bed, and not to ill use anybody, but he still persisted in the oath, and repeated the same words repeatedly, and he said he had got a hammer in his pocket—he took my left hand and thrust it into his left jacket pocket, and there I felt an iron substance like a stonemason's small hammer, just such a one as I could span with my hand—he said he would take that and knock their b——heads with it—he held my hand in his possession in his pockets for some minutes—I asked him what the cause of quarrel was, and he said it was because she pushed up against him—he did not say when—I told him people often pressed up against one another, and not to think anything of that as an offence—he mentioned another woman, and said if <hi rend="italic">Mother Kit</hi> Lee came through the alley, he would first warm the hammer over her head, and then he would settle the other two b——s afterwards—he released my hand to show the way in which he would use it over their heads—I did not see the hammer, for as soon as he let go my hand, I took to my heels and ran away from him—I expected he would give me a blow with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons. I was called to No. 2, Five Bell-alley, a few minutes after 1 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, 12th June—I saw the deceased lying on the bed dead—I should Bay she had been dead about an hour, the extremities were cold, but there was warmth about the trunk—I found a contusion on the left cheek, which had evidently occurred from a kick, for there were five nail marks on the cheek—I found on the left half bf the lower jaw a very extensive contusion—it might have been occasioned by a violent blow equally with a kick, but most probably by a kick; I could not say with certainty, there were no marks of nails there, it was on the bone—it could not have been done by a hammer, because the hammer would cause fracture—on the Thursday follow<lb/>ing, assisted by Mr. Pritchett, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the head, immediately upon removing the skull cap, I discovered a rapture of the longitudinal sinus, a large blood vessel that runs across the head from front to back—the blow on the cheek might have occasioned that rupture—on the anterior part of the brain I found a solid clot of blood, measuring four inches by three, and weighing four ounces and a drachm, that represented a larger quantity of blood, because some serum would have oozed away—I have no doubt that the blow was the cause of the rupture—in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, or where something unusual occurs, and great excitement is the consequence, more blood is sent into the head than usual—so severe a kick, or kicks, as the deceased appears to have had, might have ruptured the sinus—it might also be caused by pressure on the jugular vein—the pressure of the blood upon the brain was the proximate cause of death—if that blood had resulted from disease, it would have been either in the substance of the brain, at the back of the brain, or in the ventricles; I saw no other cause of death—I saw no trace whatever of the use of a hammer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Might not the rupture of the sinus be caused as well by a fall as a blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must have been a very heavy fell, I think not—I do not think a violent fall, and the head coming in contact with the floor, or a hard substance, would be likely to produce the rupture I found—I should say it was impossible for a fall to do it, considering how dense the sinus is, and how severe the injury must be to rupture it—it is impos<lb/>sible for a simple fall on any hard substance to cause a rupture of the longi<lb/>tudinal sinus in a person of her age, and to have so large a quantity as four ounces of blood effused—I have never been engaged in a case of man<lb/>slaughter from a pugilistic encounter'—I know that in such cases it requires very nice discrimination to say whether death resulted from a blow or a fall; in those cases the blood is always in the substance of the brain, the ventricles, or the posterior part of the brain; you never get a large clot of blood of four ounces under the frontal bone—there was no fracture of the skull—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020032"/>
               <p>the extravasation in this case must have been rapid, the vessel ruptured being so large—I think I can positively say that the rupture was not caused by a fall; there was more than an ounce of blood effused between the skin and the cheek bone, and the swelling was about an inch and a half in thick<lb/>ness; it must have been something more violent than any fall—we dissected the scalp from the cranium, and took the brain entirely out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Middle-row, South, Knightsbridge, and keep a coffee house; the prisoner is my wife. On 13th June she came home about 12 o'clock at night; she had been drinking, but was not drunk—I asked her how it was she was so late in—she said she had been after some dress—I said, "I cannot allow this, and I shall not take you out if you have been getting a dress to go out"—she had gone out about 6 or 7 o'clock to take up a servant's character, and that would not have taken her above two hours—she was perfectly sober when she went out—when I said this to her, she replied, "If you won't take me out, you shan't go out, for I will burn your trowsers;" and she ran up stairs to fetch them—she brought them down, and I prevented her from putting them on the fire—there was a fire burning in the kitchen, and she would have put them on the fire, if I had not prevented her—she then took up the cups and saucers, and smashed them through the windows; she broke six or seven windows—she then tried to run up stairs, but I prevented her, because I had some money up stairs—I got before her, and she was not able then to get up stairs—I saw a knife in her hand; she must have got it from the bar—there was a struggle between us for me to prevent her going up stairs, and I found I was wounded in the back, right on the shoulder bone—I cannot say whether she struck me, I was so flurried, seeing her with the knife, but I found myself wounded—I turned round and saw the knife in the hand of a car<lb/>penter, who was at work there—I bled very much—I remained in the house about a quarter of an hour, and then went out to look for a surgeon to get my wound dressed—my wife was in the house during that time, and saw the state I was in—I said, "Look how I am wounded; look how I am bleeding"—she made no answer—I said to the man who was in the house, "Go and fetch me a surgeon"—no one did go, so I put on my coat and hat to go myself; the carpenter went with me—my wife followed us in a short time, and overtook me—she did not do or say anything for some time—I still went on, and she said, "Come back, you shan't go;" and then, when we had got just beyond the police, she struck me in the eye with her fist—I was very weak at the time—the effect of the blow was to swell up my eye, and I had a very black eye—the policeman then came up and inter<lb/>fered,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of William Langford—he lives at No. 53, Broad-quay, Bristol, and is a chronometer and watch maker—I was living with him in Feb. last—I was at home on the night of 21st Feb.—the property, a portion of which I have since seen, was all safe that evening—in the course of that night the premises were broken open, and in the morning we missed property to the amount of from 2,700/. to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it consisted of 120 gold watches, 100 silver watches, and 100 or more gold chains, and seven gold job watches—my father offered a reward of 200.—we did not succeed in obtaining any information between that time and 21st April—about that time I came to London, and went to the house of Henry Webster, a watch maker, No. 7, Albert-terrace, Camden-town—in consequence of an application of mine to him, he showed me some watches, and amongst them was one that I knew—after some conversation with him, I agreed to purchase that watch—I got it into my possession; I paid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this is it—it is one that was stolen from my father's house on the night of 21st Feb.—in this part, where the maker's name is usually placed, the name has been taken out, and a new number put on it—there is no name on it now—the plate has been reduced—the name on it was "William Langford, Broad-quay, Bristol"—I did not see any other of the watches we had lost at Mr. Webster's then—having purchased this watch, I came away—I went again on the following Tuesday, the 24th; I went alone—I did not find any more of my father's property on that second occasion—I went again on the following day, and by my instruction Jack<lb/>son and Mason followed me in and searched the house, and in a little nest of drawers on Mr. Webster's work board, I found two gold cases and two movements belonging to the cases—these are them—I have put them together since—the original names have been taken out, and other names put on, and the numbers have been altered, by making "1" into "4," and "2" into "8"—that was all we found—Webster was taken into custody, and taken to the police court—he was afterwards admitted to bail, and then examined as a witness—on Thursday, 26th April, I went with Jackson to the house of a watchmaker named Bartman, No. 50, Compton-street, Clerkenwell—I there found five gold cases and four parts of movements—I am able to identify them as a portion of the property my father losfc—Bartman gave an account of where he got them from—these are them—I have here got the watches and parts of watches that we found at Bartman's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020035"/>
               <p>—all of them except one are deficient of the parte on which the names are usually put, or at least where they were put on these cases—I am able to Bay that these watches have had my father's name on them, "William Langford, Broad-quay"—one of them was deficient of the pillar plates, but they were found at Webster's—from what I learned, I went the same night to the house of Gray—Bartman and Jackson went with me—Gray lives on Clerkenwell-green—he carries on the business of a jeweller's tool dealer—he has a shop—there seemed nothing but tools—Gray was at home—Jackson and I and Bartman went as far as the end of the churchyard, iind left Bartman in custody of a constable—Bartman had the watches in tin boxes—Jackson and I went to the iron sate leading to the side door of the house, and Mr. Gray answered it—Mr. Jackson said he wanted to speak to him—he opened the gate, and I said, "I want to buy some crossing files"—that was to get into the shop—he showed us into the shop, and Jackson put the following questions to him: "Have you any watchest" he said, "No"—"Have you had any lately?" he said, Not for many months"—I then gave him into the custody of Jackson—Jackson put the questiont to him again, and told him he was an officer, and he gave the same answers, negatives to all the questions—Jackson then told me to open the front door—I opened it, and called Bartman in, and Jackson said, "Mr. Bartman, from whom did you have those watches you have in the box?" he said, "From Mr. Gray"—Gray said, "Oh, I remember now, I did give then to him"—we then searched the house, but found nothing else—he was then taken to the police court—all the property produced is a portion of what we lost—there are six watches from the north of England, which have been altered—they were sold by Mr. Webster.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 11). I accompanied Mr. Langford in search of this property—on Wednesday evening, 25th April, I went to Mr. Webster 8, in Albert-terrace, Camden-road—I have seen the property that the last witness has identified—that is the property found there—I assisted in searching Mr. Webster's premises, and brought away the pro<lb/>perty identified by Mr. Langford—on the evening of the 26th 1 went to the house in Compton-street, occupied by Bartman—he produced this property to us, and gave an account of it—in consequence of what was disclosed there, I went the same evening to the house of the prisoner, about 9 o'clock—I went into the shop with Mr. Langford, and saw Mr. Gray—I asked him if he had any watches altered, or sent any to be repaired in any way—he said, no, he had not—I was in plain clothes, but I disclosed to him that I was an officer—I said, "Be very careful, Mr. Gray; I am an officer belonging to the police; I will ask you again;" which I did, and he said, no, he had not had any watches in his shop for four months—Mr. Langford then undid the front door—the shop was shut at that time—I called Mr. Bartman in—he came, and brought in this tin box—I asked Mr. Bartman of whom he had those watches—he pointed to Mr. Gray, and said, "I had them of Mr. Gray"—I then told him he must consider himself in my cus<lb/>tody—I asked him if he had any bills or invoices of either of them—he said, no, he had none—I asked him of whom he purchased these watches—he said, "I bought them one or two at a time, over the counter; I do not know who I bought them of—I took him to the station, and he was after<lb/>wards taken before the Magistrate—he was bailed after the examination, and after he got outside he gave a description of a man of whom he said he bought them—from the description he gave me, I told him I knew the man</p>

               <p>very well—he had been in custody before—he could not recollect the name, but he afterwards told me the name—I made arrangements to meet him at Spital-square station at 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I met him, and we went down to a public house in Cambridge-heath-road—he went inside with his friend, Mr. Symons, a gentleman who bailed him, and the sergeant and I remained outside, at the corner of the house—he was in, it might be three or four minutes, when he came out, and said, "There is one of the men just gone along; he is the man that took the money for the watches"—I said, "Why did not you follow him out and give him in charge directly, as you had a very good opportunity?"—I had not an opportunity of seeing the man that he represented then, but I did afterwards—Mr. Gray said, "I think I know where he is gone to; I think I can find him"—I said, "We will follow behind you, and will go into the public house, the Gossett Anns, in Gosseti-street, and remain there;" and as sergeant Mason and I were going down Montague-street we saw three persons in close conversation, Mr. Symons and Mr. Gray, with a short man—we went about ten paces round the comer, and I told Mason to stop there—in about a minute or two Mr. Symons came round the corner, and he said, "That is the man; that is the man; go and take him"—I saw two men walking up the street, about thirty yards off—one, I have no doubt, was Mr. Gray—I told Mason to make haste up; if that was the man he might get him—Mason ran up, and, just as we got within about sixty yards, Gray said, "That is the man; I have lost him."</p>

I was with the last witness on the occasion when we went to Webster's—I did not go to Gray's house—I went with Gray and the last witness and Symons to Bethnal-green, on Friday, 27th April—we met at the Spital-square station, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—we went to a public house where sergeant Jackson and Gray agreed we should meet—we then went into the neighbourhood of Bethnal-green-road, I think Cambridge Heath-road—we went to a public house——I think the man's name that kept it was Hunter—I think it was the Red Deer, or Rein Deer—I am a perfect stranger in that neighbourhood—Gray left us, and went into the house—it was arranged that if he saw the person there that sold him the watches, he should come outside and speak to him under the lamp in front of the house—he went in the house, and remained a few minutes—it was about 9 o'clock at night, or getting towards 9—we were waiting and watching for him and the man to come out—presently he came out to us—we were a short distance off—he said, "I saw the man in the house, but he has disappeared; his place is vacant, and he has left his glass of what he was drinking standing on the table"—we then remained some time, and he was making inquiries with regard to a person named Day—that was the first time I had heard the name of Day—he said he kept a small tea shop, or was a dealer in tea—I went with him, and he made some inquiries with respect to finding this person named Day—he found the address of the man Day, and after waiting some time it was agreed that Gray and Symons should go to another public house to look for Day—I think the public house was the sign of the Panther—I do not know the name of the street—he was to look for Day, or the person he had first named to us—sergeant Jackson and I followed him, and passed the public house, and near the public house we saw three persons in conversation, the prisoner and Symons, and a third person unknown to us—I was very close to them; in fact if I had put my hand out, I could have touched them—we went about twelve paces beyond them, and turned the corner of a street—after remaining there somewhere about a minute, I should say, Symons came round the corner, and said, "That was one of the men"—Jackson and I followed in the direction where Gray and the other person were going—they went in the opposite direction to that in which we had come—I then started and ran—I could see two persons walking, perhaps sixty paces ahead of me, and they were very near the corner of the street at that time—I ran to the corner and met Gray coming down the street—I turned the corner—they had disappeared from my view; and I met Gray coming to<lb/>wards the corner—I said, "Where has the man gone to?"—he said, "He</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020038"/>
               <p>started off and ran; he has gone ont at the end of the street; he ran as hard as he could"—I said, "Why did you not stop him, or detain him?"—he said, "I could not do so, he ran away before I was aware of it"—I said, "If you had attempted to hare detained him, I should have been at your elbow in an instant, I could have caught him"—he said, "He ran away quite unawares, I had no idea he was going to run"—at that time Jackson and Symons came up, and the prisoner proposed to go to Day's house, and wait for his return—we went there and waited till about 4 o'clock in the morning—he never came in—at that time we left—we gave up the search and the inquiry—if when we passed them in the street, I had been told to take him, I could have taken him with a great deal of ease.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Were you not told by Gray that when three persona came out of the public house you were to take the third? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not mention a third person—he did not say that if a stranger came out of the public house with him and Symons I was to take him—he did not put it in that way—I saw him speak to Bay near the Panther—I did not see him come out of the Panther—I knew Gray was going to the Panther—he did not say before he went in the Panther, that if we saw him and Symons with a third person, we were to take the third person; he never mentioned such a thing to me nor to Jackson—I saw a third person in company with Gray and Symons—I did not exactly expect that that third person would be the man, because that person did not answer the description of the person—he described him as being a tall man, and the third man as a short man, something like Jackson—the other man was a tall man; De<lb/>Vaux—the prisoner was to meet us at the Spital Square station—three o'clock was the time, I think; we were a little after—it was between 3 and 4 o'clock, and then he was to come to us at another public house—Jackson amused himself with a game at bagatelle; I was sitting looking on—I believe the landlord played with him; it was just to while away the time—I do not know whether Jackson staid to finish the game—I went out—Gray might say, "Come along at once," and Jackson might say, "Stop till we finish the game," but I went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the City-road—I did live in Albert-terrace, Camden-town—I have known the prisoner since Sept or Oct.; I cannot say to a week—I only came to town in Sept—I purchased some gold watches of him about 6th or 7th March—to the best of my belief I bought these nine gold watches (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) of him—they were all bought at the same time, and three more; twelve altogether—here are six here that I sold in my journey in the north—I saw Mr. Langford at my house on 21st April—I sold him a watch, which is among the lot that is before me—this is it—it is one I bought of Gray—I afterwards received from him some name plates; that would be some time afterwards—I would not say whether these are them (<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>) or not—I did not take particular notice of them—they were given me by Mr. Gray to gild, but they were not in a state to gild; they wanted smoothing up to gild—they had been filed and were rough—I do not know how many there were; I never counted them—the name of the maker is placed sometimes in one part, sometimes in another—this is the part that is rough in these plates; it appears in both parts.</p>

Lund and Salmon came to lodge there as soon as I did—I went with Lund to pawn his watch, on a Monday, about 1 o'clock, because he said that he did not like to go by himself—he came back with me, stopped in the house about an hour, and then went out, and came back in half an hour—he said he felt rather tired, and went to lie down—while he was lying down the prisoner went up stairs—I went up about a quarter of an hour afterwards, as was going to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with one of the sailors, not this young man—I was dressing up a doll, and I went into the room, and allowed my mistress what 1 was going to do, and she smiled at it—I saw her at Lund's bedside, with her hands in his waist<lb/>coat pocket; she took out a shilling, and I said, "Do not you take that shilling; he will only miss it, for he counted his money out to one of the other sailors"—she said, "You take one;" I said, "No, God forbid that I should rob the sailors, for they are robbed quite enough; you had better put it back"—she said that she would, and I saw her put her fingers in the pocket, but I do not know that she put the shilling in—presently he came down, and said, "Esther, I have been robbed," and I told him, and when I went into the kitchen, the prisoner struck me on the nose, and made it bleed—I took my things, and went home to my mother—I took none of the money; my mistress wanted me, but I would not.</p>

               <p>"If you think I have done it, search me before I go out of the house"—I said that because she said to herself that I had done it—somebody had told me that she had charged me with being the thief—before this, I lived at No. 6, Fane-street, with my mother; she and I had a few words, and I Jived with a young woman, a few weeks at the waistcoat work, in Penitent-street—no one but this young woman lived there—people did not visit me there—I do not know the name of the woman who keeps the house—I found out that it is a brothel after I had been there a little time—I never opened the door to the people, and I never <hi rend="italic">done</hi> wrong while I was in the place—the door was always open; it was a cigar shop—I am seventeen years old.</p>

On 7th June, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, I received information, ran up from the garden, and went in pursuit of three boys which were pointed out to me by my child and the last witness—I kept them in sight 200 or 300 yards, for where they are making new basins for the East London water works—Chapman, the policeman, was there—when they had walked about 100 yards, Davis separated from the other two, and ran as hard as he could—I had previously walked very cautiously, for fear they should fancy they were detected, but then I ran also, and seeing a policeman, I motioned to him to go through the hedge, to stop one of them who had gone through—as soon as I came up, they were all three taken by Chapman, and I gave them into custody—I examined my shop, and missed some pipes, which were safe in a glass case on the counter in the morning before I left—Chapman handed me these pieces of pipe; they are my property—1 lost five, which were worth between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—this one is rendered valueless, by being thrown against some brickwork.</p>

I was on duty in Green<lb/>wich fair on the evening of Wednesday, 30th May—I saw the prisoner in company with three others—I watched them, and saw them hustle several gentlemen—I missed the prisoner—I then followed the other three from the fair to the church—I there saw the prisoner join them, and they all walked together from the church towards Deptford—I got assistance in the Broadway, and went to the prisoner—I asked him where the watch was that he had got—he said he had got no watch—one of the others ran away—we took, the three into a public house, and on searching the prisoner I found these two watches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this one the prosecutor claims as his—he stated that a man had given him half a crown to carry them to London—he said, "Perhaps you saw the man give them to me?"—this watch has been broken off from the bow.</p>

On Thursday afternoon, 7th June, in consequence of being sent for, I went to a house in Hill-street, Wool<lb/>wich, occupied by Bowden; I found the quartermaster and Mansfield, and two or three others there—I searched and found a great deal of property lying about—I found a half chest of drawers, open—Captain Elgee's servant identified a great part of the property—the case was broken, and in three cupboards I found three chests broken up, and some on the fire—this small box was in a chest up stairs, with Captain Elgee's name on it—I found one pair of sheets with Captain Elgee's name, and a quantity of books—I found a box under the bed with the name of Captain Addington on it—that only contained straw—there was another large chest with Captain Elgee's name on it, which had been broken open, and a canteen case with Captain Yel<lb/>verton's name on it in chalk, the contents of which were gone; but I</p>

About the middle of Feb. last, I was a pauper inmate of the workhouse at Newington, and saw the prisoner there and her child—it was three months old, within a day or two, when it died—I believe its name was Mary—they were in the ward called the mothers' room; I was the nurse of that room—the mothers who had children to take, care of were in that room by themselves, I had ten of them—I had seen the deceased child in the lying-in ward before that, several times; it Was born in the workhouse—I had seen it in the lying-in ward about a fortnight before it came into the mothers' room—it was then in its mother's care, and. when it came into my room it was in the mother's care—it appeared very; bad in health then—it was under my care about five weeks—I do not know how it was when it was in the lying-in ward, but when it came to me it. was very poorly—it was continually crying and screaming—it was very thin—I saw it daily, and nearly hourly—about a week after it came to my room I spoke to the prisoner about it—it was my duty to see that the mothers attended to the children—the prisoner had nothing to do but to take care of the child, she had no labour to do—she had a very fine breast of milk—she had the means of giving plenty of nourishment to the child from the breast—I said to her, "Sturgess, your child does not look well, I will call Mr. Lowndes's attention to it"—she said she did not want any attention—I did call Mr. Lowndes's attention to it—she was in my room between a month and five weeks; she was then taken before a Magistrate, and taken to prison—she ill used the child very much—it was a complete sight from want—I constantly called her attention to it, night and day—she was allowed arrowroot and other things for the child, but she did not give it,</p>

               <p>they were supplied by the authorities of the workhouse, in order that she might feed the child properly; there was plenty for that purpose—she would not suckle the child—she did not do it, and she would not do it—she said she would not, and she did not—I heard her say so repeatedly—her breast was not at all sore, I examined it several times—she appeared to be quite well—I have seen her hit and shake the child—I do not know whether it was naturally a healthy child; I think if it had had food it would have been healthy—I did not see it shortly after it was born—Mr. Lowndes examined her breast in my presence, and told her that she had got a fine breast of milk and that she must suckle the child—she said she could not give it, and she would not give it; she said it did not want milk, she would bring it up by hand—her conduct was very bad to the child—I should say I saw her give it the breast very little indeed, and she never gave it at all the whole of the night—the child was in a very bad state when the pri<lb/>soner was taken away—it was taken the greatest care of by the matron and the master, before the prisoner was removed, and afterwards also—it was fed well when I had it—it lived ten days after the prisoner was removed—it had a pint of arrowroot and milk, and every attention was paid to it; it died on Saturday night, 24th March—in my opinion the child seemed to suffer from want of food and nourishment—I believe the prisoner is about twenty or twenty-one years of age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 7, New-street, Camden-town. I was an inmate of the Newington poorhouse for about three months, commencing about Feb.; it was while the prisoner was there—she was delivered of a child there, in the lying-in ward—I was there at that time, and saw her and the child from day to day—she was not kind to the child; she used to slap it and shake it, and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it on the bed—she did not attend to it when it cried; she would let it cry for two or three minutes—she appeared to have a full breast—I have spoken to her a great many times about letting it cry, and not giving it the breast—she has said, "Mind your own business, and let the little devil cry"—she afterwards moved into the mothers' room—I saw her there—her conduct to the child there was very bad; she did not give it the breast—we had to force her very much before she would do it—she used to give it the breast then; that was not very often—there was plenty of food supplied for the child—I have seen her give the child a little, and eat the rest herself—I have seen her throw the child on the bed, and say she hated the sight of it—she appeared to be serious when she said so—the child looked very bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you say she threw it on the bed, you mean on the bedclothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she threw it there for the purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LOWNDES</hi>. I am medical officer to the poorhouse at Newington, My attention was first called to the deceased child on 14th Feb.—it was then about ten weeks old—it was healthy in appearance, but delicate—in consequence of being told that the prisoner refused to suckle it, I examined her breast, and found it copiously supplied—I then remonstrated with her upon the cruelty of withholding its natural diet from it, and also upon the consequences likely to ensue from it—she said she had no milk, but I found plenty—she took it to the breast again, and I heard no more of her until 15th March—I then examined the child—I found it grossly neglected—there was great excoriation, in consequence of its napkin not having been changed—it was then taken from its mother—it did not appear likely to live—it certainly did not appear to have been properly suckled and taken care of—I ordered it farinaceous food, arrow root, and light diet—if any<lb/>thing could have sustained life, they would have done so, judiciously employed, or rather, I should say, it might have prolonged its existence—it died on 24th March—I made <hi rend="italic">a post mortem</hi> examination on the 29th—the brain was perfectly healthy in structure, but ex-sanguineous, paler than</p>

               <p>usual, and there was effusion in the ventricles, or between the membranes—the lungs were perfectly healthy, but flaccid—the stomach was perfectly healthy, but there was not a particle of nutriment in it—there was a quan<lb/>tity of bile in the duodenum—the mucous membranes of the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> were congested—the larger intestines were quite empty, not a particle of faeces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account for that, because the child had then been in the care of the parish officers for nine days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot account for it—the kidneys were healthy—the body was quite ex-sanguineous—in my opinion, the cause of death was inanition; I should say that was of about a month's standing; it is impossible to state exactly—those appear<lb/>ances would not hare been so positive if the child had been properly fed from the 14th March till the 21st—I think if it had been properly taken care of for the last nine days it would not have presented those appearances—taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think want of due nourishment was the cause of death—the first cause was want of due nourishment before 15th March—if it had been properly nourished since 15th March, I think it would have been very doubtful whether death would have occurred or not—I did not think the child would have lived from the first time I saw it—if it had been properly nourished from 15th March to the 24th, I do not think it likely that it would have lived—the evil had been done on the 14th, when I remonstrated with the mother as to the neglect—it pined afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Why did you first say it was doubtful whether it would have lived or not, and immediately afterwards say it was not doubtful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is, that whatever care might have been taken of it, it would not have ultimately lived; it might have prolonged life, it would probably not have died so soon—my attention was not called to the child at all between 14th Feb. and 15th March—I passed the ward every day, and the prisoner then had the child, and therefore I heard no more about it—it wanted no medicine; all it wanted was moral management—children are not subject at that very early age to disease of the mesenteric glands; it is the case if they are of a scrofulous tendency, but here the visceras were perfectly healthy—the mesenteric glands appeared perfectly healthy—I did not see anything of a strumous habit in the child—I never examined the mother particularly—she was not subject to scrofula of the neck, or anything of that kind—I believe scrofula is an hereditary disease.</p>

On a Thursday, in last January, the prisoner came to the side gate and rang the bell; I had never seen her before—she brought some lace in a basket, and asked me to buy some—I bought a small piece which came to 6rf.—she said that she was in very great trouble—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece to go and get change, and bring it back; she asked me for some<lb/>thing to eat, and I gave her some small pieces of bread, some mutton, and an ounce of tea—the tea was my own—she did not come back as she had promised, and I never saw her again till Monday, 11th June, five months afterwards, when she came again and rang at the bell—I went, and she said, "Well, Miss, I suppose you have not forgotten me"—I said, "No"—she said, "You have not forgotten the 2. piece;" I said, "No, but I will for<lb/>give you that"—she said, I must tell you all; I would have come back and paid you, but I have been in trouble; I was watched at the gate with the tea you gave me, and have been in prison four months, all through what you have done"—she charged me with' stealing the tea from my master—I told her that I did not, that it was my own, and it was very strange that she should be taken into custody for what I had given her—she said that while she was in prison she had one child died, and her husband was very ill, and that she was in great distress, and wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as she had to make up 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her lawyer, and had got but 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if I did not give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she would have me up before the Court for stealing my master's property, but if I did I should hear no more about it—that frightened me—she said that my master and mistress must know all about it, and began screaming and cry<lb/>ing—I told her I could not give her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I would do what I could for her—she made a dreadful noise, and I begged her not to do so, and told her I would do what I could for her—I went up stairs, fetched down two half crowns, which I gave her, and she said, "Oh, my God I is this all you are going to give me?"—I said, "I cannot give you any more"—she said, "You must"—I told her I did not think I could give her any more—she said, "You must, or else your mistress and master must know about it"—I then gave her a morning frock of mine, and another half crown, and she went away and said she would call again on the morrow, and tell me whe<lb/>ther it would do or not—she did not come then, but she came on the Wed<lb/>nesday, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and said that what I had given her was not enough, aud I must give her something more, anything would do, shawls or anything—I gave her a shawl, and she went away and came again about 7 o'clock on the same evening, and I gave her a gown piece and a pair of socks—she said the same that time, about my master and mistress know<lb/>ing it, and that I should get into trouble—she offered me a bottle of something, which I would not take—I gave her the things because she threatened me and frightened me, and I believed that J should be taken to the eourt—she had that child with her.</p>

On Wednesday, 13th June, about half past 7 o'clock, I was on duty in Grove-road, Brixton, and saw the pri<lb/>soner come out at the gate and join a woman named May, who was holding the prisoner's child—I asked the prisoner what she had been doing, she said that she had been begging; I told her she must walk away—I saw a bundle under her arm, made towards her to question her, and she dropped this gown piece from under her shawl—I picked it up, and found under her shawl this pair of stays—she said that she had exchanged them with a lady for some catsup.</p>

Leny, Wateringbury, Kent, 1854," and besides that, the number and weight—I next saw the pockets at the police station, at Islington, about a week or ten days after they were lost—fifteen of them were in their original state, and five were in new cloth—there were no marks on the new pockets—I examined the hops—I examined the externals of the fifteen pockete, and drew samples from the new pockets, and found them to correspond with the hops we had in our warehouse—I have the samples here—the value of the hops was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Weston-street, Bermondsey. I know the hop warehouse of the prosecutors—you turn out of Weston-street to go to the warehouse, and on the left hand side as you go down, are the premises of my father—he does not follow any busi<lb/>ness—there are no windows in that part of our house which is in a line with the gates of the warehouse—on the night of 26th April, I was at the gates of my father's premises at a little after 10 o'clock—I was returning home—I saw a van turn the corner, going towards the gates of the hep warehouse—the van was empty—the gates were not open when I first saw the vau—when I got a little way up the turning, the gates opened—the van went up the yard, and the gates closed directly—I was not able to distinguish the driver of the van, or the person by whom the gates were opened—I did not perceive any one—I went in directly, and saw no more—in about a quarter of an hour I heard something come out—to the best of my belief they were not there above a quarter of an hour—what came out appeared to me to be a van loaded—it was about 25 minutes to 11 o'clock when it came down—I did not see the van after it left the yard, nor which way it went.</p>

On 26th April, I was passing through Suow'e-fields, about a quarter past 10 o'clock at night, I saw a van laden with hops going towards Ring-street—there were two horses in it, they were trotting—I held on behind, and followed the van to Blackfrars-road—I saw the per<lb/>son who was driving the van, when he was turning round Weston-street, Snow's-fields—there was a light at the corner of Weston-afcreet—William Stafford was driving—the van went up King-street, towards Blackfriars-road—it then went towards the bridge—I let go the van then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, and live at No. 25, John-street I know the prisoner, William Stafford; he came to me either the latter end of April, or the beginning of May, he brought a sample of hops with him in his hat, he offered them for sale, I declined to purchase them—I asked him what hops they were—he said they came from Farnham in Kent—I told him I thought he made a mistake, as Farnham happened to be in Surrey—he then said it might be Farningham—they were hops of English growth—the grower's name is generally on the sample of hops, and I observed the words, "Bees wax" there—I declined to buy—he put the sample where he took it from, in his hat, and went away.</p>
