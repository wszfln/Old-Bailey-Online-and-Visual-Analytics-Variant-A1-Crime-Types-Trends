                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Lady Talbot de Malahide—she lives at 3, Lowndes-square, Chelsea—on 30th November, Lady Talbot went out about five minutes before 7, in the carriage—the footman went with her—after she had gone out, the butler went out, and after that I went upstairs to Lady Talbot's bedroom; that was about half-past 7—her ladyship's bedroom is the front room on the third floor—I found the room all in confusion—the two wardrobe doors were wide open each way, the drawer was half out, and the cover of the jewel-case lay outside the drawer; the pincushion thrown down on the floor, and the drawer at the bottom of the looking-glass half open—Lady Talbot's watch, which had been on the dressing-table, was gone—the jewel-case was also gone—I had not been in the room since 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the room was then all right and straight—when I went up at half-past 7, it was to light her ladyship's fire—while I was in the room I heard a door go upstairs, and I went upstairs to my own room which is the front attic—I there found the jewel-close, and the two the two room trays that held the diamonds, lying at each end of it, and what is termed a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, lying by the side of it—I then went into the next room, which is a spare room, that is a front room also; and there I found the window open, the floor all wet, and an upper square of glass broken in the window, near the lock of the window—it was a very wet night, and was raining very hard at the time—I missed my silver watch from my room, from off the fire-place—I had seen it safe at 4 o'clock, when I was up in the room—I saw that the jewel-case had been broken open, by the trays being out—I took the iron thing into my hand that they opened it with—I went down and called the lady's-maid, and she came up stairs and examined the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lady's-maid to Lady Talbot—I was called by last witness on 30th November, about half-past 7—I went upstairs—I found the wardrobe open, and everything in confusion—I had dressed Lady Talbot for the theatre—the things were all right at that time—I left the bedroom about a quarter-past 6—the watch that I missed was on the dressing-table at that time—the jewels were in my charge—I kept the key of them—a diamond necklace was missed on this occasion, two tiaras, two diamond bracelets, two diamond brooches, and a small diamond ornament for the neck; altogether they are valued at about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were other smaller things besides these jewels, but not in the case—all that were in the case, were taken; the others were about the room, but they were not taken—they were of inferior value—they were thrown about—all the valuable jewellery that could be got at was taken, all the diamonds—those strewed about the room had been turned out of the boxes, but not removed—I lost a brooch of my own, it was taken off a pincushion—the house is in the parish of Chelsea—to the best of my belief, this diamond (<hi rend="italic">looking at a ring produced</hi>) belonged to her ladyship's necklace, from the size and purity of it—all I can say is, that it exactly resembles one of those in the centre of the necklace—I had been in the habit of cleaning these jewels for fifteeen years, brushing them almost daily—I think this was about the centre stone in the necklace, because it was the largest.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, B</hi>). On the night of 30th November, I went to 3, Lowndes-square, and examined the premises—I went up into the unoccupied room and the attic, and found the window open—a pane of glass was broken near the fastening, and there was some glass on the floor—a person could get from the roof into that room very easily—it was a very foggy misty night, small rain—it was rather windy at times, gusty—being so dark that night, I could not make a very good examination; but at daybreak, I went on to the roof of the house—there is a balustrade in front—I saw finger-marks on the balustrade in front of the houses 4 and 5, Lowndes-square, on the dirt that had become damp on the balustrades—No. 7 is under repair—there were ladders against it, reaching up to the roof—it is a flat roof—the marks were such as a person might make in passing along the roofs, and keeping himself steady—I was shown this <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> and the dressing-case—I compared the marks on it—it appears to have been broken open with that <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>—some days after this, I think the 3rd December, I received a hat from Meakins, a constable on the beat—I made some inquiries with reference to that—I went to 40, Cambridge-street, Hackney-road, on, as</p>

               <p>near as I can recollect, the 4th, 5th or 6th December, I can't say the exact day—I endeavoured to find the prisoner there, but did not succeed—I know that some things in Cambridge-street were afterwards moved to Clarence-place—that was as near as I can judge, about 17th December—I endeavoured to find the prisoner at Clarence-place, but was not successful in that—the things were afterwards removed from Clarence-place to 27, Hyde-place, Hoxton—that removal was on 20th December—I succeeded in finding the prisoner at that place, on 26th December—I had tried before that, between the 20th and 26th—on 26th, I saw him come out of 27, Hyde-place—his wife was with him, and a man and woman—Sergeant Potter was with me—he took the prisoner into custody, and another sergeant took his wife into custody—when Potter took the prisoner, he said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi>, I take you into custody for a large jewel robbery at 3, Lowndes-square, Pimlico"—I did not hear what reply he made—I and the sergeants returned into the house No. 27, taking the prisoner with us—we made a careful search of the house—whilst searching, the prisoner said to one of the sergeants, "I know what you are looking for now, you are looking for tools, but I have done away with them years ago"—Potter was keeping him in custody—before this occasion, I saw a man come out of No. 27, once or twice in the dusk of the evening, but could not be certain whether it was the prisoner or not—we did not find any <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi> or anything of the kind at this house—a great portion of the furniture was quite new—I found a quantity of flannel, unmade, and linen also not made up—I have not got it here—at the station I asked the prisoner for his address, and he gave it 27, Hyde-place, Hoxton—that was the house we had watched—he said he was a lapidary—in the cab on the way to the station, he said, "If you gentlemen had me to rights, I should have given you a <hi rend="italic">warming</hi> before you had taken me"—he meant, I suppose, if we had got the case clear against him, that I understood to be his meaning—that was after we had searched the house, and found none of the property—the prisoner's wife was taken before the magistrate, and discharged—this is the hat that was found (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found two or three letters in the house No. 27—I have one addressed to Mr. Arnold, 27, Hyde-place—I have also got a rent-book of the house 40, Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road.</p>

               <p>—I saw that hat worn by the prisoner at Lewes, on 2d July last—I expressed that opinion before I knew what was inside the hat, and said whose hat it was—I was present afterwards at the hatter's when inquiries were made about it—I had the hat shown to me at the cattle-show about the 11th; the cattle-show finished on Friday, and I went on the Saturday—I think I saw the hat on the Saturday, and on the Monday or Tuesday following I went to the hatter's—I was not there at the time he turned out the lining—I have seen the prisoner on many occasions—I had seen him wear the hat previous to that, previous to the date I have mentioned; I have seen him at Clerkenwell, where he lived—it was through the hat that I knew where he was at Lewes—the prisoner was traced to Hyde-place, from Great Cambridge-street—I apprehended him there on 26th, on Boxing-day, about twenty minutes before 2, his brother, his wife, and a woman with a baby were with him—I saw them come out of No. 27—I said to the prisoner, "<hi rend="italic">Patsy</hi> (that is the name by which I knew him), I want you, you must consider yourself in my custody for a jewel robbery at Lady Talbot's, at Brompton"—he said, "Very well, Mr. Potter, don't expose me here"—he then turned round and saw the four others, who were there in custody of other officers, and said, "Potter, you don't mean to take him into custody? he is innocent"—that was his brother-in-law, who was present—I said, "I shall leave that to the inspector"—he said, "I suppose you mean to search my place," or lodging, or something of that kind—I said, "Yes," and he asked to be present during the search—I took him back into the house and kept him in custody while Mr. Rolls and two other officers made a search—while they were searching a cupboard at the bottom of the stairs, the prisoner said, "I suppose you are looking for tools, but I have done with them years ago," and he said something about jewellery, but I could hardly catch the words—he said, "You knew, Potter, I should not have anything here"—on searching him I found three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>close to the window I could not see it—it had a black hatband on it—if a person had gone up the ladder and had got into the front gutter where the balustrade is, he could not get over the roof so as to fetch a hat, supposing it bad blown off; it is 9 ft. 6in. from the roof to the gutter, and nearly perpendicular—a person could not get along the roof from the front part—the hat was not wet, only just damp—we had a board on the ladders every night, but an expert person could get up even with a board there—I believe this to be the hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Red-lion-street, Wapping, and am apprentice to my father, a lighterman—we work for Willock and Son—on the morning of 19th January, I was on the river in a barge laden with lead, at Fresh Wharf, about two hundred yards from the Tower—about 7 o'clock I heard a noise with the last pig that was lifted on the gunwale—I was in the cabin—I came on deck and saw a boat shoving away—the prisoner was in the boat—there were four pigs of lead in the boat—there was one pig on deck, near the gunwale, on my barge—when I first saw the boat in which the prisoner was, it was about four yards off alongside—I hallooed out for the police directly—I found no police came so I stood on the gunwale of the barge for about two minutes while he was rowing off—I saw him throw the first pig overboard against the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi> steam-boat—that was while I was standing on the gunwale of the barge—after that I ran through the wharf and took a sculler from Billingsgate, near the Custom House, and rowed after him—he rowed towards over the water, and then he turned back again when he saw me coming, and rowed towards Brewer's Quay, and when we got to him there was none of the lead in the boat—I had lost sight of him from one end of the steam-boat to the other—that was the only time I lost sight of him, when I went round to get the sculler—he was rowing past the steam<lb/>boat then—when I overtook him at Brewer's Quay he was going on board a coal barge there to get a sweep of coals, and I told him I was going to give</p>

On the evening of Monday, 7th Jaunary, I and a police-officer, <hi rend="italic">K</hi> 141, were together in the Mile-end-road in plain clothes—I saw the three prisoners in company—I know the tobacco<lb/>nist's shop kept by Pennill—I saw them together about fifty yards from that shop—that is in the direction of Mr. Riddle's—I saw them all go up to Riddle's window together, and Brown went in, the other two standing together a few yards out—I saw Brown come out—she went directly to the other two—they all three walked in company from there to the corner of Globe-lane—I saw Brown go into a tobacconist's shop in Globe-lane-Burns remained outside—I took hold of Burns, and told her she had bed passing bad money—White was standing a few yards off, at the corner, in the Mile-end-road—Burns became very violent upon my laying hold of her and she dropped these two shillings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the pavement—I saw them picked up, and they were given to me—she said, "A man gave them me" Brown then came out of the shop, and I secured her upon a charge of passing bad money—White was brought to the station, and on him was found a shilling, two sixpences, and four penny-pieces, good money—one of then sixpences is the coin which was shown to William Street, from whom I got this counterfeit shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at the station White said, "I known nothing of the women," and the women said, "We don't know each other"—they were all charged with uttering bad money in company, and White said, "I know nothing of the women."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Whites Defence</hi>. I work in the London Docks; I was taking a walk and met the two females; I spoke to the one that I knew; the other I had never seen before. We went into a public-house, and she gave me a six-pence; I took it and called for something to drink; perhaps that might be the sixpence. I stood at the corner while they went up the turning; I waited till their return, but I never questioned them as to what they were going to do, and they never told me; then the policeman came up and took hold of my hands, and said he would take care I threw nothing away, and then he took me to the station. About a quarter of an hour or ten minutes afterwards Copping came in with the collar, and said, "Here, here is the col-lar," and the other one took it from him. They never said anything about the collar on the first statement, it was only at the second statement they mentioned it. If I had not known this woman, I should not have been in it.</p>

I get my living by laying drain pipes—on the evening of Wednesday week, about 8 o'clock, I was near the railway at Hackney—I saw the three prisoners there in company—I watched them for half an hour—I saw Smith come out of Mrs. Bonham's—I did not see her previously go in—when she came out, the other two were standing under the railway—she joined them there, and they all three went together up the Amherst-road—I spoke to the police-constable who was in plain clothes, and mentioned what I had seen—he and I followed them up the road till they came to Duncan-place, where Mr. Cooper the tobacconist's shop is—I saw Jackson go to the shop window and look over—he nudged Young, like this—she then went into the shop—the other two went across the road, and I followed them—the officer left me and went into the tobacconist's shop—I secured Smith.</p>

Northampton"—I also found this peg-iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in one of the trunks—the letter-bag contains envelopes and cards, bearing the name of Poole and Co.—I showed the contents of the hamper to a person of the name of Stone, and I showed the contents of the trunks to Fossey, and the seven packages of skins to Butcher.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Springfield House, Canon-bury-square, Islington—on Monday, 17th December, I was called in to see the deceased—he complained of intense pain in the head, especially on the right side—I questioned him as to whether he had received a How—he denied it until the Thursday, when the prisoner called on me—after seeing her I went to see the deceased, and told him that she had called on me, and he said, "She has done for me" or words to that effect, and admitted having received a blow—he became insensible for some days previous to his death—he was partially sensible at times, but not quite rational—that was from about the Saturday when the prisoner was taken—he died at midday on 1st January—I made a post-mortem examination, and found a quantity of fluid effused on the membrane of the brain—the vessels on the right side were very much congested, and there was a quantity of serum in the ventricle or cavity of the brain—there was no clot and no extravasation, but the vessels were very much congested, almost amounting to extravasation—there was no wound or other appearance on the scalp—I cut down through the membranes, and there was no appearance of anything but congestion—there was no black or blue mark, and nothing of a local character; no extravasation of blood under the scalp—I believe that he died from inflammation of the brain, which, I have no doubt, was caused by a blow—I put that down before making the examination—a violent blow on the head with the fist, three weeks before, would be quite sufficient to account for the appearances I found—I have no doubt that he was a man of intemperate habits, which very much increased the effects of the blow—if there had been any external mark three weeks before his death, it most probably would have been absorbed before I made the post-mortem examination; but when I was</p>

               <p>first called in I examined him, and saw no marks of a blow—there was a slight tumefaction, but it is impossible to say whether that was not through a blister he bad been subjected to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might this appearance that you found on the brain be the result of something other than a blow? might it not result from a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or violent excitement; but the symptoms were all local—the congestion throughout was on the right side—there was congestion through-out, but principally on the right side—I had attended him on several occasions before—I knew the connexion which existed between him and the prisoner—f found the right lung very much diseased—the left was diseased also, but that was not the cause of death—he could have lived for years—that did not accelerate his death at all—all the other organs were perfectly healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that she never struck that deceased; that when she went to see him, he said to her, "Good bye, God blest you and protect you, as I shall not be here long to look after you; for that row a few weeks sines in Green Man's-lane has finished me at last!" that he had also fallen from an omnibus and injured his head, and that he neater alluded to her having given him a blow, not having thought of anything so untrue.</hi>

On the morning of 21st December I examined the prosecutor's premises—I found the back door had been forced, an entry had been made into the kitchen, and thence into the shop—I received information from Mr. Swift that a quantity of boots had been stolen—I saw the front door; the lock had been taken off from the inside—I made inquiries, and heard nothing until 28th December—I then went with Constable All day to No. 1a, Coldbath-square—I went into the second-floor front room, and saw the prisoner Henry Reading in bed—I told him to get up—this was between 12 and 1 o'clock at night—he sat up in bed, and said to James Reading's wife, who was sitting down on a chair, I did the job; they have got me now"—I had only told him to get up, nothing more—I took him into custody—he said, "Will you let me see Mr. Somers?"—I asked him who Mr. Somers was—he said his master, the landlord of the Cobham's Head—T went there, and Mr. Somers had gone to bed—this was on the night of the 28th or morning of the 29th—at the station he gave his address, 6, Warner-street, Clerkenwell—I went there, and, searching his rooms, I found this instrument (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the head of the bed—I compared it with the marks of the back door of Mr. Swift's house, and found they corresponded with such an instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you took Henry Reading, was he in a state of intoxication? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I perceived—I should not like to swear</p>

               <p>that he was partly recovering from the effects of it—when I went to the house at Warner-street, Clerkenwell, I found an old woman there, named Elizabeth Humphrys, the landlady—the wife of James Beading was in the room when Henry Reading used this extraordinary expression—she was taken into custody by Allday, another constable.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 73). I received information with regard to the robbery at Mr. Swift's—that was, I believe, on the Thursday after-wards—I went on the night of Friday, 28th December, with the last witness, to Granville-mews—while I was standing at the top of the mews, talking with Brown, the prisoner James Reading came up—I went to the top of the mews with Brown, and he said, "That is the cabman I saw"—he pointed out James Reading, who was coming up at the same time—Reading then turned down the mews—I followed him down, and told him I wanted him for being concerned with others in breaking and entering the premises of Mr. Swift, of High-street, Camden-town—he said, "Oh J I must go with you then"—I then took the prisoner's hat off—on searching him at the station, I found on him a key, a knife, and eight shillings in silver—at the station he gave me the address, 1a, Coldbath-square—on going up stairs, I met a female on the first floor landing, I followed her up stairs, and she went and unlocked the door of the second-floor front room—I went in, and on searching the room, underneath a box in the left-hand corner, I found this pair of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then proceeded to Mr. Swift's shop, Camden-town, and took the boots to him—he identified them—I did not then show them to James Reading—I did on the way to the police-court on Saturday morning—I asked him how his wife came in possession of this pair of boots—the boots were with me at the time—he said, "I bought them last Saturday night, outside the Maidenhead public-house, King's-cross, of a man who I do not know"—I said, "How do you account for your time on the morning of the 21st?"—he said, "The first job I took Up was at King's-cross, I then set it down three or four doors this side of the Mother Redcap, Camden-town; I then put on the rank in High-street, Camden-town, and got off at a quarter to three, to the Mother Shipton, which took me from that time till a quarter past six, when I arrived at King's-cross"—the Mother Shipton is about a mile and a quarter from High-street, Camden-town, up the Hampstead-road—he said, "I put up at the yard at half-past six."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you took him into custody did he attempt to run away, or make any opposition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he went with me quietly—Elizabeth Reading gave no account of these boots, and so I took her in custody for receiving them well knowing them to be stolen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had been at the Mother Shipton on that night, it would bring him into the neighbourhood of High-street, on his way back, would it not, about the time the robbery was committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he could pass by Were, decidedly—he would pass by there, by Old St. Pancras, on his way to King's-cross—if he had got any sort of a horse that would go, he ought to go in an hour, or less than that—there is a coffee-stall at the end of Warren-street, about six or seven doors from Mr. Swift's shop—I do not know whether he had any coffee or not.</p>

               <p>that what he wrote on the opposite side was quite sufficient for me—I did not get him to sign over the stamp in the morning—I thought of that afterwards—I did not think it necessary to ask him to sign it in the morning—I asked the barmaid to watch for his coming in the evening, and before he went into the parlour, as was his ordinary rule, he came into my little parlour and signed over the receipt—he had not been in the house five minutes then—my barmaid is here who saw him sign it—he was as sober as he is now, I never saw him the worse for drink—he staid till 12 o'clock that night: after signing the paper—he came about 9; that was his usual time; he came every evening—this "I hereby undertake to pay," was written by the defendant at his office in the morning—I did not ask him to write it—he said, "I will give you something to satisfy you," and he wrote that—I was proceeded against with regard to the, bill, but the matter has been stopped, Mr. Appleyard came and said, "Let us be friends," and stopped the action—a writ was issued against me—it was an action of trover for unlawfully detaining the bill—I never had the bill—Mr. Hart would not give it up; it was impounded in the County Court—the action was not brought against me in the name of Hart—he admitted at the County Court that the signatures were his own—he did not say that he did not know what he was signing at the time—the judge put the paper in his hand three different times, and asked him if they were his signatures, and he said, "Yes, they are "—the judge asked how he could account for its coming from me, and he said, "I cannot account for it in any way; he brought the money in the morning"—he said at first that I put the money on the table, then that he saw it in my hand, and he said he must have signed it inadvertently, and I must have stolen it from his office—I don't know anything about this endorsement of "cash, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on the I.O.U.; I never saw that till now—I gave the L.O.U.—it is in my writing—I don't know in whose handwriting the endorsement of "cash, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." is; it is not mine; I never saw it before—no messenger from the defendant applied to me for the payment of this 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before the summons was issued—there was a messenger came, but she did not come for that—I saw her—Mr. Hart was in the habit of sending to me for small amounts of money—she did not say a word about coming from Mr. Hart for payment of the balance of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she brought a note to me—I don't know where it is—on his (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a note that came from him; it was one of this kind—it may not have been this note—I have received notice to produce it, but I have not got it and cannot tell where it is; perhaps it is burnt.</p>

I am a rope merchant, and live at Pensbry, in the Walworth-road—on 20th December last, I was going to lunch at my son's brewery in Whit ecbapel—it is my custom to go there almost every day, and I generally pass up Little Alie-street—that is the direct road—I generally wear my coat as it is now, unbuttoned—I have an over-coat—I had a watch with a gold chain across mywaistcoat which could be seen, on 20th December—I generally wear it in that way—the chain was visible—it was u near a quarter to 1 as could be—the prisoner Williams came in front of me, took my watch out of my pocket, caught the chain, and broke it—I caught the chain in my left hand, and this piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was left behind in my hand, and the watch and the other part of the chain were taken—Williams did not say anything to me before he did this—as soon as he had got away I called "Police!" and "Stop thief!" and then some one tried to put their legs between mine and trip me up—I could not see who that per-son was—Graham then came up and hit me on the ear and I was knocked or kicked down—they then ran away—I have not the slightest doubt as to the identity of Williams and Graham—it was a bright clear day—the value of the watch and chain was about twenty guineas.</p>

I live in Tenter-street—on Saturday, 8th January last, I went with a friend to a concert hall, and then went to a house No. 2, Little Turner-street, Commercial-road, with a girl—I saw the prisoner Kinkin there—he spoke to me first, and gave me a cigar and a glass of ale—I sat down with him, and he got taxing me whether I was a thief—he asked me if I was a <hi rend="italic">gollof</hi>—I found out afterwards that means "a thief"—I told him "No"—he said, "I know a party who was in the <hi rend="italic">steel</hi> with you," I have since ascertained that that means "Holloway prison," and a girl who was there said she knew I was—Kinkin then said to me, "I have just come from Plymouth; I have been out of the way, as I was concerned in a robbery in Whitechapel, for knocking an old gentleman down for his watch "—he also said that Graham and Williams were remanded till Tuesday:—he mentioned their names—he said that all he was frightened of was Deible</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280060"/>
               <p>and Dunnaway, as he was frightened they would apprehend him—I went to the police-station on the Sunday afternoon—they gave me directions where Deible lived, and I saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have been in Holloway, have you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I was never taken up for anything—this was a brothel that I was in—I am a bricklayer and plasterer by trade—I am in work now—I am always in work—I am with my father—he is not the only person I have been with—I don't frequent concerts much—I have never acted as spy for the police—I found a party out for Deible, at least I gave him the party's address—he asked me if I knew the party, and I said I did—it was an affiliation case—I was not the father of the child—I swear that—I have done nothing else for Deible besides that—I did not seek after some thieves for him some time ago—I have never done anything for Dunnaway—Kinkin's face is familiar to me—I had this conversation with him at once.</p>

                  </hi>. My mother was a widow, and lived at 21, Nelson-street, Victoria-dock-road—she was living there on 31st December—her name was Caroline—the prisoner lodged at our house with his wife—there were other lodgers—the prisoner came home on Monday night, 31st December, from 6 o'clock to half-past—he was in drink—he came into the kitchen—the other lodgers were there—he sent out for a pot of ale—I fetched it—my mother was then in the front parlour, locked in the room—after I had fetched the ale the prisoner drank some of it—I do not know what he did after that—I went out of the kitchen soon, and went to where my mother was—the prisoner kept asking for mother—she heard him but did not answer him—she let me in, and after I was in I locked the door again—while I was inside the room with my mother the prisoner came to the door and knocked several times—neither of us answered him—after some time he said he should burst the door open if mother did not open it—my mother said that if he did he should pay for it—the prisoner swore at her—he then burst the door open, and struck her with his fist over the right eye—it was a very serious blow—it did not knock her down—I saw blood; she wiped it off with her apron—upon the blow being struck I rushed off the sofa between my mother and the prisoner—when the blow was struck there was no one in the room but myself and my mother—I called for two young men</p>

               <p>Taylor and Thornton, two of the lodgers, and they came and took him out of the parlour—after that my mother left the room almost directly, and walked into the kitchen—the prisoner was there—he used some very foul language, and said what was in his room was his—my mother said, No, they were hers—she was excited, through the prisoner's language, and one thing and the other—she said she would go out and fetch some one to put a stop to it and she ran out of the kitchen straight into the parlour—after she had gone I heard her fall—the prisoner remained in the kitchen—I went into the parlour directly I heard the fall—I found my mother on the ground, lying flat on her face—I tried to raise her—I found she was insensible—I could not raise her; she was too heavy; she never spoke to me—I never saw her breathing.</p>

               <p>then came out of the parlour into the kitchen; after staying some time, hearing the prisoner coming downstairs again she went into the parlour again and locked the door—the prisoner went and knocked and told her to open the door—she did not answer—I heard no more till the deceased called me and told me to take the prisoner out—I went in and saw him standing with his hand half open—the deceased was in the middle of the room and her daughter by her side—I persuaded him to come out, and he came into the kitchen—his wife told him to go upstairs and not make a fool and laughing-stock of himself there, and he went to the front door—the deceased then came into the kitchen and said she would not stand it any longer—the prisoner came in and said to her, "Have I done anything to you that you should lock the door in my face, a thing your ever did before, when I was drunk or sober; have you any spite to me that you should do so?"—she said, "No, my lad, but when you are drunk I am frightened"—a few more words passed—the prisoner said that every cup and saucer he took his tea in was his own—the deceased then said she would not have it any longer, she would go and fetch some one who should put him out—she left the prisoner standing in the kitchen and went into the parlour and there fell—the daughter followed her and called to me to come in—I went in and saw the deceased lying on the floor with her head on the concertina—I picked her up and saw she had received a blow in the eye—blood was beginning to flow—I laid her on the sofa, got a glass of water, and wiped her eye—I did not know she was dead till two or three more came in—I put the water to her lips—she just gasped at it—when she was in the kitchen she seemed excited and frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of Barking-road—on the night of 31st December, I was sent for to 21, Nelson-street—I found Mrs. Mortlock on the sofa dead—that was about twenty minutes past 8—I examined her, and found a severe contused wound over the left eye, and a scratch over the right eyebrow, and some recent marks of bruises about the arms; no other external appearances—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on 2nd January, in conjunction with Mr. Taylor—on dissecting the scalp, we found some extravasated blood over the entire portion of the left temporal muscle, corresponding to the seat of injury, the mark over the left eyebrow—on opening the head, I found the membranes of the brain much injected, and the convolutions much congested; the ventricles were gorged with sanguino-serous fluid in clots—the entire surface of the brain, and also the base of the brain, was covered with clots of blood—there was no other appearance in the head—the other portions of the body were healthy—the liver was slightly enlarged, and there was some gall stone in the gall bladder—the mark over the left eye was a contused wound—it was a slight wound—the skin was very slightly broken in five or six places—I should say that a blow from a man's fist would have produced it—I believe the cause of death to be extravasation of blood within and around the brain—taking into consideration the great excitement the woman was under, I believe that a slight blow would cause the mischief that I saw—insensibility might come on within a few minutes after the blow was struck—excitement after the blow would hasten the insensibility, supposing the injury to have been caused by the blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is, in other words, if the blood had set in to the brain, the excitement would be the predisposing cause of that, and continue as long as it lasted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course excitement would tend to increase the tendency of blood-vessels to rupture—I do not attribute the death to the scratch over the right eyebrow—I think that had nothing whatever to do with it—I have listened attentively to the evidence given by the two last witnesses—I heard what was said about the concertina, that the woman was discovered with her left eye resting on it—I should say that the appearance I saw, was caused more by a blunt object than by a concertina—what I saw was more like the blow of a fist—I would not take upon myself to say it was impossible for the concertina to have inflicted what I saw—I should not attribute the death to the excitement alone; it might have been caused by great excitement, there was a possibility of it—you can distinguish a laceration of the brain or the membranes by excitement, and by a violent blow—I know what is understood by a counter-stroke—a violent blow given on the front of the head will very often cause death by a rupture at the back—you generally, where death is caused by over-excitement, find the appearances which I found on this person; a general suffusion of the</p>

               <p>surface of the brain, and also clots at the base—I could not say in this case that death was more consistent with excitement than with the blow—she might become insensible from excitement itself, without the blow.</p>

I am a surgeon at Stratford—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I perfectly agree with Mr. Morris as to the state of the brain—in my judgment, the cause of death was the effusion of serum and blood in and upon the substance and surface of the brain, pressure on and within the brain—I think the excitement and the blow together would produce the appearance I saw; but I do not consider that the violence of the blow, as evidenced by the external appearance, would account for the fatal appearance exhibited inside the brain—I do not think the blow was sufficiently violent to produce the fatal lesion—I am not speaking from the mark of the blow, but from the gravity of the internal lesion compared with the evidence of violence—excitement very probably caused it—excitement produced by a quarrel would occasion the appearances I saw—a blow would certainly aggravate the mischief.</p>

I am a private in the Royal Marines, stationed at Woolwich—the prisoners are comrades of mine—on Tuesday morning, 15th January, I got up about half-past 6—I was the first up in that room—After I lighted the gas I saw a lot of small biscuits on the floor, and I said, "Halloa, where have all these biscuits come from?"—there was no answer—that was not the room occupied by Lancaster and Harling—I saw Lancaster afterwards on that morning, and he told me if I was to go up into a room and look up on the shelf over the door, I should see a bag of sugar—he did not occupy the same room as I—he asked me to make away with it—I told him I should have nothing at all to do with it—a little time after that I vent on guard—I saw Lancaster again the next morning—he followed me oat into the passage from the kitchen and said, "Wilson, you are coming off guard and I am going on guard, and I want you to see Harling for me"—I said, "Well, what do you want?"—he said, "I want you to tell him to make away with the silk handkerchiefs and silk, that there may not be a bother about it"—I said, "What silk handkerchiefs?"—he said, "Why don't you know?—I said, "No, I do not know, I should only like to"—he said, "Don't you know that I broke into Butler's lobby the other night?"—I said, "No, this is the first I have heard of it"—he said, "Yes, I did intend to break into it on the ball night, but it was not quite convenient"—I said, "I can't stop to hear any more, I must go back as they will be relieving the guard," and I went away on guard again—when I came off guard I saw Harling—I told him that Lancaster told me to tell him to make away with the handkerchiefs and silk—Harling said, "What do you mean, what silk handkerchiefs?"—I said, "Well, I don't know, you ought to know the best, he told me to tell you"—he then said, "Well, I have got the silk handkerchiefs and the silk, and I am going to make away with then to night"—on the following morning I was in the passage and saw both the prisoners there—Lancaster had just come off guard and I was going up stairs—Lancaster said, "Weil, Harling, have you made away with those silk handkerchiefs and silk?"—he said, "No, I have not, I can't take them out now, because there is a stopper on the gate"—Lancaster made answer, "Well, then, the best thing we can do, to do away with them, is to burn them"—Harling said, "No, let us put them in one of the tanks"—that was all I heard.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lancaster's Defence</hi>. On the night of 14th Wilson and I and Harling were out drinking in the town till about half-past 8. Wilson broke a bottle of rum, and Harling left us and wished us good night, telling a recruit who was there to stop behind. He said, "Lancaster, there is something I want to do to-night, and I hope you will come up into our room and have some rum, and we will go down and put it all right. I went up into the room about 9 o'clock and had a share of the bottle of rum, and Wilson was sitting on the bed with his comrade. I said, "I am going down." He said, "I will be there in about half-an-hour." I went and watched there till about 10 o'clock, when Wilson came down. He said, "Now, Lancaster, Butler is away, I want you to come with me and break into his room; I know there is money in it." I said "Very well, we will go." Somebody came by, and I said, "Go and get into your bed." Wilson said, "No." I went with him to the sergeant's lobby. He took off his jacket and told me to hold it at the door; he took a large tile and broke the door, went in, and picked out four handkerchiefs and a new blue handkerchief, and put them into his own room; he brought two pieces of silk which he gave to me. Next morn<lb/>ing he came and said, "Lancaster I have got half-a-crown out of the recruit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280075"/>
               <p>to get some breakfast," and told me to go to Derby's bag and get some ham. I did so, and he said, "You take and cook it for breakfast". It was then time to mount guard, and Wilson said, "You can sell them handkerchiefs, and spend the money; that will do till we come off guard." I asked Harling if he would come down the town and have a game at cards; we did so, and I said, "Harling, I have a couple of pieces of silk here, I want you to sell them, I have had them in my bag ever since I came home." He did not know where they came from. I am guilty, but Harling is innocent, Wilson was the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harling's Defence</hi>. On 14th I was walking round the town of Woolwich and Wilson and a recruit asked me to go and have some beer with them. I accompanied them part of the way to the barracks and wished them good Bight On the Tuesday, about half-past 2 in the afternoon, Lancaster came and asked me to go out and have a game at cards with him. I did so; we then went to an eating-house, and afterwards, at Lancaster's suggestion, went to a low part of the town, and he pulled out the handkerchiefs and asked me if I could sell them. I asked whose they were, and he said he had had them in his bag a long time. I had not the remotest idea that they were stolen. I gave them to the girl, who brought 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back. I never attempted to conceal what part I had taken in the disposal of the property.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Harling</hi>. On the day I was given in custody Ward came and asked me to give her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said if I felt ever so wiling I had not the money. She said, "Well, I will come up and see if I cannot do you a good turn before the Magistrate in the morning," evidently intending to do me harm. She swore that I went on 17th or 18th and offered the property for sale, when it is known that I was confined in the guard-room on that evening; she afterwards swore that she had never seen me before in her life to her know-ledge. Wilson states that when Lancaster delivered the message to me he saw me in the kitchen; is it not highly improbable that Lancaster should leave my side and go to this man and get a message and deliver it to me; why not deliver it to me in the kitchen?</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, High-street, Deptford, and am a boot and shoe maker—on the 9th, I was passing along High-street and saw a chaise standing at Mr. Mills' door, and Marney peeping through the window and watching the chaise narrowly, which induced me to watch him—he remained like that for two or three minutes, and then waved his hand across the road to Fuller—I saw Fuller go across and deliberately take something out of the chaise—I did not know what it was—I went into Mr. Mills', and spoke to the gentleman whom I saw standing there—I brought him to the chaise—I knew Marney in particular before—it is impossible for there to be any mistake with regard to Marney being one that I saw on that occasion—it was in the evening, between 7 and 8 o'clock—the High-street is lighted tolerably well there—I saw which way Marney went, and took the prosecutor down there—Marney was standing among a crowd of lads, and I picked him out—I said, "This is the man that knows something of your coat."</p>

I live at Cheltenham-place, Westminster-road, and am a tobacconist—on Monday afternoon, 7th January, about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock, I was in the prosecutor's shop, Mr. John Moore, pawnbroker, of Church-street, Woolwich—I heard a noise as if glass was breaking—it appeared to come from the front, from Mr. Moore's window, as though his window was being broken—I ran outside, saw the broken window, and saw the prisoners Steele, Miller, and another, in front—they all three ran away when I went out—I pursued them—I identify Steele and Miller—the other I cannot swear to—I caught Steele and took him back to the shop—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Cumberland</hi>—I was at Sheerness on the night of 24th December—on the morning of Christmas-day I was in Woolwich—I came there on the 24th, and slept there at the house of a man named Jones, a civilian—I had my breakfast in the morning, not with Jones—there were two people in the house—I know the prisoner Jones—the first time that I met Smith on the Christmas-day, was early in the afternoon—I first met Jones at night; it must have been about 8 or 9 o'clock, at the Waterman's-hall, I believe they call it—he asked me to have a game at twenty-fives—we played a game, and I won—I cannot tell who was present then—there were two Jones's—I left that house—Smith and Hudson went with me—they locked arms with me going out—Jones was not, to my knowledge, the first marine there—he was in the house, but whether he was at this time, I cannot say—three left the house, but those two are the only two I can swear to—I changed a sovereign in the Water-man' shall—Smith told me to put the half-sovereign away, and not to put it in my pocket with the rest of the money—I had no quarrel in that public-house—I remember going to the coffee-shop of Mr. Thomas, and having supper—I cannot say what o'clock that was—I think it must have been past 10—three marines went there with me—I firmly believe that Hudson and Smith never let go of me—we went into another house before this coffee-shop—I do not know the third one that went into Thomas's, another man, joined us, and went backwards and forwards while we were having our supper—something was said about a crack, in the first part of the afternoon, when I met Smith—Smith and I left Jones and went together into a house called the Punch Bowl—Jones came out very soon after—he went for a glass of beer—while he was gone for it, Smith whispered to me, "I don't like what that fellow says; 'he whispered in my ear to give you a crack "—I said, "I am very doubtful of that, for I have known Jones a good while and have always found him a manly sort of chap"—I believe there were four of them when we came out of the coffee-shop, and I felt jaded—I said, "I can't get back to Sheerness to-night, and I should like you to show me a lodging as close to the railway as possible;" and they said, "All right"—we went a little further, and I found that two were holding me, but I cannot say which they were—they were feeling about my pocket—I said, "What do you mean, men?"—Smith got his hand into my pocket—I said to him, "After my treatment, is that how you are going to serve me?" and, to the best of my knowledge, he said, "Yes"—then we had a scuffle and they knocked me down—I do not know which knocked me down—there were four present at the time—I recognize Hudson smith, nobody else—I was in good sense—one of them said, "Hold his head up;" and then I expected a blow, and I shut my eyes—I received the blow, and then some-one said, "That's done him;" or "done for him"—I cannot swear to the words—when I recovered a little I lifted my head, and they were coming towards me—I recognised Smith—I said, "Smith, you villain, you nearly murdered me"—I did not know who was taking me to the hospital—the next thing I knew was I found myself in the hospital—I was not quite certain the next day, where I was—I am sure I had a half-sovereign in my pocket while I was at the cook-shop—I am quite sure of that, because when the Magistrate came to me he asked the question, when I changed the sovereign, did I have any gold—I said that I changed a sovereign and had a half-sovereign in gold, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some coppers—I gave a half-sovereign to the woman at the cook-shop—she gave me four half-crowns for it, and I paid for the supper with one of the half-crowns—when I came out of the</p>

               <p>cook-shop I had some half-crowns in my pocket—I did not see them any more—they were taken out of my pocket before I was knocked down, to the best of my belief—I knew that my half-crowns had gone away from me—I do not know who took them, but I can swear that Smith had his hand in my pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> You found my hand in your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you came right in front of me—I cannot swear that you took the money out of my pocket—to the best of my belief I was robbed before I was knocked down—I cannot swear whether you either struck or kicked me, or whether they were kicks or blows that I received—I cannot swear what dress you were in, but to the best of my belief it was the one you have now—to the best of my belief, the first place I saw you at, that day, was the public-house, but I won't be confident to that—I cannot tell the exact time at which it was—I do not know the name of the house—to the best of my belief it was the Warwick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hudson. Q.</hi> Where was the first house you saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief, the same house where I first saw Smith—I cannot tell you what time.; it was before we went to have dinner—you did not go to have any dinner with us—I am not positive that you went to the coffee-shop—you took hold of my arm on leaving the Waterman's-hall—I cannot tell the exact time I went to the coffee-shop—it might be 10 o'clock or a little after—I was quite correct when I was robbed, enough to know to do my duty as a man—at the time you came down with the sergeant-major I had to lift my left eyelid to see you, I could not see anything with my right eye—I did not identify him—I do not know whether t e sergeant-major said, "Be positive"—I did not, to my knowledge, say that I was positive you were not the man—I could not say that, for I could not see you</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Montgrant-square, Woolwich, and am a labourer—on Christmas-day last, about a quarter-past 11 at night, I was standing at the corner of Placid-alley, Woolwich, about a hundred yards from Thomas's cook-shop, and saw Jones, Smith, Ball, one other, and the sailor, five altogether—I have seen the sailor here to-day—they were all standing in a lump round the sailor, talking, for about five minutes—I heard one of the marines say, "Have you got it?"—I could not swear which said that—another one said, "Yes, I have got it"—as soon as he said he had got it, Smith and Ball <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the sailor down, and then I saw Jones and Ball kicking him together—then, after they kicked him, they ran up through the square—the sailor cried out "Murder!" and as soon as they left him I went down to him—I had seen Jones and Smith the same evening before, in company with the sailor, coming down High-street—I did not notice what time that was; about half-past 9—a woman named Jones, also came up to the sailor when he called out "Murder"—I sent her for the police—she came back to me and said she could not find them—the police ultimately came, and the sailor was taken to the Royal Marine Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones. Q.</hi> What kind of a dress had I on when you first saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were in a red coat, but whether a jacket or a tunic I cannot say—it was about half-past 9 when I first saw you—you were not tipsy—I did not see what house you first went into after I first saw you—I passed you by in the street—I was going one way and you were coming the other—the sailor was in your company when I first saw you—I cannot say how long you were in his company—I was not watching you—I cannot say which feet you and Ball kicked with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Smith. Q.</hi> What time do you say it was when you saw me with the sailor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half-past 9—I saw three of you coming down the street together—it was a quarter-past 11 when I found the sailor down—I stood there for about five minutes—another man, a civilian, came down at the time—that was a brother of mine—I gave an alarm—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out "Police!"—we did not both stand near while the police came—my brother went indoors—he lives about two or three minutes' walk from there, I should say, I cannot say exactly as to the distance, I have not measured the ground—when my brother came down he said it was a shame to see the man treated like that—I did not interfere with you at all—my brother went with me to the sailor after the marines went away—he was having his supper in-doors, and after He heard "Murder!" he came out—he had neither cap nor coat on, and he went back and put them on and then came down again.</p>

I keep the Nag's Head public-house in York-road, Battersea—on the morning of 20th April I went into the bar and found the bar door open, a screw drawn out of the box-staple, and the staple drawn back—I found a wooden bowl which had contained silver the previous evening, lying empty on the counter—I went outside; a policeman was passing at the time; he came in and found that Rome one had gained entrance in the public parlour at the rear of the premises and that the perforated zinc blind that was put there was broken away from the window, and the window thrown up—any one could easily step in—I looked about and missed a tin box, containing above five pounds' worth of halfpence, from a cupboard underneath the counter; from a desk in the bar three pounds worth of silver, done up in separate parcels; and about one pound's worth of loose money from the till—I also missed a gold finger ring, three gold shirt-studs, and four silver spoons from the desk—I afterwards found the tin box up at the end of the garden, very nearly thirty yards from the house, empty—before that I missed an overcoat, a pilot jacket, and an ordinary coat, and discovered a cord jacket in the kitchen—this overcoat, studs, ring, and pilot jacket are mine—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the ring is not here—the four silver spoons belong to the executors of the late George Pinnock—this is the jacket I found in the kitchen—the bar was secure the night before—I did not fasten the window—I fastened the bar door and the outer door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I am a detective—on Monday afternoon, 7th January, I received directions from Messrs. Budd, and went in plain clothes to Princes Dock, Rotherhithe—I got there about twenty minutes to 5 o'clock, close by the dock, and saw Graham's wagon loading some old sheathing in front of the dock—Jelf, Percival, and some others whom I could not see, were bringing the metal from the dock to the wagon—Preece was in the wagon packing the metal—I saw a man named Sullivan there (<hi rend="italic">See last case</hi>)—I followed and apprehended him, and after taking him to the station I returned to the wagon and found it had turned down Paradise-street, and drawn up at a public-house—it had turned to the right instead of the left—Preece was the driver of it—Clark's Orchard is at the back of that public-house—as I turned the corner to meet the wagon I heard the metal rattle, and a roan who had picked some metal off the wagon ran through the narrow court at the side of the public-house into Clark's Orchard, carrying some metal under his arm—I have not ascertained who that was—as I drew nearer I saw another person, who I believe to be Jelf, take another armful of open squares of metal and leave the wagon with it—it was like this sheathing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the man in the wagon trampled it down so as to lay close in the wagon like sheets of paper—when I first turned the corner Percival and Preece were drinking out of a pint of porter between the tail of the wagon and the cart—Percival brought it out and gave it to Preece—Jelf then came back from the court—I am positive it was Jelf—I knew him previously working at the wharf—Harris then ran through with another armful—Jelf saw me and held up his hands, giving a signal to Percival, who was shifting the metal down towards the tail-board where the others were removing it from—I ran before Percival and followed Harris across Clark's Orchard, and caught him half way through the wicket-gate of Mr. McGregor's house and half out—Clark's Orchard is a narrow court, more like a mews than a street—I caught hold of his collar, and part of the metal dropped inside McGregor's and some outside—we had a struggle—he was stronger than me—we had several ups and downs and he got away, and I have not seen him since—he ran past the wagon, and Percival and the others who were there never offered to stop him—the wagon then went on—I went hack and picked up the metal that laid outside, took it to the station, and came back with another constable to McGregor's, and rang the bell several times, as the wicket-gate was then shut: I did not see it open, it must have been shut in the scuffle, I suppose—I rang the bell three or four times, and at last Mr. McGregor came down—I said, "You have some metal in here which some men have been</p>

               <p>bringing; I want to see it"—he said, "No, I have not; there has been no metal brought in to-day"—I said, "I know better, for I have seen two lots come myself—I asked him where he kept his metal and he took us up stairs—the house is like a mews, there is a pair of folding-gates and rooms over them, but nothing like a shop—I went to the first floor, and at the top of the landing there was a little square place, where there was a little box with a quantity of this metal in it piled up—there were scales and so forth on the landing—there was none lying on the landing, it was all doubled up in this form and put in the box—these small squares are where the folds were—I said, "How do you account for the possession of this V—he said that he bought it of some one whose name I forget, and had got a receipt for it—he called his daughter to bring the receipt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the name he mentioned is the name that appeared on the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "King and Queen Dockyard, November 14, 1860.—Received of Mr. McGregor 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment of 9cwt. 2qrs. 4 lbs. old metal and nails, for Reedy and Mar-shall, Robert Strachan.")—I said, "This receipt will not do for me, fort his stuff is quite wet as if just brought in, and this receipt is 14th November, and this is 7th January"—it was wet with frost and snow on it—there was very heavy rime that morning, and there was rime on the metal—there was rime on the metal in the wagon—he said, "My man always washes the metal"—I said, "This metal has not been washed, because here is all the frost and snow on it, and if it had been washed that would not have been there"—I took the metal away which had the frost and snow on it, leaving a quantity behind which was dry—I brought away 32 lbs. all with frost and snow on it, that was stacked: the bottom part was dry—I told McGregor that he would be wanted at Greenwich police-court next morning at half-past 9, and said, "I will call for you to go there"—! called for him but he was not there—I was at the police-court all day but did not see him—after I had taken the metal away from McGregor's I went by rail to the prosecutor's premises—the wagon had not come in—I waited for it—Percival, Jelf, and Preece came with it—I told them I should take them in custody for being concerned with others in stealing this metal of their masters—they said that they knew nothing of it, and Jelf said, "When you ran by me I felt struck to the ground, you might have knocked me down as you passed me; I know nothing about it"—I said, "I know better, you were there all the time; you were the person who went with the second lot, you were sent to the end of the court when I went through, and you held up your hands and gave the <hi rend="italic">office</hi> to the others"—he persisted in his innocence—Percival said that he knew nothing about it—I said, "I know better; you were standing drinking with the carman when the other ran through"—he acknowledged drinking the beer, but said that one of them went to the water-closet and he never saw anything of it—Preece said he know nothing about it—I said, "You were standing by at the time and saw all that was going on"—I made the report to Preece's master, and he ordered him to be at the police-court on 15th January—I was there and took him in custody—that was after the first examination—the others were in custody before—I asked Preece how he accounted for going out of his road, as, instead of turning to the left, he turned down Paradise-street—he said, "Percival ordered me"—Percival was not present when he said that—the other would have been the more direct road—he persisted that he knew nothing about it and I said "You must answer that before a Magistrate."</p>

               <p>a few minutes after—it was a little after 5 o'clock when I saw these men running up the court—it was not dark, as there was a gas lamp over the door of the public-house, but it was dark in the street where I was—I saw Jelf coming down the court, and was confident of him at the time—I should not like to swear to him now, but I feel confident because I knew him long before—if he had a pipe in his hand I think I must have seen it, because I spoke to him and said, "I can take you at any time," as I ran by him—if he came out of the public-house it was before I came up—he put his h and up like this, and I considered it was a signal to the others to leave off—Preece was standing between the wagon and the public-house—I was on this side of the wagon—it did not screen them from me—Preece was drinking some beer—I know he saw what passed because his face was to me, and I saw it—I did not take him in custody till after we got to Greenwich—it was only after certain things he said that he was taken in custody—it is not customary for all the carts and wagons to go down Paradise-street to avoid the toll-bar—the bar is t' e other side of Mill-pond-bridge—Preece has been out on bail—his master seemed to think he was as bad as the others, or I do not think he would have had him taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. H. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many houses are there in Clark's-orchard, thirty or forty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say there are—most of them are the same style of houses that McGregor lives in—there is no marine-store shop in that place—I have been up and down and have not seen one—I have not made inquiries for one—I will swear there is not a marine-store shop, but I cannot say whether there is a marine-store dealer's—McGregor may call himself a marine store dealer; I cannot say—I cannot swear that there is not a house in the court with "Marine-store dealer," written over the door, but I looked for one and could not find one—I pulled the bell four times, I think it was, before he came down—he seemed to be a long time coming—when I said that I had seen two lots of metal go in myself I meant that I saw it go through the court—I believe it did go in because I found the stuff there—I did not see it go into McGregor's gate—it is not true that I saw it go in, but it turns out that that was true—when I said I saw it go into McGregor's it was a mistake—Mr. Budd set me to watch—Harris is the man I followed and had the scuffle with—he has been out of town since, but there is a true bill found against him—I ran after him, seized him, and pulled him back as he was stooping, going in at the wicket gate—his head and shoulders were in, and his legs were out—there are two large gates, and this wicket is in one of them, and it was open—I did not see him open it, though I was very close upon him—the metal got scattered about, which he was carrying—there was not above one sheet inside, the rest tumbled outside—I had not a very long struggle with him—we had two or three ups and downs—I picked up 19 lbs. of metal which he was carrying, took it to the station, marked it, and weighed it by itself—several constables saw me do so—the copper was not all mixed up together to be taken to the station—I went down with this first, and weighed it before I took any out of McGregor's house—there was no snow that day, but there was a very heavy rime—the trees and everything were loaded with hoar frost—I mentioned snow to McGregor: there was snow on it, because there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280093"/>
               <p>snow on the ground, and this had been doubled upon the ground—it had not been snowing that day, but the yard was covered with snow—I have not told you that when I said snow, I meant hoar frost—there were pieces of snow doubled up with it, which it had picked up in the yard, small pieces which hung to the metal; there were no lumps—McGregor's daughter brought a file with bills on it, and this bill was near the bottom—the copper that I took away, was lying at the top of other copper—I dare say there was a hundredweight or more, doubled up in the same way—my first question to him was, "How do you account for the possession of this metal? pointing to the lot; and he produced this receipt—the question in my mind only had reference to this—I knew that all that lay there could not have been brought in—I alluded to what I saw go in, and pointed to the metal—this is my signature to this deposition—(<hi rend="italic">This being read stated</hi>, "When I asked him how he accounted for the possession of the metal, it had reference to the whole, about one hundredweight; the wet metal was on the top.")—I had not separated the two metals then, but this was lying on the top—I had never seen McGregor before—there was no sign of any business only inside—his dwelling-house is upstairs, over a place which appears to have been a coach-house, into which the gates open—there is a large place behind the gates—after you have got into that space there is a slight partition—it has been a large building, and is separated off—there is a ceiling over it—it is not a warehouse—there was a bed lying on the floor, and he said that was where his man slept—there were a lot of crucibles there to melt metal in, but I did not see any metal—there were lots of ashes and such stuff as that, as if it had come from some furnace—I did not empty the tuba of ashes—I went up stairs, but did not go into his room—I never heard the name of Ben brook mentioned, till it was mentioned at the police-court—I was then asked about Ben brook, and said that I had never heard his name mentioned—I said, "I do not think Benbrook is the name of the person he said he bought the metal of, the name of the person was on the invoice"—that is what I say now—I never heard him mention the name—Benbrook is the only name that was mentioned—when I drew McGregor's attention to some metal as well, he did not say that he bought it from Benbrook—the name of Benbrook was not mentioned—I drew his attention to it being wet, and he said that his man had washed it—with regard to his not appearing next day, I believe his solicitor, Mr. Cockle, explained before the Magistrate that he misunderstood what station to go to: and he may have said that would produce him next day if required—I do not remember the Magistrate stopping Mr. Cockle, saying he did not want to hear him, he was quite satisfied—Mr. Cockle, I believe, applied for the summons—I saw three lots of metal go down altogether—the second was, I believe, taken by Jelf—the metal taken from McGregor's was carried away by me and the other officer together—it was doubled up in three, not exactly as it is now, because we put it in a sack—it was weighed at the station—I mean to say that we took 32 lbs. of metal from McGregor's—we each took some—we went together to the station—I went with it, and gave some to another constable to carry—he accompanied me to the station, and then it was all put together—what we picked up on the road was in sheets, not doubled up; but we doubled it up to bring it here—we marked it first—the parcels have been kept serrate—the tail board of the wagon was down level with the bottom of the wagon—it was on chains—I told the Magistrate that it was all mixed together, because we put it together; but it was not mixed before it was marked—it was marked at the police-station—it was not mixed before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280094"/>
               <p>it got there, nor did I tell the Magistrate so, nor did he say it was very wrong, that I remember—I cannot swear he did not—on my oath it was not mixed before we got to the station; it could not be—this is the lot that we found on Harris, and this is the lot that we found at the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs. Budd, copper smelters, 13,. Upper Thames-street—I know a vessel named the <hi rend="italic">Gwalior</hi>—I had provided the metal sheathing for her in 1858, at the commencement of January in that year—I arranged with the owners, Messrs. Robert Henderson and Sons, to strip her and fresh sheath her—I transacted the business with Mr. George Henderson, and I know for a fact that the ship is his—I gave orders for the old sheathing to be brought back—it is worth 7 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound in exchange, and the new sheathing is worth 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>

Do you know whether, as a matter of practice, that sometimes over the actual weight is generally taken to allow for the dirt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My instructions to the foreman who represents Vivian and Sons, are, that they Should get fair weight between man and man—sometimes the weather is very wet, and I have frequently set questions at rest for them: we do not buy dirt, we buy metal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.
