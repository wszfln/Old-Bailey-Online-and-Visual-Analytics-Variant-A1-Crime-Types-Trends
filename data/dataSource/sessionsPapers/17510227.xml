            . The prisoner brought the horse to me on Tuesday, the 22d of Jan. about nine o'clock in the morning: he had three white feet, a blaze down his face, and two wall eyes. I work with Mrs. Clayton. The prisoner ask'd if our bailey was at home. I said I expected him every hour. He said, he heard my mistress wanted to buy some horses, which she did. He staid some time, but seem'd very uneasy; often looking out, as though he suspected every body he saw. I sent the boy to inquire at a house in the town for our bailey; who return'd, and told me, the prisoner had been at that house and proffer'd the horse for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270003"/> nine guineas ; which the prisoner said was true. Then I said, I am but a poor man, and could not afford to give much; but ask'd what I should give for him; adding, I would give him 3 l. 10 s. Upon which he pull'd me by the collar, and whispering, said, you shall have him for the other ten shillings. I answered, no. Then he said I should have him. So I gave him a shilling earnest, and said, if he would fetch a voucher to tell how he came by the horse, I would pay him the remainder of the money; otherwise I would not. Then he told me his father's name was

Then I offer'd to be 9 d. towards that charge; but he said he would not send, he would go himself. I answered he should not go. So we held him, and he struggled with us, till we tore his cloaths; and at last we, with much difficulty, secured him. The next morning I went to enquire after his father, but found no such man lived there; and calling at a house to get my breakfast, I heard the prosecutor had been about there to seek after such a horse, and subscribing the prisoner. Thus having obtain'd the prisoner, and found the prosecutor had subscrib'd him, I went to the prosecutor's house on the Wednesday, about one o'clock; when I saw his wife, and told her, I had got a man in curtisey. She said her husband was gone to London to have the horse advertised. She sent a man after him, and he came back and went along with me, and owned the horse.</p>

            . When the prisoner and the other man went away, there came a link by the door; I going the same way, took the benefit of it. I came up with them in about three quarters of a mile walking: when I was about 20 yards behind them, I saw the china mug in the prisoner's hand; the prosecutor had told me of it before, and I had been privately looking about the house with him for it, and he told me he suspected the prisoner had it. So I went up to him, and took him by the collar, and said, Jack, that is Mr. Nash's mug, give it me; he put it into his bosom, then he took me fast by the collar. I cry'd out I had stop'd a thief; the person along with him stood close by us, but neither assisted me or him. I said again, he had robb'd Mr. Nash of a china mug. Then he threw it over a wall belonging to the Widow Withers. I went and knock'd at the door, and got a candle and lanthorn, and went into the yard behind the wall, and pick'd up the mug<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270004"/> broke in pieces. The pieces were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor, and one of the same pattern compared with it, which he brought.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Nash's house this night, and drank four or five pots of slip. After the reckoning was paid, Mr. Ambler and I went away together; I fell down three or four times, and I pick'd up this mug near a pair of gates where lay some dung; I did not know whether it was a common white mug or a china mug; and in walking about a quarter of a mile, this Mr. Scot came after me, and said I stole it. So I shov'd him up against the wall, and threw it over the wall.</p>

In a hurry, betwixt 9 and 10 o'clock on Sunday night, I accidentally left my key in the lock where this money was, there it remained all night; on the Monday morning, betwixt eight and nine, I went to my desk, the first thing I saw was the key in the drawer; I immediately drew it out, and saw my two bags were gone.</p>

Looking upon. my desk, I found the key of my chamber door lying there. The prisoner was taken the same day at Shadwell. I went there: the first thing I asked her was, about what time she took this money. She said, she took it out after she had lighted the fire; that she went in in an unlucky hour; seeing the key there, she open'd it, and was tempted, seeing a yellow bag, to see what was in it; and seeing a large parcel of gold, she took it away. She made this confession in presence of several gentlemen, and never denied it. The yellow bag was produced in court, with the letters

            . I live in Shacksby's Walk, Shadwell. The prisoner at the bar came to my house the 18th of February, about a quarter after 11 o'clock. I had little or no knowledge of her, but she knew my daughter. She staid till seven o'clock. I found she had shew'd this money to my wife. My wife told me of it. I said to her, my dear, you have got money about you, tell it, that it may prevent any mistake, &amp;c. She took it out, but could not tell it. She drop'd one guinea, and I made her take it up. I saw there were 68 guineas, besides half guineas and Portugal money. (There is now a memorandum in the bag that was made before the justice, it being told over upon his worship's table.) I think in all there is 110 l. 12 s. 6 d. The money was in a dirty linen bag. I never saw the yellow bag in my house, but I saw it afterwards. She told me she receiv'd it for prize-money belonging to her husband. I ask'd her what man of war her husband belong'd to. She could not tell: nor could she tell whether she received the money in Broad-street, or at a banker's. Then she said, she had sold her conosity for 500 l. and such like talk. I sent for a constable and took her up. and took her before justice Bury. The bag was produced in court with the money and memorandum in it, sealed with the justice's seal.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I hung the coat with the other things in the pockets up behind the door in the entry. On the 15th of this month I went accidentally to the shop door, and there I saw the prisoner stand; it was gone betwixt six and eight o'clock in the morning. I had some knowledge of the prisoner, for I once met her by Aldgate, and she ask'd me if I would have my fortune told. I went into Rosemary-lane, and the first woman I met with was the prisoner with the coat in her apron. The things were not in the pocket when I found it again.</p>

               <p>I met an old woman who desired I'd go and pawn this old coat of her son's for her, saying she should be obliged to me.

               <p>Whereas a young woman pick'd out of a young man's pocket, that was in mourning, at the prince of Wales's gate, Leicester-fields, a silver watch, with a black ribbon but no seal, maker's name forgot. The person that took it being known, if the does not return it with honour, or send it to S. S. at the plough in St. Martin's Lane, by to-morrow noon, she shall be prosecuted as the law directs; if pawn'd or sold, please to direct to the above-mention'd place, and you shall have your money again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270008"/> with thanks. If returned by the time there shall be no questions ask'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular reason to think a young woman pick'd it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Sunderland. No, my lord. A young woman was some time standing next to me in the crowd, that is all, just by the prince of Wales's gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any talk with this young woman?</p>
               <p>Sunderland. No, I had not, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember you saw the prisoner there?</p>
               <p>Sunderland. No, my lord; I don't remember I ever saw him, before I saw him before the justice. I had advertised in this method, thinking it the best method to get my watch again. I can neither read nor write.

            . I am servant to Mr. Bibby, a pawn-broker in Stanhope-street. This watch ( producing it) was brought to pawn to me the 21st of January. A man, not the prisoner, it was a little man, wanted two guineas and an half upon it. I would not lend it. Then he went out, and came in again, and brought the watch in his hand, and said he'd take 2 l. 5 s. I look'd over the paper to see if it was advertised. I could not find it was. I stopp'd it: he went out again, and brought in the prisoner at the bar. The prisoner said it was his watch, and if I did not deliver it he'd mark me and abused me very much. He was at the door when the other came first in, for I heard a whispering there, which made me have a suspicion. I sent for a constable; he was not at home; and one of our people went out to them; they beat him over the head with a bludgeon. I heard no more of it that night. The next morning it was advertised. I went to inform the prosecutor. I left word; but he was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Is it not out of spite, my lord, that he now gives this evidence against me, from a former quarrel?</p>
               <p>Slatre. He has been a customer of ours, and we once had words; but I declare I have no more malice against him than I have against any one person in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Slatre. He is a gentleman: I believe he is no business at all.</p>

            . I am constable. On the 21st of January, about six in the evening, a servant to the pawnbroker came to my house and desired me to go there, saying, there was a couple of ugly fellows came with a watch, which they had a mind to stop ; but when I came there they were both gone. They told me the prisoner was one of them. I have known him these two years. After that they sent again, saying, there were many people in the street with bludgeons, &amp;c. I was not at home. The next morning I saw the advertisement, and I carried it to the pawnbroker, and looked at the watch, and found it to be the same. I thought the Friday following a proper time to apprehend the prisoner, when the libel was burnt at Westminster. I took him up that day; he did not own any thing of the fact, but said the person with him was named Preston. I went to see for him, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I met this Preston, who had the watch, in Russel-street, near Covent-garden. He had been a midshipman on board a man of war, and I was master at arms, but not of the same ship. I knew him very well in the West-Indies, but never heard any thing to his discredit in my life. He asked me how I did. We went to the black lion to drink some punch: he made an apology he had no money, but he had a watch to pawn. I directed him to Mr. Bebby's, and said he'd give him as much upon it as any body. He desir'd I'd show him the house. I did. He went in, and came out again and said, I can only get so much for it. Said I, then you'll only have the less to pay when you fetch it out again. Then he went in again, and the watch was stop'd. Then I went in, the lad ask'd me if I knew him. I told him I did. He ask'd me if I would vouch for his honesty. I told him I would. The watch was stop'd. As to my going back again, I did not: it is evident I would not, if I thought it was got dishonestly, recommend him to a pawnbroker that I knew, and where I had pawned my cloaths and things several times, and was known very well. When I found he could not stand by it, I beat him, and gave him a black eye. I thought he had got it by some girl he kept company with.</p>

            . I know the other person, but do not know his christian name. He quarrel'd with Mr. Harvey about a watch. Mr. Preston came to Mr. Harvey, and ask'd him to go with him to give him a character, saying he had been to a pawnbroker, and his watch was stop'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>B. Newman. This was at Mr. Harvey's lodging, at the two Brewers in Maynard street, St. Giles's, near the church.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. What day was this ?</p>
               <p>B. Newman. I believe it was the day after the prince's birth day, he went and came back again, and said he believed he was brought into a scrape and would have satisfaction for it, saying he'd beat him for bringing him into it. The next morning he went to Mr. Preston's house and took him into the field, and they fought with their fists as they told me, they came home with their faces broken. Mr. Preston then said he'd give him part of a pot of purl, and said he was sorry he had brought him into that dispute.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen them together since?</p>
               <p>B. Newman. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Sunderland. Is this the woman that stood by you when you lost your watch in Leicester fields?</p>

I have known the prisoner twenty four years, he went to school at the college at Dublin, and he was discharged from general Legonier's horse with a fair character, and also from on board a man of war.

               <p>Slater. It was impossible, my lord, they are near a mile distant from each other, the man only went out and came in again directly.</p>

             for 1. l. 10 s. the prisoner brought it. When I came to settle accounts with Mr. Revil he denied it, then I examined it more particularly, and look upon it to be extremely well forged; I should have been unwilling to have sworn it was not Mr. Revil's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Hankey, Esq; No, I never did, but I am well acquainted with his hand writing; the prisoner was taken up for an attempt of the like kind, and he confessed to me he forged this very note for 1 l. 10 s. and also, after that, before the alderman at Guild-hall, and that he had also forged the other two draughts. He said he had no accomplice, saying, he was himself alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any hopes of mercy to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Hankey, Esq; No, my lord, I did not ; he had no reasonable expectation of mercy, for he said he knew he should be hang'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>

               <p>Hankey, Esq; He had been drinking, but sensible enough.</p>
               <p>The note read to this purport.</p>

             he shew'd it to me; he observed upon it, it was a very small draught for Mr. Revil to draw, and said it was likely the balance of some account, but I had not at that time any reason to suppose it to be forg'd; it was given up by Mr. Revil, and return'd as not allow'd by him. The prisoner acknowledged it to be a forgery to me several times, and also before Mr. alderman Whitaker, before whom they were all three produced.</p>

               <p>Christopher Green. I live at the crown in St. Catherine's street. The prisoner at the bar came, I think, to lodge at my house on the 19th of Jan. he agreed with me for a room for his wife and two children; he staid 7 days; he owed me about 17 s. 9 d. he said he had got upwards of 40 l. due to him at Mr. Revil's, and being to go abroad, said he was afraid he should go away without it. He brought this note for 1 l. 10 s. desired I'd step with it, and he'd get ready; I was willing to get my money, so went to Sir

He, his wife, and all went away; his wife came back about 10 o'clock at night, and said she had had a quarrel with her husband; then he came again, and had got 15 or 16 l. pound about him, and said he had took 20 l. of his money, and that he must go out of town, or he should be arrested. He went out, and came again on the Wednesday, and said he had been arrested, and that his charges came to 7 l. more than he then had: he said he'd call in the afternoon, saying, he had got a note for the other 20 l. and if I would step up with that he'd be obliged to me; he said they would ask me some questions, and I must tell them I came from

            . I am a watchman, my stand is in Pater-noster Row, facing the end of Panyer-alley. On the 7th of Jan. about a quarter of an hour before six in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man; they went up Queen's-head-alley into Newgate-street, one turn'd towards Newgate, the prisoner towards St. Martin's Le grand. I laid my hand on his shoulder and said, friend, what have you got here? said he some old iron, and that he was going to the golden hall in aldersgate street, and if I would go with him he'd give me six pence; said I it is lead, then I collar'd him, he threw it down, and struggled with me, and he offer'd me a shilling to let him go: then another watchman came up, and we brought him to the watch house going through Newgate-market, where he dropp'd these shoemakers pinchers. I went back to Panyer-alley for the lead; and there were found in it two pieces of lead; we weigh'd them and there were five score and six pounds weight.</p>

            . I was drinking with Joseph Wolf about a month ago at Downs's, the red Lion in Gardiner-lane. He said he had got a shirt in pawn, and did not know how to get it out, and was afraid of coming into trouble. (The two prisoners were soldiers.) I having the key of this woman's house, he persuaded me to go along with him to rob it: we went the same day and open'd the door, Wolf broke open the chamber door up one pair of stairs; then he got a hammer and chissel, and broke open three drawers, there being a bag of tools left in the house of Daniel Wright's, he is a sawyer; he took out a pair of stays, a holland shift, six damask napkins, and a damask table-cloth; then we lock'd the outside door, and went to St. Gyles's. Wolf gave a man, a stranger to me, the stays to pawn or sell, who went, and returned with 2 s. 6 d. he gave the man 6 d. for his trouble. We went to an old cloaths shop in Monmouth-street, and he sold the holland shift there for 2 s. after that we met with an old cloaths woman, to whom Wolf gave the six napkins to go to sell for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this woman?</p>
               <p>Moulding. I don't know her, my lord; she sold them, and brought him 5 s. then we went to the two Brewer's in St. Giles's, and he offer'd the table cloth to the woman of the house; she would not buy it, so we went to the brown bear, and sold it for 8 s. and two full pots of beer. Going out at the door I met with

            , who ask'd me what I had been about, and I told him the whole; he said, I am sorry you should let such a fool as Wolf into such an affair, saying, if I had let him know of it, he could have pick'd the lock and made things secure, so that it should never have been found out. Then he and I concluded to go the next day without Wolf, but we were both upon duty at St. James's guard; and as we could not hire our duty of the corporal, we took leave, and deserted our guard, and went to this house at Kensington Gore. We took out a pair of holland sheets, twelve damask napkins, and one damask table cloth; then we came back again to St. Giles's, and from thence to a pawnbroker in Denmark-street ; Martin went in with the pair of sheets. The pawnbroker stop'd them, and told him, if he could bring any body to vouch for him, that he came honestly by them, he would lend him 10 s. 6 d. upon them: he went to one Jenny Monroe, a washerwoman, and they went back; I staid in her house. They return'd, and brought 10 s. 6 d. she said; but Martin said he had but a crown: he went out again, I believe, in about five minutes, with the damask table-cloth and 12 napkins, to pawn at the same place; when they return'd, they said they had got a guinea; so he gave me half a crown and half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share of what Wolf sold?</p>

               <p>Moulding. I had, my lord; I had a shilling out of the stays, a shilling out of the holland shift, and half a crown out of the six napkins; and I had four shillings out of the damask table cloth we sold at the brown bear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you surrender yourself voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Moulding. I discovered it to the serjeant last Tuesday se'nnight, and voluntarily delivered myself up to him.

In about two hours after they came again, and brought a damask table cloth, and twelve damask napkins. I lent him a guinea upon them. He complained his wife lay in, and she said the same.</p>

I found Mr. Hughs had got another will, bearing date the same day; then I had a great suspicion of them.

I called him up and talk'd with him; he denied it. Upon this I carry'd them before my Lord Mayor. The woman confess'd Butler and Herne brought the will to her, and she was to have four or five pounds for coming to swear; and before my Lord Mayor she confessed she knew nothing of

We went to the Dog tavern ; there Herne and Butler both confessed, that the whole was but a forgery; that Herne wrote it in the presence of Butler, and that Butler wrote the name

               <p>Hodgson Bailes. I formerly kept the Three-Tun Tavern, Crutched-Fryers. On the twenty first of November, betwixt ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner applied to me to fill up this blank power of attorney, holding it in his hand, which I did; the writing is all my hand-writing, except the witnesses names and the name of Hardey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when you did it ?</p>
               <p>Bailes. No; we were alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it done?</p>
               <p>Bailes. At the Three-Tun Tavern, in the room they call the Bacchus; he put it into his pocket afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the Three-Tun Tavern now?</p>
               <p>Bailes. One Mr. Floyd, he was in the house then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a woman there, who called herself Harris?</p>
               <p>Bailes. I did not as I know of; Mr. Carr had another power of attorney in his pocket, to the best of my knowledge it was filled up in the same person's name; he said that was blunderingly fill'd up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you sometimes employed in transacting business this way; that is, in filling up powers of attorney?</p>
               <p>Bailes. Yes, I am often; but I never fill'd up a letter of attorney for the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to frequent this house?</p>
               <p>Bailes. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270015"/>Q. Was he not known to be an agent for such persons that wanted such things to be done?</p>
               <p>Bailes. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this an office of intelligence?</p>
               <p>Bailes. Yes, it is; they keep a prize-book to give strangers the best intelligence they can of prizes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other letter of attorney?</p>
               <p>Bailes. Yes, I did; I remember there was a remarkable word, which was Fivety, wrote at length.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that duly executed before a proper magistrate ?</p>
               <p>Bailes. I cannot tell; I do think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When he used to resort to your house, how did he behave?</p>
               <p>Bailes. Very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is an honest man?</p>
               <p>Bailes. I cannot say I think he is, because he did not pay me for what he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be a man of a fair character?</p>
               <p>Bailes. Some people give him but an indifferent one.</p>

               <p>Curle. Yes sir, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sail were there in this fleet?</p>
               <p>Curle. There were nineteen sail.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for persons who come there, to leave their letters of attorney before payment?</p>

               <p>Did he not send a letter from the Old Bailey to your office?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Mason. offer to pay him the money on the Thursday before he was taken up, and the prisoner then refused taking it?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>For what reason do you think Mr. Mason offered to pay him the money?</p>
               <p>Curle. As he had sollicited several times for payment of it, Mr. Mason was very willing to punish him.</p>
               <p>Coun. for the prisoner. The Papers he speaks of, did he say they belonged to this Hardey?</p>

            , upon the account of taking six French men of war the 14th of Oct. 1747. the first distribution was in Feb. 1748. the second in 49, and their claims that were not paid on that day were to be paid on a monthly day for three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270018"/> days from the date of the first payment. On the 22d of November Mr. Carr applied to me at the Navy-office, and told me he had applied the day before, which was the third Wednesday in the month of November, the day of payment, and had been told by the clerks there was not money to pay him. I having the day before given to the clerks a draught of fifty pound, I was surprised they should make that excuse. About two o'clock the next day, which is the time I go to look into and settle the accounts, I told my clerk what he said; my clerk said he told him he came too late, but as he had applied on a proper day, though after the hour for payment, that at any future time he should be paid the money, himself being present at the office. The next morning, being the 23d, the clerk brought me the letter of attorney, and a notation from the prize books of the Monmouth, and in consequence of the orders they had signed by Mr. Carr, they had given him leave to sign the books: he had left the letter of attorney, which the clerk delivered to me, signed

The next time Mr. Carr and I met I told him I was surprized he had imposed upon the clerk with a false message; I observed the letter of attorney was dated November 21, the very day the recal was to be. I thought it was extremely odd, to think a man should be at the expence of executing a letter of attorney, when he might have come, not only then, but any time of payment, and receive that money.

I said, what property? said he, I paid the woman the money, or some of the money, I will not pretend to say which; as some of the prize money had been paid on board the ship, I did not doubt but I could find the man's hand-writing there. Upon which I ordered my clerks to look over the prize list. I found the first payment was paid on board to the party himself, and that he had wrote his name. We compared it with that on the letter of attorney, and we found not the least similitude of hands. Upon which I observed to Mr. Carr, how can you bring a thing of this sort as a credible thing, desiring him to look upon the writing, &amp;c.

            , when it came into my head, that by sending for a notation to the Navy-office we should find whether that Hardey was an able seaman in May 747, and whether he was a petty officer in October 47, and also whether he was dead or alive; so with my own hand I wrote a note to the clerk of the Navy-office, and sent it away immediately. Mr. Carr said, I am obliged to be at the change and cannot stay. The clerk returned and brought a notation, that the man had been able in May 47, rated a petty officer in August 47, and that he died in the March following, on boarding a privateer, upon which the whole affair came out to me. I was at that instant convinced the letter of attorney was a forgery, so I wrote to my attorney to know what must be done. Carr was with me on the Wednesday about dinner time, and he was to come again the next day for a final answer, whether the money was to be paid or not, and before he went away I prevailed upon him to leave the letter of attorney with me. On the same day I had message from him, that he would come about two o'clock, and stay at the three Tuns till five. I sent word I would meet him about two o'clock, this was on Thursday. My attorney came in the morning, he advised a prosecution; Mr. Brett one of the agents came in at that instant, and was made acquainted with the whole affair; he applied to the sitting Alderman for the apprehending Mr. Carr, and the agents and constable were there in expectation of him; but instead of coming he sent me a letter from the Old Bailey, dated half past one o'clock, giving an account he was there to give evidence on a trial; I suppose the affair of

            *. So the constable was dispatched at that time, and the gentlemen went away: but we were told it was necessary to let him receive the money if he pleased, so I thought it would be better to suffer by a payment of that sort in order to make an example of him, than to let him go unpunished for attempts of this sort. On the Friday I was there with the constable at two o'clock, which was the time Mr. Carr was to come there. I was in the inward office by myself, Mr. Carr came there, and was shewn in to me; he came in and told me here is the order from

            . Mr. Sedding had a draught for 19 l. and was to give him 6 s. 6 d. in cash. I think Mr. Carr was in a good deal of confusion at that time. He said if the woman comes to the office, I desire that you will say the money was paid; said I, I don't design to keep a publick office to tell lies for you; said I, will you take the money? No, said he, I know better; then I took him into the inward room, and told him it was found out. He not taking the money, I let him go about his business, and told the constable not to execute his warrant, as I had none of the other agents with me. I met all the gentlemen at night, and told them the affair: they were determined and thought it their duty to prosecute him, then the constable had an order to put the warrant into execution on the Monday. The prisoner was taken up on that day and carried before the sitting alderman, when the alderman asked him how he came to vouch for the woman: he said he had seen

             was in gaol, or I had not proposed to have sent a man to him. I remember I said to him, when he had got the papers in his hand, how came you to be so generous as to trust this woman with 19 l. upon the bare face of a letter of attorney? His answer was, I have done it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. You ask'd the prisoner why this man could not come himself. What was his answer?</p>
               <p>Mason. He said the man was, or had been in goal.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a usual thing for women in this sort of business to employ persons to receive money for them?</p>
               <p>Mason. It is, Sir, but it is very unusual for people to pay poundage, which out of 19 l. must cost 19 s. and they themselves pass by the end of the court where it is to be paid to seek for a person to transact this business for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do women who have got such powers frequently come themselves?</p>
               <p>Mason. I have seen women that live upon the spot frequently coming, persons that live out of town frequently employ persons to come for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you in your conscience think, that if the prisoner knew it to be a forgery he would have continued his sollicitations ?</p>
               <p>Mason. He did do it.</p>
               <p>Counsel. That is not an answer to the question?</p>
               <p>Mason. I do think him all along knowing it to be such by the circumstances that attended it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not willingly leave the letter of attorney with you?</p>
               <p>Mason. I got it from him at last with some reluctancy; when I ask'd him to leave it, he said he believed it not to be necessary to leave it; said I, it is necessary, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you would have given the 19 l. to have had him?</p>
               <p>Mason. I don't remember I said them words, but we were advised to let him take it, and thought it necessary so to do, that he might be brought to justice.</p>

Mr. Carr stood behind me, and said he could bring a number of gentlemen in the parish of St. George's Southwark that can speak to her character, saying she is a woman of reputation: at that time he had not brought the certificate; I said, why don't you bring an order to receive the money, he said he had brought one, and it was in the office; we look'd and could not find it: then Mr. Mason proposed to send to the Navy-office to enquire about Hardey, and in the mean time the prisoner went away, saying he could not stay. He afterwards brought the order under the woman's hand.</p>

             the pin header?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. About a year ago, I believe she lodged at the sign of the Thatch'd house in Mint-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What size woman was she?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. Much such a little woman as I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was she?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. About thirty years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she a married woman, or a widow?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. She is a widow, her husband died abroad.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mint-street in the parish of St. George's?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. It is, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen her lately ?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. No, not to my knowledge these 12 months, I believe she lives in St. Mary Overy's parish now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what station her husband was in on board a ship?</p>
               <p>M. Harris. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am a person who have transacted this sort of business some time, the woman applied to me with a power of attorney, executed before justice Clerk in the Borough, I told her that would not do. I told her it would be better for her to have it done right, saying, it would cost her but half a crown to have another executed before my Lord Mayor; it was delivered to me, I had no view of any advantage in the world in it: as soon as I found it out to be a forgery, I applied to Mr. Mason, and told him I would not take the money, saying, I found I was greatly imposed upon. I know it was impossible for this man to come to life to make this power of attorney, when I found out he died such a time; I never kept out of the way, being conscious of my own innocency.</p>

I keep a kind of an Intelligence-office, my house is a thorough fare to the Navy-office, as men have recourse there to know when they are to be paid; there is a prize book kept in my office for intelligence of this nature, when and where to be paid; Mr. Carr is an agent concern'd in that kind of business, and I never heard any thing to his disreputation before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270023"/> this, he always kept good company and behaved well before me. I remember on November the 21st a woman came to my house, as there is every day, twenty, thirty, or forty men, women and boys, come into my house to ask questions, pray where is such a ship paid, &amp;c. When any body comes to employ a person in this way, as there are several that do the same business as Mr. Carr does that use my house, I deal very impartially with them, I take the first, Mr. Carr happened to be at the bar the very time the woman said she wanted an agent to recover some prize money for the October fleet; I made her answer, that man was as fit a man as any I knew: then I called Mr. Carr, and told him there was such a woman who says she has some prize money due by a letter of attorney, and she would be glad if you will assist her in it.</p>

We were at dinner, and Mr. M'clean came along with her; Mr. M'clean call'd for one of my drawers, and Mr. Carr was call'd out to Mrs. Harris and him; what pass'd then I cannot say.

               <p>Q. Did you hear the name that woman went by?</p>
               <p>M'clean. Mr. Carr drank to her by the name of Mrs. Harris; some time after this, he requested I'd go to one Hardey, to see a letter of attorney executed before my Lord Mayor.</p>

I asked him, if he would come in and drink, she said he was affrighted out of his wits, fearing he should be arrested. We went down the Borough, she went before for some time, and the man was particulary more uneasy than the woman, we turned down to the water-side, to St. Mary Overy's ; then we crossed over the water, and landed at the Three Cranes, and went to my Lord Mayor's Hall, some of the Gentlemen ask'd what the business of that man was? he said, he came to execute a letter of attorney; there was a fattish man which was called for. I walked up and down the hall, and saw them execute this letter of attorney, and he witnessed it, and the man gave him a shilling. Then he went upon the right hand, and came out and gave it to Hardey, and Hardey gave it to the woman, and begg'd of her, she would be as expeditious as she could possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it signed there?</p>
               <p>M'clean. I saw the clerk very busy in writing; I ask'd her, what was the reason he could not come to Mr. Carr himself, and she asked me, if Mr. Carr was an honest man? I told her he was; we came back to the Three Tuns, and one of the waiters told me, Mr. Carr was in the house. He was in a back parlour, I sent in, and told him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270025"/> wanted to speak with him; he said we have done dinner, I am sorry you did not come sooner; he asked me if I saw it done?

               <p>M'clean. I believe I came there after eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hand did you see the letter of attorney first?</p>
               <p>M'clean. Mr. Carr gave it to her, to carry to this Hardey.</p>

               <p>- Humphries. I remember Mr. Carr leaving an order at Mr. Mason's office the 18th of January. I happened to meet Mr. Carr at the Portugal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270026"/> coffee-house, he told me he was going down to Talbot court, and asked me to walk along with him; I went into a Tavern in Talbot court, I sat there a little time, and he came and told me Mr. Mason had detained the order. I told him if Mr. Mason would acknowledge it, or give a receipt for it well and good. I went with him there; Mr. Mason asked Mr. Carr if he would receive the money; No, said he, I know better. Why so? said Mr. Mason. said he, since I have been here last I went to the Navy-office and searched the books, and there I understand

             has been dead two years ago, and therefore he said he believed he was imposed upon by that power of attorney, therefore, said he, I will not receive the money. Said Mr. Mason I had rather than fifty guineas you had taken it, at which I laughed. Mr. Mason looked very sternly at me, Sir, said he, it is no laughing matter; said I, I cannot help laughing at your zeal for taking an advantage of a person. Then Mr. Carr told him, he apprehended he had got a warrant against him, and said, if you have one pray execute it now; and if you do not I shall be upon change every day, or at the Portugal coffee-house. I find, said Mr. Mason, you have been taking advice, and I'll take advice as well as you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Mason say he had a warrant?</p>
               <p>Humphries. I don't know that he said he had.</p>

               <p>Carril. I am his brother-in-law, and a perriwig maker. I believe he is as honest as any gentleman here.</p>
               <p>For the Crown.</p>
               <p>Jos. Hughs. I am proctor at Doctor's Commons. I have known Mr. Carr about two years, I have always looked upon him in a very bad light for two years past. Some gentlemen among us have spoke of him as such, that has been concerned in prize affairs, in one or two I have been concerned in.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him?</p>
               <p>Hughs. I do look upon him to be a bad man.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the ticket-office in the navy. I deliver all the tickets that are delivered. I have known the prisoner from the time of my coming into the office, which was in August last. I was once walking cross the park with another person, and I met Mr. Carr and another fine gentleman in a lace waistcoat with him; as they came near me he just moved his hat and passed me. Said the gentleman with me, do you know that gentleman? yes, Sir, said I; said he, do you know the other gentleman that is in company with him? no, said I: said he, that is a person I don't like, I must have a great regard to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270028"/> what I did with Mr. Carr, he never came to our office above two or three times afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he behave when he used to come to your office?</p>
               <p>Horne. Quite smooth to the last degree, I always behaved civil to him, and always searched the books for him, he used to ask me several questions, in order to get intelligence concerning sailors, such as we call Fishing Questions.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him in the general?</p>
               <p>Horne. I believe him to be a very ill man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boxley. I am along with Mess. Bell and Harrison in Crutchet friers as a clerk, they have dealt some years in the navy way in receiving wages and prize money for sailors, I have known the prisoner by sight about five or six months past.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>

               <p>Boxley. I cannot say I believe him to be an honest man, far from it.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you perceive it last in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Welch. I had pull'd it out of my pocket as I went along with her, fearing I should lose it, and put it into my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person with you?</p>
               <p>Welch. No, my lord, there were only she and I together.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the room before you miss'd your money?</p>
               <p>Welch. Not above ten minutes, I told her I would charge the constable with her, she said she knew nothing about it, we were in a two pair of stairs room backwards, I sat down by her I did not lie down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought you up your rum?</p>
               <p>Welch. A little boy.</p>

             was in the room at that time; I asked what was the matter? the man told me, he had lost a guinea and some silver; he did not know whether 3 or 4 shillings: I asked her how she could come there to rob any body? she hit me a slap on the face, Mrs. Brown said, it is in her mouth; I put my two thumbs to the side of her cheeks, and said she should not swallow it, and the man put his fingers in her mouth and pulled out the guinea; he taxed her with some silver, and some bottle-screws and teeth (I suppose what they call black-a-moor's teeth) but nothing was found but two shillings and two-pence halfpenny in her pocket, and he said he had given her that. He insisted upon sending for a constable, then she beg'd and prayed of me to make it up.</p>

               <p>Welch. I did, my lord, when I first met with her; but I had three shillings besides that, when I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. from a Juryman. What did you give her the 2 s. for?</p>
               <p>Welch. Because we was likely to be concerned together, but it did not happen so.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Brown. I was going up stairs, the prisoner and prosecutor were in the room; the door was shut, the man called out and said, he was robb'd. I said to her, if you have got his money give it to him again; then I saw it in her mouth, so I called the woman of the house up. The money drop'd out of her mouth upon the table, as the woman of the house held her mouth. She was searched, and some odd halfpence were found in her pocket, she said she was drunk when she took it, and desired to make it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going along, that man picked me up; he asked me to go to drink, I carried him to that woman's house, he gave me the guinea to stay with him all night.</p>

             appears to be entered the 16th of April, 46, able seaman; he was discharged from her the 30th of August following, to the Pembrook man of war; the neat money due to him for the Pembrook was 4 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270031"/> 19 s. 3 d. there was a ticket made out for this man's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Redman. Here is a column in our book for that purpose, where it is set forth.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have been paid his wages without producing the ticket?</p>
               <p>Redman. No, my lord, he cannot; that must be produced at the pay office, on the payment or recall of the ship. So that upon producing this ticket, and a proper authority, an indorsement is sufficient, when the sum is under 10 pounds, it is necessary it should be signed by the person and a witness, without which, they would make an objection, and would not pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when it is so signed, is it the method usually to pay the money?</p>
               <p>Redman. Yes it is, my lord, when the person cannot come himself, supposing the debt is under 10 l. it is generally put in such like words, pray pay the money to such a person. I look upon this in the same light as an indorsement, he is shewn the ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you apprehend this to be?</p>
               <p>Redman. I apprehend this to be a very good ticket that was delivered out of our office.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the indorsement on the back of it?</p>
               <p>Redman. This is sufficient for the treasurers to pay the money by.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose there was not such an order on the back side?</p>
               <p>Redman. They could not answer paying the money, if a person buys a ticket without that common form, pray pay, &amp;c. he cannot receive the money.</p>

I suspected that he was an apprentice, being a very young fellow; he told me he was but nineteen years old; I told him as to that, I had no doubt, but he was the very man to whom the ticket belonged, by what appeared to me on the ticket; he said he was no apprentice; I desired he'd bring me some security upon that. I had let him have some money, he returned and said, he could bring no vouchers, but positively declared, he was no apprentice; had he been an apprentice I should have lost it all. I paid him half a guinea more. After I had bought it he made me this indorsement on the back of it, as is customary.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it none upon it when he brought it to you?</p>

            , widow, is my aunt, the prisoner lodged in our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your aunt a house-keeper ?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. She is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your aunt lose any thing lately?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. Yes, my lord, the tenth of February. The prisoner had hired the room about three weeks or a month before we missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What things?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. Things taken out of a chest of drawers in her lodging room.</p>
               <p>Q. There is another indictment for things she took out of her lodging room, I perceive, but you must say nothing of them now.</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. The chest of drawers were not let to her as part of the furniture. She had no right to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were taken out of these drawers?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. There was a green silk night gown, four shifts, a pair of green silk stockings, a metal tweezer case; they belong to my aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these drawers locked up?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. To the best of my knowledge they were locked, but I cannot be certain. There were three handkerchiefs taken ( a cambrick apron, some silver lace, a pair of sleeve buttons) out of a pair of drawers in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. Because she owned it, and told us she had pawned them to three different pawnbrokers;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270033"/> two of them lived in Aldersgate-street, the other in Barbican. I also had been told she was seen in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that examine your drawers?</p>
               <p>M. Boomer. No, my lord, I did not. I found all my aunt's things except the velvet hood, that we could not find. The four shifts of my aunt I had put into the drawers but a little before. Part of the goods produced in court and deposed to.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Had she any promises of mercy or threats made to her when she confessed this ?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. She had favourable promises made her when she confessed the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. By who ?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. Mrs. Boomer promised her if she would fetch them out of pawn she would put it into a debt, a nd the prisoner should pay so much a week till it was out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she was willing to give her credit for them, if she could have them again, was she?</p>
               <p>Shepherd. Yes, my lord, she was. The goods were delivered into Mr. Parks's hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Parks. I am constable, I did not make any memorandum of the day of the month. They brought me a warrant from my lord mayor, and I went along with Mrs. Boomer and the prisoner. The prisoner asked for the things at the pawnbroker's. I took the things to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear these promises made her in case she would confess?</p>
               <p>Parks. They did tell her in my hearing she should not suffer on condition she would make good the damages.</p>

            . I lodge in the prosecutrix's house, I was in the room when M. Boomer, spinster, came into it first of all. She seemed to be in a flurry of spirits, that there were things missing; she asked the prisoner if she took them, the prisoner answered she knew nothing of them: the young woman said I am afraid you are the person that is guilty, still the prisoner persisted in it that she knew nothing of it. After that the gentlewoman came and called the prisoner down stairs to her aunt; and there were proposals made, if she would come to a confession. They said they would make it a debt, and take it as she could pay. I saw the confession she made, I was before my lord-mayor with them.</p>

               <p>M. Dennet. He was at home. I weighed them and agreed for the price; they asked nine pence a pound, I gave eight-pence for the copper, and a penny a pound for the leaden sash weights.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Goodier. It was on Thursday the 24th of January, and the Saturday following they brought the copper kettles; there were twelve pounds and a half. The girl weighed them, and as she had lived with the people who had been here before, I asked her what they had used to give a pound, she told me eight-pence, so I gave it them. I took the porter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270035"/> to sell these goods into Holborn, they stopp'd the man and me. I told them I bought them of two men, but I did not know their names.

               <p>Goodier. By some people who lived in Fleet-lane who had seen them. Mr. Pewterers and I went there; there came the prisoner and two or three more. I whispered to Mr. Pewterers and told him he was one of them; we took him up, and he told us he would bring us to the other. We brought him a good way on the rope-walk, then he got some persons to help us, and we took the other, and some goods. We took them and the goods before the justice, and Mr. Pewterers swore to them.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me betwixt one and two o'clock on Thursday morning. He said, you old rogue you are drunk; said I, I cannot get up, my head achs so. We had been drinking in Cow cross the night before. I got up and went with him to Mr. Pewterers's house; he said there was a very good job to be done, and he would put some money into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what this job was ?</p>
               <p>Hood. It was to open Mr. Pewterers's door in Cow-cross, and see what was in the house to rob it. I went with him to the front door; he had got ten pick-lock keys, and he with one of them, by putting his knee against the door, opened it. I stood by him; then he went in and went backwards into the yard; there were some unfinished tea-kettles stood upon the forge and a shelf, about ten of them. The back door was open when we got in. He took a copper out of that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that place separate from the house?</p>
               <p>Hood. It was a separate place from the house. We went into the house and there took eight sash weights. We did not stay long. The prisoner got a sack and put the things into it, and we went out at the fore door and locked it after us. Then we carried the things to my-house, and we went again to Mr. Pewterers's house and carried more things away. We did not stay above a quarter of an hour each time.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get in the second time?</p>
               <p>Hood. The same way we did the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the fore door after you the last time?</p>
               <p>Hood. We did. The prisoner had got a dark lanthorn, but the wind blew the candle out. I do think he had been in the house before ever he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you think so?</p>
               <p>Hood. Because he said when he came to me, you old rogue I will help you to a good job.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Hood. It was between one and two o'clock. After this, about five in the morning, he came to my house and fetched the things to his house, and bent them all to pieces. He went to two or three shops to sell them, and the people would not buy them, then he said he would go and carry them to Fleet lane, (to this other evidence's,) we did, the girl weighed them, and the man paid the money for them. I believe there were about eight or nine tea-kettles beat all together. The prisoner carried the copper on the other side the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Who bought the sash weights?</p>
               <p>Hood. Goodier bought them. We were twice at Goodier's house. When the prisoner was taken up I was in bed, and Mr. Pewterers came and took me up.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not that witness bring the goods to my house?</p>

               <p>As for what Hood and his daughter have sworn, it is as false as God is true. I declare I never was in Mr. Pewterers's house with him.

I had got a warrant to take up Hood, his wife and daughter.</p>

Steel made himself an evidence against one Long Will, Country Jack and another person: Mr. Pewterers was bound over to prosecute them; the prisoner was in the roundhouse at that time the justice admitted Steel to give evidence against them three; and he also sent a detainer to detain this Hood, for receiving these goods knowing them to be stolen. I returned the recognisance to Hicks's-Hall, for the prosecution of those three persons. The evidence Steel is in Clerkenwell Bridewell now.</p>

            . About a month or five weeks before I was taken, Country Jack, Long Will and Hodges, wanted me to go with them; I told them I was going home, so I consented; we went with an intent to rob any body. We went down St. John's Street, then into Cow-Cross. The first attempt we made was at a shed, we could not get in at a window there, then we went to White's-alley, in Cow-Cross; there Country Jack got over into a back yard, and returned again with a bag and some tea-kettles in it; one of them fell out when we got the bag into the alley, I took it up, and put it in again, it was not finished: I made the best of my way to Chick-lane; about a week after, I met Country Jack going up Snow-hill, he said, he was not afraid of being taken. I asked him for my share of the money, I threatened him because he would not give me any.</p>
               <p>Q. What were there in this bag?</p>
               <p>Steel. There were several tea-kettles, but I cannot swear to any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he get them?</p>

               <p>Steel. It was after Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you in company?</p>
               <p>Steel. There were four of us.</p>

               <p>Steel. No, my lord, he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night did Country Jack get these goods?</p>
               <p>Steel. Between two and three in the morning: we helped him over the pales.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He knows nothing of the matter; my back yard is next yard but one to the alley, and out of the alley near the first pales there lies timber, so that a man may walk up to the top of the pales the same as going up steps.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Which were taken up first, the four persons or the prisoner and Hood?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The four men were.</p>
               <p>Q. to Steel. When did you make this confession?</p>

I was just got into bed. I said it was the cat, she said she was sure she heard the drawers move as they opened, and somebody stir the fire. I arose and went down and saw nobody; I searched the coal-hole. I went to bed again, and lay till five o'clock next morning. As I was making a fire, I heard a great snoring, I looked into a place<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175102270037"/> where I lay my coals, the place were I had looked in before; there I saw a man's legs as far as his breeches knees. I went out and called a neighbour or two, he was snoring hard when I came back, I took him hold by the shoulders, and when he got up, I found him to be a neighbour's son, the prisoner at the bar, he is about seventeen years of age. I asked him, what he did there? he said two strange men shov'd me in at the window after they had made him drunk. I asked him, what he came there for? he said, to carry away all he could find. A little time afterwards he said one of the men was named Hargrave, and some time after that, he said the other was named Stevens; he owned the same before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what window?</p>
               <p>E. Markham. No, he did not, but I believe I know which window; but I cannot say whether the same window was open or shut over night, neither can I say for certain, which window he came in at ; there was a little wooden sliding shutter to one pane of glass that was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he meddled with any thing?</p>
               <p>E. Markham. No, he had not; I missed not any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>E. Markham. I did not, my lord, he confessed opening the drawers, and shutting them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any things in the drawers, that he could take away?</p>
               <p>E. Markham. Yes, my lord, there were, which he might have put into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in liquor?</p>
               <p>E. Markham. He was, my lord, I don't know but he may be an honest lad.</p>

I am daughter to the prosecutrix; on the 23d of January, about 12 at night, I heard something come slump upon the stairs; I thought it was the cat, and I heard the drawers open in the kitchen, and the fire stir; I went to my mother, she was a-bed, we went down into the kitchen, I opened the drawers and found nothing gone; my mother looked in the coal-hole and saw nobody there, we went to bed again ; next morning about 5 o'clock, I heard my mother come up stairs again, after she had been down, very nimbly out of the kitchen and opened the street door; I asked her where she was going, she said to me hold your tongue, saying, there was a man asleep in the kitchen ; she called two of our neighbours in, I went down stairs, and saw them bring the prisoner out of the coal-hole; I heard my mother ask him, what he came there for? he said two men pushed him in at a window.</p>

            . I don't know whether it was open or shut, he did not wrong us of any thing; there were many things about the kitchen and in the drawers, that he might have taken if he would. I believe he was very much in liquor; I have known him ever since he was a child, he may be very honest for what I know.</p>
