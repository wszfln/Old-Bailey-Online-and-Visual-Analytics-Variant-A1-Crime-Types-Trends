                  </hi>. I am in the service of James Schoolbred and others. The prisoner came into their service in April—it was his duty to take goods out to various customers, receive the money for what he sold and account for it the same day—he was to show me the goods he took before he went out—on the 18th of July, he brought certain goods to me before he went out on his journey—I took an account of the pieces, and advanced him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that he might require for change—among other places he was to go to Mrs. Duncan's, in Torrington-square—on his return he gave an ac<lb/>count to me of what he had sold to Mrs. Duncan, which I took down—(reading) "7 1/2 yards of long cloth, at 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 2 pairs of gloves, at 21<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;—1 pair of gloves, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and one, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 3 handkerchiefs, at 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and two at 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" six items amounting to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not appear to be drunk when he came back—I did not remark any<lb/>thing—I had a settlement at the time about the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I had advanced as change—I found out some mistake, and he was dismissed that night—he accounted to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I spoke to him afterwards about having given him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he said there was some mistake, he would see—he went up stairs and got some other money and tried to make it out as well as he could—he did not make it out—when I advanced him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he gave me an I. O. U.—he tore that between his teeth—I saw him do so—it was afterwards found—this produced is it—it has "30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." on it—it was in consequence of this he was dismissed—on the following day he came for his things—I heard Mr. Schoolbred ask him whether he had been to Torrington-square—he said he had—he asked him to give him an account of the goods he had sold—he did so, and it precisely corresponded with those which I have sold—he was asked how he was paid—he said the lady put down two sovereigns, that there was a little boy in the room who said, "Oh mamma, I have got 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of halfpence," upon which he took up the one sovereign and the lady the other—I heard that said several times.</p>

School-bred and Cook, and that he should not go away without his character—he had a very long interview with them in the counting-house about four o'clock—I do not know whether he was waiting there all that time—I did not see him at all in the morning that I recollect—it was about ten o'clock on the Friday morning that I gave him the 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., just before he went out, ind he gave me the I O U—it was about six in the evening that I spoke to him about the mistake—I went up to him and said, "I wish you would look at your money that I have given you, for I think I have made some mistake as I cannot make my money right by 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he looked over his money, and in his purse found a half-sovereign on the silver side, and laid" I find I have half-a-sovereign that according to the day's business does not belong to me, and in all probability there must have been some mis<lb/>take, and you must have given me more than belongs to me"—I do not remember that his appearance was very odd when he came back that day—I do not think it was—I do not think he appeared as if his head was swimming—I did not say so—he made some remark about it—my business is in the counting-house—if I had examined the goods he returned with I might probably have discovered what the mistake was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Messrs. Schoolbred and Cook. It is not usual to measure the goods which young men bring back—that was well known to the prisoner—he was discharged on the Friday night—I saw him about ten o'clock on the following morning—he wanted to explain away to me the impression that I had on my mind about the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the previous evening—I told him I had nothing to do with the matter, if he be<lb/>longed to my department I should have sent him away without allowing him to reply at all, I was so satisfied that he had cheated the boy out of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was all the explanation I thought he wanted—I heard Mr. Schoolbred ask him if he had been to Torrington-square, and to give an account of the goods—he wrote this account in my presence, and it precisely tallies with that in Chaldecot's book—I have heard his account of what took place—it is sub<lb/>stantially correct—at the end of the interview Mr. Schoolbred said, "</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Solomon Harris, who lives on his property at Uxbridge, in the parish of Hillingdon. On Friday, 8th Aug., about noon, I went into the parlour, and saw the prisoner behind the door, with the large stick now produced in his hand—I asked what he came there for—he directly struck me with the stick on the side of my head, and said, "That is what I came for"—(I had seen him that morning in front of the house and supposed him a beggar)—he struck me all round and across the room on my head, shoulder, and arm—I imagine I raised my arm to protect my head—I fell from the blows—he then stood over me and said if I screamed he would knock my brains out—I was screaming, and he said, "What, you have not had enough, have not you?" or some<lb/>thing to that effect—the servants, Lucket and Miles rushed into the room—when Miles saw it was a man she ran back to give the alarm—the prisoner rushed to Lucket—she screamed, and he told her if she screamed he would knock her brains out—I was on the ground—the parlour door was only latched, but when Lucket came in the prisoner bolted it—I saw when I entered the parlour that the window was open—Lucket lifted me up—I felt agitated—I did not feel the extent of the injury I had received till I jumped out of the window—I did not fall, but came on my feet (Lucket endeavoured to prevent my jumping out) my husband came out to me—I ran round the premises and gave an alarm—my mouth was bleeding and my jaw very much injured—my teeth were loosened from the blows, and my head very bad—I had an immense lump on the side of my head—my arm and shoulders were very much bruised—I had not offered to seize the prisoner, or commit any violence on him, I only said, "What have you come for?"—Roadnight, the police-sergeant, afterwards produced a chim<lb/>ney ornament and three table forks, which are my husband's property—I was very ill and confined to my bed for about a week, attended by Mr. Stillwell—a table-cover was afterwards produced to me which is my husband's.</p>

               <p>the 8th of Aug., I heard mistress screaming, and went to the parlour—the door was shut but not bolted—I went in and found mistress lying on the floor and the prisoner standing at the table, close to mistress, with the stick produced in his hand, holding it up as if attempting to strike her—I screamed, and he turned to me and said if I screamed he would knock my brains out—he shut the door which I left open, and I think he bolted it—I could see mistress had been very ill used—I saw her hand to her head while she was on the ground—I lifted her up, and she attempted to get out of the window—I endeavoured to prevent her—she was very much alarmed—Miles came up, screamed out, and ran for master—I saw blood on mistress's lips—she at last succeeded in getting out of the window—she was going out on her head, but I turned her back again, and she went out on her feet—the prisoner stood in the room—I asked him to let roe go out of the room—he opened the door and let me out—I left him in the parlour—Powell came—I was much alarmed and fainted—the table-cover, forks, and chimney-ornament were shown to me by the officer—they are master's—the table-cloth was rolled up on a chair when I went into the room—I had not been there that morning before—the forks were kept in a drawer under the cabinet in the parlour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you cannot undertake to say when you saw either of these articles last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this figure was not an ornament in use—it has no plinth and was put by—I have only missed the lock since this—it is not the duty of any one to examine the presses to see if the locks are safe—that press contained some old music-books—it would have escaped observation unless any one had gone and pulled the door open, because there are no handles to them and they fit close—I do not think it at all likely that the statue could have been taken two or three years—I have looked at the place from which the vase was removed, and I should say it has not been long since removed—I found a vacuum of dust, which would not have been the case if taken two years ago, as the dust would have gone on accumulating on the same spot—the last I recollect of the vase is three years ago, when it was removed from a room—we occasion<lb/>ally have foreigners to see the palace.</p>

Be sure and bear in mind he could not give any reference, as we have been empty some time of any lodgers, and he was the only one we had at the time he was lodging at our house, and we had no servant at that time. Be sure and say I asked, if we got into trouble about selling it, to give the name of Mr. John Johnson, 54, Seymour-street; but don't be positive of the number of the house.

This silver, I must tell your Worship, was, about two years ago, brought by a foreigner who lodged at my house; he said he came from France; the next day he said he must be off for the continent, and this old silver which he left behind I might take care of; he said he should be back in about three months; he has not been back; the gentleman said, when I disposed of it, I was to give the name of John Johnson, of Upper Seymour-street, the number I have forgotten; I live myself at No. 6, Gillingham-street, Vauxhall; the silver was all broken up when it was left with me."</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White-hart at Hampton-wick—the prisoner was in my service as ostler—on Saturday evening, the 2nd of Aug., about nine o'clock, I was standing in my bar, against the door, and heard the yard door open—this is a correct plan of the premises—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I heard the back door open, in consequence of which I said to the lad, Phil-lips, who was wiping glasses between the bar and the tap-room, "Who is gone into the yard?"—I looked towards the door, and saw some person going out—he said, "John, the ostler, gone to shut the kitchen shutters"—I told him to go and see who it was—Mrs. Phillips asked him some ques-tion which delayed him—he went in about two minutes from the time of the door opening—I think there was sufficient time for a person to have gone down the yard through the stable to the back of the lean-to as described is the plan—the distance is about thirty yards—about a minute and a half or two minutes after Phillips went out I heard him cry out, "Master, master, the loft is on fire"—I ran into the yard and saw the flames through the lattice of the loft, over the stable where the horses are keptvthe flames appeared to come from the back part of the loft—there arc feather-edged boards above</p>

               <p>the rack which join the loft to the stable—on seeing the flames I returned into the parlour and gave an alarm—Mr. Wheeler, George Styles, Mr. Lemon, and Mr. Elkins, customers, who were in the house at the time, went out with me into the yard—I went to the pump and remained there pumping water and they got up into the loft by the ladder—the flames were extinguished in less than five minutes—I afterwards went with a po<lb/>liceman to the back of the stable—we found the door leading into the stable adjoining the lean-to, open—the other door leading into the pig-sty was bolted—we got into the lean-to, and found the ashes of some straw there alight, on the feather-edged boarding at the top of the wall—I found three such wisps of straw had been placed there—they had all been lighted—two were burnt, and one was singed but did not appear to have taken—there were ashes in the corner from the two that had burnt—the other was washed away by the water—it appeared to me that the loft had been fired from the lean-to—I had not seen the prisoner during this time—after the fire was put out I saw him in the yard—I said nothing to him—I did not see him assist in extinguishing the fire—I stood in the scullery, at the pump, and could not have seen him—there is a privy in the yard, for the use of the yard only—I saw the remains of a lucifer-match found there next morning in a cobweb—it was nearly burnt—there are two gates under the loft—the prisoner told me a few minutes after eight that evening that he had locked the gates, and the yard was safe—the pieces of straw appeared as if they had been <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down the feather-edged boards from the loft—I went into the loft with the policeman—the flooring was very wet, and in a hole that ap<lb/>peared to have been cut in the feather-edged boarding we found a wisp of straw containing lucifer-matches—there was a quantity of loose straw near it, and four or five trusses of straw besides—that is the place where they were usually kept—I had seen the prisoner throw some straw from that loft at seven o'clock for the racking of the horses—there was no means of placing the wisps of straw down the feather-edged boarding except by going up the ladder into the loft, nor was there any way by which they could have been fired except by going through the stable to the back—we have tried how long it would take to get there from the yard door, and it would not take a minute.</p>

               <p>poultry-yard or garden—I had a girl in my service, named Harriet Strick-land—she came with me to this house—she had heen about three months with me—I had no quarrel with her—I had occasion to find fault with her for standing at the door—that was perhaps a week before the fire took place—there had been an attempt to fire four nights before—it was a few days before that that I told her I disapproved of her standing at the door—I had no words with her—I know Mr. Bowen—he is a gentleman in the habit of using my house—it was not with Bowen that I found her talking at the door—she talked to him and many others of my customer!—she was talking to a Mr. Carter when I said I did not approve of it—I had no conversation with her about the first fire—she did not say anything to me respecting it—after the attempt made to fire the house, I consulted a solicitor, and wished him to examine my servants—he did so and ad<lb/>vised me to discharge the whole of them—I discharged Strickland, not all—I had given Phillips notice to leave, and he was going in a very short time—he was there when I took the house—those were the only servants I had—Strickland did not tell me then that she knew who did the fire, nor any words to that effect—she said that it would he done again—that was on the 1st of Aug.—the first fire was on the 29th of July—I discharged heron the 1st of Aug., and then she said, "It will be done again"—she was examined before the Magistrate at the first hearing, but not at the second—she had promised the Magistrate to attend, but did not—she told the policeman that she had heard somebody go up stairs without shoes, and come down again, on the night of the firevthe prisoner must have been in bed at that time—I believe Mr. Bowen is an upholsterer—he has no shop in my neighbourhood—he has a lodging at Kingston—I only know him by his being a customer at my house—he fixes the time to be home at eleven o'clock, and if not he sleeps at my house occasionally—I made no charge against Strickland in connection with Bowen—I never expressed any such suspicion to anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Baker. On Saturday, the 2nd of Aug., about nine o'clock, I came out of the parlour, took up a glass, and told Mrs. Baker to draw the nine o'clock beer—the prisoner had been sitting in the tap-room just before—he had been there since eight o'clock, and had his supper—he asked me for a screw of tobacco and a pipe about half-past eight, and he was smoking that when I came out—when I took it to him, he said he had got to go and fasten the kitchen shutters—that would not take quite half a minute—I did not see him leave the tap-room or go out at the yard door—as I was wiping a glass Mr. Baker asked me who was gone out at the back door—I said, "John, gone to that the kitchen shutters"—I heard the back door opened and shut again—I looked into the tap-room—he was not there, and I said, yes, it was him—there was no one else there—the kitchen shutter did want fastening—I believe it was open the last time I was in the yard, and when I opened the door the kit<lb/>chen shutter was shut—the last time I was in the yard was about half-past four or five o'clock—I did not go to the yard door directly Mr. Baker spoke to me, as Mrs. Baker said something to me—he told me a second time, and then I went—about five minutes elapsed between my hearing the door shut and my going—I did not see a soul in the yard—I saw a light in the loft—the loft door was shut—I had been out of an evening, and had seen the prisoner there with a light before, and thought it might be that, but I saw the smoke and flame came from under the tiles—I said, "Oh, master, the loft is on fire!"—I should say I said it loud enough for any one in the yard or privy to hear—I did not see the prisoner till about twenty minutes after I discovered fire, when I was going with my beer—I then saw him in the yard, coming out with some carriage harness—I did not see him in the privy—the family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Baker, a young lady, a little boy, the prisoner, and myself—there was no female servant in the house—the customers were in the parlour.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 1st of June, about half-past seven o'clock, I was called to Lower Keate-street, and found the prisoner and Crawley there, and 150 or 200 people collected—Crawley came running down for me, and on my going up he gave the prisoner in charge for attempting to stab him—I then took him into custody—he resisted—I called on Connor to assist me, which he did, by taking hold of him—I asked the prisoner to deliver up the knife—he said he had no knife—I asked him to come with me—he began to kick-when Connor took hold of him he said he would not be taken by any b—thief—he struggled and kicked very violently, at last I got him down to the bottom of Keate-street—we there procured the assistance of Miller and Burcham—he kicked them very much indeed—when we got to the corner of Red Lion-street he laid himself on the ground on his back, and throw up his legs—I and Rurchain had hold of him at that time—Miller</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical attendant at St. Margaret's Poor-house. I saw the child on the 31st of July, within half an hour of its being brought to the house—it was in a very emaciated and reduced state—there was no external injury of any consequence—it died on the 6th of Aug.—it had proper nourishment in the workhouse, arrow-root made with water and milk added—it rejected it at first, but subsequently retained some—it vomited at first constantly—I afterwards substituted barley-water and milk, as being lighter—it retained some, but it continued to a certain extent to reject a part of the food during the whole period—it never properly kept the food in the stomach—I examined it after death—I found quite sufficient food in the intestines to promote life, but the system would not act upon it, convert it into proper chyle, or produce suf<lb/>ficient nutritious blood—I found some increased vascularity in the lower end of the stomach, and the upper portion of the intestines—I attribute that to the child's having become in a diseased state for some period—its general appearance indicated a disease of considerable standing when the child was first brought in—I did not find a sufficient amount of disease to account for the death—the vascularity showed that there was a constitu<lb/>tional disease of some kind or other—from its general appearance, I should say it had laboured under <hi rend="italic">atrophy</hi> for two or three weeks—I expected to find mesenteric disease, but I did not—it had some wrappers on when it came in, sufficient to protect it—there was nothing in its general appear<lb/>ance, or in my examination, to enable me to speak positively as to the cause of its being in that condition—if it was from continued disease one would expect to find a sufficient morbid change, and that I consider I did not—I cannot medically assert positively what had produced that state—the want of proper food would account for it, but I could not state it was that which produced it, because there are several diseases that would pro<lb/>duce it, mesenteric disease, or disease on the brain, and they are very common to infants.</p>

B. Savory, and Sons," is on the gold watch, and two of the silver ones, as the makers—that name is on all the watches we make—we sell some that we do not make—there it one Ge<lb/>neva watch—I only know the numbers by reference to our book—I made the entry in the book myself, at the time of the transaction—the two silver lever-watches are entered on 27th of April—they were at that time brought in from the manufactory—the entry is made when we receive them from the workman—here is "No. 9"—that is No. 9, Cornhill—we send there for them—this entry does not strictly show the time that the watches came into our stock—this is a charge I make when I am going to send them to a customer—they were at the manufactory, No. 9, at the time I made the entry—our shop is No. 14—it is the same concern—I will swear that I had seen these watches at the time I made the entry—I went to No. 9, and saw them both finished—I did not bring them away then, because we did not want them—we always leave them till the last moment, to give time for further regulation—I looked at this entry at the time I packed up the watches—I swear that—I cannot say who was with me at the time—I cannot recollect whether anybody read it to me—I make it a rule in pack-ing up goods for an order, to have my book by me to see that the numbers correspond with what I am packing up—I have no doubt I compared these watches with this book.</p>

No. 1, contains two clocks and five watches"—that is another entry which I made some time after the 27th of April—I make no mark in my book to show that I have compared them—I judge from my general practice the numbers are inserted at the time of delivery, at the time I make the charge, which is generally after the goods are finished—I did so here—I put down the numbers after they were completed, and while they remained at No. 9—all this entry is my writing—I cannot say when it was made—I should suppose it was written on the 23rd of June—the latter part has been written at some other time, after the watches were gone—I am not positive that any part of it was written on the 23rd—this entry does not contain the numbers of the missing watches—it con<lb/>tains the number of a watch which was shipped in the same ship for a different party—I entered three cases, and made a memorandum that all three were shipped by this ship.</p>

               <p>at all there, which you can undertake to say was made at the time the package left your premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—I did not go down to the Dock myself—I delivered the package to Mr. Faris, I believe in our shop, No. 14—I do not know that I could swear to delivering it to him—I have no doubt that I did—I have no distinct recollection of that iden<lb/>tical thing—we have a great business both at home and abroad, and ex<lb/>port a considerable number of packages to India, and all places abroad—it is a thing of very rare occurrence, for anything intended for shipment, to be left behind—I have known such a thing occur, not left at the Custom-house, but at our shop—I never knew a case of five watches left behind.</p>

The examination took place in one of the sheds—I cannot possibly say which—if it was a tin case I should say in No. 1—the sheds are closed at four o'clock—they are occupied for the purposes of business during the day—after the examination had taken place, and I had ascertained the correctness of it, the box would be resoldered, and would be left in the regular course of business in the custody of the weighers in the shed, to be taken into the charge of the Dock Company for shipping—it is part of my duty to certify the names of the persons employed as weighers on particular days—here is my signature to each of these certificates—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two</hi>)—this enables me to say that the persons referred to were employed on particular days—one of these refers to Bonham—I cannot say whether he was employed at shed No. 1, but it appears that he was employed by the searchers on the 23rd of June, as a searcher's cooper—I cannot speak to any of the other prisoners—the other appears to be a certificate that a man named Turner was employed on the 23rd as a searcher's cooper—I should not have certified that he was so employed had he not been—they are the persons with whom in the course of business a box of this kind would be left to be delivered to the Dock Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Customhouse weigher. I was on duty at the West India Dock in June, 1842, as searcher's cooper—a cer-tain number of the weighers are appointed as searchers' coopers on the 1st of the month—Bonham and Lewis were also appointed as searchers' coopers for June, 1842, and Strickland as the shipping-officer—a portion of the shed No. 1 is divided off for the express use of the searchers and their men, the searchers' coopers—that is their regular station, but they go about the Docks to various places—it is a place appointed for the coopers to remain in attendance, to wait any orders that may be issued by the searchers—they are obliged to be there till they are wanted—it is their duty to open any packages, by direction of the searchers, for their examination, and to fasten them up again when they have been examined—in June, 1842, I remember a case being brought to the West India Dock, said to contain plate, to be examined by the searchers—I did not attend the examination of it myself—I do not know who did—there were other searchers' coopers, and most likely, in fact, one or more of us would be sure to attend—Bonham, Lewis, and myself, were the three searchers' coopers for that month—I was in and out of the shed at the time this case was there for the purpose of examination—I remember on one occasion coming into the shed and seeing the case open—Lewis and Bonham were in the shed by the case—I should say they were about to put the lid on again—I think that was it, as near as I could tell—I cannot give a description of the case—it was rather a largish one—the outer case was made of fir, or deal, I should say, and a tin case was inside—one of them, I cannot say which, made an ob-servation, "Lend us a hand," or "Come on, <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>, lend us a hand"—there</p>

               <p>was no one but Lewis and Bonham in the shed at that time—Strick-land was outside—he was the shipping-officer—he was to see that woods were shipped, and sign the bills for the searchers—I assisted Lewis and Bonham in putting on the lid—there were screws in the lid to fasten it down—we drove the screws in as we should nails, not regularly screwed them in—the case was then turned out of the shed, and delivered over to the Dock Company for shipment—the shipping-officer would go on board the ship, and get the mate's receipt for the goods, after they were shipped by the Dock Company—he would deliver the goods at any one of the stations where the ship laid—ships lie at various stations—I cannot men<lb/>tion the name of any person to whom it was delivered—I think it was handed over to some of the Dock Company's people, who ought to receive it—sometimes they fetch them away from the shed, but that is not the usual case—whether we put this case outside No. 1 shed, or took it down to No. 3 shed, I cannot say—the Dock Company's people receive it for the purpose of putting it on board, and put it on board when it suits them—I think Lewis and myself were the two that put the case outside No 1. shed, or took it down to No. 3, or wherever it was we took it to—I rather think there was only us two—on returning to No. 1 shed we were all four together, Strickland, Bonham, Lewis, and myself, and I saw in the hands of Strickland a package containing some watches—it was open, but I think it was a brown paper package—I thought at first it contained only four watches, but I found afterwards there were five—there was one gold and two silver watches alike, and two other silver watches I believe somewhat larger than the others—they were looked at, and a consultation was entered into as to the disposal of them—one of us, I cannot say which, proposed to sell them—Strickland said he should like to keep the gold one himself, and also one of the silver ones for his son, and he would make good the difference to us—that was I suppose the value of what they would be sold for—that was not agreed to, and it was determined to sell them—I believe Lewis and myself went that night to a Jew named Moss to ask him if he would purchase them—he lived in Elizabeth-street, No. 3, I think, the corner house—I am not positive whether Lewis had any of the watches with him on that night or not—in consequence of my going there, Moss came to the Dock on the following day—I rather think the watches were left with Strickland that day—some of them were—I am not positive whether Lewis had any then or not in his custody—I think Strickland left them in the place that night—I am not positive, but I believe he left them in his own desk—they were in his desk at one time—he had a desk in No. 1 shed, in the place that was parted off for the searchers—it was the shipping-officer's station entirely—whether all the watches were put in that desk that night or not I cannot say—I saw Lewis with a package two or three days afterwards, which he represented to be the watches, and they appeared to me to be so, there was something like two or three lumps in the package, but I did not see the inside of it—when Moss came down to the Docks I believe we were all four present—the watches were produced to him, I cannot say positively by whom—I believe he offered 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them to the best of my recollection—we did not consent to sell them for that price—we said, who said it I cannot tell, but we agreed if we could get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them to let them go—Moss would not give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said if we would let him take them away he would see what he could get for them, but we objected to that, and eventually Lewis went to some place with him—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180063"/>
               <p>had not the whole of the watches—I am not positive, but I think he had part—he went with Moss—he told me so three or four days afterwards—he said he took him to a palace of a place, but he went up a court to it, be described it as a very large mansion, but that he would not let him go entirely in; he left him in a place, and he left him so long that he feared whether he should be <hi rend="italic">burked</hi> or not—that was all he told me at that time that I know of, only that Moss's answer was that he would not give the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who at last had the watches? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the course of a few days, per<lb/>haps nearly a week, Strickland produced I should say 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., deducting his own share—he would take the watches, at all events, he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1 saw him give the other two sovereigns, but how many he gave I could not swear—I believed it to bo 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I never saw the watches again—I cannot say that I knew what had become of them—I heard from Lewis that they had been re-christened and sold among his own friends in the Lale of Wight, by a relation of his in the trade—I do not recollect whether we had anything in the shed after I came back and found Strickland with the watches—it was not an unfrequent occurrence for us to do so—we frequently had eatables and drinkables there—I do not know whether we had or not.</p>

                  </hi>. In June, 1842, I was apprentice to Mr. Wales, a tin<lb/>plate worker—he was in the habit of attending at the Docks, for the purpose of unsoldering and soldering cases—I quitted his employment on the 2nd of July—about a week or ten days before I left I was sent by him to the West India Dock—I went to shed No. 1—I took my soldering tools with me—I cannot recollect what time in the day it was—I unsol-dered a case, and saw some watches and clocks taken from it—I do not know what day it was—I cannot remember seeing Mr. Scanlan there—I do not remember who was present—I know Strickland was there—I know Lewis and Bonham by sight—I think Bon ham was in the shed that day, and I think Lewis must have been there, for I seldom or ever went to any other shed—I cannot say whether he was there on that very day—there were about four or five there altogether—five with myself, I think—I cannot say whether I saw Turner there on that particular day—I have been him there—I know his face very well—the things were replaced, and I soldered the case up again—before I did so one of them, I cannot re-member which, took up one of the watches, placed it outside his waistcoat-pocket, and said, "That would look very well," or, "That would look well," or something of that sort—after I had soldered the case, Strickland asked me if I would go and get him some shrimps at Blackwall, which is more than half a mile from the Dock, I should think nearly three-quarters—I refused at first—he said he would give me two glasses of brandy and water if I went, and I consented to go—he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get them—they were to be live shrimps—I went, but could not get any live shrimps—I did not apply at more than one place—I got whitebait instead—I left my soldering tools in shed No. 1, while I went to Blackwall—I cannot say whether I left all the persons there that were present when I unsoldered the box, but I left some of them there—I saw an examining officer, but I do not know his name—I cannot say whether he staid—I brought the whitebait back to shed No. 1—I should think I was gone nearly three quarters of an hour, or quite.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that have afforded an opportunity, if anybody had been dis<lb/>posed to avail themselves of it, of unsoldering the box and securing it again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, Yes—on my return I found them drinking brandy and water—I think I found about four there—I made the fifth as far as I recollect now—I can speak positively to Strickland being one, and I think Bonham was there—I have no recollection of the others—I have no stronger recollection of Lewis—I know his face, and have seen him in the shed—whether I saw him on either of these occasions I cannot recollect—I had some brandy and water, I cannot say exactly who gave it me—I think it was Strickland who promised me—I drank one glass, and 1 think I had another one, or part of another—it was filled out for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tin<lb/>plate worker, in Regent-street, Blackwall. I have been employed to solder and unsolder packing-cases for the people at the Dock, for I believe these twenty years—Laycock was my appren<lb/>tice in June, 1842—I frequently sent him to the Docks to solder and unsolder cases, until one day that he came home rather the worse for liquor—that might be about ten days before he left me, or from ten to twelve days—I have my day-book here—I always enter everything into it myself—here is an entry, "23rd of June, 1 case of watches"—that means one case of watches unsoldered and soldered up on that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you recollect the time of day when he came home the worse for liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, as near as I recollect, about three o'clock in the afternoon—I recollect saying when he came home, "William, you are not fit to go into the Dock, if you do such a thing as that, and there-fore I will not allow you to go any more," and after that I went myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether that day was the same as you have read from the book, the 23rd of June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That case, according to what I could understand, was the case after which I told him he should not go into the Dock again—I have a perfect recollection of his coming home rather the worse for liquor—I have no doubt it was him that soldered up this case on this account, that as soon as I had soldered a case up, I drowned the pot directly, and never left it with any fire in it, and took my soldering-irons away—this entry does not show whether he or I went—I could not recollect, to swear to it, whether it was he or I went, but I know at that time he came home the worse for liquor, and I would not allow him to go afterwards—I never left my soldering-iron behind me, nor the fire alight—I always made a custom of drawing a bucket of water, and drown-ing it out—I turned the fire out of the fire-pot, and then put more water into the fire-pot as well—it would take from ten minutes to a quarler of an hour to light the charcoal in the fire-pot, and make a fire; and probably three, four, or five minutes to heat the iron—it would take at least twenty minutes to get a hot iron.</p>

On the 8th of Aug., in consequence of in<lb/>formation I had received, I went to the prisoner Osborne's house—I had seen Mr. Yeoman before I went, he showed me a watch, and told me where he got it from—I took the number and name, and desired him to keep it—Osborne keeps the Crooked Billet on Tower-hill—he was not at home when I first went, but I waited till he came in—I told him I wished to speak with him privately—I went into the bar parlour with him—I then told him I had come upon very unpleasant business, that I had a search warrant, which I showed him—after telling him who and what I was (in fact I gave him my card) I told him I did not want to make things more unpleasant than there was a necessity for, as I understood hit wife was very ill in bed—I then cautioned him as to any answers he might make to the questions I was about to put to him—I said, "I hope you will be very particular in answering the questions I am about to put to you, because it may be of great importance, the answers you give"—I then asked, whether he had not sold a watch about three years ago, to a person named Yeoman, who kept a livery-stable in Lamb's Conduit--street—he said he had—I said, "You have the fellow watch to it in your pocket"—he said he had—I told him I must have it, and he produced it, took it from his guard and gave it to me—I then said, "Now I don't wish, as a matter of course, to go into your wife's bed-room; will you fetch me the gold watch which she has?"—he went and fetched the gold watch which I have produced, and gave it to me—I then said, "I hope you will be able to give me a satisfactory account of how you came into possession of these, watches"—he said, "I bought five of them"—I said, "Whom did you buy them of?"—he said he bought them of a man who occasionally used his house, when he kept the Lamb, in Lamb's Conduit-street—I said, "What is the man's name?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Will you give me a description of him?"—he said he would consider about that to<lb/>morrow—I said, "Where are the other two watches?"—he said, "I sold one to my solicitor, Mr. Taylor, No. 2, Castle-street, Holborn"—I said, "Well, where is the other?"—he said he did not think he had more than four—I said, "It is rather an extraordinary thing, is it not, for a publican to buy watches worth between 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not to be able to say whom he bought them of"—he said they were brought to his house to be raffled—he said when he kept the Lamb, he had a great many raffles at bis bouse—I said, "Well, at all events you can give me a description of the man"—he said he dare say he should be able to find him for me in a day or two—I think that was nearly the whole of the conversation at that time—I then left the house, and went down to Strickland's, which is a public-house in Anthony-street, close by Rosemary-lane—I went in front of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180073"/>
               <p>bar, and had a long conversation with him on general topics—nothing con<lb/>nected with this—I was in the house about twenty minutes perhaps before I apprehended him—as I was going out at the door with him, he said to his wife, "Send to Osborne to look after the cellars"—I took him to the station, and he was locked up—I immediately went back to Osborne's—he was not at home—I then went back to Strickland's, and found Osborne there and apprehended him—he said Mrs. Strickland had sent for him in a very great hurry—he said nothing more about the watches.</p>

               <p>as to the answers he gave, as it might be important to him—I did not tell him I had come to take him into custody—I told him I had a search war-rant—I told him it was confined to the watches, and then he produced them—I found his initials on the watch he had, and his wife's on the gold watch, but I had told him that was the case, because I had been to Mr. Webster, who put them—I also found Mr. Yeoman's initials on the watch he had—I did know Osborne when he kept the Lamb—I did not suggest to Strickland, when I took him, that perhaps Osborne would be bail for him if he sent for him—I did not mention Osbome's name to him at all—Strickland's house may be about half a mile from Osborne's, or nearly so—the Crooked Billet is at the top of Rosemary-lane, on Tower-hill, and Strickland's house is at the other end of Rosemary-lane—the Crooked Billet is a very large establishment—I believe Osborne has been there twelve months or more—I took him into custody immediately on meeting him again at Strickland's—that was perhaps twenty minutes after I had taken Strickland, for as soon as I left him I went as fast as I could to Oiborne's, and then took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> back to Strickland's, because I expected to find him there, from what I had heard Strickland say to his wife, and from something else that I was in possession of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am steward to the United Brothers' Provident So<lb/>ciety, held at the City of London public-house, Sidney-street, City-road—in the beginning of 1844 the prisoner was secretary to the society, and bad been so, I think, about five years—it was the duty of the steward to keep the books of the society—I was steward at the time—it was the prisoner's duty to make the entries in the books—there was a minute—book kept and a depositor's book—this is the minute-book—the depositor's book we have been unable to find—there is a resolution entered in the minute—book, on the ht of Jan. 1844, in the prisoner's handwriting, that the senior steward, in conjunction with the secretary, should add the interest to the principal in the savings bank—I went on the 2nd of Jan. with the prisoner to the savings bank for that purpose, and made the necessary arrangements—I think the principal and interest, when added up, was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I saw the prisoner produce the depositor's book at the bank—I believe it was the duty of the steward to take care of that book, but the prisoner had always been in the habit of having it—it was returned into his hand at the bank, with the minute-book, and I have never seen it since—I never asked the prisoner for it—here is an entry in the minute-book, of the 5th of Feb. 1844* in the prisoner's handwriting, "J. Randall deposited the bank book in the <hi rend="italic">book</hi>"—there was a conversation with the prisoner afterwards about that entry, and he said he must have made a mistake, he must have meant <hi rend="italic">box</hi>—I never did deposit the bank book in the box—I first found it was not in</p>

Randall, Sept. 29th 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., ditto 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," &amp;c.—that is, money I was receiving when 1 was sick—those entries are not made under the direction of the steward—the se<lb/>cretary makes them of his own option—he knows what to put down—the stewards draw the money from the landlord, and pay it to the sick members—the secretary gets the account from the landlord's book, which we sign for his security—I have seen this book before, but never examined it par-ticularly—the other stewards had also an opportunity of seeing it—I believe the minute-book was generally on the table every night of meeting—the books were kept in the box, but this book the prisoner had in his pos-session—it has never been kept in the box since 1 have been there—there were three keys belonging to the box in which the bank-book was kept—the prisoner had neither of those keys—the two stewards had each one, and the landlord one, each for a different lock, so that all three keys must be there to open the box—James Andrews was my fellow-steaard, and Hume Graddon, but he was not a free steward—we always kept the bank-book in the box till it was taken to the bank—our accounts were generally made up and balanced in Dec.—this book does not contain the receipts and expenditure, it is called, "Receipts and Expenditure-book"—here is an entry, "Balance to treasurer"—we were never aware that this book contained any entry of the sort—it was a larger book in which that was entered—this is the book—this other was expressly for a minute-book—I never examined to see whether it was marked with receipts and expendi-ture—nothing but minutes of meetings had any business in it—I have belonged to the society rather better than five years—here is a minute in the book, authorizing me to proceed to the bank.</p>

                  </hi>. In Jan. and Feb., 1844, I was a manager of the Fins<lb/>bury Savings-bank—the Birmingham United Brothers' Society banked with us—before they took out their money, it would be necessary that a notice should be sent—I find such a notice in our "Notice and Repay-ment book," on the 14th of Feb., 1844—we have certain numbers in our book, and also in the depositor's book, held by the customer—the number referred to tells me whether or not it is a right account—I attended on the 21st of Feb.—I find on that date this receipt, "Finsbury-bank for savings: We the undersigned do hereby acknowledge the receipt of the sums annexed to our respective names, this 21st of Feb., 1844;" and, under the No. "9," are the names "William Nash, Thomas Bond, and William or Willan Jones"—three persons must have been present to have signed that, or I should not have given the check—we require the pre<lb/>sence of all the three parties signing, as they do at the Bank for a transfer of stock; and upon their signing, I give a check, which is paid by another person—the depositor's book is essential to be produced—it gives me the clue where to look, and also where I am to refer for the amount I have to pay—I then take their names and I have their minute-book before me at the same time, to see that the signatures are the same as I have taken—we do not require the same signatures to the notice that we do to the re-ceipt—I do not know the persons signing the receipt, only from the minute-book, and the Secretary comes—I find their handwriting in the minute-book—with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184508180080"/>
               <p>reference to this particular transaction, I do not remember the production of the minute-book at all—it would certainly not have been paid unless the minute-book had been shown—there is only the name of Thomas Bond in the notice—I paid a check of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the per<lb/>sons signing the receipt—here are my initials, both in the book and on the check—I should not have given the check until I had seen the depositor's book—I personally do every act myself before I part with the check.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have no recollection of this particular traos-action, except by referring to this book, and judging of your usual regu-larity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—we require the depositor's book both when notice is given, and also when the money is paid—as far as I recollect, it is invariably present when the money is paid—I cannot say that in no one instance has money been paid without it, because I do not pay all the money—I firmly believe I never gave a check without the minute-book being produced—I do not think it is at all possible I should give a check without the minute-book being before me—I did not receive the notice—I do not know whether the depositor's book and minute-book were produced then—I do not recollect any transaction with this Society before—I could not swear that I compared the signatures in this book with those in the minute-book on this occasion—most likely I did—I cannot recollect parti-cularly as to this single transaction, but it is the usual practice to do so; and I should expect I did so then—I gave the check to one of the three persons who signed—the secretary most likely—he is generally the party who takes it—there is no "secretary" marked here, but I should give it to the one who would call himself secretary, although he has not signed u such—there is nothing in this entry to show me to which of the three the check was handed—the depositor's book, after passing through the ledger, comes to me as having to give the check.</p>

               <p>the depositor's book, before me, and seeing that the number corresponded, I should give the check—I should not go to the actuary to ask him any question at all, unless I was in any doubt about it—no one of these parties has signed as the secretary—I did not notice that at the time, nor do I know exactly that it is necessary—I did not require the secretary to be there.</p>

George Selby is treasurer, and a trustee—on the 1st of Jan., 1844, the United Brothers had money deposited there—I find a notice in this book to withdraw 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received that notice—it would be the duty of other parties to pay it—the depositor's book would be retained at the bank till the following week, that the necessary entries preparatory to the repayment may be made—it is kept in my hands, or my clerk's, until the party send in their ticket, which contains a number, for the payment of that number—the secretary of the society is then called upon to produce the minute-hook, that I may judge who are the right persons to receive the money—I remember nothing whatever about the payment of this parti-cular money—it is usual for the secretary to come when the money is paid, and to sign at the foot of the receipt—the minute-book directs us who to pay—it contains the handwriting of the parties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose it appeared that three of the members were to sign for the society and receive the money, no one of whom was secretary, would you require a fourth signature "as that of the secretary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he was present—it would require some very particular excuse to relieve him from attendance, but the signatures of the trustees are the essential signa-tures—the signature of the secretary is usually taken for the purpose of identifying the trustees—our discharge is the signature of the persons to whom it is payable—the bona fide nature of the transaction, and the ap<lb/>pearance of the minute book, would be the things we should judge by in that case—I do not know the prisoner—I never remember to have seen him—we have so many thousand depositors.</p>

Balls and Coles never signed our book before, till the secretary produced them, and signed in our book—that was on the 21st of Oct., 1840—he signed as the secretary there—that is a more correct minute—when the secretary attends he would sign either beneath or beside the others.</p>

In Jan. 1844, I was steward to the society—I held a key of the chest—I saw the bank, or depositor's book on the club evening, Jan. 1,1844—I have never seen it since—it used to be kept in the box before that time—I saw it that evening, and examined it—it was out on the table—it wai not replaced in the box that evenig—it was left out to go to the bank next day—it was neglected or forgotten afterwards—it is only required once a year—the prisoner was our secretary—I know his handwriting—I believe the name of Willan Jones to this receipt to be the prisoner's handwriting—I have been in the habit of seeing him write very frequently for nearly six years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Castle-street, Holborn. On Saturday night, the 2nd of Aug., I was going to bed about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—I heard some glass falling, which sounded in the lower part of the house—I was in the first floor—I went down and searched the lower part of the house, and the kitchen—as I waa coming up again, I saw through the glass door that the back office was open, which is under cover, and communicates with the house by a glaat door—I went in and found the window of the office wide open, and one pane of glass broken—the prisoner was inside the office, sitting on a stool—I asked what he did there—he said be came there to sleep—I told him that was not a place for him to sleep, and he should not stay there—I fetched the policeman, and gave him in charge—the house is my dwelling-house, and I sleep in it—it is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn—I know the prisoner by sight, from his having been employed by Mr. Bald-win, to whom that back office is under let—the prisoner used to write there for Mr. Baldwin.</p>

Reynolds and Smith's, corn dealers, Enfield, as he went home, and he said he would—I gave him a note with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note in it, of which I kept the number—it was 93,631—I directed the note to Messrs. Reynolds and Smith, and sealed or wafered it up—he took it and went away—on Monday I came to Lon-don and called on Messrs. Reynolds and Smith, and in consequence of what they said to me I afterwards spoke to the prisoner and asked him why he had not delivered the note I gave him—he laid he supposed he had lost it—the police are in the habit of coming to my yard every now and then, and one of them named Hoppy came at that time into my room where the prisoner was—I told him the circumstance, and wrote to the Bank of Eng-land to stop the payment of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note—the prisoner came afterwards to my house—he said it was a bad job, he had lost the note, and asked me to let him work it out—this is the note which I gave the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it has my writing on it—it is No. 93,681.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a military man. On Friday night, the 8th of Aug., I got into an omnibus about nine o'clock at the Euston-square sta-tion—it was going in the direction of Piccadilly—I think the prisoner is the man who was in the omnibus, and sat on my right-hand side—nobody tat on the other side of me—I had my dog there—before I got into the omnibus I had my purse which contained 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sovereigns, half-So<lb/>vereigns, and silver—I had put my purse into my coat pocket—I had not heard the prisoner say where he wished to be put down—the omnibus stopped to put down an outside passenger, and when it stopped the prisoner got out—I had his bag in my hand—I was endeavouring to keep up the bag and the little cage which had my dog—the prisoner called quickly for his bag and his portmanteau—when he was gone the conductor spoke to me, and I found a hole in my pocket—some keys which had been in my pocket were on the seat, and my purse was gone—some said the bole in my pocket was cut, some said it was torn, and some that it was worn—I can positively swear I had no hole in it before I got into the omni-bus—the hole was two inches long or more—I got out and went with the conductor to endeavour to find the prisoner, but we did not succeed—I afterwards went the same evening to a house in Macclesfield-street—I saw the prisoner there in the parlour—the house was represented to me as an improper house—I told the prisoner if he was a respectable person to give</p>

               <p>me an address or reference—I felt very unwilling to give him in charge, because I thought he looked such a respectable man—he would not give any address or any name, and I was compelled to give him in charge—I was present when he was going to the station-house—he ran away, and we had to give chase after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Baker-street, Portman-square. On the 10th of July I slept at my father's, Mr. Salmon Bun-ell's house, at Acton, Middlesex—I went to bed "about eleven o'clock—I cannot speak to my own knowledge about the house being fastened—I was awoke at four in the morning—I heard a noise in the lower part of the house—I sent the servant to ascertain the cause—I then walked to the bed-room window, and saw a man run across the garden—I dressed and went down—I found a back door forced, the glass broken, and the frame broken—an inner door was forced, and a plank forced off another door—I did not see these things the night before.</p>

I am groom to Mr. Salmon Burrell, the father of the last witness—I sleep in his dwelling-house, which is in the parish of Acton—I was called up about four o'clock that morning—I went down, and found the place broken open—a cap, a razor, and a handkerchief belonging to me, were taken out of the stable—they had got from the kitchen to the coach-house, and from thence to the stable—I had shut up the house the night before, and all the places that were afterwards broken were then safe—I locked them about ten—I do not know the prisoner—this cap, razor, and handkerchief are mine—my coat was lying down on a form in the coach-house, but was not taken away.</p>

About four o'clock that morn-ing I was on duty—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner near the premises—I pursued and took him—I found this cap, razor, and handkerchief on him, also a nail, the handle of a knife, and five duplicates—I found the blade of this knife on the window sill of the premises—I found, in the back part of the premises, this old spit, which has lately been used at the greenhouse fire—it is what he broke the door open with—I have fitted it to the marks on the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Horsenden, near Greenford, near Mrs. Jones's. On the 5th of July I was going up my garden, and heard a great noise—I stopped in the garden, and heard Mrs. Jones say, "Come on, you b----,</p>

On the evening of the 21st of July, I was standing at the door—the prisoner was standing a few feet in front of me, with a companion—he purchased some trotters—I saw the policeman coming up, and the prisoner seemed to spit something towards him—the officer took no notice, but when he got a little further, he turned—the prisoner came up to me, and thrust a portion of the bone within a few inches of me, and said, "Will you have a bit?"—I said, "No"—he then thrust his face to mine, and said, "Kiss my,—you b—vagabond"—I put my hand against him, and said, "Go on"—he struck me, and I turned and said to Fenn, "Will you allow this?"—Fenn came up and touched him, and said, "This wont do"—he then began to strike Fenn in the face and breast, and his hat fell off—another officer came and assisted in taking the prisoner—Fenn used a proper degree of forbearance towards him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Marquis of Anglesey public-house in Bow-street, in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden—I rent the house and live in it—on Saturday mght, the 12th of July, I shut my house myself at a quarter past twelve—I was the last person up—I saw everything secure, and went to bed—about two o'clock in the morning I was called up by the constable, who was outside my front door—I let him in—my front door was fastened, and my house was just as I had left it, except a trap<lb/>door between two walls, which was burst open—that door was a part of the house—it is between an old wall and a new one which they had been erecting—it is between the old house next door, which was under repairs, and my house, and led into my passage between the bar and the tap-room—there was a vacancy in the wall in consequence of repairs, and that door was put to supply it, so that in fact it formed part of the wall—I found it had been forced open from the other side into my passage—they must have got at it from the house which was under repair—it had not been left open—it was fastened—I found a drawer in my bar had been tried at by some instrument, and there were marks of a screw-driver on it which corresponded with the marks of one which was brought by one of the officers.</p>

We were rebuilding a party-wall between the Marquis of Anglesey and the house which was repairing—I put up a door in a temporary way, about four o'clock on Saturday afternoon—I merely put a holdfast or two and a bit of wood—the wall had been condemned by the district surveyor—we had pulled part of it down, and there was a vacancy of about eighteen inches between that and the new wall, and I fastened up this door—the adjoining house was empty—I went to work on the Monday morning, about nine o'clock—I found the door had been disturbed, but it was then put up again—there was no staple to that door, nor padlock—there was to the front door of the house No. 23, Russell-street, and the staple was wrenched off that, and the pad<lb/>lock undone.</p>

                  </hi> I was in Lower Grosvenor-place about eleven o'clock at night on Sunday, the 3rd of Aug.—I saw the prisoner Smith—I think I addressed her, but I will not be sure—there was some conversation about the time of night, and in the course of that conversation I looked at my watch—it was a gold watch, and fastened round my neck with a string—I looked at it, and told her the time—we were then passing along Grosvenor-street, away from Ranelagh-street—I was induced by what Smith said to go back to Ranelagh-street, and went down Ranelagh-mews—I had not been there a moment when she wished to induce me to turn down a dark place, which I did—she held me by the coat, and wished me to proceed a little further—she then coughed twice, and that was followed by Edwards rushing down upon me—he held me by the arms, and said, "What are you ill-using the female for? what are you doing to her?" or words to that effect—I thought Smith had hold of my coat at that time—I struggled as violently as I could, and succeeded in extricating myself as soon as I could, but I had called "Police" two or three times—I walked three or four feet—passage from the mews leads to the back of some small houses in Ranelagh-street—Edwards went up the passage, but I saw him again instantly almost—I missed my watch the moment that the police<lb/>man approached me—I had scarcely recovered from the fright I was pat in when I saw the ring of my watch hanging to my guard—I said, "They have taken my watch"—it had been wrenched from the ring—I gave in<lb/>formation to the policeman, and the prisoners, who had not gone more than a yard, were both taken—I know the houses Nos. 22 and 24 in Ra-nelagh-street—the backs of those houses come against the passage where I</p>

I was at dinner in my back parlour, which communicates with my shop—I heard a noise in the shop, went in, and saw the prisoner standing in the shop with a box of cheroots in his hand—directly he saw me he put them down on a candle-box near the door, inside the shop, about three yards from where they had been when I went to dinner—I took hold of him, and kept him till the policeman came—this is the box—it contained ninety-four Manilla cheroots.</p>

I did not see the deceased till after he was dead—my impression is, that the violence of the blow caused a rupture of a branch of an artery on the right side of the head, which allowed a certain quantity of blood to escape, and that accumulated into a clot and caused death—it was all in consequence of a blow.</p>

I remember the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> boat coming to Coombe Hill wharf on Sunday, and she began discharging on Monday morning, the 14th—I received orders from my master to assist in discharging thnt boat, and I did so—Hawkins was assisting—my master was at home—I saw him—he came about six o'clock on the Monday morning, and gave me orders—he was not away from the premises the whole day more than an hour or an hour and a half, till six in the evening—he was not away long enough to have gone to Beckford, or any such distance—he did not leave the work any time, except to take his meals, and in the whole of the day he was not away more, than an hour or an hour and a half—I did not see the prisoner—I must have seen him if he had been there—my master went to the Swan public-house after he left the work, and Hawkins with him—I left between nine and ten o'clock, and left him and Hawkins at the Swan.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in High-street, Woolwich. On Sunday, the 13th of July, Thomas Banks came to my house—he was tipsy and quarrelling—he said he would knock any person about that came before him—I begged him to be quiet, and said I would have nothing there but quietness, and if he wanted to fight he must go out into the street—I was sitting in my kitchen, and Edward Pickett alongside of me—Banks hit him a slap on the side of the face, then closed his fist and hit me in the face—he then pulled Pickett up and hit him with his fist—William Elford happened to come to the door, and Banks said to him, "Now, Wil<lb/>liam, this is the time; go to work, my boy"—with that, William Elford hit me, and his wife, Elizabeth Elford, also hit me with the pitchfork—I fell, and while down, William Elford kicked me in the eye, and I do not know what happened after—I have lost the sight of it—I had done nothing but beg of them to be quiet—pretty-well all that were there made their escape out of the place when they saw them behaving in such a rude man-ner—I saw Sarah Banks in the place when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> happened, when Banks hit me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Woolwich. On Sunday, the 13th of July, between one and two o'clock, Driscoll came to me—he was bleeding from a wound in the temple—(I found no other wound about him)—it was from a blow—it had injured the eye, and round about the margin of the eye was bruised—I think it very probable to have hap<lb/>pened from a kick—I should call it an injury dangerous to life—the result of it was very alarming—he had inflammation of the eye, and that com<lb/>municated itself to the brain for a time.</p>

Q.</hi> Where did you graduate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Free Hos-pital—I took my diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons, and I am a licentiate apothecary—I never had Driscoll under my treatment before—he was under my care very nearly three weeks—there was deep seated inflam-mation—the wound was about one-eighth of an inch deep—it is very indistinct now—I swear there was danger to life from that wound—he was suffering from concussion of the brain—he was partially insensible—he answered questions, and then relapsed again into a partial state of insensi-bility for four or five hours—I gave him small doses of calomel—I did not consider it necessary to bleed him—bleeding is recommended in some cases of concussion—it depends on circumstances—I have read works in which it is not recommended—I cannot give the name of a work, but there are plenty—I never read "Cooper's Surgery"—I gave him calomel and antimonials, and such treatment as I considered necessary—I did not use a hot bath—I considered him in danger until reaction took place—by rea-ction, I mean returning sensation or animation—that was about five hours—during those five hours I had serious apprehensions of his death—I am</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone-sawyer, and live at Woolwich; I have been lodging at Driscoll's since Christmas. On Sunday the 13th of July, about dinner time, I was sitting in the kitchen between Dris-coll and another man—Banks was sitting at the table at bis dinner—he came up cursing, swearing, and blaspheming, took out four or five half-crowns, clapped them on his hand, and said he would fight any man in the house—he had had a drop of drink, but was sober enough to know what he was about—he put himself in an attitude of fighting, and struck me in the face with his open hand—he then took me by the breast, pulled me up, struck me, and knocked me down, and when I was down Sarah Banks put her finger in my mouth, pulled my cheek, and caused a wound—she struck me frequently with this iron bar, at least, with some instru-ment; I could not see what it was—Banks had hold of me while I was down, and pulled my whiskers out of me—when I got up I could not stand on my leg; it was broken—I stumbled—Ronan's mother helped me out of the way—I was very much hurt.</p>

On the 13th of July I heard screams of "Murder!" from Driscoll's house, which is next door to mine—I went and saw Pickett lying on the ground, and Banks kicking him most violently—I saw Sarah Banks go to the fire-place, take a bar of iron which is used as a kitchen poker, and strike him across the back part of the neck, once across the bottom part of the leg, and once across the thigh—she then put the poker down, put her hand inside his mouth, and tore it with vengeance, from whence the blood issued in torrents—I do not suppose Banks would have let go of Pickett had not a man said, "You are no man," and then he ran after that man; but he eluded him, and ran away—I saw nobody else do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Essex-place, Blackheath-hill. I recollect the night of this disturbance—there was something between us and the landlord of the public-house—the first officer that came up was West-brook—lie came up when the landlord called "Police," and laid hold of Norris, and chucked him down seven or eight times—that was before Norn's bad committed any violence—Norris had no knife, and I think it was impossible for him to have one—Cottington then came up, and they both had hold of Norris's arms, and chucked him down seven or eight times—I went and said to the policemen, "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves—you ought to take him quietly"—there were flint stones down by there—I was taken, and fined 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the oath of Westbrook, for trying to rescue.</p>

               <p>not break in the stern of the long-boat—it was broken when the swell came, the chain pressed the boat down—the boat by which I was saved was a water-man's skiff—it was about two or three yards from me—I jumped as far as I could, and got into her—the skiff rose to the swell, being loose—she was right astern of us, between us and the next tier—I was not near enough to the skiff to jump into it—I jumped into the water, and reached into the skiff—our boat was going down when I jumped—it sunk down when I was jumping—the head<lb/>chain was resting on the stern of the boat at the time—I did not see a Greenwich steamer passing up—I saw the guard-ship of the Custom-house there—I did not see the Custom-house cutter—I have seen many steam-boats pass by before, when we have been rais-ing the chain—the chain was over the bow, and the stern too, when the swell took place, and kept the boat down—it went over the whole length of the boat—the gunwale was twelve or fifteen inches out of the water at both ends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman on the Thames. On the morn-ing of the 22nd of July, about ten o'clock, I was off St. George's-stairs—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> steamer come by—my boat was still at that time—I was in it—the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> did not make a great swell, not more than 1 have seen her make—after she had passed I looked up the river, and saw the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> coming down fast, at about twelve miles an hour, I imagine—she produced a very great surf, which caused me to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> from the shore, to take care of the boat and myself—she passed me outside, in the middle of the river—as she passed I saw the boat which was unmoor-ing the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>—she was pressed down in the water by the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> flying ahead, and turning, and her chain pressed her down in the water—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> drove her down—it was an hour and a half before low water—the tide is strong at that time—she was pressed down, and the boat went into the water—the boat threw her ahead, and tightened her chain, and pressed down the boat—the young man who was saved got into a boat—I was in another boat at that time, not in my own—I rowed towards the others, and endeavoured to save them—the swell of the Prince of Wales prevented my going as fast as I could—when I was within about twenty feet of the men the <hi rend="italic">Ruby</hi> came down, and the chain tightened under my boat—the river is not crowded near Horsleydown-pier—there were six or seven vessels there—I think the speed at which the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> was going was not proper, because it causes such heavy swells and jerks to the boats on shore, and damages them—the swell of all the steam boats does that—the swell is in proportion to the speed and size of the boat—it is more necessary to use caution, and to go slowly at this state of the tide, than at other times—the tide itself would drift a boat four or five miles an hour down the river, without working the vessel.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why is it more necessary to use caution an hour before ebb than any other time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the water is lower, and there is not so much room for it to expel itself—the narrower the water the greater the swell—at ebb it would require more caution—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> was lying the last vessel but one in the tier, next but one to the shore—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> was not above forty feet from the outermost vessel of the tier—those four vessels are about twenty feet each in the beam—I saw the Custom-house cutter—she was lying astern of the tier, on the outermost side—she was about twenty feet wide—the <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> was just about leaving the tier at the time I saw the men sinking—she</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A boat getting from London to Black wall in forty minutes would not show the pace she was going through all the voyage, as she would be obliged to ease at times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they would make greater speed when they got below the tier—Evans did not get into my boat—my boat was hanging on to the stern of the barge—it is a wherry—I was about fifty or sixty feet from the long-boat that was raising the chain—the boat the man taved himself in was touching the <hi rend="italic">Culloden's</hi> boat—I was not touching that—he got into the boat by laying hold of her and scrambling into her—he was half in the water—the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi> was moored stern upwards with the previous tide—in my judgment it was the swell the steamer threw forward, when she passed by the tier, that capsised the boat—it lifted the boat forward first, then tightened the chain, and threw her down—this was between London-bridge and Limehouse<lb/>reach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary to the Margate and London Steam-Packet Company. The <hi rend="italic">Prince of Wales</hi> belongs to that company—I left London-bridge on board of her at ten o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 22nd of July—Capt. Foss had the command of her—we did not stop until we got to Blackwall, which is six miles and a half from London-bridge—we got to Btackwall about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock—that was her usual regular time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is the time the captain is directed to be at Black wall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the time of starting for the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> is also ten o'clock—her time to be at Blackwall is half-past ten—I went before the Coroner for the purpose of watching the proceedings—I gave the name of the captain—six and a half miles in forty minutes would make nine miles or a little more per hour, supposing the whole ground traversed at the same speed—they go much slower through the Pool—when we get clear of the tiers we go at full speed—I believe the Pool is three miles long—the captain attended before the Coroner as well as myself—the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> arrived at Blackwall before us—she was just a-head of us as we passed Horsleydown tier—she must have travelled quite as quickly as we did—I did not observe whether she made as much swell as we did—the captain was in his proper place on the paddle-box, looking out—I was not aware of any accident until we got to Blackwall, nor do I believe anybody else was aware of it—we kept midstream through the Pool—Capt. Foss has been a servant of the company about five months—before that he has been on Ramsgate station for about two years—he has been accustomed to the river all his life—he was always a steady sober man—he was per<lb/>fectly sober on this occasion—I never saw him otherwise.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal harbour-master of the City of London. I have been familiar with the river twenty-six years, and with the mode of navigating steam-boats—I should say eight or ten miles an hour is too great a speed for steam-boats 200 feet long to navigate through the Upper Pool—it requites less speed when going with the tide than against it—they are not so much under control—if the tide is running from four to five miles an hour, I should say a power of three would be quite sufficient to give her steerage-way—the run of the spring-tide, with a favourable wind, hardly exceeds three miles—I know it, because I have tried it with a log—when there is a strong gale down the river, it may run a little stronger—I never heard of its making six—to<lb/>day is the first time I ever heard an opinion that the tide runs six miles an hour—if the tide runs at three miles, I should say a power of three more would be employed to make her answer the helm—it depends on the vessel—at times they require more speed to avoid danger—if there is nothing in the way, three miles would be quite sufficient to make her navigable—I have seen considerable space made in the water by sailing vessels, but not so great as by steamers.</p>

               <p>a notion of their different tonnage—I have seen the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Thanet</hi> going through the water—that certainly makes some commotion particularly at that hour, ten o'clock—the whole Pool is stirred up at ten o'clock, almost like the Bay of Biscay—I certainly do not think it a prudent act for men to place themselves under a chain in this way at the time these vessels are going, because there is a safe mode of doing it by a chain lighter—it is what I would not allow any man to do if I was a master of a ship—the weight of the chain over the boat must weigh it down—the chain lighter is the proper way—we have chain lighters belonging to the Corporation, and always moor vessels with them—if I had been commander of the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>, I would not have allowed the men to get under the chain in this way, particularly when steam-boats were passing.</p>

On the night of the 3rd of Aug., at twelve o'clock, I was going down Stangate-street—I met the two prisoners—they stood in the middle of the path, and said, "My dear, where are you going?"—they seized hold of me, and took all sorts of liberties with me—while Upton was taking liberties with me, Code picked my pocket of four half-crowns—I put my hand to my pocket where I had had four half-crowns, and I missed them—I perceived that Code had robbed me, because Upton held me while Code picked my pocket—the money was in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I called, "Police;" and two men immediately flew from some door-way to the prisoners—there seemed like some conversation with them, and something was handed—one of the men ran off—the other came to me, and said, "Don't be alarmed, I will protect you"—I would not leave the prisoners—they shuffled into another street, to get away from me, but I would not leave them—I said, "You have robbed me;" and they made a sort of jeer of it—the policeman came up, and I gave them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Kennington-place. On the 1st of Aug., a few minutes after ten o'clock, I was leaving my shop to go into the parlour behind—when I got to the parlour door I heard some money rattle—I turned and saw Baylis leaning on the counter on his elbows, with a halfpenny in his hand—he asked me for a halfpenny-worth of Negrohead tobacco—I said I did not sell it—he then turned, and was about to leave the shop—I looked into my till, and found all the money was gone—I missed a sixpence and two fourpenny pieces, which I had put in the minute before, and what other money there had been in it I do not know—I jumped over the counter, ran round the cor<lb/>ner, and caught Baylis in Devonshire-place—my house is the corner house but one to Devonshire-place—I saw Dibbin was just parting from him—I took Baylis back—I said, "I want that money you have taken out of my till"—he said, "What money?"—he said he had none about him—I said, "You have given it to that other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>"—Dibbin was then in the road—he had come back, and was standing near my door—Baylis called to him and said, "<hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi>," and Dibbin ran away—after he was gone, Baylis said, "If you will come with me I will take you to the place where the money is"—I said I would keep him—he then ran off, I ran after him up Kennington-lane, and he was taken again.</p>

About ten o'clock that morning I saw the three prisoners standing at the corner of Vauxhall-street, right opposite the prosecutor's shop—I saw Baylis and Dibbin leave Wright on the other side of the way, and come across to Mr. Collins's shop—I saw Baylis go inside, and Dibbin was standing outside—I then went in<lb/>doors, and in a few minutes I went into Devonshire-street, and saw Baylis and Dibbin come down the street, and Baylis gave Dibbin some silver—Mr. Collins then came round the corner, he pursued Baylis and took him—Dibbin then went and gave something to Wright, and they went off together—Dibbin came and stood by Mr. Collins's shop—some person said, "That is the boy that was at the door," and he ran off.</p>

I live at No. 3, Camden Villas, Camden<lb/>grove, Peck-ham, and am a builder—the prisoner came to me about the 20th of June and entered into a contract for building houses, and I was to find materials for the work—after he had entered into the contract, he said he had more bair than he wanted for Mr. Morgan's work, and asked me to take some—he said he had a two hundred weight bag—on the 27th of June he produced the hair to me, and I agreed to buy it at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred—I agreed to have one hundred and a half—he said that would be enough for my job—he then drew all the money he could on Saturday night, and left my job—I went to inquire where he was, and gave information to the prosecutor—the hair was all used except about a handful, which the policeman took away—I am sure what he took was some of the same hair that I had from the prisoner—the policeman took possession of the very same bag in which the hair was brought.</p>

My traveller sold 2 cwt. of hair to Mr. Mor-gan, and I directed a quantity of hair to be packed up from a heap in my warehouse—I have looked at this hair produced by the officer—there is nothing particular about it now, but when I saw it before in the officer's possession, previous to going before the magistrate, there was a small lock of seal-hair amongst it, and by some means it was lost—I took possession of it, but what became of it I cannot tell—in my warehouse in which the hair was which I directed to be packed up for Mr. Morgan, there was a great quantity of seal hair—it is probable that some of it might have got into that sent to Mr. Morgan, and I saw some of it in the hair produced by the officer—it would have been of no use to Mr. Morgan at all—I do not know of any one who sells hair to plasterers having seal hair—this hair produced is similar to what I had in bulk, and sold to Mr. Morgan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brickmaker, and live at Battersea. The pri<lb/>soner worked in the same field. Last Saturday night I took him to ray house to sleep, because he was very much intoxicated—I was sober—we got home about half-past ten o'clock at night—I counted my money—I had three half-crowns, one shilling, a fourpenny piece, and three halfpence—I put the three half-crowns in one of my jacket pockets, to pay the rent—I put the shilling in another pocket, and the rest of the money in ano-ther pocket, but all in my jacket—I put my jacket at the foot of the stairs—I went to bed, and did not awake till a quarter past eight; but the night before the prisoner made a mistake and went into my bed, and my wife called me to turn him out, which I did, and he left his clothes down stairs—in the morning I found my jacket, but it was removed from where I left it, and the money was gone—I saw the prisoner several hours after<lb/>wards, and asked him to return the money—he denied having it.</p>

On Sunday, the 22nd of June, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in the Caraberwell-road—I went into Windmill-lane, and saw Hare and Payne, and a great many other persons—Hare was rather drunk, and was stripped to fight—I requested him to go away—he said he should when he liked; but when he found I was desirous for him to go, he went, and the people separated after a few minutes—some time afterwards I received information, and went to Nelson-street, and saw Hare throwing up his hat and jacket, and there were fifty or more persons about—I went to the Walworth-road, and got Wigzell—when we got to the bottom of Windmill-lane we saw Chantler at a distance, and beckoned him—when we got to Nelson-street I saw Hare in fustian or corded trowsers—he had no coat or waistcoat on—his shirt-sleeves were tucked up, and his handkerchief tied round his waist—he was throwing up his hat and jacket, and challenging any one to fight—he challenged several in my presence—he did not speak to one alone—I went up to him with Wigzell, and said he must go to the station—he wanted to know what for—I said he would know that when he got to the station—he went a short distance very quietly, then turned very restive indeed—I requested him to go quietly, and told him we were taking him to the station—he requested to know the charge—I said, "Being drunk and disorderly, and creating a disturbance"—he said he would not go, life or death first—he laid himself down on the ground seve-ral times—after we got a short distance Payne came up and caught hold of Hare by the braces and shirt, and said he would be d—d if he should go; he should go along with him—I told Payne to take his hands off him, or I would break his arms with my truncheon—he continued to hold on to Hare several times after that—Hare laid himself down on the ground, and said, if we would allow him to button his shirt up, he would go quietly—I had seen him kick out several times before that—we allowed him to get up, and he was about buttoning his shirt, when he clenched hit, fist, struck me in the face, and made my nose bleed—he struck Wigzell, who very nearly fell, but he held on by Hare, and kept himself up—I then drew my truncheon, and struck Hare on the head, who fell to the ground—when Hare struck me in the face my truncheon was in my pocket—there was a hooting and shouting of the people, and a singing out to Hare not to go with us—he got up, and struggled, and the mob all closed in upon us—we were being overpowered, and I went to the corner of Wind-mill-lane, to get more assistance—Wigzell and Chantler remained with Hare—I returned with three other officers in about three minutes—Hare</p>

               <p>Sunday night, the 22nd of June, I was at home—I saw Wig-zell and Kayser in Windmill-lane, and Hare in custody—I did not hear Hare say anything then, but when Payne came and took hold of his braces and said, "Don't go," Hare said, "I will be d—d if I will go"—I knew Payne before, but I did not know Hare—I saw Eliza Norman strike Wigzell—she is the wife, or lives as a wife with William Passfield—when she struck Wigzell he turned round with a random blow and struck her on the neck or the back part of the head—that was after several ups and downs with Payne and Hare, and Wigzell was getting exhausted, Passfield came off the foot-path and struck Wigzell two or three times with his fists on the back part of his person—I saw the three. Goodrights there, Flinn, Pass-field, Mannix, and Shae—I saw Flinn have hold of the officer's belt, pull-ing him across, and striking him—Mannix had hold of his belt at the same time, and another person who is not in custody—I saw Wigzell on the ground, and Payne had hold of Chantler's staff—I went in and saw William Goodright stamping on Wigzell as he lay on the ground—I went to assist, and I heard some one say, "There is the b—y cork-cutter gone to help the <hi rend="italic">Peelers"</hi>—James and Henry Goodright were edging in against the officer, and Shae was inciting Hare on, and saying, "Go it, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>—give it him, <hi rend="italic">Tom."</hi>

On the 8th of April I went out at the back door, and saw the prisoner sowing seeds in that ground—I told my husband—I then went and said to the prisoner, "My husband says it is useless for you to sow soed in that ground, for we want it to plant potatoes"—he said, "I will see him d—d first before I will give it up"—I returned to the cottage—my husband went out and told him it was no use for him to sow his seed, as he wanted it himself to plant potatoes; and how foolish it was of him to be so obstinate—the prisoner said, "You do, do you; I will tee you d—d before I will give it up"—my husband said, "The ground I want, and the ground I will have"—the prisoner said, "I will not give it up without it is by law"—he had bad a notice to quit the ground, and told my husband that be ought to have a twelvemonths' notice, not six—my husband said he never knew a twelvemonths' notice, six months' notice was always good in law—the prisoner said he would not give it up, and my husband said he should—the prisoner then said he would have a fair up and down for it—I suppose he meant a fight—he said, "You ought to have taken possession of the ground"—my husband said, "I am always in possession of my own ground while my cottage stands on it"—when my husband first went on the ground and spoke to the prisoner, he went a little distance, raised his arm, and drove his left elbow into my husband's chest, and threw him flat on his back—my husband had not done anything to him before he did that—I cried out, and said, "Oh, Mr. Hurvey, you will kill my husband!"—my husband got up, and said, "What did you do that for?"—the prisoner said, "If you don't stand out of my way I will knock your b—y life out!" and the prisoner's niece said "He did not knock your husband down, he only pushed him down"—when my husband said he was always in possession while bis cottage stood on it, the prisoner said that was not possession, my husband ought to have</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hen and Chicken<lb/>Jane, Walworth. This matter happened on a Tuesday morning—I lived next door to Mr. Ratherbee's cottage, on the right hand—I saw Harvey sowing seed—I saw Mrs. Ratherbee go up to him, and I heard her say, "Mr. Harvey, my husband has sent me to tell you it is not any use your sowing seeds in the ground, for we want it to plant potatoes in"—the prisoner said, "I will see him d—d first"—she went into the cottage—Mr. Ratherbee and she came out—they went straight to the prisoner, and Mr. Ratherbee said, "Mr. Harvey, what is the use of being so foolish not to give up the ground? you have had a regular notice six months, why do you want twelve months?"—the prisoner said, "I will have twelve months"—Mr. Ratherbee said, "A six months' written notice is quite plenty by law"—the prisoner said, "I will not give it up unless by law"—Mr. Ratherbee said, "I do not want to go to law, I have no money to go to law; all I want is for you to give up the ground by peace and quietness"—I then saw the prisoner go from Mr. Ratherbee—he stooped, and picked up a stick, which appeared to me to be about six inches long—he was marking the beds of seed with it—I then went into my cottage for a cup of coffee, and as I got up to return I looked through the window, and saw the pri<lb/>soner going towards Mr. Ratherbee with his left elbow up—in passing to the door I lost sight of them for a moment, and did not see the blow struck—when</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Canterbury-row, and am a sur<lb/>geon. On the 10th of April I was called to attend the deceased—he had a vessel by his bed-side witb a quantity of blood in it, and was spitting blood at the time—he complained of pain in his side, which he said bad been caused by a blow—I examined his chest—I found no bruise, and nothing to indicate a blow, but by examining with my ear I heard a noise in the chest—the spitting of blood proceeded from the rupture of a blood-vessel—it diminished gradually for about three weeks—he went on for a week or ten days without, and then there was a return of it—it diminished again by treatment, but from his general state of ill health it returned—he went to the hospital—I saw him there—he was very low, and was expec-torating mucus tinged with blood—that was about the 29th of June—I did not see him again alive—on the 2nd of Aug. I saw him lying dead at his house—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found the cells of the lungs dilated very much, which I attributed to his occupation as a trumpeter—the lungs were gorged with mucus, a little quantity of blood and air—there was an extensive disease as well, which had existed for some time—that would eventually have caused him to die—the lung where the vessel had been ruptured had recovered itself—there had been extensive bleeding, and the effect of that was to weaken him, and cause great debility—the more immediate cause of his death was the state of the air-cells and the spitting of blood, which would decidedly weaken him—supposing him to have received a blow from a man's elbow on the 10th of April, which knocked him down, and he bad been then pulled about the ground, one or both of those things would account for the rupture of a blood vessel, and that would accelerate the disease—he would have died of the diseased lungs, but the rupture of the vessel would accelerate the disease.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bolingbroke-row, and am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on the 9th of July—I found his respiration carried on very imperfectly, scarcely at all in the right lung, and very slightly through the left—I attended his <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—Mr. Otway has described it correctly—the deceased stated to me, while I was attending him, that he had ruptured a blood-vessel six months before; that a caldron which the japanners used was overset or burst, and nearly suffocated every person, that they were obliged to leave the place to get fresh air, and when he got out he had a cough which caused him to vomit blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If an injury of that kind had existed six months, would there not be a predisposition of body to have a similar occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is a difficult question to answer whether he died from the bursting of a blood-vessel from excitement, or from external injury—if a man had received a blow with an elbow sufficient to knock him down, it would rather surprise me if there had been no mark—there was no internal evidence that any external injury had been sustained—I was particularly careful in that respect.</p>
