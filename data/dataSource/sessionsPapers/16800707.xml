Having thus chastized the Coachman, Mr. Doughty went from him into the Court-yard and shut the door after him; but the Coachman not yet satisfied, followed, and clapping his foot to the door, pusht it open: then Mr. Doughty drew his Sword, and gave him several wounds; one Witness seemed to say, Mr. Hambletons Sword was also drawn, but the rest did not see any such thing; but 'twas proved, that the poor man being down, after he had received some wounds, begged very heartily for his Life that he would not kill him, crying out he was wounded; whereupon Doughty desisting from his fury, some people took him up, and opening his Doublet, found abundance of Blood: he had below the left pap a large wound, and as was supposed deep, being run into the Body; but the Witnesses for the Prisoner represented it as onely superficial, that the Rapier glanc'd along on the Ribs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16800707004"/>and so made very little penetration; he was likewise wounded in the Thigh, and on the Nose, and forehead, and a Cut on the hand.

To which Justice Arnold, who was ready with his Witnesses, answered; That he had as much notice of the time of Tryal as himself; That he had brought up his Witnesses, and so might the said Giles if he had any; and that the matter was made publick enough, notice having been given that it should now be Tryed, in the Gazet; the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor was likewise very urgent not to have it put off any longer, as apprehending these pretences and delays to be nothing but the usual shams which Papists commonly have to shuffle off Justice; but at last, to the end the Prisoner might not have the least pretence to complain that he was surprized, the Court was pleased to put his Tryal off till Wednesday next in the afternoon, and by the time, if he have any Witnesses, he may bring them even from St. Omers. Mr. Herbert, formerly in custody concerning the same matter, and Bailed, was now bound over again, with Sureties to appear the first day of next Term at the Kings Bench-Bar, he having since, (as was proved by several Witnesses) most violently and inhumanely beaten a poor Woman in the Countrey, and to his fury gave this worthy reason for it. That she had done his Friend Giles an injury, or words to that effect, as supposing it seems her concerned in discovering him. He seemed to resent it hard, that he should be prosecuted by so mean a person, but was very well answered, That when he should beat women of greater Quality, he should have better people to prosecute him; in the mean time, 'twas all the reason in the world that this Woman though never so poor, should have right done her.</p>
