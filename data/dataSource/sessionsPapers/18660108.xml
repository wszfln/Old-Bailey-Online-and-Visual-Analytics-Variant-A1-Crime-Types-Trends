I am a master mariner, and my ship should have sailed this morning—I was in the Commercial-road last night about 7 o'clock—the prisoner caught hold of my watch-guard, and some other men attacked me behind—a struggle ensued between us, and I was thrown to the ground, and dragged about 20 yards—just before I had my watch in my hand—I saw it in the prisoner's hand—I held him fast—I tore his clothes nearly off his back in the struggle—I value the watch at 21 guineas—it was presented to me by my owner.</p>

I live at 30, Tunbridge-street, Euston-road—I have been a soldier, and have three Indian medals and four bars—I have since been a labourer—on 27th December, about half-past 12, I was in a public-house in Tunbridge-street, with Ann French, who is a friend of my wife's—as I came out I saw the prisoner and five or six others—the prisoner stood on my left, about two yards from me as I came out—I stood still, and he said to a man, "Jack, you be on to him, and, God blind me, I will not miss him this time"—a man in a lightish coat then came up and struck me on the eyebrow, a sharp blow with something sharp, I cannot say whether it was his fist—I have the mark still—it bled furiously—the prisoner then came up and made a grasp at my medals—he only left me this one bar—they were silver—he ran off the roadway, but the female who was by my side seized him, and a man seized me at the same time, who held me, and prevented me following the prisoner—I had never seen the prisoner before—I am sure he is the man—the medals were dropped into my area last Wednesday week.

I am 18 years of age—I have known Collingridge about six or eight years—I was in the service of Mr. Willis—his shop is about five minutes' walk from Collingridge's—I entered their service about five weeks before I was taken into custody—I went to Collingridge's about half-past 8 or 9 on the Monday or Tuesday evening—the shop was shut up but the door was not bolted—I went in and and saw Collingridge there—I told him I wanted some money, that I had got two rings, and I asked him to advance me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so for a day or two—he advanced me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I told him I would call in a few days—he made no inquiry of me as to where I pro<lb/>cured the rings—two days having elapsed I went there again; the shop was then full of people, and I waited outside about twenty minutes; this was at half-past ten on the Thursday morning—after I thought all the persons had left, I went in, but I found another person sitting behind a clock—I had these thirteen rings with me—I gave Mr. Collingridge the rings wrapped up in paper, and said, "Here is thirteen more of them rings, I want to sell them"—he said, "Just give me a piece of paper where they came from"—I then went into a coffee-shop and wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "28, Hawley-crescent, Camden-town, December, 1865.

                  </hi>, M. D. I live at Ilford—on 26th Decem<lb/>ber, I made a post<lb/>mortem examination of the deceased at the Chequers Inn—I found he bad suffered from slight bleeding from the nose, and there was a puffy swelling at the back part of the head, on the right side—on removing the scalp, I found, in the locality of that swelling, a quantity of effused blood under the scalp, and upon opening the scalp I found a large extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, which was the cause of death—looking at the external marks, I should say that whatever caused them, caused the extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—extravasation might arise from excitement—I cannot say whether it would be more likely to arise from a blow—in a man of his age, it would be quite as possible to arise from excitement and over fulness of the vessels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Judging from what you saw, what was the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, caused by a blow or a fall—I say that under certain conditions, the extravasation would be as likely to arise from fulness of the vessels, but seeing marks of external violence inclines my opinion another way—there had not been much bleeding from the nose—his age was sixty-four—if I had not seen the marks of violence, I should, probably, have said that death arose from apoplexy, but seeing the external marks of violence, I am able to say that they make it in a high degree improbable that the extravasation arose from excitement and over-fulness—my opinion is that he died from the effects of extravasa<lb/>tion of blood at the base of the brain, produced by violence—that is much more likely than that he died from over-excitement and over-fulness of the vessels, but it is not totally inconsistent with the other state of facts—the marks of violence do not exclude the possibility of over-fulness of the vessels and excitement—I have heard the evidence before.</p>

               <p>the day, there is a possibility of its arising from excessive excitement—there was no fracture of the skull, and the puffy swelling was not over the seat of the injury—the extravasation was the result of the rupture either of several small vessels or one large one—I did not ascertain which—it is the occasional result of a blow that vessels are ruptured, as in the case of prize-fighters, and the case of over-fulness; that is the common form which it takes—drinking, dancing, quarrelling would undoubtedly have a tendency to increase the peril from over-fulness of blood.</p>

               <p>with the exception of certain alterations in salary—his duties were, to take orders and receive sums of money, which he was to remit to us not later than the following Tuesday—he would post them on the Monday, so that we should receive them on the Tuesday—his accounts were in this form (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is the name of the customer, the amount due, and the amount received—it was his duty to remit the money to us—he had no authority to endorse checks or bills, and he had been told so—it was not his duty to receive money at Birmingham—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the first sheet we received after 25th August—there is no entry on it of any amount from Messrs. Rolleson—their name does not appear in it—it is a Birmingham account, and it was not his duty to receive it—the sheets did not come up regularly every week, and we had made complaints to him respecting that—Mr. Foster's account does not appear here—he had no authority to endorse that particular cheque—there is no entry on the receipt of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the en<lb/>dorsement on the cheque is, "For the Patent Crucible Company, Charles C. Cooper"—I never heard of this sum being received by him until I heard it from Messrs.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter</hi>). I came to this country on 1st June last—at the time I came, I was in company with a Russian gentleman—shortly after I came, I put myself in communication with Inspector Thompson—I came in the company of a person named Bayer—I first saw the prisoner about six, eight, or ten days after my arrival; I cannot say exactly—I saw him at Spencer's hotel, near London-bridge—I was in company with Bayer, Berrens, and Londinski—Bayer and Berrens are the persons who were convicted last Sessions—I came to the place with Bayer and Berrens, and Londinski brought the prisoner there—they introduced the prisoner as the person who understood how to make the plates for forged notes—the conversation was to the effect that we spoke about it, and I asked him if it was really true that he understood how to make these things—he answered Yes, he did understand it, and told me that on several occasions already he had worked in that line, and had been doing business with Holchester here; that he also had been acquainted with a man named Miller, who had already been taken in custody before for forged plates, and that he had been assisting that man in making those plates; that he had already managed a similar business in Riga, only they were betrayed there, and that he was ready to establish such a factory for me as well—something was said about a sample—I told him I wanted to be sure if he could make something and do something, and he promised to make a sample in a few days—there the matter remained, and it was agreed that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186601080033"/>
               <p>should make that sample at Bayer's house, under the supervision of the other people—it was said that, if the sample turned out well, a house was to be taken, in which the manufactory should be established—the manufactory was to make forged 25-rouble Russian notes—some short time after that, the prisoner came and brought a steel or iron plate with him, and told me he would engrave on it a sample, namely, an eagle—an eagle is on the genuine rouble Russian notes—there was nothing on the plate the first time I saw it, it was quite smooth—he afterwards showed me the same plate with the eagle of a 25-rouble note on it—after that, I told them to look for a house, on which the prisoner brought me a newspaper, saying that he had found a house in it advertised at Pinner—that was a very short time after I had seen the eagle on the steel plate—I went to Pinner with the prisoner and Bayer one evening in a hired carriage—the carriage was hired at Camber<lb/>well-gate—when we got to Pinner, the house was not any longer to let—we stopped and dined at the hotel at Pinner—I afterwards hired a house at 11, Russell-street, Camberwell—from time to time I was the prisoner, Berrens, Holchester, Bayer, Davis, and Silberman—Silberman I saw least of all—all those persons were convicted last Sessions—the first letter I received from the prisoner was in August—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter—he gave it me himself, into my hand—I was examined as a witness last Sessions—on my cross-examination by the prisoner, he called on me to produce that letter—it is now in pieces—he told me he had already written me an answer at home, and gave this letter into my hands at his own house in Portland-street, or something like that—I went to his lodgings because I was expecting an answer to my letter—I had previously written him a letter—I said something to him when I went to him as to his not having answered my letter—I do not recollect the date; it was immediately after I gave him the letter—I said something about his not having replied to the letter, and then he gave me the letter—on the back of my letter he wrote his answer (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "2 o'clock, afternoon, 22 August, '65. <hi rend="smallCaps">DR.

You will see by these few lines how much I have penetrated in this man; and apologizing that I could not do anything for you, I hope you will excuse my not personally coming to you, I being too much engaged in my business, and having been always exposed to un<lb/>pleasantness when I have stopped away.

I was acting in concert with Mr. Thompson in respect to this matter, and in July and August, from time to time, I saw the prisoner in company of the persons who were convicted here last Session—I saw them at 11, Little Russell-street—after they were taken into custody, I went by Inspector Thompson's directions, and searched for the prisoner—I went to Great Portland-street, where he lodged—I did not go to the house, but I watched it till he came in—it is No. 23—I stopped him as he was going towards the door, and said, "Your name is Braun"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Very well, I am a police-officer, I shall take you in custody for being concerned with a number of persons now in custody, and having in their possession a number of forged Russian rouble notes, which have been found at 11, Russell-street, Camberwell"—he said, "Oh yes, I know all about it"—I said, "Stop, before you tell me anything, let me tell you that whatever you say, I must use in evidence against you"—he said, "I am the man who has given the police information about it"—he was in custody then; I had taken him—I said, "What police?"—he said, "The City police, Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Scott"—they are in the City police force—I said, "when"—he said, "A long time ago"—I said, "What do you call a long time"—he said, "A year; I told them that Berrens, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Heidelrich, came to me and wanted me to engrave plates for making 50-rouble Russian notes; I agreed to. do so, but nothing was brought to me; some time after, Holchester came to me also, wanted me to engrave plates for the making of 50 Russian rouble notes, telling me I should be well paid for what I did; I agreed to do so on that occasion, but, as on the other, nothing was brought me"—he then said to me that about three weeks ago, he had seen Holchester and Berrens, who told him they were doing him a good thing with the 5-rouble notes, and again wanted him to make plate—we then arrived at the station, and no more was said—the prisoner never made any communication to me until I took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>.

O. 31, 001 to 31, 050—eleven of the cheques were presented cashed, and afterwards returned to him, and after that cash was paid on these eleven other checks which I have in my hand, but they were not given up to him—there was no money of Parry's in the bank at the end of 1862, he had overdrawn 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which was paid to us on 29th January, 1863—that closed the account, and was the last transaction between us, no other cheques have been paid since that time, and there has been nothing to his credit since—in the course of keeping the accounts I became acquainted with Parry's writing—I should not like to say that this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing, nor to say that it is not—I doubt the signature as well as the body—these two cheques for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are two of those supplied to Parry—I believe the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to be Parry's writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a looking-lass manufacturer of Elliott-road, Broad-wall, Southwark—about four months ago Friend obtained some goods from my premises, but I was not there—I had made application to him several times for the payment of money, and on 11th November be came to my workshop with this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—he said that he had come to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off my account if I would change the cheque—I put my name on the back of it, and sent it out to get it changed, but I could not, and returned it to him—he called on me on Monday, 13th, paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said he would pay me the rest on Saturday—he said he had cashed the cheque, but did not mention Mr. White's name—Mr. White lives five or six doors off in the same street—on 1st December I went with Mr. White and Friend to Parry's—we went from Mr. White's house—Friend was in a public-house—I think it was the Cock and Castle—he said that the gentleman who drew the cheque lived a long way off, and it would take about two hours to go to him—Mr. White asked him for the money for the cheque—he said, "I have not got any money for it, and I want it," but he did not show Friend the cheque—Friend said, "I am very sorry, I will see Mr. Parry at ten to<lb/>morrow morning and bring him to you"—Mr. White said that would not do, it had been a long time in hand, and he wanted it settled—when we pressed him for the money he said it was a long way off—we proposed to take a cab, but he said he had to do some business, and it would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of his pocket, but when Mr. White said that he would lock him up, he consented to go and took us to Bethnal Green-road, which took about five minutes—we found Parry there—Friend went into the house and had a conversation with him—they both came out and walked up the street sharply—Mr. White and I followed them—he asked Parry about the cheque, who said he did not know anything about it—Friend said, "Yes, you do, you know all about it"—Parry said, "The fact is, it is a <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, I did it when I was half-drunk to oblige Friend, and we had the money between us"—Parry showed fight, and said he would knock Mr. White down; and that we had got a security for the money—we got into a cab, went to Norris-street, Haymarket, Parry having said, "I will take you where you can get security"—when we got into the cab be said that we had better let it be till next morning, as he did not expect we should find the gentleman, but we drove to Norris-street—the name of Whiteman was on the door where he knocked—a servant came who said that Mr. Whiteman would not be seen—we went three times to know if he would come down—Mr. White said it would be a pity to lose them now as they were such slippery customers, and gave them in charge, and they were taken to Vine-street, but they were not locked up—we were told that we ought to take a warrant out against them, so the charge was not taken—I saw Friend next night in a public-house in the Hackney-road, and pointed him out to a policeman, who followed him—he went to a dark turning which led very near to where he lives, and was taken into custody—I saw Parry on Tuesday morning, when he was brought up to the police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 47, Mark-lane—I know the prisoner—on the 28th August he was clerk to Mr. Dashwood, of 41, Eastcheap, who has a sale-room at Hackney, called St. Thomas's Hall—about 29th of August, I told the prisoner that I wished some goods sold, and if it would be anything in his way, I would employ his master, and he begged me to do so—thereupon I gave an order to Mr. Dashwood to receive the goods—I gave the order to the prisoner for Mr. Dashwood—I told him that I wanted some furniture sold, but I particularly stipulated that the contents of my drawers and my books were not to be sold by any means—the furniture was there at Taylor's Repository, Newington—it was for a ten-roomed house—there were two wardrobes, containing drawers, a peram<lb/>bulator, a bagfull of coins in one of the drawers, a bundle of Indian spears, a cruet-stand, two brushes, three trays, a telescope, two Indian fans, and a chest full of tools—I told the prisoner that the contents of the drawers generally were not to be touched—I afterwards saw my furniture at St. Thomas's Hall, Hackney, about the 24th August—I had seen it about four or five days before that at Newington—the drawers of the wardrobe were then</p>

               <p>locked—I had seen the 200 coins and the contents of the drawers about four days before they were removed from Taylor's Repository—I attended the sale—I examined the drawers, and found they were empty—they had been unlocked—I had not given the prisoner the keys—I was to have taken the things out of the drawers that day—I said, "The drawers have been forced open, and a great many things are missing"—he said he did not know any<lb/>thing about it, he had had nothing to do with it—on the day I gave him in custody, 13th December, I said to him, "Where is that whip of mine?"—he said, "I do not know what you mean, I have not seen one at all"—this was at a refreshment place in Eastcheap—on the same evening the daughter of the keeper of the refreshment-room showed me about fifty coins—they were the same coins that I had missed—I had last seen them about 24th August, at Taylor's Repository—about 30th August, I said to the prisoner, "What has become of that bundle of Indian spears, and a driving-whip?"—he said he did not know anything about them—about the middle of September, he gave me an empty tool-chest—he said that he had taken it home in case it should be lost—about 24th August, I missed my perambulator, and I asked him what had become of it—he said that it was broken all to pieces, and that it was not worth while keeping it—afterwards he said he had sold it for three shillings, which he gave me—on the evening of 13th December, I went with the officer, Head, to his house at Herne hill—we found there some Indian spears, two brushes, duplicates of two ivory fans, and a duplicate of a whip.</p>
