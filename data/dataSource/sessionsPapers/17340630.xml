They boxt fairly; the Deceas'd had the better, and the Prisoner said he would fight no more, in the Nine-pin-Ground among Black-guards; but would fight it out in a Room. The Deceas'd was for having it out in the Ground. Then the Prisoner clapp'd him on the Back, and call'd him a good Lad. They shook Hand three times very lovingly, and went to boxing again. The Prisoner struck the Deceas'd upon the Temples, which made him stagger, and as he was falling the Prisoner kick'd him on the Breast and the Groin, and he fell down, and lay for dead; but he was brought a little to himself in about half an Hour.

I was much surpriz'd, and said, Don't frighten me, and I'll give you all. I gave him my Purse, he pull'd off my Glove, and took 2 Rings, one, which was a Mourning-ring, he pull'd off, and I think, I gave him the other. I desir'd him to return me a Key, that was in the Purse, but he damn'd me, and rode off. My Coachman drove to the Turnpike, and then desir'd me to let him take one of the Horses, and pursue the Highwayman. I <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300004"/> gave him leave, and he follow'd them, and they were both taken that Night. But some, who took the Prisoner, let him go again.

             (the Prosecutor's Coachman.) A little on this side the Turnpike that goes to Newington-Green, I saw the Prisoner and another coming through the Turnpike, they past the Chariot and turn'd short and said, Damn you stop! But not stoping immediately, the Prisoner cry'd, Damn your Body and Soul, stop or I'll shoot you this Minute He had a Pistol in his Hand. I stop'd, and he went to the Chariot-door to my Mistress, and another Lady who was with her, and Damn'd their Bloods for a Couple of Bitches, bid them deliver their Watches. They said they had none. Then he demanded their Money and Rings, and I saw him take a Ring off my Mistresses's Finger. The other Rogue was then on the Off-side of the Chariot. They rid away together towards Islington, and I drove to the Turnpike, took one of the Horses, and rais'd an Hue and Cry, and pursued them to Holloway, where they parted. One of them went towards Highgate, and was follow'd by some of the Company. The Prisoner quitted his Horse, ran down a Lane, and got into a Field. I dismounted too, and pursued him - One of the Company leap'd the Hedge with his Horse, and rode up to the Prisoner who offer'd a a Pistol at him, but another came behind the Prisoner, and pull'd him backwards. My Horse being left in the Lane with another Horse, they fell a Kicking one another; and the Prisoner being seiz'd, I went to take care of my Horse, and in the mean time those who had got the Prisoner let him slip away, for it seems they were acquainted with him - I am positive that he is the Man, and I pick'd him out among several in Newgate - He had brown Clothes, and his Horse was a White Grey, but very dirty.</p>

            . As I and 3 or 4 more were binding Hay at Holloway, we heard the Hue and Cry, and saw the Prisoner ride down the Lane between Mother Red-Cap's and the Castle, and Ward follow'd him. The Prisoner quitted his Horse, ran through a great Slough, and got over the Hedge into the Field. We ran to assist, and the Gentleman being unwilling to ride through the Slough, put me upon his Horse and I leap'd the Hedge and came up with the Prisoner. He drew a Pistol and offer'd to fire at me, but another Gentleman came behind him and pull'd him backwards, and the Pistol fell out of his Hand. Then I laid hold of his Pistol, and Ward was <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300005"/> the next Man who came up. Ward's Horse quarrelling with another, in the Lane, he ran to part them, and I follow'd to assist him, and as I return'd I met 20 or 30 of them in a Body, and they said the Prisoner was gone.</p>

On Tuesday Morning, the 19th of March, my Bureau (which stands in Mr. Thornbury's Dressing-room, on the first Floor) was broke, the Back-doors of my House left open, and the Prisoner was not to be found.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Fleet. A Table-cloth out of the Kitchen, but I know not what Money was taken out of my Bureau. For Mr. Thornbury who is my Relation, receives my Rents for me, and he had put some of my Money there, and I had not settled with him since he receiv'd it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornbury. About 12 at Night, the Prisoner as usual undrest me in my Dressing-room where the Bureau stood, and he put my silver Buckles in his Pocket to clean them next Morning as I thought, but about 7 in the Morning I heard he was gone. As I did not think he had taken any thing with him but his Livery and my Buckles, I only said Let him go - he's a sorry Fellow. But going into my Dressing room, I found the Bureau was broke open and mist 27 l. 14 s. 6 d. of Mrs. Fleet's Money, and 23 l. the Money of

But opening a Book I had put them in, I found them all safe. We went to the Cheshire-Cheese in Arundel-street where the Prisoner had lodg'd; we heard he had hired a Horse of Mr. Child behind St-Clement's-Church, and had changed his Livery. I got a 1000 Advertisements printed, describ'd the Prisoner and his Horse, and put them in the Post-Office to be sent all over England. On Friday the Horse was return'd <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300006"/> to Mr. Child, and he told me he had heard the Prisoner was at Huntington. I sent Mr. Child Post after him, and he return'd on Saturday Night, and said the Prisoner was taken with 41l. and my Buckles upon him, and committed to Huntington Goal. Here's the Money and Buckles seal'd up in this Bag.</p>

            . I had been out of Town, and when I return'd, my Partner told me, he had let a Horse to the Prisoner. In the Evening Madam Fleet's Servant came to enquire if the Prisoner had hired a Horse. I said Yes. They told me he had committed a Robbery. 3 Days after this the York Coachman brought back my Horse. I told him what had happen'd, and he said he had left the Prisoner at Stevenage; and if I took Post I might get to Huntington before the Coach went out. I accordingly took Post Horses at Mid night, and came to Huntington by 7 in the Morning; but the York Coach was gone. I and the Landlord follow, and at the End of 6 Miles overtook it, and seiz'd the Prisoner. I ask'd him how he came to rob his Mistress. He said he had done it, and could not help it. I found 2 Guineas, half a Moidore, and some Silver, in his Pocket, and he said it was his Mistresses's Money and that the rest was in his Cloak-bag. I search'd the Cloak-bag, and found 7 pair of Stockings, some Linnen, a pair of silver Buckles, 12 Moidores, 11 Guineas, and 3 Portugal Pieces of 3 l. 12 s. each. I carried him before Justice Forkington, at Huntington, where he made a Confession, and afterwards he wrote this Letter, (I saw him write part of it) to his Mistress, and I carried it to her, at her House in Great-James-street in Bedford-Row.</p>
               <p>Then the Letter was read. He therein says, he has confest all before the Justice, and begs Pardon of his Mistress, acknowledges that he had receiv'd her Pardon once before; but his fellow Servants twitting him with it; that put him upon Robbing her and running away.</p>
               <p>His Confession being prov'd, was likewise read in Court. In this, he owns, that about 6 in the Morning he broke open the Escritore in Mrs. Fleet's House, and took away 12 Moidores, 3 Portugal 2 l. 12 s. Pieces, 3 Guineas, a half Moidore, and about 8 l. in Silver, and a pair of silver Buckles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Mr. Child took me, he said if I'd own the Fact, my Mrs. would take me into her Service again, and I being in Confusion and Light-headed, by means of a late Feaver, I did not know what I said or sign'd, but I remember that Mr. Child Pick'd my Pocket.</p>

As I was changing a Guinea, for a Customer, the Prisoner came in, and desir'd me to change her Guinea too, for she said, she wanted Sugar and Plumbs I saw she had Silver and Halfpence in one Hand, and told her, she had more Silver than would pay for what she wanted; but she said, she had occasion for more Silver. I had some Silver and Gold in a Paper. I told her I had never a half Guinea, and with that, she thrust her Hand among the Money, and said, Here's a half Guinea; and here's another. I ask'd her, What she meant by that? And catching hold of her Hand, I took two Guineas out of it, and then bid her go about her Business, for I would change no Money for her. Well, says she, give me my Guinea again. I told her, I had no Guinea of hers. Yes, says she, but you have, for one of these you took out of my Hand was mine. I told her, I knew what was in the Paper, for it was set down, and if I found a Guinea too much, she should have it. I cast up the Money, and miss'd some, but being a little in a Fluster, I could not exactly tell how much. It's hard, says she, that I should lose my Guinea, and so she went away very quietly. A Friend of mine, who was in the Shop, said he believ'd she had got something, or she would not have gone away so easy, and so he went and brought her back. I was now a little more cool, and cast up the Money more carefully, and found I wanted 20 s. or a Guinea, tho' I reckon'd the two Guineas I had taken out of her Hand, and so I call'd a Constable.</p>

I found the Flaps lock'd fast, but upon opening them, there was neither Bill nor Money. I ask'd the Maid where the Prisoner was. She said he went out about 9 a Clock in a hurry, and said, he must be at 9 a Clock Prayers, and would come home at half an Hour past 12. I thought to go and see for him, at the Portugueze Chappel, but considering it was almost his time to return, I waited 'till 1 a Clock, and hearing nothing of him then, I sent Touchet to enquire of the Gentleman who recommended the Prisoner, and went myself to the Water-side, where I heard that some such Person was gone off in the Gravesend-Boat. I immediately got a Post-horse, and arriv'd at Gravesend before the Boat; but when it came in, he was not among the Passengers. So I left a Description of him, and return'd, concluding he was still in Town. I desir'd one to lie at the Water-side, and I myself lay at the Post-house; but the Prisoner came to neither Place. Next Morning, being Monday, I went to all the Persons who were concern'd in the Notes, to let them know the Notes were stoln I return'd at Noon, and found our People at home look'd much pleasanter. They told me, the Portugueze Ambassador's Priest had brought cash and Notes, to the value of 854 l. 14 s. They said, they did not think it safe to stop him - He was one who had recommended the Prisoner. On Thursday, I heard that the Prisoner had been at Brentford, and hir'd a Horse for Windsor. I went to Brentford, and found the Man who left him the Horse; he was under no concern about losing his Horse, for he said, the Prisoner had left 7 l. for Security, and was gone to Windsor, to meet the Prince of Orange. I return'd home, and got 500 Advertisements printed, and left them at the Post-Office, to be spread in England and Ireland. Next Wednesday a Letter came from Mr. Ford, at Bath, advising, that on seeing the Advertisement he had stopt the Prisoner.</p>

My Husband went to give Security for the Money; but Mr. Hague told me, if I placed 20 l. in a Friend's Hands, something might be done - I lodg'd the Money in Mr. Havers's Hands, and afterwards put 5 l. more to it by Mr. Ross's Orders, and Mr. Hague told me he'd stand by what Mr. Ross did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hague. I never told her so.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Barker. No; for when the Justice took his Confession, they turn'd me out.</p>

            . The Wednesday after the Prisoner was taken, I went, with Mrs. Barker, to Mr. Ross's, and Mr. Hague was there. Mr. Barker, the Prisoner's Father-in-Law, was to give a Bond of 30 l. and Mr. Hague agreed to it; for Mr. Ross, said, Must I make it for thirty Pound? And Mr. Hague said, Yes. And he bid me agree with Mr. Ross, for, says he, If you make it easy with him, I shall be easy.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barker. And Ross said, Down with your ready Rhino.</p>

She made me no Answer; but the Prisoner's Mother said, she was very ill. Aye, says the Prisoner, She has got a Black Eye. How came she by it? says I. Why, says he, I gave it her accidentally. I think you are always giving her black Eyes, says I. But this was her own Fault, says he; for Yesterday, while I was gone out with two Gallons of Brandy, Sam Badham and another+ came in to drink, and that other Man struck my Wife on the Breast. I coming home before he was gone, my Wife said will you see me murder'd? And upon that I knock'd him down, but she going to take his Part, I happen'd to give her a black Eye - I went next Day, When the Prisoner said, his Mother (Mrs. <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300011"/> Ray) had fetch'd his Wife away in a Chair to her House in Eagle-street; so I went to see her there. She was lying upon the Bed in a loose Gown. She had a terrible black Eye, and as I kneel'd by the Bed-side, she said, as plain as she could speak - I am kill'd - I am murder'd! This was all I could understand, for she had got a great faultring in her Speech by the Hurt she had receiv'd. The Prisoner coming into the Room I held her up and begg'd her to kiss him; she kiss'd me, but she slid her Head away from him - Three Weeks before this I saw her at the Shop, and the Prisoner was there too. I ask'd her how she did. Do? says she, bad enough - See how this Rogue kills me and cuts me to Pieces - See how he has cut my Gown - and see what a Condition my Arms are in. And indeed her Arms were black and blue. So I spent 6 Pence to make them Friends again, by the same Token that I scor'd it up, and have not paid it yet -</p>

            . On Monday, April 29. as I was standing at Mr. Banks's Door, which faces the Prisoner's Shop, I heard a great Noise, and looking, I saw the Prisoner beating his Wife; there was no Soul but they two in the Shop; with his Fist clenched thus - he gave her a violent Blow on the Breast. She cry'd, Murder! And then he gave her another Blow on the Chest, which knock'd her down. The Mob gathering, I went over to my own Door, which is next to the Prisoner's. He came out and asked them what they wanted? Then he went in, and shut the Door. By and by he came out again, and went over to the Alehouse (Mr. Cary's) and call'd for a Pint of Beer - On Tuesday she was very ill. On Wednesday she was carried to his Mother's, at a Farrier's Shop in Eagle-street, and on Saturday she dy'd - I have often seen him beat her before this, and seen her Arms as black as this Coat, and she has frequently said he was a Murdering Thieving Dog, and that she dy'd by Inches. In particular, six Weeks before the last Quarrel, I got up between 3 and 4 in the Morning, to burn Cork (for I keep a Cork-Shop;) I went to light a Candle, and found the Deceas'd drest vastly clean, and leaning on the Counter. I was surpriz'd to see her drest so soon. She wink'd upon me, and said she had been at a Labour. I laught, and told her, when I went to a Labour, I never return'd so soon. She wink'd again, and ask'd me to give her Hansel. So I laid out a Penny with her, and went to burn my Cork; which I did by the dead Wall. She came to me there, and said, What do ye think? My Rogue has laid a Pen-knife behind the Counter where we lye, and swore he would cut my Throat, if I did not get up directly. He beats and pinches me so, that I dye by Inches.</p>

We open'd the Thorax; the Breast-bone, and Pectoral Muscles on each Side were much bruised, but nothing was amiss in the Heart. Then we open'd the Abdomen, and found a large Adhesion of the Lungs to the Pleura. The Liver was much swell'd, and the Largeness of it had thrust up the Disphragma, so that the Lungs had not room to play.</p>

            , Surgeon. On Thursday Night I was sent for to Mr. Evans, the Deceas'd's Master, but when I came, the Deceas'd was gone to my House. I went home, and drest him. He was wounded in the left side of the lower Belly. A Piece of his Cawl hung out: It was cut, and I cut it off. I did not probe the Wound, for it went quite through; I drest him again, next Morning, but he dy'd between 9 and 10 at Night. I open'd him on Saturday, the Knife had divided the Epigastrick Artery, and the great Gut, and the Wound was the Cause of his Death.</p>

            , Constable. The Mob carried the Prisoner to St. Martin's Watch-house, and put him in the Hole below. When I came there, I heard him a swearing at a prodigious rate; he curst the House where he had been drinking, and sometimes lamented, and cry'd O Lord! O Lord! I went down to him (for I was above before.) He said he had kill'd a Man, and was sorry for it; but Damn it, he was drunk, and the Liquor had done it, and he would dye with all the pleasure in Life. He shew'd me a Wound in his Head, and said it was done when he was knock'd down, and he wish'd he had been kill'd quite.</p>

He continued on board 3 Months after, but plaid no more such Tricks - The Day of the Murder, I met him about 5 in the Evening, at the Steelyard, without his Hat. He said he had been to get an Enterprize of uncustom'd Goods (for he belongs to the Custom-house) and that he had hir'd a File of Soldiers, for a Shilling a Piece, to assist him - Then he spit in my Face, and went away, but he did not seem to be drunk.</p>

I told him it was too late, and we had better go to morrow; but he would needs have me go that Night, and so at last I went. When we came to Tower-hill, he could not find the House. Then he said it was in Bishop's-gate-street. We went to Aldgate, and he said it was somewhere there-abouts. He look'd at several Houses, but could not find the right. Thence he carried me into Fenchurch-street, where he said he was sure the House was not far off; but still was <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300015"/> at a Loss; and so, to humour him, I went from one Place to another, 'till I was out of Patience, and so I brought him back to Tower-Hill, where I left him.</p>

            . The Prisoner, when he was upon Custom-house Duty, lodg'd 2 or 3 Nights a Week at my House, the Cock at Iron-Gate. About 10 at Night he came home, and said, he had been with Mr. Clay. He seem'd much disturb'd; he drank 2 Pints of Beer, and I bid him go to Bed and sleep. He said the Devil would not let him; but at last I got him up Stairs. Then he cry'd, Fire! Murder! and swore and tore at a strange Rate. By degrees he grew quiet, and I heard no more of him, 'till 3 in the Morning, when he came down, and my Maid let him out. He return'd about 9 the same Thursday Morning, put up his Oars, and seem'd very sober, 'till he call'd a poor Man in to give him some drink, but threw it all in his Face. He ask'd me to lend him a Guinea; I refus'd it. Then he said he was going to buy three Great-coats, and a Dozen of Fowls, which he would send home, and desir'd me to pay for them. To humour him I said, Yes. He went out and came in again. I was then mincing some Meat. He catch'd up the Knife, held me by the Head, and swore, Damn you for a Bitch, you would not lend me a Guinea, and now I'll cut your Throat. My Daughter, and Maid crying out, he turn'd round and threw the Meat and Pans in the Ashes; then he push'd the Knife against my Belly, but it being blunt, and my Coats thick, it did not hurt me. Then he went up Stairs, and made a great Uproar. I ask'd him what he was doing? He damn'd me for a Bitch, and said he was breaking the House. He threw Bricks out of the Window, came down with his Cloaths unbraced, ask'd me where his Knife was, spirted some Beer in my Face, and so ran out.</p>
               <p>E. Smith, Wade's Maid. He call'd all Night upon the Devil, and, in the Morning, threw some Flowers, that stood in a Pot, about the House, went out and threw. Mud in Peoples Faces. He met a Soldier, ask'd him if he was a Man, anp then threw Dirt in his Face. The Soldier drawing his Sword, he ran away, and said, Will you kill a Madman? He threw a Girl's Walnuts, and a Woman's Greens about the Street. Then he ask'd me for some Soap, to wash himself. He rubb'd his Hands and Face with it, and then smear'd them all over with Soot, and so ran out, and blacked an old Man's Face. We went up into his Room, and there he had broke all the Windows to get out, I suppose, and break his Neck, tho' he could not because of the iron Bars; but he had thrown his Shoes into the next Yard - The last time he went from our House, was between 5 and 6 on Thursday Evening, and the Deceas'd was kill'd that Night.</p>
               <p>Sam. Davis. I was his Partner in the Boat; we went out about 4 in the Morning, and he was pretty quiet 'till about 8, and then he swore he'd go to a Justice, and swear Treason against his Wife, for damn her, a Bitch, she lov'd the Pretender. He drank nothing while he was with me.</p>

            , came to lodge there but a little before Lady-Day, and then we observ'd the Prisoner look'd big, and at Easter, she look'd very lank. We suspected she had been deliver'd, tho' she appear'd publickly every Day, and we had never heard her cry out; but then we could not think what was become of the Child. In short, we thought the Family was all alike, or things could not be kept so private. We watch'd and harke'd all as ever we could. One while we fancy'd the Child might be at Nurse in the Garret, because they were often whipping up and down Stairs; but when we could find nothing, we concluded it was baked in the Oven. At last Mrs. Goldsmith, going in o the Cellar, came up, and told me and her Husband, she had seen a Wig-box below, and smelt something. He went down, and came up again, like a dead Man, and said, he put his Hand in the Box, and felt a Child, but was so surpriz'd, that he did not take it out. We consulted what to do, and, says I, as they have kept this Thing in hugger-mugger, we wont let 'em know the Child is found, before we send for a Constable; so Mr. Goldsmith fetch'd a Constable and Watch, and they brought the Child up, and it was all mouldy. The Prisoner, at first, deny'd she had had a Child; but in a little time own'd it was her's.</p>

In turning about, I took my Hand off, and saw the Prisoner in a black silk Cloak, close at my Right-side. I ask'd her, why she crouded me so? She look'd full in my Face, and at the same time I perceived her Hand on my Watch; but presently she took her Hand off, and the Dial-plate of my Watch being outwards, I did mistrust I had lost the Case, but I gave her a Push, and said, You Toad! What Business has your Hand on my Watch? My Hand? Says she; and went off in a Hurry down the Steps. In pushing her my Watch turn'd, and I saw the Key-hole on the Backside. I cry'd out, Stop Thief! she has stole my Watch-Case. So I follow'd and took her. I steal your Watch-Case? Says she. I received the Sacrament this Morning. That's nothing to me, says I. The Beadle search'd her slightly, but could not find the Case.</p>

He took something from him, and then came to me, and said, Damn you, now let's see what you have got? and robb'd me of 10 d. When they had robb'd us they went towards the Half-way-House. We stood pausing a little, and I was for going back, but one of 'em call'd to us, and said, Damn you, go forward. So we cross'd the Fields to Pancras, and went home to Red-Lion-Street. Next Day I went to Mrs. Moreland, at the Half-way-House, and told her we had been robb'd, and described the Men to her. While I was there the Prisoners and 2 Women came in. Lord, says I, those are the Men. You frighten me, says she, don't speak so loud, for if they should hear us, we may be kill'd. I know one of them, his Name is Cummins, and often frequents the Mag-Pye and Horse-Shoe in Drury-Lane. The Prisoners went away about 3, and I came home between 4 and 5. I told my Husband and my Landlord Falkner, that I had seen the Prisoners. We went next Morning to Mrs. Morland's, to get farther Information, and she gave us Directions in Writing to find Cummins. I went the same Evening to the Mag-Pye and Horse-Shoe, and finding York was there, I sent for my Husband, and Mr. Falkner, and they got a Constable who took him to his House, (the Rose in Wild-Street) and there Cummins came in to see what was the Matter, and so he was taken too.</p>

             to fetch a Bed from Moor-fields, and going to meet him, I found him by the Dog-house with the Bed on the Ground, and the Prisoner lying upon it, who said, he would see whither the Bed went. I took it on my Back, and he follow'd us. We had not gone far before he took up a Saddle. The Lad in the Ditch catch'd at it, but the Prisoner brought it away, and soon after threw it into a Ditch. The Lad follow'd us and ask'd for the Saddle. Then, says the Prisoner, It's time for me to leave you, and so he went away, and we were taken up on this Account and sent to New-Prison, where we lay all Night. The Prisoner had said his Name was Barnet, and he appearing to be a Butcher by his Clothes, we enquir'd for him, and found he <rs id="t17340630-29-deflabel143" type="occupation">kept a Chandler's shop</rs>

I pitch'd it on a Post to rest my self, and it fell upon the Ground, and he got upon it - My Brother came presently after, and a Cooper passing by at the same time, the Prisoner cry'd Hoa! Every Body knows me, my Name is Barnet. Then my Brother took up the Bed, and the Prisoner follow'd us about 6 Yards, where I saw a Man in a <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173406300020"/> Ditch, and the Prisoner took up a Saddle, laid it across his Shoulder, and said, We'll have this Saddle. He carry'd it 40 or 50 Yards and threw it into into a Ditch, and soon after the Lad came up and said, where's my Saddle. We told him the Prisoner had thrown it into a Ditch. Then, says the Prisoner, It will be my best way to turn back again, and so he went away; the Lad follow'd us home, and to satisfy him we went back again with him, to look for the Saddle, but could not find it:</p>

The Prisoner, and another Woman came in, and he desir'd they might have a Glass of what they would drink; which I gave them. He took out 7 Guineas and laid them on the Counter. I ask'd him why he pull'd out his Money in a publick Shop, and bid him put it up again. The Prisoner took it up, and counted it over, and I bid him take care of it. And she said she would call a Coach, and see him home; but he would have no Coach, and desir'd her not to be in a hurry. Other Customers coming in, I turn'd my back to draw some Liquor, and the Prisoner went away. The Squire staid a Quarter of an Hour after, and said his Money was gone.</p>

He said that was not all, but she swore and curs'd that she had but 7, and then she swept it all up, and left him, and 2 Soldiers went with her.
