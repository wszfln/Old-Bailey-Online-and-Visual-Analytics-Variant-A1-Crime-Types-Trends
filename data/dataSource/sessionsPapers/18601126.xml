On 14th November, I saw the prisoner about five minutes before 5 o'clock in Lower Thames-street, near the west end of the Custom House—he was walking towards Tower-hill, and watched him—he was putting down a chest of tea that he was carrying on to a hawker's barrow—I heard him tell the man with the barrow to drive it to Brick-lane—I said, "Hold hard—what have you got there?"—he said "A chest of tea, I suppose"—I said, "Where did you get it from"—he said, "From Mr. Cook or Mr. Cox, I don't know which;"—I asked him if he had an invoice—he said, "I know nothing about an invoice, Mr. Foster gave it me to carry to Brick-lane;" I asked him who Mr. Foster was, he said he was standing in Thames-street, at the corner of Bell Yard—I took him back to see if Mr. Foster was there, and he was not—here is a direction on the chest—it is directed to Wakefield—I took it and the prisoner to the station—as we were going along a man came up, and said there was a horse and cart lost and two chests of tea—I said I had got one of them.</p>

I went back to see for the man but could not find him, and the officer took me to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When he took me, he asked the lady whether I was the man? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not—she said "That is the man."</p>

The policeman was coming down the road, and he collared me and said he saw me get over the railings. I never was in the place, and know nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carriage-trimming manufacturer, at No. 40, Drury-lane—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in the middle of June, I think—he, at that time or shortly afterwards, entered my employ<lb/>ment as town traveller, with a salary and commission—shortly after that it happened that I was short of money—I had a quantity of velvet in my possession—I had some conversation with the prisoner on the subject—he said that through some friends of his he could raise money for me on the velvets—I afterwards, by his instructions, sent the goods to Messrs. Werner and Falck, on 6th July, at Bury-court, St. Mary-Axe—the prisoner after<lb/>wards, on the same day, handed me 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it came from Werner and Falck's as an advance upon the velvets—I said that it was a very small sum for the amount of the velvets, aud asked him if he could not obtain more—he said he would try, and on the next day he returned and said that Werner and Falck would not give more—I think he remained in my service about a fortnight after the 6th—he had told me that the period of loan was for one month—ou 6th August following, I received a letter from him about the redemption of these goods—I saw him in the City and gave him a</p>

               <p>cheque for 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being the amount of principal and interest—it might have been the day following the advance of the money that I learnt the interest was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it was not at the time the money was advanced—the only conversation was that the rate would not be a very heavy one; perhaps 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for three months, and to my surprise I found it was a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for one month—I gave him directions to take the cheque to the Union Bank, Temple-bar Branch, get it cashed, and to pay over the proceeds to Messrs. Werner and Falck—I gave him directions to leave the velvets at Messrs. Werner and Falck's to my orders—I saw him subsequently on the day I gave him the cheque, about 4 o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, and he stated that he had been to Werner and Falck's and neither of the partners were in, and that he had left the money with the clerk—I did not direct or authorize the prisoner to sell these velvets after giving him the cheque; I had done so previously—that cheque has been returned to me by my bankers as paid—the officer has it—the prisoner was not in my employ when I gave him instructions to sell; it was afterwards—the value of the velvets is 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid that for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you really mean that you did not give him instructions to sell after you gave him the cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I decidedly did not know that he was negotiating a sale after I gave him the cheque—I did not know that Mr. Cawley had given bills for them—I have been frequently to Mr. Michael's, but not about the velvets or the bills; I went merely because I did not know what had become of Mr. Muckleston—Mr. Michael said something to me about the bills—I did not see them, or what was written on them, or whether they were bills; he showed me some pieces of paper which he stated had been given to him, and which he stated to be bills, But I did not look at them—he offered to discount them if I would put my name to them—I did not ask him what arrangements he had made about the velvets—I do not think anything was said about them—I do not know why those papers, which were called bills, were produced; I did not know of their being in existence—Mr. Michael said that the bills were left with him by the prisoner for the velvets—that was about all that was said about the velvets—he asked me to endorse them, and I declined to have anything to do with them—I went there about 12th or 14th August—the cheque was given on the 6th—the prisoner, I believe, wrote several letters to me before I went there—I did not go there in consequence of any letter; I cannot explain why I went, but I was searching after Mr. Muckleston at the time—the prisoner said one day that he had been to Tottenham to Mr. Michael, and asked him to discount some bills he had—this was before I went to Mr. Michael—I do not think he said that those bills were for the velvets, but he said that they were bills of Cawley's; they were some which I expect were obtained by frand—I had nothing to do with the bills or the discount—I do not know whether I should or should not have refused to receive the money if I had not been asked to endorse them—I said that I would not recognise any bills in any shape or form; all that I wanted was an order for my velvets, and that is what I told the prisoner—I first knew on Friday the 10th, that the proceeds of the cheque had not been paid, and after searching for the prisoner for a long while, I saw him come out at Mr. Michael's door, and spoke to him about the money—he told me he had been into Michael's at that minute to get him to discount Cawley's bill—it was two or three days after that, that he told me he had been to Tottenham, and after that I went to Michael's on the 12th or Hth—I did not know at the time, that the prisoner gave a bill for the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards I did—that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260020"/>
               <p>was before I gave the cheque; it was on 6th July that he gave the bill—I told the prisoner to pledge the velvets in his own name; that was for a trade reason, it was that people might not know that I was pledging—I did not wish the velvets to be brought back, that my clerks might not know that they had been pledged; they went into the books as bo much cash from Werner and Falck on account—I knew something about Cawley before I gave the cheque—the only thing I know is, that he made sales to Cawley while he was in my employ, and I understood that Cawley's character was not such as I could trust, and I did not wish to do any more business with him—I never knew of the bills being grven for these very velvets till the 10th—I cannot say whether I knew before the 10th that the prisoner was negotiating a transaction with Cawley—he wrote me some letters, saying that he could do something with the velvets; those letters are here—I did not know on the 6th that he had offered the velvets to Cawley—he said before the cheque was given that he could sell these velvets to Cawley, and I declined the transaction—he was authorized to sell up to the time I gave him the cheque, either for cash or for bills approved by me, but not Cawley's bills—I went to Cannon-street to Mr. Burke, to inquire about Cawley's reference—that was when the prisoner was in my employ, and about three weeks before I gave him the cheque; he then said that Mr. Cawley was proposing to buy the velvets—I consulted my solicitor a few days afterwards—I cannot tell you when the warrant was taken out, but it was a short time afterwards—I swear I did not say to Mr. Michael that I would not endorse the bills; and that if I did not get my money, I would have it in another way, that I would have the money or lock the defendant up; nothing of the kind; nor that I would shut his mouth, and the money would soon be brought forward, as Muckleston had some warrant for grain and some seed—I said that I had seen the person who sold some seed to him, but I did not say that I would lock him up, or have my money; nothing of the kind—I may have called there again afterwards going by—I do not think I called there between the time when the papers were shown to me, and the issuing of the warrant—I went with Newton once or twice either after or before the goods were shown to me, I cannot say which—I have no doubt I went there both after and before—I looked at some goods with Newton which Michael showed me, and Michael did not ask me to take those goods as part of the bills, but against the velvets—I certainly looked at the goods, but for no earthly purpose: there had been no end of propositions made by Michael, and I might have just touched the goods in a cursory manner, but as to looking at them I did not—I did not say, "When he is ouce taken, the money with all my expenses will be paid;" nor did I offer a reward of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said nothing about taking him, but perhaps I had the warrant out at that time—I might have said that I intended taking out a warrant, but nothing about locking him up; or about locking him up, and the money would soon be forthcoming—not on either occasion—the warrant was put into the hands of Haydon, the city detective, who I afterwards met on 28th August, and told him not to execute it at present—Michael was there—Poole was not there at that time—I found Michael and Haydon together at some place where I was referred to from the detective-office, and not by appointment at all—my reason for telling Haydon not to execute the warrant, was, in the first place, because we could not find the party—we had been looking after him for three weeks, and there was a certain matter entered into at the time, in which I was regularly done, and which I was foolish enough to sign—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—one name</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260021"/>
               <p>in it is, and also the u Dear Sir"—I have seen Mr. Poole on no end of occasions—he told me on one occasion, to tell Michael to come down—I called on Mr. Poole, who said, "Michael has heen hero"—I called as a friend, but for no specific purpose—I have known him for years—this was a week or ten days afterwards—I called on Michael to say that Mr. Poole wanted him—I might have had an idea what Mr. Poole wanted him for, but Mr. Poole did not tell me—I did not know perfectly well that Poole was to settle the matters between me and the prisoner, and that Michael and I were to see him on the other side—there was not a word about settling, but Michael was constantly upon Poole, to try to settle it—that I have heard since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was it you told Haydon not to execute the warrant at present? was not it because you had put the matters into Poole's hands? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a referee; I said to Haydon that it might be referred to Mr. Poole to know whether I had a civil or a criminal case, or it was said in his presence; Haydon and Michael were by—that was after the warrant had been out for nearly a month—I believe Haydon went out of town—I did not tell Haydon on that same day, the 28th, to have the name written off the police books—I told him to suspend the warrant, that was all—I have no recollection of his saying, "In order to do that, I shall be obliged to have the name written off at the station"—he did not execute the warrant—he did not Bay that it was handed over to Moes by mistake when he went out of town—he said that he had sent Moss in to apprehend him, while to remained outside—Poole is a private gentleman; he has an office in London—he does not live at Southend, but his wife was very ill, and he was staying there, and she subsequently died—I do not know that that was the reason that he could not go into the reference—I know nothing about it—I called almost daily upon Michael—the cheque was payable to the defendant—I understand that the acceptance that he gave was in his own name—I have not seen it—I have heard since that it was for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not write a letter to him about Cawley's bills—I never wrote a letter—I did not write a letter asking for Cawley's bills; decidedly not—I never saw the bills, and do not know whether there was first a large one for 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was afterwards broken up into four small ones—I know nothing of any bills of Cawley's—if I have said, "Not for these last bills," it must have been a slip of the tongue—I never wrote to him to ask him for the one large bill—at letter has been destroyed by my request, or in my presence.</p>

I am a merchant, carrying on business at 3, Bury-court, St. Mary-axe—I have known the prisoner four or five months before this matter was inquired iuto—in July last he applied to me for an advance on some goods—I made the advance on 6th July—I gave him a cheque for 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon certain velvet goods, and he gave me a promissory note and a memorandum of deposit in his own name—in the course of business that loan would have been repayable on 9th August, the bill was due on 6th August—I cannot say whether I saw him upon that day, I think it was afterwards—the bill was presented when due and not paid, and the prisoner came and asked for a renewal; the bill produced was for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I granted it, and the velvets remained in my hands—he afterwards called again and said, if any one said anything about the velvets, I was not to say anything about his business to anybody—I retained the second bill of 9th August that was not honoured, and since that I have had the amount of my advance and interest paid to me by Mr. Onion, and the goods taken away—the difference between the 95<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the interest.</p>

On 19th September, I went to the privy at the back of the house; it is about six or seven yards from the house—you go along the garden to it—there is a man's shed behind it, another water-closet, but they do not touch each other—there are open fields beyond that, back and front—there is a wooden fencing—persons can get to that field at the back from the high road, and a person could get from the field into the garden, so as to go to the privy, without any difficulty—it was between 10 and 11 in the morning when I went to the privy—I saw there the body of a male child; it was lying with its legs upwards, and opposite the door as I went in—it was covered over with mess, all but the legs, I could see them—I had used the privy before, since the prisoner left, but I never noticed anything before—when I saw it, I sent for my husband and a police-constable, and they came and got the child out—it was quite naked and the left arm was off, just before you get to the shoulder—I did not notice any mark on that day—I next saw the child before the jury—the arm was taken off higher up than where the vaccination mark was on the prisoner's child—when I saw the body at the inquest, I noticed a mark on its navel—it was a similar mark to that which was on the prisoner's child—the child looked very much like the prisoner's child—the prisoner said she had named the child William Augustus Bryant—that was the name it was</p>

I am inspector of the N division of police—from information that was communicated to me on 19th September last I went to the cottage where the Mead's live, and there saw the body of a child—on the evening of the same day I went to Mr. Drake's house, 13, Lansdown-road, Notting-hill—on going there I saw the prisoner—she opened the kitchen door for me—I asked her if Mr. Drake lived there—she said, "No"—I said, "Who does?" and she said, "Mr. Warren"—I asked if Mr. Warren was at home—she said, "No"—I said, "Is Mr. Warren at home?"—she said, "No"—I asked if there were any other servants in the house besides herself—she said, "No"—I asked her if she knew where Mr. Warren was gone—she said he was gone to a supper party—I then said, "What is your name?" and she said, "Ann"—I said, "Ann what?" she said, "Ann Bryant"—I said, "I think I have seen you before; I think I have seen you at Hackney"—she said, "You may have"—I said, "Your name is Emma Padfield"—she said it was—she went by the name of Emma Padfield at Lea-bridge, and I was instructed to take Emma Padfield iu custody—I said, "Your master is at home, and I must see him"—she took me into the house, and she said, "If you want master you must ring the bell"—I put my hand up to the pull—she said, "You don't want me any more"—I said, "Oh yes, you must go up stairs with me; I want to see your master, you must take me to your master"—we went up stairs—the master came out, and said to the prisoner, "Who is this man? who is this man?"—I had a plain over<lb/>coat on at the time, and I unbuttoned my coat, and said, "Sir, I will show you who I am; I am an inspector of the Metropolitan police, and I come to take your servant into custody"—I said, "If you will oblige me by going into a room I will tell you what I want to take her for"—I went into a parlour with the master and mistress and the prisoner—I then told the prisoner that I was come to apprehend her on a charge of murder, for killing her child at Lea-bridge—I also said, "In the presence of your master and mistress I caution you, I don't wish you to make any statement to me, or answer any questions I may put to you; if you do it will be taken down and use; if against you at your trial, if you are sent for trial"—she then said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You were delivere of a child in June last at Lea-bridge"—she said, "Yes, I was"—I said, "What has become of that child?"—she said, "The friends of the young man, the father of the child, have taken it away to keep it"—she did not mention any names—I said the body of a child had been found in a water-closet at Lea-bridge, and it was supposed to be the body of her child—she said, "I have been in great distress; I have even wanted bread, but indeed I did not do it myself"—I went into the kitchen with her to collect her things together, previous to bringing her away, and she said, "If you take me away I will let it all out, for the father of the child has behaved very cruel to me"—I then brought I her in a cab to Hackney police-station, and charged her with the murder—I asked her on the road to the station the name of her child, and she said, the name of her child was Augustus—I asked her what her name was, and she said, "Ann Padfield"—this frock was given to me by Mr. Mead, the second day after the prisoner was in custody—these other things I found in her box—I have retained them in my possession ever since—the frock I let Dr. Gay have, but I put a mark on it at the time, and know it to be the same—I also produce a basket—I received that from Mr. Drake's residence, Lansdown-place, Notting-hill—there was nothing in it when I found it.</p>

               <p>of a male child, at the Homerton workhouse—the body was considerably bloated and discoloured—it was apparently the body of a fine, well developed child—I could not exactly tell its age, but from the circumstances attending my examination, I could do so nearly—the head was very much bloated, and the body also, but not so much so as the head—it was of a livid colour, but in parts it had been stained by the soil of the privy—the livid colour arose from the stains of the soil to a great extent, it was not from decom-position or putrefaction—the eyes were considerably protruded, not sunk in as is usually the case with dead persons—the ears and the nose were compressed, as were also the lips—the nose appeared to have been violently compressed—the tongue was swollen and livid—the tissues of the mouth were far gone in decomposition, and eaten by maggots—the gums had separated readily from the jaw—the left arm had been removed within about an inch of the shoulder joint—the wound of the integuments was jagged, it appeared to have been cut by a moderately sharp instrument—the surface of the stump was considerably decomposed, and also maggot-eaten—it was a conical wound slanting from the skiu to the bone—the bone had, been apparently broken across about an inch below the head of the bone, and was splintered against the chest—the large artery was but very slightly contracted at the orifice, and contained no blood—there were three cuts through the skin, within a very short distance of the edge; one towards the chest on the inner side, and two on the opposite side—those cuts were parallel with the edge of the flaps of skin in each—the amputation was by a circular incision, and in a line with that incision were these cuts, parallel to the edge of the skin—I did not see the arm, it being lost, but the edges of the skin remained—each of them were five-eighths of an inch in length, and they gaped but very slightly—the left side of the chest contained a quantity of bloody fluid—both lungs were extremely solid and shrunken, and of a deep livid colour—the right lung sunk very readily into water, and, as far as I could judge, was entirely free from air—a portion of the left lung sunk half way, it was about the same specific gravity; it sunk slightly, but did not fall to the bottom of the vessel—on examining the ribs, I found that the second rib was cut through at the angle, which was against the I wound made in the amputation of the arm on the left side—the heart was I rather flabby, that might have been from the post mortem changes, and with the vessels, was empty of blood, but the tissues were blood-stained—I then proceeded to examine the abdomen—the mucous membrane of the stomach was of a deep livid colour throughout, and the stomach itself contained a little mucus—in the upper intestines there was a little food and I think some milk; and in the lower intestines, focal matter, the usual contents—the liver was very much congested, and of a deep purple colour—it was also shrunk, as well as the lungs—I examined the brain—the scalp had separated from the skull in consequence of decomposition—on cutting through the scalp at the back of the head, I found a little extravasated blood—the bones of the skull had separated from each other from decomposition, and the two parietal bones over-lapped each other very considerably—the brain was reduced to a pulp—my attention was called to the skin, by the coroner, and I took a portion of the skin of the abdomen, and put it in some river water—I found that that took out the livid marks, and left behind a mark on the right side of the navel—that mark was of a conical shape, the point of the cone being about an inch to the right of the navel, and from thence it took its course downwards and rather outwards, slantingly—it was about three-fourths of an inch broad at its broadest part, and about an inch and three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260045"/>
               <p>quarters long—I subsequently examined the jaws—they contained five milk teeth, and the rudiments of the permanent molar teeth—the milk teeth had not been cut—they were within the jaw—the mark on the abdomen was a dis<lb/>coloration of the skin—I believe it to be a congenital mark—that is some<lb/>times developed after birth, generally within a few days after, but that is very uncertain—it was a peculiar mark—it was a simple discoloration, not a number of blood vessels as is sometimes seen—there was nutriment in the stomach—some of the conditions of the body, I think, might have been due to post mortem changes, such as the state of the skull, the alight extravasa<lb/>tion of blood at the back of the head, and the colour of the stomach, but I do not think the state of the lungs could have been the result of post mortem change—my impression was, that the child died from asphyxia, suffocation, whether caused by compression or by drowning, I could not undertake to say—the compression of the nose and lips might possibly have I been caused by the body having been, at some time after death, in contact with some unyielding substance—I did not find any trace of disease in the heart, lungs, or any other part of the body that would account for death—it is very difficult to say whether the arm was removed before or after death, I can only state my impression—my impression is, that the arm was removed immediately after death—I think so, first, because there was nottho retractation of the skin that you would meet with had the amputation been made during life; and secondly, there was no evidence or appearance of clot<lb/>ted blood in the neighbourhood of the wound; that, however, might have been removed by the fluid in which the body had evidently been lying for some time; thirdly, from the fact that the wound was through the integuments and it did not gape, it had not retracted, as is usual, if made in a living subject; then the blood vessels being empty, would rather be a reason for thinking that it was immediately after death, still I would not give any force to that, for, as I say, the blood might have been washed away, or removed by post mortem change or decomposition—the vessels being empty would make me think it was done immediately after death, but I would not give any great weight to that opinion—there might have been blood in the vessels, and it might have been removed by decomposition after death—I have described everything that I saw—this frock was shown to me, I think three days after the inquest—I found no marks on it—I submitted it to maceration in distilled water, and I discovered some few blood globules in the water after maceration—I am able to say they were globules of blood, but whether of human blood or not I could not say—I showed the portion of the skin of the abdomen, with the mark on it, before the magistrate, also to the coroner, and some of the witnesses—I did not examine for poison, but as far as my examination went, I found no reason to apprehend that the child had been poisoned.</p>

                  </hi>: I am one of the senior clerks in the post-office—the prisoner was sorter at the South Western District office, Pimlico—in consequence of something which occurred, I made up, on 7th November, what is called a test letter—I enclosed in it two half-sovereigns, having previously marked them, and fastened them in a piece of adhesive gum paper, to keep them from tumbling about—I put them into an envelope addressed, "J. Longfellow, Esq., solicitor, Merrion-square, Dublin," and fastened it in the ordinary way with the adhesive gum on the envelope—I gave it to Willis Clare, One of the inspectors of letter carriers, with instructions; and if posted according to my instructions, it would, in the regular course, come to the office where the prisoner was employed, and thence to the General Post Office—it would be posted at Battersea, and would be taken in a bag—I Opened the bag on its arrival at the chief office, and it did not contain the letter addressed to Mr. Longfellow—I then'Vent to Pimlico, and followed the officer Smee into the Phœnix public-house, close to the South Western office (this was shortly after 7 o'clock), where Frances Mitchlemore, the landlady's niece, produced five half-sovereigns to me, among which I found one of the two that I had enclosed in the letter—it had my mark upon it—I then went to the South Western office, and through the sorting office to the adjoining room—the prisoner was not there, and I directed Newman to fetch him—he did so, and I said to the prisoner, "Did you assist with the general sorting at 3.50 to-day?"—he said, "Yes"—(the general post sorting is sorting for the provincial towns)—I told him that a money letter addressed "J. Longfellow, Esq., Dublin," was missing, and asked if he knew anything</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260047"/>
               <p>about it—he said that he did not—I directed Smee to search him, and saw Smee take from him a purse containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some coppers—he told me that he had saved that from his wages last Saturday—I asked him if he changed a half-sovereign at the public-house round the corner to<lb/>day—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he got it from—he said that he had received it for his wages on Saturday—I think this was Wednesday; I am not certain—I told him that I was in possession of a half-sovereign which I had obtained at the public-house, and which had been enclosed in the letter addressed to Mr. Longfellow, and that the letter had been seen in his posses<lb/>sion at about 4 o'clock—he said that he knew nothing of the letter or the half-sovereign—I sent Upfold, an officer, to search his lodgings, while I remained with the prisoner—Flicker showed me three half-sovereigns at about twenty minutes past 8, among which I saw the other one with my mark upon it—the prisoner was then given into custody—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two half-sovereigns.</p>

               <p>District office—on 7th November I opened the letter-bag which I received from the Battersea-bridge office—I had previously communicated with Mr. Gardner to know what he was doing—when the letter-bag arrived, I found a letter addressed, "J. Longfellow, Esq., Dublin"—it was still fastened—I felt it, and it appeared to contain coin—the prisoner was employed in sorting letters, and I placed that letter before him with others to sort—I saw him take it to the scale and weigh it—he brought it back to the sorting table, and I afterwards saw him sort it up for the Irish division—it was the first letter in the Irish division—shortly after that the prisoner left the table, and went into the register room; he took something with him, and he also took some registered letters from the opening table, where the bags are opened—when he was gone I went to the sorting table to ascertain whether the letter was there; it was not there—that was about two minutes after I had seen it standing in the Irish division—I went directly—I examined the letters in the Irish division to see whether it had got mixed up with them, and am sure it was not there—I then tied them up, and sent them off with others—I afterwards made a communication to Mr. Gardner—the prisoner remained in the office till after 7 o'clock—I missed him shortly after 7—he was atten<lb/>ding to his duty in the meantime, but he went down stairs once, about 5 o'clock—down stairs goes to the water-closet—he remained below about five minutes—when I missed him at a little past 7, I went to the Phœnix public-house, and saw him there, having something to drink—I then returned to the dis<lb/>trict office, and he shortly afterwards came in—Mr. Gardner then came in, and Smee, the constable—Mr. Gardner then directed me to fetch the prisoner, but, instead of fetching him, I called out to him, and he said, "All right"—he was then in the road room, where the letters are sorted for the suburbs of London—it is an ante-room adjoining the sorting room—he came out of the road room and I told him that he was wanted—he went up to the letter car<lb/>riers' office up stairs, and as he was going up I called him, he said, "All right," but continued going up stairs—Smee and Gardner were in the adjoining room—I followed the prisoner up stairs, and found him in the act of getting a registered letter signed for—he was standing close by the seat of Henry Rice, a letter carrier—he came down stall's, and I followed him down and took him to Mr. Gardner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you call the prisoner in to sort the letters at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beckoned him in—that was about 4 o'clock—this was not his regular work, but it was work which he was accustomed to do—there were a great many sorters in the office—he took the letter to weigh it—I do not know whether several people saw him weigh it—the weighing machine is in the sight of all the others—the stamper was standing near the weighing machine, I and there was a sorter opening at the table—I missed the letter in two minutest—during those two minutes I was watching him as far as I possibly could—my duty is to superintend the sorting—I was watching all the sorters; not Hume in particular—I had no object in that—I did not see him take the letter up after he had put it in the Irish division, and yet I was watching him—I examined the letters for the Irish post only—the prisoner remained from 4 to 5 o'clock without going out—I do not think he even left the place—he might have gone down stairs if he had chosen—the Phœnix public-house is used by all the sorters—I had been there during the afternoon, and it may be more than once—I do not know that I changed any money there; I may have, but if I did, I know it was not a half-sovereign, I because I had not one in my possession—I remember saying to somebody, I laying my hand on ray stomach, "I shall spend a fortune in gin to-day," and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260049"/>
               <p>most likely it was to the prisoner—when I got up stairs he was having a registered letter signed for—that was in conformity with his duty—I am not aware of a registered letter arriving open, containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I recollect some remittance coming loose, but I do not think it was that day—I do not know that the prisoner received a letter open, containing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and that he handed it to the authorities at once—I remember a remittance from a post-office receiver, containing bank notes, coming open, and Hume showing it to me, but whether it was that day or not, I cannot say—he might have pretended that easily—he has borne a good character during the four years he has been at the post-office.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a master bill poster, and reside at 1, Burleigh-street, Strand—the prisoner was employed by me for the purpose of posting bills—Messrs. Waterlow, of London-wall, employ me to post bills for them—on 30th September, I received from them, for the purpose of being posted, a large quantity of bills, some of which were like these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner was my servant, and I handed him some of those which I had received from Waterlow's, with instructions to post them—two hundred, I should think, was about the number I gave him—if he has posted any district according to his judgment sufficiently, and does not exhaust all the bills, his duty would be to bring the residue back to me—I do not know the date of the month when I gave him those bills—it was on a Sunday;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260054"/>
               <p>the day after I got them from Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what the defendant is by profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he had studied for the church, and then he had studied for the bar—I asked him why he left the bar—he said he did not think that any one but a rogue could succeed in it—I said it was a strange argument—he said he could not reconcile it with his conscience, therefore he would not practice—he then said he had been brought up for a surgeon, but he did not practice; but that he had been to Hythe and obtained a certificate there—that he was then made ensign of the Victoria rifles, but he did not get his captaincy—he said the Duke of Wellington had deceived him, that he had promised him the captaincy and given him an ensigncy—I said that when the first company of the proposed corps was started, in all probability it would increase, and we might get it up to the strength of a regiment, and that no doubt as the strength increased, according to the rules of the War office, he would perhaps get his majority, that he might do so, but it would depend upon the Lord Lieutenant, whether he would accept him—he had not said anything about wishing to be a major before that, but he then said he was very anxious to be a major—the other officers referred to in the agreement, are only staff officers, drill instructors, not commissioned officers—after the agreement was signed, he had some communication with the Lord Lieutenant—he told me so—he said the Lord Lieutenant refused to make him a major—I said I was astounded that he could make such an application, knowing, as he well did, and as I did, that unless there were four or five companies raised it was impossible he could be made a major, that even Lord Lovelace himself had not power to make him a major—he said "well" the matter rested between him and Lord Lovelace—I said I did not think he ought to trouble Lord Lovelace with such numerous applications, it must throw rather suspicion, upon me—he said I had nothing to do with it then, because the matter depended between him and Lord Lovelace—to the best of my recollection this conversation was a few days after the agreement had been signed—he did not tell me before, of his intention to go to Lord Lovelace—I wrote to the defendant, to the best of my recollection, the day before I received from him the letter upon which he is indicted—it was on or about the 26th—I have served a copy of a notice to produce that letter—I served it personally upon Mr. Booth's clerk yesterday about 1 o'clock—on the following day, the 27th, I received from the prisoner this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "16, Boundary-road, St. John's-wood, 27th July, 1860. Sir; In reply to your note, threatening legal proceedings, I have to inform you that if within twenty-four hours you do not retract that letter, and return me the paper on which you found your claim, obtained from me, such as it is, by surprise and unfairly, I will lay the whole matter before the Lord Lieutenant; for the public benefit and the volunteer movement this very suspicious matter shall be sifted to the bottom—you admitted yesterday that your brother was the Eicke of the late commission sale affair, and now another member of the same family has tried his hand with the volunteer movement; in your excuse to me yesterday for the family connexion, you calumniated Lord Brougham and his brother, and last night, your father, in like manner, asperaed the Earl of Jersey—this intensifies my suspicion of you—I suspect, however, that the letter just received, was written before you saw me last night—I have further to inform you that I have not as yet refused the command of the corps through the Lord Lieutenant, with whom alone I have to do; your</p>

P.S. Remember that you hold, or stated you held, a commission, and it was this that placed me into undue confidence in you—I admit my error, however, in trusting you")—In that letter he charges me with having calumniated Lord Brougham and his brother—there is not the slightest foundation for that—I never calumniated Lord Brougham—some short time after the defendant had signed, the agreement, he said he thought it might be arranged for the men to repay him back the amount of the clothing—I said that was contrary to the terms of the agreement, and it would be unfair to me, and they would not listen to me if I proposed it to the members, because it was an understood thing that they should be assist<lb/>ed with the clothing, and lay by to prepare for fresh clothing as they were worn out, but that they were to start free of debt—he said, "Well, then, the matte'r must rest," he would not go on with it—by the terms of the agreement it was to be done at once—I received these other two letters from the defendant, they are his hand-writing—they reached me by post—the date of the last is 30th July—he has never performed the agreement up to this time—he has called on me since—I am not sure whether it was before or after the 27th—I saw him—he said he wanted his likeness back that he had given me—it was a photograph that he had presented to me—he gave it me to show to the members of the corps—I had got upwards of sixty members promised—I did not exhibit the portrait to any of them—I put it in my sitting room—when he called, he said he wanted his likeness back, and he would have nothing more to do with the matter—I gave it him—he said he had only lent it to me, but he had really given it to me in the first instance as a present, and he said "If you put the wig in a certain position, it was like Our Saviour."</p>

               <p>day that I received the threatening letter, I received another letter in answer to one that I wrote—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>

Your obedient Servant, Andrew Steinmetz. P.S. Clearly, if you have acted honestly in this transaction, you will not resist one moment to accede to this honest proposal, it will prove whether you can bear inspection or not in your present speculation; (my last proposal was merely a test of your respectability,) of the alleged corps—you refuse to propose it to them and why.") I received that letter—I don't know whether it was the same day—I don't recollect whether it was before or after the other—I learnt that Mr. Steinmetz was going abroad—I took proceedings against him, and issued a writ, and made an affidavit that I believed he was going abroad, upon which I had him arrested—my reason for suing him, and having him arrested was a claim of 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon this very agreement, as trustee in the matter—I was the only party who could sue of course, as trustee for the amount; the corps could not sue him—I also sued him for the amount of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to myself, expended by me—the demand made was upon the same agreement as that referred to in the letter—I had him taken in custody on the writ, and he gave bail to appear—I am proceeding with it, it is going on—I do not know how far my solicitor has gone—my father is not my solicitor in this case; I don't know about this case—I do not recollect the date of my taking proceedings to arrest the defendant—to the best of my recollection it was about a month after this letter had been written—he gave bail, and went abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you then go before the Grand Jury without giving him any notice, and without yourself going before a Magistrate, and prefer this bill against him for felony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him notice before he went abroad that I should prosecute him—I went before the Grand Jury—I really do not know whether or not he was then in England—I went to Marylebone police-office—they said they did not quite comprehend the matter, and that I had my remedy by indicting him before the Grand Jury, and I went and indicted him before the Grand Jury—I then got a certificate from this Court, and a warrant from a Magistrate, and arrested him—I believe that was last Wednesday week—I did not receive notice from him that he was coming up to put in bail—I did not appear next morning at the police-court, because they said they would give me notice, which they did not do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the town travellers to Messrs. Ernest—I see stock when it comes in—about twenty minutes past five, on 24th October, the night after the robbery, I called at the shop of Mr. Baldock, in Aylesbury-street—I called there in the usual course of business—I remained in the first instance, and then left the shop and went into the back parlour—I saw the prisoner come in and produce this bottle of attar of roses—it was then in its original case, this tin canister—I was then let out by the back premises, and made a communication to a friend to get a policeman while I walked up and down before the shop—I then went in after waiting for some minutes before the policeman arrived, and the bottle of attar of roses, now produced, was placed in my hands by Mr. Baldock, and I recognised the article, he asked me if was a judge of attar of roses—I said that I did not pretend to be a great judge, but I knew something about the article—he said "I am offered this at a certain price"—he did not name the price—I asked what price he was asked for it—he said he was asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce—that was in the presence of the prisoner—Mr. Baldock remarked that the quantity was too much for him to take, and that he knew I was in a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186011260066"/>
               <p>position to get rid of any quantity of attar of roses at a price—I said, "Yes, I can do any quantity at a price"—I then said, "Who has offered it to you?"—he said, "This is the party"—I turned to the prisoner and said, "Well, have you got any more of this article, because I can't give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for it, but I will buy it at a price; there shall be no mistake with regard to you or me—I do business on cash-payments—the fact is, I will take any quantity of it at a price"—I asked him if he had got any more—he said he had got five or six bottles more—I said, "As a matter of course you have got them with you, and they are equal to the sample you have produced to me"—he said he had not got them with him but could bring them in the course of a minute or two—I, not wishing to lose sight of the prisoner, said it did not matter, I would take a single bottle as sample of a lot—we then went farther into conversation, the question came to be about the weight; I asked him the weight, what he asked for the bottle of attar now produced—he said he should leave that to me; he did not know the weight—I remarked that I was not buyer and seller too, and that it was just probable he might turn up a week or two hence and say I had cheated him in the weight—I then said to Mr. Baldock, "If you will-be kind enough to find your Turkish weights, we will weigh this bottle"—Mr. Baldock searched for the weights for a few minutes and could not find them—we then said we would open the bottle and take the weight of the contents—in the first instance the gross weight of the bottle was taken, that is, the bottle and contents were put into the scales, then the bottle was emptied into a clean measure-glass and the weight of the empty bottle taken, which exactly corresponded with the net weight on the bottle—the gross weight of the bottle was three ounces and three quarters—I really forget the tare of the bottle, but it exactly corresponded with the mark on the label—at that time the bottle was full, it had not been opened—after this; my friend arrived with the policeman and the prisoner was given in charge—he then said a party round the corner had given it to him for sale—he remarked that Mr. Baldock had known him—he said he would go, and fetch the man who gave it him, if we would allow him to go by himself, but that it was not likely if the man saw him going with a policeman or with any disturbance about, that he would wait his coming.</p>
               <p>

Ernest—before I went to Mr. Baldock's, I knew the marks upon the whole twenty bottles—it was upon seeing the P.C.A. on the bottle that I gave the prisoner in charge—I did not know the other marks until the invoice was compared with the bottle—the policeman came into the shop after the attar had been turned out of the original bottle—he was not there when the prisoner spoke about the weight of the attar—the prisoner agreed to let me have the lot for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist of 30, Aylesbury-street, Clerkenwell—I deal with Messrs. Ernest—their traveller was in the habit of calling at my house—on the day in question the prisoner called at my shop about 5 o'clock—he showed me a bottle of attar of roses, and asked if I wanted any—I asked him how he knew it was attar of roses (the bottle was tied down)—how he knew what the contents were—before he gave me a reply, a little girl came in for some trifling article, and he left the shop</p>

I took the book, and put down the grease the gentleman had bought, and about half-past 4 I was a cutting a little boy's hair, and a gentleman came in and sat down; I did not ask him what he came for; in the meantime two more came in, and the gentlemen who came in first gave his turn to one of the other gentlemen; I served that gentlemen he had given his turn to; the gentleman required change; I put my hand in my pocket to give him change. I had in my pocket about thirteen sovereigns, and a few odd shillings which I had been saving up for the last four months; I pulled a handful out to give him change, and the gentleman sitting on the form who gave his turn away said, "You are well up for money, perhaps you can give me change for this?" I said, "Well, I never took such a thing before, I would rather refuse it;" he then said, "Don't you think it good? you will save me a great deal of trouble." I then took it in my hand, and showed it to a young man in the shop, and asked him if it was good, and he said it was, and another gentlemen in the shop said, "Let me look at it," and he said, "Oh yes, it is good," and I gave him change, and he put his name at the back, and as I had never taken a note before, I did not think of having his address at the back. I then had it in my possession all the morning, and I gave it to a cousin of mine to get it changed; and I took and wrote my own name at the back of it, and he could not get it changed. I kept the note until the next day; I thought when the gentleman asked me if I had seen it, I had some suspicion about it, and told him I had not had it, for fear I should lose my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a saddler's ironmonger, at 21, Fore-street, and have an extensive business there—Barnard was in my employ as a warehouseman, up to 2d November, and had been so about seven or eight years; I cannot state it exactly—I know Mulley—I have seen him occasionally at my warehouse—he has been coming backwards and forwards for purposes of business there, I should think, about twelve months—he was a customer of mine for ready money—I had no account with him—I have seen the articles that Hubble has brought here to-day—they are the same that were shown to me at the station-house—he showed me some property that was found in the prisoner's room up stairs; consisting of various kinds, the same sorts as we sell—I identify the goods produced by Hubble to-day; they are part of what was in our warehouse—the brushes have our name on them—the goods that were taken from our premises have our private mark upon them—on the afternoon of 2d November, I saw Mulley in our shop—Barnard was serving him—after Mulley had left, I went to Moor-lane police-station—I saw Mulley in custody there—I asked him how he accounted for having so many more goods in the parcel, than he had paid for at our warehouse—he said he did not know that there were any more than he had paid for; that he did not see what was packed up in his parcel—I asked him where he got the two brushes from, and some other articles also which were taken out of his pockets; some mane combs, and polishing-paste—he said he brought them from home with him; that he expected to meet with a customer, and, not meeting with one, he was taking them back again—I had given the officer previous instructions—I can hardly tell you the value of the goods in the parcel which Mulley put into the cart, without including the brushes and things taken from his person; but the skins and buckles and things in the parcel, would be worth considerably more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

I am a warehouseman in the employ of Mr. Eldred, of Fore-street—I have been in his service eleven years—I have been in the habit of seeing Mulley come to my employer's—I made a communication to the cashier—on 2d November, I saw Mulley in my master's shop—I saw him when he first came in—Barnard was not there then—I heard Mulley spoken to by Mr. Eldred—Mr. Eldred said Barnard would be in shortly, and would serve him—Mulley said very well, he would wait—I have, on more than one former occasion, known that to take place, that Barnard was out—Mulley has always expressed a wish to wait—on the 2d, he waited—I saw Barnard come in—we sell at the counter—if the quantity of goods bought is very small indeed, we pack them up as we sell them—a package like this one (<hi rend="italic">pointing one out</hi>), would be supposed to be packed by ourselves—a large parcel, we should be supposed to take to the packer—at the time Mr. Eldred told him that Barnard was absent, the other men were doing their ordinary work—he was served by Barnard on that afternoon, with the goods which are now in Court, I believe—the invoice was written by Barnard, who packed the goods himself—it is our custom, when the invoice is made, to get somebody to check it—on this occasion, it was given to Mr. Taylor, the cashier, and he checked it—if we draw an invoice ourselves, it is checked by another to see if the amounts are carried out correctly, and the addition is correct also—the articles ought to have been called over, but on this occasion, it is evident, they were not—that is done by the cashier—he has a desk in the centre of the warehouse, where he is able to see all that is going on—our ordinary course of business, in checking the articles in the parcel, was departed from in this instance—while Mulley was purchasing these goods, Barnard went up stairs, and Mulley with him—we keep brushes up stairs, and goods of other kind; saddlery—while they were up stairs, I examined the parcel that had been left on the counter—I found in it, two curry-combs, a remnant of cloth, or serge you might term it, and these two pieces of leather; the buckles were not there—that was before the invoice was made—I saw Mulley leave the shop with that parcel—Barnard made it up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have been in the employ of Mr. Eldred for sometime past—I first became acquainted with Mulley about a twelve month ago, I think—I believe he was then a customer's journeyman. He used to come backwards and forwards to the shop—I have changed him lower generally for my master's goods than I have charged the generality of customers; I do not think my master, or any one else in the place, knew of that. It has been for perhaps the last two months that I have charged him lower—I did not supply him on 2d November with these two skins; he brought them to the warehouse with him tied up, and asked me to enclose them in his parcel—I had a conversation with Mr. Eldred about those skins at the station. I let him have those covered buckles; I could not exactly enumerate the things I let him have on that occasion, but I know there were several little things put in the parcel which Mr. Mulley did not</p>

               <p>having this property in his possession—he made no answer, and I took him to the station—I was about three yards from them when I first saw them, and knew them all before well—I am quite sure of them—I have known Davies many years—I had seen them all four together about 1 o'clock that morning about ten yards from where I took them in custody, at the corner of George-street—the barrow was close against a lamp-post.</p>

I am a shoemaker of 11, Ernest-street, Notting-hill—the prisoner's first wife was my sister—I remember his going to America—I saw him when he came back in January, 1858, and asked him where my sister Harriet was—he said that he had left her in America—I asked him if he was not going to send over for her—he said, "No, I never intend to live with her any more; but as soon as I get into employment I will allow her half of my wages."</p>

               <p>only country people who she was staying with—she had been in the habit of earning money, independently of him; she has been obliged to do so to try and get a living for herself—she was obliged to learn shoebinding and got a trifle in that way—I do apt know where they were in America—she used to write to my other sister, and one letter used to do for us both—the prisoner mentioned to me about the bank breaking, and said that he had lost some money—I know nothing about his being obliged to go to Chicago to work.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 175). On 18th August, I went to Ewell to look for the prisoner, but did not find him—I looked out for him after<lb/>wards, and found him at Southend in the name of George Young—after putting a question to him respecting a gun, I told him that I had a warrant for his apprehension for bigamy—he asked me if I would let him go in doors—I permitted him to do so—he said to his wife, "This is a new tiling, I understood that she was dead, and they are now going to take me to London"—I told him that he must accompany me to the station—he told me at the station, that his wife went with him to New York, where he could not obtain employment; that he went on to Chicago, where he obtained a situation, and wrote to his wife to come there; but as she would not come, he came away to England—I have been to Christ Church, Marylebone, and obtained this certificate—it is a true copy of the register—I also obtained this other certificate from St. Matthew's, Brixton—that is also a true copy—(<hi rend="italic">The certificates were here read</hi>).</p>
