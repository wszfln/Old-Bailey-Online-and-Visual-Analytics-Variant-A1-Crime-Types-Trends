                  <hi rend="smallCaps">TOM POWELL</hi>. I live at 14, Kensington Park Road—I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph: "Clerk</hi> wanted by an established auctioneer, surveyor, and tavern valuer; a permanent appointment guaranteed to a gentleman advancing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on good security. Address Peter, Hanway Street, Oxford Street"—in consequence of seeing that I wrote to that address, to which I received an answer on 1st September—I came to London some weeks after, and saw the defendant at 105, Great Russell Street—he had a clerk there—I asked him if he was satisfied with his present clerk—after some little conversation he asked me if I would call again in a few days—J did so—he then said "I have a good business that is bringing me in 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and if I can get a young gentleman who will assist and help me in my business, I think I ought to make 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—I referred to his letter, and asked him how much money he required—he said if I advanced him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—he then showed me a book purporting to be a cash-<lb/>book, showing that in the last three months his receipts were so much, and that it would make up close on 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said he had received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188207310004"/>
               <p>that money in his business—I was to call again, which I did in a week or ten days with a friend—lie then showed us the same book, and the next day I believe he came to where I was lodging in Adam Street with this copy of an agreement, which I had written out for him—my mother and sister were with me at the time, and we talked the matter over, and the agreement was signed—he said he had a very good business, and it would be my own fault if I did not make a fortune—after some time I gave him a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that cheque was duly met—I parted with that cheque on the faith of his representations as to his business—he gave me at the same time this promissory note for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then entered on the office at 105, Great Russell Street—I never saw any business done there; a few people came there, but they only came for money—I remained there three or four months, till lie was turned out of the office in January—a distress was put in—all I had to do was to address two or three envelopes, and several of them were never posted—he used to come there every morning; he used to write letters, and stand before the fire and look over a lot of papers that he had there, and he would go out at luncheon time; that was all I saw; I never saw any business—I spoke to him about my 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. once or twice; I told him I thought it was a swindle; he always said that he would pay me every penny if he paid no one else—I saw him afterwards when he went to Oxford Street, and asked him to make arrangements to pay me or a part of it, and he wrote me this letter of 10th February. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that his brother was about to take to the business, when he hoped to arrange for the repayment of the money.</hi>) I have never had a penny; I got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for the first two or three weeks and sundry amounts of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. afterwards—I ultimately took proceedings at Bow Street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe this cash-book was produced by my solicitor at the police-court—I looked at it when the prisoner showed it me—it contains these amounts: "In July, 1881: receipts 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., expenditure 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; August, receipts 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., expenditure 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; September, receipts 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., expenditure 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; October, receipts 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., expenditure 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he said he was making those amounts in three months—I did not look at. the amounts; he only showed me the amount at the bottom of the page—he did not say that Mr. Simpson, of whom he took the business, was making 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he said nothing about Mr. Simpson—it was on the faith of what he told me that I advanced the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been a brewer by trade, not a public-house auctioneer's clerk; that is work carried on both in and out of the office—it might have been a month after I entered the office that I first spoke to the prisoner about this; it might have been a little more—people came pretty nearly every day asking for money—I was in the office during the whole time I was there; the prisoner said something to me one day about going out, but he never gave me any money to do so, and I could not go about to public-houses without money—he never sold a house during the time I was there—I don't know that it was a slack time—the money entered in the book as received was not money received in the business, but by pawning his clothes and the money he had from me—Mr. Hare was the friend who went with me to see the prisoner; he is not here—he asked the prisoner a few questions and looked at the cash-book.</p>

I am a solicitor, and am landlord of 105, Great Russell Street—I let out such parts as I do not use—about three years ago I let a portion to Mr. Simpson at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was there three years, and then introduced the prisoner to me as a person who would take the premises, as he was about leaving; I think that was in the beginning of last July—I think Simpson had a pretty good business the first two years, but it fell off very much; it is well known that public-house brokers have been doing very little for the last year or two—he owed me three quarters' rent when he left; he gave me his acceptance for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I had security on the interest of the prisoner's wife in some land—the bill was dishonoured—I received the first quarter's rent out of Powell's 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque at the beginning of November—I cashed it and took my rent out of it, and paid Mortlock 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a front room used for living in, a bedroom, and a back room used as a workshop—I don't know whether it was used as a living-room as well; I was never in it—there was an alteration made with regard to the entrance; some steps were made to go up from the yard, so that there was a separate entrance to the workshop without going through the private room—those steps were put up not by me, but by the prisoner—no explanation was made to me why they were put up; be did not mention that he had sublet a portion of the place—I never entered the place since Mertens had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of John Bale and Son, printers, of 87, Great Titchfield Street—I printed copies of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> from time to time—at that time it was published at Titchfield Street, since I knew the prisoner the type of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> was not set up at our place; it was brought ready set up week by week—we printed this copy of 13th May—it was a stranger who brought the type on that occasion, a man I had not seen before—the prisoner has brought it—I have seen him in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> several times—we machined it; we</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first saw the prisoner in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> when he was employed as a compositor by ourselves, when we printed it—we then set up the type—printing is a term that would imply the whole proceeding; those who brought the formes we should regard as the printers—we printed the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> from its first issue, about four years ago; we printed it, I think, for twelve months, supplying the paper and everything, and allowed the account to run against Mr. Most—I don't remember how the prisoner came into our employment; I have an impression that he was recommended to us by the person for whom we printed the paper in the first instance—I am uncertain whether we advertised or whether it was as I have stated—I don't remember inserting an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>—I may have done it; we have frequently done so—I believe the prisoner set up for us the first number of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>—we also had another German compositor at the time, named Englebricht, and those were the two compositors who set up the matter in the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>—it did not take up the whole of their time; they were on other matter, regular work—we set up and machined a number of periodicals—I think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of our periodicals; it is called the <hi rend="italic">British Flag and Christian Sentinel,</hi> with the motto, "For God, our Queen, and Country "—I think we set that up at the same time as the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>—the prisoner and Englebricht were probably engaged on that work; I can't say positively—I did not hold him responsible for the contents of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">British Flag</hi>—I did not ask him to watch the <hi rend="italic">British Flag</hi> to see if there were any immoral libels in that; that was in English, and I could not do it in the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit,</hi> because it was in German—l did not ask him to watch the contents of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit,</hi> or hold him any more responsible than any ordinary man—at that time Most was the person with whom we had to deal—I did not arrange with him personally to start the paper; I think we did the printing, composing, and supplying the paper for five guineas a week, allowing the account to run. and it has been running ever since, unfortunately—I can't say that I sunk capital in it, but there is an account still owing—I was not frightened when Most was apprehended; I did not think that I had been running close to the wind; at that time we were only machining the paper—I know John Neave—when Most was apprehended we entered into an arrangement with Neave to continue machining the paper, on the understanding that no such articles as that of Most should appear again—I should not have machined the paper unless I had had such a stipulation; I would not have gone on with it because I did not think it right to do such a thing—I made no stipulation with the prisoner—I think we only set up the type for the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> for twelve months; after that it was not set up at our place—I heard that Most bought the type for himself and started a small printing business—the prisoner and Engelbricht left us at that time; I believe the reason of their leaving was that they were to continue on the paper, and I had no more German work for them at that time; Most had commenced to have the German work set up himself; we did other German work for Most, and he printed other work besides the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit;</hi> he printed a German grammar, which we machined—I suppose you might call Most a general printer in German—there are not many</p>

               <p>German printers in London; we had some difficulty in getting German compositors; we generally advertise for them if we want them—after Most was apprehended I saw Neave, and continued to deal with him—it was an understanding that it was to be paid for weekly—Neave's account was to be paid for weekly, and I think it was almost without exception—I think on one or two occasions it might run over for a fortnight, but I think not longer—I have not my ledger here, only my receipt-book—Most's account is still one for which I look to Neave for payment; he has paid me one or two sums on account of it—Neave was the man we sent to if we wanted to know anything; for instance, if the paper was late—I did not know the prisoner in any other capacity than that of a compositor—I stipulated with Neave that the money for each week should be sent along with the paper, and most frequently the man who brought the paper also brought the money—I should not put a compositor to that work; I suppose they would rather do it in small establishments than stand still—sometimes the formes, the paper, and the money were brought together, by the prisoner or one of the other men—I didn't see him on the occasion when this number was printed—I don't know whether he had anything to do with the paper on that occasion—I have not been in communication with Neave since the prisoner's arrest—I am not sure whether the prisoner is what is called a Society man; I should suppose not; he was not when he worked for us—I am not a member of the Compositors' Society, and never was—I never was a journeyman; only journeymen are eligible—I don't suppose that when a man becomes a foreman he would leave the Society; I never heard of a master printer being eligible as a member—I said just now that I had not communicated with Neave since the prisoner's arrest, but I wrote a letter to him, to which I had no answer—I directed it to 22, Percy Street—I wrote for my account, and did not get it—I do not look to the prisoner for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am overseer at the Churton Street Branch Post Office—I have been there seven years, and the prisoner has been there all that time, employed as a letter carrier—on 5th July he was on duty, and made the 11. 45 collection from the St. George's Square pillar box, the Grosvenor Road wall box, and the Belgrave Road pillar box—he had a bag to carry the letters in—he arrived at Churton Street Post Office at 11. 55—it was then his duty to empty his bag, face the letters up, and stamp them with the obliterating stamp—on this day he also had to stamp the letters brought by Blessley and Press from Lupus Street, and each collector would then take his own letters and tie them up—after mid-day Gibbs made a communication to me, and I directed him to communicate with Madden, the detective employed there—assuming the letters to have been posted at Grosvenor wall box at 11.30, they would be collected by the prisoner at 11. 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been employed in the Post Office about eight years—I remember some time ago about 20 letters being sent to the post office unstamped by Mr. Radford, a merchant—I sent them back, and they were afterwards brought back stamped—if a man was in a hurry collecting letters, it would be as easy for him to slip them into his pocket—on previous occasions the prisoner has handed letters containing money and jewellery to me—there are no partitions in the room to obstruct the view—the letters are stamped on a table about six feet by 5 feet—he had many hundreds of letters to stamp that morning—there were a great many circulars.</p>

Cambridge Road, and Warwick Square boxes—I had nothing to do with the Grosvenor Road or Lupus Street or Churton Street boxes—I took my letters to the Churton Street Office, faced them up, and took them over to the prisoner to be stamped—my table was about six feet behind the prisoner's—he was standing sideways to the table—he said "You see what I have to do; put them down behind," pushing me back—he had a great many letters and circulars in front of him—I put them down behind him—I saw two letters on the table lying away from the others, with the addresses downwards—I returned to my own table and saw him pick up the two letters and put them into his inside coat pocket—I made a communication to Mr. Johnson, and then went for Madder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was dealing with more letters than usual that morning, there were 300 or 400 circulars—when he pushed me away and said "See what I have to do," I understood him to allude to the press of work which he had before him—the table where he was standing was in view of Mr. Johnson.</p>

In January, 1882, I was book-keeper to Fleet and Co.—I kept the petty cash book—the prisoner brought me these documents from Petty, Wood, and Co., as receipts for money which he had paid—I saw a receipt stamp across, and paid him these two sums—I wrote this cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable to Petty, Wood, and Co.—I believe this endorsement, Petty, Wood, and Co., to be the prisoner's writing—this other cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is payable to Petty, Wood, and Co., or bearer.</p>

Fleet's prospectus—I do not know when it started—it has been turned into a limited company—I never heard it said that as long as you were at large it was impossible to issue it—Mr. Richards said to me "You know Jones's account is overdrawn," but I do not know how much—I never looked at one of the ledgers in my life—I repaid you any money you had paid although your account was overdrawn.</p>

W. July 17th, 1882. The Ross Publishing Company, 4, Wine Office Court, Fleet Street. Gentlemen,—Your letter of Saturday duly to hand. It is impossible for me to be with you at the time named. However, to meet the case, if there are any orders introduced by me which on inquiry you cannot accept, I am quite willing to refund you the commission paid upon them out of the future commission. I hope to be in a position to hand you some first-class orders this week.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined,</hi> The prisoner is a very good canvasser—if any order turned out to be bad I deducted the commission—he brought me an order from Thornhill and Co. of New Bond Street—the commission has been paid on one quarter—he also brought me an order from Lyne and Co., of Tottenham Court Road, but the commission on that has not been paid because we were doubtful of the order—the same thing applies to Cox and Co., of Reading—I think there will be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him—he was at Reading to canvass for me—I have always been of opinion that the order is in his writing, and the signature—I told him his explanation bore the impress of truth—the representation of some one connected with the prisoner made me alter my view—to the best of my belief this is his writing—I believed it to be a forgery—I could not say by whom—on application to Bainbridge and Pound I found it to be a forgery—I believe it is customary for canvassers to assist each other, but not respectable canvassers—I believed the prisoner to be respectable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman living apart from my husband at 6, Moor Park Road, Fulham—I occupy the whole house—I have lived there about nine months—I have known the prisoner about 18 months he has been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to my house—he occasionally slept there—there are three bedrooms in the house; when he slept there it was in a room at the top of the house; I occupied a separate room from his—on Friday, 26th May, I went to the Oaks—I saw the prisoner on the day before, the Thursday; I did not arrange with him that day to go with him to the Oaks, I did on the Friday morning—he did not sleep there that Thursday night—I saw him between 7 and 8 o'clock on Friday morning, as near as I can remember, and it was then arranged that we were to go down to the Oaks—we went in a Hansom cab; we started about 2 o'clock; we took luncheon with us, some sandwiches in a basket; Mr. Wells packed the basket—we went in the cab on to the course, and were stationed opposite the Grand Stand, and from there saw the races—while at Epsom we met the deceased; I had not known him before; the prisoner introduced him to me—we left Epsom a little after 5 o'clock, I expect, as soon as the races had finished—while there we took our refreshments in the cab, consisting of food and champagne and beer; the deceased took some with us, and we remained together during the day, and we all three came back in the Hansom; I sat in the middle—they stopped on the road more than once for refreshment, and eventually arrived at my residence between 7 and 8 o'clock—we were all on good terms during that time—I went into the house first; previous to that I had asked Mr. Carlisle to come in; he followed me in—Mr. Wells said something to him, I don't know what it was; they came in both together—both of them appeared to have had too much to drink—they were in the drawing-room on the ground-floor for about an hour previous to that I had not sent for anything, it was in the house—I did not send for anything till after they had begun to fight; that was about three-quarters of an hour or an hour after we had got in; we were all three together in the drawing-room up to that time—they did not begin to quarrel in the drawing-room—I asked the deceased if he would like to come and see the front garden—he said, "Yes, with pleasure"—then I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188207310039"/>
               <p>asked him if he would like to come and see the back garden—he said "Yes," and when we were down in the back garden I asked him if he would kindly give me a little whisky-and-water, and Mr. Wells rushed down the stairs and came and snatched the glass of whisky out of his hand and dashed it against the wall—there was some whisky in the drawing-room; I had not had any; they had some; there was whisky on the table; Mr. Carlisle brought it to me out of the drawing-room, it was whisky-and-water—the prisoner snatched the glass out of the deceased's hands and dashed it against the wall, and he punched him in the head dreadful—he began to fight with his friend—before he snatched the glass out of his hand he said, "You are here, are you?"—then the deceased said, "If you mean fight come on," and they did fight—I ran away out into the garden to tell the people to get the police, and sent the charwoman, Susan Pape—I went into the w. c.; I was frightened—there is a window in there which looks out on to the back garden, so that I could see what was going on—I looked out of the window and saw the deceased trying to keep the prisoner down—he had got the prisoner down, but I think the prisoner got the other one down first, but the deceased got the better of him, I think, and they fought dreadful—one or the other of them said, "You shall kill me or I will kill you before I have done with you," but I could not distinguish the voices—then the police came, and Mr. Wells ran up to the top of the house and laid down on the bed when he saw the police coming—I then came out of the closet—I don't know whether I let the policeman in first or whether the charwoman did—the policeman went up with me to the room where the prisoner was, and I told the policeman to take him away, he had no right there—the prisoner said, "I shall not go, I pay the rent, I am the landlord of this house "—I told him he was not; I told the constable to take him into custody—the constable said he could not, as he had not seen the fight, and as the man said he was the landlord and paid the rent—he was not the landlord and did not pay the rent—the constable then went away, because the prisoner was quiet I went down into the drawing-room, leaving the prisoner there—Carlisle and I were in the drawing-room about three-quarters of an hour—the prisoner then came down into the drawing-room and said to the deceased, "Look what you have done to my face"—the deceased made answer, "But you struck me first, I won't be knocked about by you"—then they made it up together and shook hands—I thought they were going away together, and that Wells was going to get his hat and coat—in the meantime I wanted change to pay the charwoman, and I gave her half a sovereign and told her she had better get a bottle of whisky, although I had plenty in the house, and I could put it away—she brought me the change, and I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was not. in the room then, I don't know where he was, he went out as I thought to put on his hat and coat; I don't know what room he was in—the charwoman brought the whisky and put it on the drawing-room table—the deceased said he must go to town, he had particular business to do—the prisoner was not there then; he subsequently came into the drawing-room, and without saying one word he took up the bottle of whisky by the neck and hit his friend dreadful on the side of the head, and said, "Take that you——"—I only saw him strike him once; I ran away into the w. c., I was so frightened—after that they fought most dreadful in the passage; I could hear them</p>

               <p>fighting; I could not see them—that went on some time, and then I heard them fighting down the stairs, and after some little time I heard the deceased cry out "Oh; he has stabbed me this time"—then the prisoner came running along the passage where 1 was in The w. c, and he pulled hold of the door, and said "I will do for you now"—I never answered—he said "Oh, you are not in here, are you?"—I did not answer, I was too frightened—he then ran down the kitchen stairs—I heard him come upstairs again and go—I do not know, in my fright, whether it was the drawing-room door or the hall door shut, after a few minutes I came out and went straight to the drawing-room, and there was Mr. Wells kneeling on a chair and looking through the side-blind—I said "Oh, look at your face"—I did not see where the deceased was at that time—I said "But you gave your friend the first blow, you know"—he said "He has broken three of my ribs"—he groaned dreadful—I said "Don't you think we had better send for a doctor?"—he said "No, no, no"—he was looking through the blind, and he said "Oh, here are the police come for me; I am done for"—he then ran out of the room—first of all he said "Don't you open the door"—I said "I shall," and then he ran upstairs—there was a Knocking at the door; I opened it at once and let in one of the constables—one of the police, I think it must have been the sergeant, went upstairs to the prisoner; I did not go up—the prisoner then came downstairs, and one of the constables said something to him about this affair, and I turned round on him and said "You struck your friend with the bottle on the head you know, you should not have done it"—he said "If you round on me I am done for<hi rend="italic">"</hi>—I stopped in the drawing-room—I did not see the body of the deceased—the prisoner was taken away by the police—I had a poultry-knife in my possession; I had not taken it down to Epsom that day—I had not seen it that day before starting to Epsom—it was usually kept in the kitchen, on the dresser behind the door, in a knife-basket—I did not see that knife after we returned from the races; there were no knives in the drawing-room after we returned from the races—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my knife—I had not seen it at all on that day—when I asked the police to remove him I said nothing to him about having paid for his clothes; I had paid for clothes for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not sleep in my house on the Thursday night; I slept in the house alone that night—he came to the house between 7 and 8 o'clock next morning, or it might have been between 8 and 9 o'clock, for his letters—I did not let him in; I threw him the key—he was not then in the same clothes as he wore afterwards at Epsom, he had his old clothes—the other clothes were not kept at my house; I had no clothes belonging to him—I don't know whether he had anything to eat in the house; he might have had something downstairs in the kitchen; I don't know—I had nothing to drink with him—he stayed till he fetched the cab and went to the races—he went first for a brougham, but could not get it—with the exception of going for the cab, he was not out of the house from 8 o'clock in the morning till we started for Epsom—he went out alone for the cab—I suppose he put on the clothes at the shop in Holborn on the Thursday—he did not have the same clothes on on the Friday morning that he had on at Epsom—I don't know where he changed his clothes, except when they were bought at the shop—he may have had them on; I really did not take much</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188207310041"/>
               <p>notice of his clothes—ho had on the same clothes from the time he came in the morning till we went to Epsom—I made a mistake; he must have had them on; I am positive of that—no clothes' of his were kept at my house, that I am quite certain about, neither clothes nor linen—after this matter was over the police came for his overcoat—he did not take a clean shirt away—I sent him a night-dress of my own, because they said he had got nothing to put on—I don't know how long he was out when he went for the cab, it might be a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes—I think he had some whisky and water before he started for Epsom—I think he might have taken some twice—I did not have some with him; I don't like it—we had champagne in the hamper, and we had some at the races—I afterwards asked Carlisle to bring me some whisky and water in the garden, because I was thirsty—we had whisky and bottled beer in the hamper, and about three or four bottles of champagne, I don't know how much whisky—the prisoner packed the hamper—I did not see the things put in; I saw them at Epsom—I don't know how much whisky and beer there was—no one that I know of partook of the refreshment we took to Epsom except the prisoner, myself, and the deceased—the whole of what we took there was finished before we returned—in addition to that we stopped for refreshment two or three times on the road, to Epsom—I did not take any refreshment myself at those places; the prisoner did—I don't know what he had—they went into the public-house—we had no drink on the course besides what was in the cab—the prisoner and deceased may have done so when they went betting; I don't know—we stopped, three or four times for refreshment on the road from Epsom, and on each occasion the prisoner and deceased had drink; I did not—I had none but what I had in the cab—I sent out for a bottle of whisky because I thought, being race day, they would not give the charwoman change without—I had whisky in the house for my friends, not for my own drinking—my money paid for it all—I did not get out at any of the public-houses that we stopped at—I am quite sure that when we got back to Moor Park Road the prisoner and deceased came into the house together—the front door was not closed between the prisoner going in and the deceased going in—I did not stand and talk to the deceased outside the gate—the prisoner did not say to the deceased there "I wish you good day"—it was an understood thing that he was to come in—the deceased did not say to me outside the gate "I will wish you good day"—I may have said "I wish you to come into my house to have a glass of wine;" no doubt I did—the prisoner did not put out his hand to shake hands with the deceased and say "Good-bye"—I swear he did not—he did not say to the deceased "If we part now we shall be friends; if you come inside we shall not be so, we shall be enemies"—I heard nothing of the sort—I did not push the prisoner—I rang the bell myself—the door was not slammed between the prisoner and the deceased going in; I am positive of that—I think the prisoner had possession of both the keys of the gate and the house when we were at Epsom, as I had no pocket—I remember calling the cabman into the house to pay him—that was from five to 10 minutes after we had gone into the house—I paid him, and he went away—there had been no quarrel in the drawing-room before the cabman came in—a musical box was playing; Mr. Wells set it going—up to the time the cabman went away everything was pleasant and happy; that I am sure of—the deceased was playing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188207310042"/>
               <p>the piano as well—I did not say to the prisoner in the hearing of the cabman "You are a dirty old beast; I will have you locked up; the clothes on your back are not yours"—I never said such a thing, nor any words like it; there was no necessity for it—they were talking very lively together—I did not take any particular notice of what they said—I could not have said that, and forgotten it—I saw the cabman go away, and I shut the door after him—I did not look outside—I went upstairs and took my hat off—there was no crowd at the door, only little children; I am sure of that—I don't know whether I looked—I saw no persons there, only children—I did not ask the cabman to drive away quickly, with a view of getting the crowd away—I did not ask him to drive away quickly—it was about three-quarters of an hour or an hour after the cab<lb/>man left before there was any quarrel—there was no quarrel in the drawing-room at first—the first policeman, Flawn, came about nine; up to that time there had been no quarrel or disturbance; I am perfectly certain of that—Flawn did not go into the drawing-room, he went upstairs—he was in the house about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—I was with him all the time—the table in the drawing-room was not driven right up to the window at that time; I never noticed it—there was nothing disturbed in the first fight, two chairs in the drawing-room were not lying on their sides—there was no disturbance in the passage or in the drawing-room at that time—the globe of the gas bracket was not lying smashed on the ground at that time, nor were two chairs and a form on their sides in the hall, nor a pair of steps, a poker, and fire<lb/>shovel lying in the hall—before going into the garden the prisoner did not press the deceased to go; I never heard him say so—the deceased came down into the garden with me—we had been in the drawing-room altogether about an hour—I had ample opportunity of seeing him; I don't know his age, or the prisoner's—Carlisle was very much the younger—he looked a fine, well-proportioned, strong man—I and the deceased went first into the garden—the prisoner came down about 5 or 10 minutes afterwards, it could not be more—up to that time everything had gone on pleasantly—the quarrel then commenced by Mr. Wells rushing downstairs into the garden—he did not run down into the garden from the drawing-room before I went there; the deceased did not run after him into the garden—the prisoner was not at that time trying to get away from the deceased in the drawing-room—there was no quarrel<lb/>ling or challenging to fight till they got into the garden; there was none in the drawing-room, that I am quite sure of—I did not say before the Magistrate, "About an hour after we got home they were in the drawing-room on the first floor and they began to quarrel; I do not know what they began to quarrel about, but they challenged each other to fight, and they went into the back garden"—I have never said such a thing, it could not be—my deposition was read over to me and I signed it, but I think that must be a mistake—I could not have said it; if I said it, it must have been a mistake—I am not in the habit of making such mistakes—I cannot account for having said it; I never said it—I did not say that the fight began in the drawing-room, because it did not, it was in the back garden—I cannot swear that I never said it—I cannot account for having said it if it is not true—the drawing-room is on the first floor—there are steps down from the hall to the garden—the drawing-room runs from the front to the back</p>

               <p>of the house; there are folding" doors—only the front was furnished, the hinder part is only carpeted, it is not quite finished—there is one step in the hall and there is a door leading; down to the garden; that door is usually kept closed—it was shut on this afternoon—just below the one step in the hall there is a flight of steps at the back leading down to the kitchen—I went down the kitchen stairs to go into the garden—we got home from Epsom between 7 and 8 o'clock, it might have been a little later—It was between 8 and 9 o'clock when the dreadful struggle took place in the garden—it lasted very near half an hour—they were struggling as hard as it was possible for men to fight—the deceased once got the better of the struggle—the deceased was getting the worst of it at the first—the prisoner struck the first blow; I think the prisoner got the worst of it at last—the deceased got the worst of it for some minutes—I heard some shouting between them—at that time the deceased was getting the best of the struggle; he was holding the prisoner down and telling him to be quiet, I am quite sure of that; they were like two wild beasts more than anything else; both of them were shouting—I heard the deceased say, "If I let you got up will <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> be quiet?" that was at the beginning of the struggle—at that time the deceased was getting the best of it—I don't know whether he continued to get the best of it, I think it was six to one and half a dozen to the other—I could see and hear distinctly what went on from where I was—I sent for a police<lb/>man a few minutes after the struggle commenced in the garden, when I saw they would not give up fighting—the policeman came in about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes, it might be a little longer—the prisoner ran upstairs to the bedroom at the top of the house, not stopping anywhere on the way; I am sure about that—when the policeman came he complained of the way in which he had been used; he said, "Look at my face"—I think there was blood on his face, I did not take particular notice—he also complained, of his ribs being hurt—he might have been upstairs about three-quarters of an hour after the police had gone—when the prisoner went upstairs the deceased was not left in the garden, he was in the drawing-room with me—the prisoner might have been upstairs about 20 minutes before the police went to him—during that time the deceased was in the drawing<lb/>room; he came up out of the garden into the drawing-room—he was not in the garden at all after the fight, he was in the drawing-room with me—the policeman was there about 10 minutes—after he left I returned to the drawing-room, and was there with the deceased—the deceased was upstairs with me and the policeman in the top room the whole time—I did not notice whether the door of the back kitchen was open or shut when they came up from the garden—the deceased and I were not down<lb/>stairs in the kitchen at all before the prisoner came down from the top floor; the deceased never went into any of my kitchens, nor I either that day—when the prisoner came into the drawing-room he apologised to the deceased and said, "Let us befriends." or words to that effect; both of them did—the prisoner appeared desirous of being on good terms with the deceased "and me, and so was the deceased—it was about a quarter of an hour afterwards, or it might be a little longer, after, that the disturbance occurred in the drawing-room—during that time we were all on friendly terms; it was made up—until the prisoner struck the deceased with the bottle there was not an unfriendly word said—the prisoner came</p>

               <p>straight down from the top room to the drawing-room, not going any where else to my knowledge—he was out of the drawing-room before the blow was struck by the bottle; his friend and I thought he was going to get his hat and coat to go out together; he went out of the front drawing, room into the other one to get his hat and coat; I missed him; he came back in a few minutes—he did not come from upstairs on that occasion; he came from the back drawing-room into the front—I can't say that he was in the back drawing-room all the time—I missed him—he did not come from upstairs—I may have said before the Magistrate, "We had missed the prisoner again, and he came downstairs in a dreadful passion, and asked the deceased if he was going to stop, and then they quarrelled again"—he never said that to me, nor in my presence—I was very agitated and sleepy; I had had no sleep all that night—it must be wrong; he did not say a word till he struck him with the bottle—it is not true what I said before the Magistrate the next day after this matter occurred; I had not the matter fresh in my mind, I was confused; it must be a mistake, it did not occur—I did not see anything in the deceased's hands at the time he was struck by the prisoner with the bottle—I saw him carefully; it was light; the gas was not lighted; it was between the lights; it was very light; it was a moonlight night; I suppose it would be past 10 then—the blinds were up, except the side blinds; the centre blind was up until the whole thing was over, it was not pulled down at all—it was full moonlight, as bright a moonlight as I had ever seen; I did not see the moon; there was a very bright moon—when the prisoner came downstairs from the top room I was not in the kitchen with the deceased; I am no in the habit of taking strangers into the kitchen; the prisoner did not call to us to come upstairs; we did not then come upstairs—it is not true that the prisoner and I were talking for some little time in the drawing<lb/>room while the deceased was downstairs—the deceased did not come running up from downstairs—he had nothing in his hand in the drawing<lb/>room; I did not look particularly, but I dare say I should have noticed if there had been—there was nothing particular to cause me to notice—I heard no words in the drawing-room before the blow was struck with the bottle—the deceased said he must go home; that was when Mr. Wells came in, when they made it up together—the making-up was at the prisoner's desire and the deceased's also—I dare say the prisoner first suggested it; yes, he did—from the time the blow was struck with the bottle to the time the prisoner came to me at the w. c., when all was over, was about half an hour—he came there as soon as I heard the door shut—when I left them in the drawing-room there was a dreadful fight going on between them, one was as hard at it as the other—I Went away Immediately the struggle began—I did not see anything after the blow with the bottle was struck—I did not see a poker used at any time, nor any weapon at all—during the whole half-hour I was in the water-closet the fighting in the passage was dreadful; there was no cessation of it—it was the very moment before the door was shut that I heard the words "Oh! he has stabbed me," and it was immediately after that that the prisoner came and tried the water-closet door; no interval elapsed, he came to me directly-a few minutes after the prisoner went to the door I came out and went into the drawing-room—the prisoner and I were on quite friendly terms; there was nothing to make us otherwise—I never heard</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Seizman was called into Court</hi>)—I do not know him; I may have seen him before—I did not live at his hotel with the pri<lb/>soner from 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> March, occupying No. 10 room, nor did Mrs. Seizman come upstairs and ask me if I could translate a telegram in French which came for her—it is altogether a story; I never was at Seizman's Hotel either with or without the prisoner—I do not know the Waterloo Road—I do not know Dr. Mills, of Charing Cross—Dr. Lee attended me at Moore Park Road—the name of Wells was, I think, on his bottles, but I never passed by that name—I have looked at the bottles since, and found that the medicines came in the name of Mrs. Wells—I may have had twenty or thirty bottles, but I never noticed that the name was Mrs. Wells—there was a mistake in one or two of the water bills; they might be made out to Mrs. Wallace, and I had them altered; it would have been all over the place—I never passed as Mrs. Wallace; my name is Sykes—I never heard myself addressed as Mrs. Wallace—I have had tax-papers sent in to Mrs. Wallace, and I had them altered—Dr. Lee did not address me as Mrs. Wells, but I think I remember saying to Wells that he had no business to give my name as Mrs. Wells—he said that it did not matter, as I paid for everything I had—I was never attended by any doctor at Charing Cross Hotel, but I was there with my husband some years ago—I was not staying there with this man last August, nor did he and I occupy together No. 38, nor did we pass under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Wallace; all that must be pure imagination—the prisoner did not get Dr. Mills to me one Sunday morning in room No. 38, as 1 was suffering from skin disease—I never had skin disease—I did not, on leaving Seizman's Hotel, tell the cabman to drive to Charing Cross, Mr. Seizman being present.</p>

I am Divisional Surgeon of Police—on the night of Friday, 26th May, I went to 6, Moore Park Road, at 11 o'clock—I went into the front garden, where I saw Bartle, and Carlisle lying down at the bottom of the steps—I examined him at once, and found him in a dying state—he did not speak, and was dead within 3 minutes: I was not more than 2 minutes coming to the house—I saw a quantity of blood on the ground—the man was injured on the temple, and on examination I found a fracture of the skull—I did not know at that time where the large quantity of blood came from—I had him removed to the Workhouse, and then to the mortuary—I examined his clothes, and afterwards made a post-mortem examination, and found my opinion confirmed that tie blow on the side of the head had fractured the skull—I also found two wounds in the back, one 41/2 inches deep 2 inches below the lower angle of the right bladebone; that was merely muscular, it appeared to have struck the bone and glanced off—it was such a wound as might have been inflicted by a blow from this knife; considerable force must have been used—there were marks corresponding in the clothes—the second wound was below the other, about an inch from the spine"—that had penetrated the cavity of the chest, and injured the lungs, liver, and diaphragm, and was 7 inches deep; that was the serious wound—it might have been done with that knife, and the blow must have been given with considerable force; it would cause death within 6 or 7 minutes—besides the fracture of the skull, the flesh was cut down to the bone—the hands were bruised, not very seriously—when I first saw him before he was removed I saw this field-glass just under his right hand on the step where he was lying; the strap was wrapped round it—at the</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital—the deceased was brought there about 1 a.m. on Sunday morning, 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—I examined him and found he had a wound in the abdomen about an inch long—he was in a state of prostration and collapse; he had great difficulty in breathing—I thought it unsafe <hi rend="italic">to</hi> probe the wound—he was not bleeding much—it was a very dangerous wound—I was present on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> July, at 12. 50 in the afternoon, when the inspector was there—I then thought the man would not live twenty-four hours—I told him how bad he was, and that his recovery was extremely doubtful—he said "Yes, I do not feel as if I should recover," or words to that effect—his statement was taken in my presence—he signed it and I signed it—he got gradually better for some days, and then he was not better for some hours or a day, he had fits of shortness of breath, and seemed as if he would die very soon—that went on till about 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July, when he got suddenly worse, and Mr. Cooke was sent for, but I was in the country when he came, and another surgeon was on duty—I was not present when he died—I made a post-mortem—I found that the wound had penetrated the wall of the abdomen and showed no attempt to heal—it was nearly two inches deep because he was very fat—he died from blood poisoning, the effect <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the wound—he was of a very full habit of body—this shoemaker's knife would inflict the wound—the stab had penetrated through both shirts—I saw three or four small brown marks on the knife, and one small smear on the other side—I tested them; there is no reasonable doubt that they were blood, but whether of a mammal I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was not exactly in a healthy condition apart from the wound; he might have lived years and years, but if he met with any accident or disease he would be more likely to die than a man who was perfectly healthy—this knife is very sharp and would penetrate easily—it would be rather difficult to do it by a stumble—it went a little to the left and down; the abdomen was very prominent, in fact globular, and the wound came as if from above—if he had slipped it would be possible to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it in the fall, but not likely—he was a taller and bigger man than the prisoner—it was rather on the upper part of the abdomen.</p>

I am the wife of John Rinka, of 11, Buller Road, a labourer at the gasworks—on Saturday, 24th June, about 12 p. m., I was walking towards home, in the Imperial Road, Fulham—I had been shopping—as I passed the Imperial Cottages I received a handful of wet sand and gravel in my face—I ran to the gate—some one said "Run"—I saw four men; the prisoners are three of them; they were just inside the first gate—Hickey put his hand on my breast—I was very much hurt—I knew him by sight; he has lived in the neighbourhood for years—I said "Oh, Hickey, do you want to murder me or rob me?"—he said "F-and b—, old mother Rinka; let her go," and ran up the square—the other men tried to get hold of me, but I ran towards the first gate, and then O'Shea took me by the back of my neck—I knew O'Shea by sight—he ran in front of me, and took me by the back of my clothes, and said to Elgar "I mean business"—after some talk I did not understand, Elgar beat me on my right hand, which was very much bruised—I was carrying my parcel in my lap—I lost J lb. of tea and ¼lb. of butter—O'Shea said "Elgar, you'll make a f-fine gun"—I struck O'Shea under the chin, and made him let go of my neck;' I nearly lost my sight by his pressure—I ran away, screaming "Murder" and "Police"—when I found the police I went back about 100 yards; I was very much frightened, they following me in the shadow of the wall—O'Shea said "Here she comes now; we will lift her"—the police took O'Shea by the neck; he struck them in the face and got away, and they gave chase—the little square of cottages belong to the gasworks.</p>

I am a German—I am a sailmaker, now staying at the Sailors' Home, Whitechapel—on 16th May, 1880, I joined the British ship Cutty Sark, Captain Wallis, in London—the prisoner was chief mate—I knew him by the name of Smith—we sailed from London Cardiff, where a coloured man named John Francis joined as an able seaman—we sailed for Japan at the beginning of June—on the way out We found that Francis was not able to do his duty as an able seaman, and I often heard the mate say to him "Go out of my sight; jump overboard "—he would stand looking at the mate, and would do no work—about the middle of July I saw the mate striking him, and the blood was running out of his nose and ear, and he said "Iam not an impostor, sir," and he complained to the captain—one night, about 9th or 10th August, after we had rounded the Cape, I was in the mate's watch—Francis was on tire forecastle on the look out—it, was a dark stormy night—about 9.30 we were, hauling the sails round—the fore lazy tack was fast—the prisoner sung out twice <hi rend="italic">"Let</hi> go that lazy tack!"—I don't know, whether Francis did not or would not hear it—then all the watch sang out "Lot „ go that <hi rend="italic">fore</hi> lazy tack!"—he then let it go, and the end of it went overboard—the prisoner went round to Francis and said "Why did you let; go that lazy tack?"—he said, "You told me to let it <hi rend="italic">got</hi> and I let it go "—if he had let it go properly the end would not have gone over, but he. was no sailor and knew nothing about it—the prisoner said to the watch "The <hi rend="italic">b-r-.</hi>—did that out of spite," and he said to the, deceased, "You nigger to hell, I will come forward and knock you overboard"—Francis said "You come on this forecastle to heave me overboard; I have got a capstan bar waiting for you "—the prisoner then took a capstan bar from the windlass under the forecastle and ran on to the forecastle—I" saw a little struggle, and saw the capstan bar in the air, and heard a <hi rend="italic">flop,</hi> and the man fell down from the forecastle on the deck—it was a. heavy bar, made of teak, about 3 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2 feet long—a foot of it was broken off—I paw Francis stretch out his hand to get bold of the bar from the mate—I did not see anything in his hand—he never spoke after he fell—the prisoner said to me "You saw that nigger lift the capstan bar against me?"—I said "No, sir"—he said "Well, he will lift no more capstan bars against me; I have done for him" Francis lay there all covered with blood—I went aft and fetched the carpenter and steward, and the captain came with a lamp—he was carried down between decks in a sail-cloth, and the captain cut his hair and dressed his wound—I saw the wound—it was right across the top of his head, about four inches long—he was left there all night in his wet clothes—next day he was moved to his bunk, and the prisoner brought some of his own blankets and put them over him—lie, died that night—during the day the prisoner said to me and another man "I knocked him down like a bullock; he never gave a kick "—I saw the two south-westers that Francis was wearing at the time, and they were</p>

               <p>both full of blood and broken at the top—the capstan bar was kept in the forecastle for a time, but the captain dropped it overboard about four weeks afterwards—he did it on purpose—Francis was properly buried at sea; the captain read the prayers—the prisoner was taken' off duty after this occurred—he left the ship when we got to Auger, a Dutch port—we afterwards sailed to Singapore, and on the way the captain jumped overboard and drowned himself—-we got a pilot at Singapore, and I was seen by a Magistrate there—I remained with the Cutty Sark till she was paid off at New York—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the official log——I signed it; the captain made me do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I got the carpenter to witness that I would not sign it—I did sign it; it is not correct—the captain read it out before I signed it—this was a tea clipper of about 1,000 tons burthen, very narrow in the beam, a ship that wants to be cleverly and smartly handled in dirty weather—I shipped as sailmaker—there were 10 so-called able seamen on board, the captain and first and second mates, but only 6 or 7 of the men were really able seamen—among the watch on the night this occurred there was only one able seaman—I had to work as a seaman—the wind had caught the sails, and we were going round on another tack—the result of Francis not letting go the lazy tack was that we did not get the sails round—I had not seen any handspike on the forecastle; there was not one there—there was one underneath the capstan under the windlass; there were six capstan spokes there and hand-spikes—When the man had been struck the prisoner went aft to the captain, and told him he had struck the man down, and the captain came back with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I joined the Cutty Sark as an able seaman on 15th May, 1880—Francis joined at Cardiff—in July, during the morning watch, I heard the prisoner speak to Francis about moving so slowly—he made some insolent reply, and the prisoner struck him with his fist or hand, and some blood flowed from his ears and nostrils—Francis went aft and told the captain, and the captain said it served him right, he should do his work in a manly manner—Francis went to his bonk and took a knife from it, and went to the grindstone and sharpened it, and he walked up towards the prisoner and said, "By G—d, Mr. Smith, you look out for me, or I will murder you yet," and he dashed the knife (town on deck—he also threatened him at another time the same day, and then broke the knife in three pieces, saying "By. G—d, I will finish you yet"—the prisoner asked him what he meant; he made no answer, jut walked into the forecastle—he often threatened him in the fore castle in the presence of the seamen there, saying what he Would do, and we told him to hold his tongue—on the night this happened the prisoner was in charge of the watch from 8 to 12; the wind shifted, and orders were given to trim the sails—Francis was on the look-out on the forecastle head—the prisoner called out to him to let go the" lazy fore tack; he sang it out two or three times, and then all the Watch sang it out; then he let it go, and it went overboard—I could not hear exactly what Francis said, but it sounded like either "Very well," or "Go to h——I "—the prisoner walked forward and asked Francis what he let go the lazy tack for; he said, "You told me to let it <hi rend="italic">go,</hi> and I let it go;" the prisoner said, "If you give me any more of your jaw I will murder you yet"—I heard Francis say something, but what it was</p>

               <p>I could not say; it was in an insolent tone of voice—the prisoner said "If I come up there I will throw you overboard, you d——d nigger;" Francis said, "If you come up here to throw me overboard I have a capstan bar ready for you, you will find I am not Reynolds "—that wag alluding to a previous disturbance; Reynolds was another coloured seaman on board—this was a very dark night, it was blowing and raining very hard—I heard a blow struck, as if a man had been struck with the hand on his back with his waterproof on—I heard no more till the prisoner came aft and asked the watch if they saw that nigger lift a handspike to him; we all said "No;" he said, "Well, he won't lift another one to me in a hurry "—we then went below—on going forward I stumbled over the body of Francis, and I said to the prisoner, "You have done a fine thing now "—he ordered us to carry the body on to the fore hatch—he then went aft and told the captain—I afterwards saw the capstan bar picked up by one of the seamen on the main deck about 10 or 12 feet from the forecastle head—it was broken.</p>

               <p>the sacks, and found it was wool—the van contained 22 bags—I got up on the off shaft, spoke to the driver, and we drove on and pulled up at the Royal public-house at the corner of Bow Road and Burdett Road, where I left the van in a constable's charge, and went with Edwards to Webster's yard, Bow Common Lane—I saw a particle of wool over the entrance and some lying about, which I collected—we then went along the road till we met Mr. Charles Fardell, and drove with him to where I left the van—Edwards got on to the van by my orders, and drove to a turning out of Corbett Court, in front of Brommett's gate—he has a warehouse there joining his house—I spoke to a man standing there and was taken to the back premises, where I saw 31 bags of wool similar to that in Edwards's van—Mr. Wright was with me all the time—I sent him away with the load which I stopped Edwards with—he returned with help, and the 31 bags were removed—I arrested Meyer Frenchman, who was in charge of the premises—I was at the station when Brommett was brought in—I said, "What account do you give of the wool I found on your premises?"—he said, "I saw a man, Harry Reece, at dinner time to-day, at Union Street warehouse, and he asked me if I would buy some sweepings"—that is in Union Street, Commercial Road, a quarter of a mile from Philpot Street.</p>

I remember this wool being taken from Brommett's, and soon after Brommett arrived, as soon as he knocked at his door, I said "Mr. Brommett?"—be said "That is my name, Sir; what can I do for you?"—I was in plain clothes—I said "You are going inside?"—he said "Yes"—I said "That is right; I want to speak to you"—he went in and I followed him—I was asked to sit down, and his wife and daughters began talking to him in Hebrew—I knew they were talking about me, as they turned round and looked at me—I said "Your good lady has already told you I belong to the police; that is right, I do; and I am directed by the inspector to ask you to be kind enough to go with me to the station—he said "Shall I come now?"—I said "If your please"—we went into the street, where his son met us and said something to him which I could not understand—Brommett then looked at me and said "They say it is something about wool; what is it all about?"—I said "Yes, it is"—he said "Well, I met a man, Reece, at Candler's warehouse this morning, and</p>

I said "Do you mean to say you have bought it without seeing it?"—he said "I have not bought it"—I said "Well, bargained for it"—he said "No, I told him to send it in and I would attend to it to-morrow"—he was taken to the station.</p>

On 1st June, at 8.30 p. m., I went to Brommett's premises and saw the detectives and Meyer Frenchman, and a quantity of wool was removed by my orders—Newman brought Brommett to the station at 9.30, and Sergeant Foster said "I am a sergeant of police, Mr. Brommett; how do you account for the wool found at your premises?"—he said "All I know is a man Harry Reece came to me to-day and said he had some sweepings for sale. I said I could not attend to it to-day, but if he sent them to my place I would attend to it to-morrow "—I afterwards went with Newman and Fardell to Reece's house, 22, North Street, Commercial Road—I said "I am an inspector of police; this is Sergeant Newman and this is Mr. Fardell. I have come to make inquiries about some wool that was stolen yesterday. Brommett, Frenchman, and Edwards are in custody for stealing and receiving it; Brommett says all he knows of it is, they came to him this morning and said they had some sweepings for Bale, and he said that he could not attend to it to-day, but if he sent it into his place he would attend to it to-morrow, and Meyer said that you came for some bags and some string, which were given you, and you afterwards sent the goods in"—he said "Oh, Brommett says that, does he? I will tell you the truth. A man, Lipman, came to me last night at the Sussex Club, and said he knew a man who had some bales of wool for sale, I said 'I cannot do with it myself, but I know some one who could. 'Lipman said the man had a dock warrant. We arranged to meet this morning at the corner of New Road, Whitechapel. We met. Brommett was with me, and a man whose name I do not know was with Lipman. We all went to Bow on a tramcar, and up a yard. Brommett saw samples of wool; Lipman cut open three or four of the bales, and Brommett looked at the wool, and he and the man whose name I do not know went into a public-house close by. They had some conversation, but I did not hear what it was. Brommett came to me and said 'We are coming home now, Harry. 'I said 'Are you going to buy it?' Brommett said 'Yes. 'I said 'I don't much like the look of it. 'Brommett said 'Oh, it is all right; I am going to have a receipt from the man belonging to the place. I shall have it repacked; you go to my place and ask Meyer to give Lipman as many bags as he wants. 'That was about noon, and after dinner I went and saw Meyer, and told him Lipman was to have as</p>

               <p>many bags as he wanted. At that moment Brommett came in and Meyer said to him 'Is it all right?' Brommett said 'You let him hate as many bags as he wants and some string, that is all I know about it. 'I asked Brommett what he was going to give me for my trouble, and he said he would satisfy me"—I told him he would have to accompany me to the station—we went to Seething Lane Station, where Brommett was brought into the charge-room with the others—I repeated to him what Reece had said—he said "All I know is. he said he had some sweepings for sale, and I said 'I will see to it to-morrow'"—Reece was then charged with the others—I went with Sergeant Foster next morning to Brommett's and took possession of these two books, the "In" book and the "Out" book.</p>

Constable 34 Brought the prisoner to the police-station on 8th July about 12 in the day—I said to the prisoner "You are the man I have been looking for"—he said "I do not think you know me "—I said "I happen to know more about you than you are aware of"—I said "Whore is the carpet-bag you had with you this morning?"—he said "I have no carpet-bag, and I know nothing about one"—I said "Well, you had one this morning at 11 o'clock "—he said "You have made a mistake this time"—I left him in charge of Constable 34—he took two knives rolled up in a piece of brown paper out of his pocket, and laid them on the table—he was taken into the charge-room—then I went to Mr. Richardson's, who handed me this carpet-bag, containing the plate—I took it back to the station, and said to the prisoner "Where did you get it from?"—he said "I bought it of a man at Shoreditch Station; I gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it the previous night"—I said "What is the man's name, and where did he come from?"—he said "I do not know"—I said "What is your name?"—he said "My name is Jackson"—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "At York "—I said "That is not good enough for me, I know more than you are aware of"—showing him the property, I said "I have no doubt this is the proceeds of a burglary at Kensington"—he replied "I dare say you are not far out; you had better take care of me, it is not every day you get such a man as me in here"—I replied "We shall take very great care of you for some time to come, I dare say"—I then communicated with the owners of the property, and it was identified—the prisoner, was then conveyed to High Street, Kensington, Police-station and charged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been employed at Covent Garden as a porter. On 7th July I met some men in the market about 7 a.m. They said they had come from Newmarket, and had some property to get rid of. I told them I was doing nothing, and would go to the pawnbrokers for them. I had two glasses inside of me, and did not care what I did. I said I thought there was something wrong, but they said it was all right, and I went to the pawnbrokers' shops as I was instructed. I never thought the things were stolen till I got to the police-station. They said they represented Colonel Harvey. I recommended one to a lodging in Mill-bank Street. I do not know where the things came from. I was pushed, and had a bad suit of clothes. I have been in trouble before, and have not long been liberated. I have 18 months to do. I was led away by a glass of drink. If I get outside I will perish before I taste a drop more. Have mercy on me, I am an old man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of 25, Harrild Road, Upton Park, Essex—I went to Fenchurch Street to catch the 12 p. m. train, but was half a minute late—I walked round in a pondering mood; I saw lights in a public-house, and went towards it; the short prisoner walked in front of me, and both the prisoners surrounded me so that I could not get in—I lost my ring from my coat pocket—the prisoners made remarks—when I was going to pay for a glass of stout I found my money was gone—I had 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I found all right in my pocket when I left the station door—I had not spoken to any one—I was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The public-house was about 50 yards from the station—two porters came three minutes afterwards to the public-house—I said "I am looking for a ring, porter"—one said "Have not you it on?" I said "No, I am not wearing it"—it was a Monday night—I had been to the Houses of Parliament and to the Temple Forum in Fleet Street—I had had a little refreshment and heard a little politics; then I went direct to the station—I paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a cab home—I did not tell the women about my loss—they knew I had lost my ring—they went in the same compartment as I did—when I found I had no money I was magic-struck, and bolted out of the house, and the prisoners ran up Fenchurch Street—at the station the inspector said the prisoners would have to be searched, and I asked him how long that would take, and I said "Can I go out?" he asked what I wanted to go out for, and I said I wanted some fresh air.</p>

               <p>—two railway porters came up and spoke to the prosecutor, and all three went into the public-house—in a few minutes the prisoners came out and went down Fenchurch Street in the direction they had come—the prosecutor ran out of the public-house in an opposite direction—I spoke to him, and in consequence of what he said to me we both went after the prisoners up Horn Alley—the prosecutor said he should give the prisoners into custody for stealing 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the way to the station the prosecutor said "I have lost a gold ring"—before that I asked him what he had lost, and he said "All I have, I was going to pay for some beer, and I had got no money"—I said to the prisoners" You are given into custody for stealing some money from this prosecutor.

                  </hi>. I am a billbroker, of 26 and 27, Bush Lane—I have known Barton since 1879, and have discounted bills for him—in August, 1881, he brought me this bill (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) and asked me to discount it—he said, he had drawn it on Mr. Russell Miller in payment for hops sold by him to Mr. Miller—1 did not know Mr. Miller—I saw his name on it—I made inquiries about him—it was my invariable practice when I discounted bills for Barton to make him sign a paper similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him sign this—having signed it, I gave him this cheque for 236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it came back from my bank paid—I parted with my money on the faith of the representation he had signed that the bill was drawn in the ordinary course of his trade as a hop merchant—in the beginning of my dealings with him I believed that he</p>

               <p>was, commercially speaking, a very weak man—I found out that he had filed his petition about a month afterwards—I was put in communication with Miller before the bill was dishonoured—I did not ascertain from Miller for a very long time that it was not his signature; he avoided the question for some time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. I have discounted bills for the prisoner from 1879, the total is over 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they have all been paid with one exception, and that was only a momentary delay—the money I have received for discount is not greater than the amount of this bill; the nett amount of interest is very much lees; there is not commission as well—I said at the Mansion House that the gross interest which he paid me and commission was 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the nett was not—he told me that he had taken this bill to the Central Bank, Tooley Street—he did not say that they refused to discount it because Mr. Miller the acceptor had no banking account—my clerk called; he is here—he told me that Mr. Gardiner, the manager of the bank, could hardly understand how Mr. Miller should accept such a bill, because he was undoubtedly a man of means—I did not learn that the reason they refused was because he had no banking account—the prisoner told me before he drew the bill that he had been to Somerset House to inquire about Mr. Miller's position, and that he found he was entitled to considerable property under his father's will, and he was quite a young man just come of age—this cheque was drawn by my clerk; my friend and a gentleman who holds the power of signing for me; I don't keep dogs and bark myself—I was within the four walls of the office when it was drawn, I can't say whether I was in the room—part of the transaction may have been carried on with my clerk, and part with myself, but I was there and was cognisant of everything—I believe I told the prisoner soon after he filed his petition that Miller had denied that the bill was his acceptance; I saw him at Mr. Mountain's office soon after he filed his petition and said that Mr. Mountain had cast a doubt on the genuineness of the acceptance; he said, "How do you know that he said that the acceptance was not his?"—I said, "I wrote and asked him to take it up"—I had the bill with me on one occasion when I went to Mountain's office and had a conversation, and it may have been on the occasion when I said I had written to him—I asked him in whose writing the words "accepted, payable at," were—he did not tell me it was Mr. Hale's writing—he said that he had no reason to believe but what it was Mr. Miller's genuine acceptance—I can't give any opinion whether the words, "Accepted, payable at the London and County Bank, Lombard Street," and "G. Russell Miller," appear to be in two different writings, but I believe they are—I asked him in whose writing the "Accepted, payable at the London and County Bank" was—he did not tell me it was Hale's writing—he distinctly said that he did not know—he did not say that it was Mr. Hale's writing, who had given him the bill for a claim against Hales—I knew Mr. Hales before I took the bill, but did not know that the prisoner had had transactions with him—I knew that they were both in business—Barton brought me a bill for over 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on Hume, Webster, and Co.; it was drawn by Hale and I discounted it as agent, not as principal, I got it discounted—I did not discount it—I gave the cheque to Barton—Hale came to see me about that bill, and I should know him now if I saw him—I did not know that it was a hop transaction between Barton and Hale—Barton said to me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188207310099"/>
               <p>"Did you suspect me of any complicity of knowing this to be other than a genuine bill?"—I said, "Not at all, I knew that you were innocent, or I should not have come to see you," and I would not have gone to see him if I had thought he was guilty of forgery—I am doubtful now whether he is guilty of forgery, it is only a matter of belief—I believe I said at the Mansion House, "I have all through exonerated the defendant Barton from any participation in the forgery," and I say so now—my belief is a fluctuating belief, and on the balance I do not believe Mr. Barton is a forger—that was a true expression of my belief at the time I made it, but I am doubtful now, and have been many times at various intervals—I had rather exonerate the man than convict him of forgery—I did not say, "It is that beggar Hales's doing; he shall smart for this"—I took out a warrant against Hales—Barton did not tell me he had seen Miller write the acceptance—while we were talking in the street Hales passed—I can't recollect whether he came up to us—Barton did not say, "Miller denies the signature to the bill you gave me"—I said that to Hales, and if Barton had helped me I should have given Hales in custody there and then—I did not say, "Miller does not hesitate to say that you have forged it"—I said, "Mr. Miller repudiates the signature as a forgery"—I did not charge Hales with forging it—this was in October—I went to Barton's house from time to time to see him before the bill matured, but I do not think I saw Hales before it became due—I brought an action against Miller and Barton on this bill; the action against Miller was abandoned; Barton defended it unsuccessfully on the ground that he had taken bankruptcy proceedings and was relieved by them—it was allowed to go on till June this year, when it was finally disposed of by the Bankruptcy Court restraining me from taking action on the judgment I had obtained—I took proceedings against Hales in March; Barton saw me from time to time and assisted me in trying to ascertain Mr. Hales's whereabouts—there was a summons; it was within a few days of my being examined at the Mansion House that I took proceedings—I solemnly swear I did not try to settle this matter with Mr. Barton—this letter is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "It will be my desire to avoid trouble and expense, but apparently you are indifferent to those considerations.") I wrote that to induce him to settle it; there was a civil action coming on then—I referred to the letter of 5th April (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I have all the letters here—I had spoken to him previously to this letter of April 12th, as to paying money on the bill; I did not ask him to do so while the legal proceedings were pending; it was not my first loss, and I do not suppose it will be my last—I knew the man was in liquidation and could not pay the money—I saw Barton on several occasions while he was trying to assist me—he regretted as I regretted that the transaction should have resulted in this, but I did not ask him for money—he told me he would do his best to pay me off, and he regretted he was mixed up with the transaction—this letter says, "I can add nothing to what I have already said"—that means that he was doing his best about paying the bill—I wanted some arrangement to be made for its payment, and I do still—I wanted him to consent to judgment and not contest the thing as he did to the very last, by every vexatious means in his power—I wrote, "You will see in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of to-day an advertisement offering a reward of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the apprehension of Hales.

                  </hi>. I am a builder of 137, High Street, Homerton, and manager to Mr. Chapman—the prisoner called on me about the end of October; he referred to an advertisement about a warehouse at 1, Nisbet Place—he asked the rent; I told him. 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he gave his name Mr. Hayest, and suggested an alteration in the stairs to make it easier for anybody to go up and down—he called again and arranged to take the place, and appointed a day to call and sign the agreement, which he did—I attested it, and he signed it "J. E. Hayest" in my presence—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced, dated 14th November,</hi> 1881)—I think he had possession before. it was signed—he paid a half quarter in advance up to Christmas, and had a padlock key given to him—he requested me to put some iron bars to the windows to make the place more safe, and he thought the windows would be better whitened so that no one could see in, which I had done—he said that he did the lacquering by a patent process, but he did not take the patent out—I saw him at the premises sometimes daily, and then there would be a week or a fortnight's interval—I have seen him come there with goods with a van, and have seen Lovelock with a van—a young man used to come there at the latter portion of the time, who I thought was his brother—the vans contained cases, which were put into the warehouse, and I have seen cases put into the tan and driven away, and the prisoner generally went with it—he has never formally given up possession; I did not know that he had left—after Christmas he paid the next quarter in advance—we have not resumed possession yet; we did not know where he had gone—I remember his being absent for a little time; I understood that he was going to Paris on business a day or two before the taster holiday<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I remember his saying that he had received a good order, sufficient to last him a few weeks—I have been just inside the door, but only saw a number of packing-cases.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He asked if I should like to go to Paris with him—the young man who came was a labouring man; he was not dressed as a gentleman—I saw a gentleman there several times, between,30 and 40 years of age, a man in a far superior station in life to the prisoner as regards appearance—he frequently appeared shortly before freights went away in the vans, but I cannot say always.</p>

Achey, Limerick"—I gave directions to the manager, Mr. Stevenson, as to the delivery of these cases, and next day went back and opened one of them; they were the same size as the other; the only difference that I saw was that one had the address on the case itself, and the other was in writing—I can't say which one I opened, "but it contained rifles, bayonets, and cartridges; I can't say how many, for only one was taken out—it was put back again, and the case fastened down; it was put into a van, and I accompanied it to Euston Station that same evening, and travelled in the train with the case from London to Holyhead, and then to Dublin, and on the 16th December at Dublin I pointed out the two cases on board the boat to Keaveny and Davey, two constables—after I had been to the Swan with Two Necks I went to the receiving-house at King Street, where I had first seen the man, and found that the two cases had been sent on to Paddington Station; I saw Mr. Daniels, the clerk, there—I reported what had occurred to Head Constable Shea—I did not go to Paddington; I saw the cases when they were delivered at King Street—they appeared to be about the same size as those delivered at the Swan with Two Necks.</p>

The action of the British Government and of its aiders and abettors is obviously intended to provoke premature resistance. Upon you, therefore, rests the responsibility of averting defeat arid hnmiliation. You have grievous cause for revolt; but you are not yet prepared, and a crushing disaster would now leave to the next generation the task of beginning anew the great work already so far advanced. The salvation of our people lies in the achievement of national independence alone; but the time to strike has not yet come. Beware, then, of being misled by false or foolish friends or goaded by the enemy into fruitless outbreaks. The man who now incites to attempts at insurrection is doing England's work and must be held guilty of treason to Ireland. The most rigid discipline must enforced and partial outbreaks prevented. Move only by command of your officers. Our present duty is to prepare, to watch, to wait. Until the hour for action comes let your attitude be one of calm resolve, self-sacrifice, and unshaken confidence in the final triumph of our cause. By order of the Irish National Directory.</p>

I thought I was a murdered woman—I got as far as the front door, with my fingers on the knob, and she drove me back, and said "You are not going there"—she said she would murder me—she pushed me, and I fell down in the hall twice with her pushing me and beating me on the head—I caught hold of the brush to get it away, but could not—she said" Leave go, leave go of the brush"—she tried to get me into the breakfast-room, and said "You wall go in here"—I said "I won't"—she pushed me in—I kept hold of the door, and put my hand on the table to save me from going down—while I was in that position she said "Have you got any money; where is it; how much?"—I said "I have only got a few coppers in the house; pat do you want money for?"—she said "I want to go to my mother"—said "How much do you want I"—she said a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will do with what I have got—I said "Then you must wait till your master comes home to-night"</p>

               <p>Jointly attended her ever since, for nearly three months—there were seven wounds on the head—the first I saw was a lacerated and contused wound over the right parietal bone that was bleeding profusely; the second was a contusion over the left maxillary bone; the third was a wound over the left temple, of which there is a scar now; it has not yet healed completely, the skin was divided—the fourth was deep and lacerated over the right orbit; the artery had been wounded, and blood was pumping out—that was a most serious one; it was cut down to the bone—the fifth, both eyelids and eyes were contused and ecchymosed internally, to the front of the lobe, and also externally, so that she could not see to sign depositions—the sixth were contusions on the upper and back part of the head; there seemed to be two knocks, but they were not wounds; there was no blood from them—the seventh was over the left temple bone, just over the car; that was a wound, blood was running down on to the ear—those were such wounds as might have been caused by this brush used with violence—this brush could have inflicted all the injuries I found—there were bruises on the arms in front, as if they had been put up to protect the head—those marks could have been done with the brush or any other blunt instrument—there was a mark on the neck as if some one had grasped it—there was one clear mark of a finger-nail; there were bruises at the top of the shoulder which might also have been done with the brush—she complained very much of one finger, but that was a minor thing—the skull was fractured on the upper part of the right parietal bone—she was in a very dangerous condition, so much so that I had the Magistrate sent for in consultation with Dr. Evans—she remained for a considerable time in a dangerous condition—she was not able to go out for about two months—I did not see the slightest trace of paralysis about her—it would be quite impossible that she could have sustained all these injuries from a fall downstairs; one bruise on the forehead might—she remained rational all the time, except weak from loss of blood.</p>

I am a packer, of 34, Banfield Street, Islington—about 12.30 on Sunday morning, the 23rd July, I was walking close by my house, the prisoner and another accosted me—one struck me and I attempted to rim away—I was thrown forward into the gutter—I was caught by the leg—I got up and they collared me again a few yards away, and I struggled with them—one of them shouted, "Nail him, Jim"—I dragged the pair of them along; they got my arms behind me—my left-hand trousers pocket was torn out—it contained 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a piece of white paper, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece and some other moneys, and two keys and a knife—I knocked two loud knocks and they ran away—I went in doors a few minutes and then went to the police-station—I gave a description of the men—about half an hour afterwards I went to the police-station, and identified the prisoner from six men as one of the men—he had something on his neck, but no hat on—this cap was given to me by a little girl—it was shown to the prisoner—he said, "It is not my cap."</p>

I live at 87, Church Street, Deptford—on the afternoon of 17th June I was helping my next door neighbour to move his greengrocery business; the prisoner asked me what I was stopping the thoroughfare for—I said, "There is as much room for you as anybody else passing"—he hit me on the cheek and knocked me down and kicked one of my teeth nearly out, and kicked me on the muscle of the leg, and my ankle was broken—I cried out and my wife came to the door and said, "What are you illusing my husband for?"—he said, "That is your husband"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "Take that," with a <hi rend="italic">farmyard</hi> word and began illusing her—I got up to protect her, and just as I got on to the footpath I fell down and said, "My ankle is broke"—I fainted off and was carried in doors—on the 18th I was taken to the Seamen's Hospital, and was in nine days, when I came out to appear against the prisoner—he kicked me several times.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk, of 23, Burnaby Road, Stockwell—about 1 on Friday morning, as I was returning home, I saw flames rising from the floor of Mr. Oates's shop—I crossed the road, and looked under the doorway; the smell of paraffin almost knocked me back—I hit the shutters with my stick and shouted as loud as I could—about three-quarters of a minute after the prisoner came running up, he asked me what it was; I said "The place is on fire, you had better run as hard as you can to Spurgeon's for the escape "—I saw no one else about—I saw the prisoner again about half-past 2, after the engines had been—I said "Hallo, old man, have you not gone home yet?" he said "No, I am just going home"—I asked if he thought how the fire was done; he said he did not know, he was going for the reward money in the morning—he went off for the fire-escape when I sent him, and on his way he fell down and cut his nose; his face was covered with blood when he came back in a hansom.</p>

"—he said, "I am innocent," but before the Magistrate he said that he would plead guilty to stealing the coat.</p>

I am very sorry. I new did such a thing before" <hi rend="italic">Shipley says:</hi> "At 12.30 I was coming down the Wandsworth Road, and met Owen and three more. They asked me where I was going, and I said 'Home. 'They said 'There is a shop open down Bond Street. 'I said 'Is there?' I went down Bond Street with them, and the other three went into the shop, and handed out to us a piece of cheese and bacon. We went down the opposite turning, and two policemen rushed out upon us from a gateway, and we dropped the bacon and cheese, and tried to get away, but they caught us, and took us back. "</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners repeated the above statements in their defences, Owen adding that the bacon was "shoved" on to him as the police caught him, Shipley adding that on a cry of "Stop thief" being raised, one of two porters caught hold of him, and the police took him instead of the man running.</hi>

I am an estate agent at 75, Upper Grange Road—on 12th June I was in the Osca Arms with a client, when the defendant instructed me to seize a pony for which he signed this authority, "I authorise you to seize a pony belonging to Mr. Rolf, he not having paid the purchase money according to terms. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">SERGEANT</hi>"—I saw aim write that—I seized the pony upon this authority, and was afterwards</p>

               <p>charged with stealing it, committed and acquitted—I heard the defendant swear in Court that he gave me no authority, and he denied the signature—he was not sober when he signed it, and he was not sober at the police court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> 1 had been about two hours in the house talking about the pony—I had some bitter ale—my reason for this prosecution is to vindicate my character—I said at the police-court that I should not have taken these proceedings if he paid half my expenses at the police-court; I showed him a paper and he said it was not in his writing.</p>
