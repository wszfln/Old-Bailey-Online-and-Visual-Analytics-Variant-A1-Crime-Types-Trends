I am a lighterman in the employment of Mr. Spencer—on Tuesday, 25th October, I was at Brewer's-quay from twenty-minutes to half-past 8 in the morning—I noticed a van there—I took no particular notice of what sort of van it was; it was a four-wheeled van—I did not notice in what state it was, whether it was dirty or clean—it stood about ten yards from the barge, <hi rend="italic">Barber</hi>—there were some casks on the ground, five or six; they might be three or four feet from the van—I saw two men with the van—to the best of my belief one was Taylor, and the other a man called <hi rend="italic">Bobby Oddleggs</hi>—I knew him by sight; he was not employed by Mr. Spencer; I believe he is a carman—I afterwards went to the premises of Messrs. Best and Sons, in Henrietta-street, Cavendish-square, and saw a van there—I cannot say whether that was the van that I had seen on the Tuesday morning, at the wharf—it was a four-wheeled van—when I went to Messrs. Best's premises, I tried the height of the van with regard to my dress; I thought it corresponded too high with the one I saw in the quay—when I was at the wharf on this Tuesday morning I should have caught my dress against this van if I had not moved on one side—I did not catch it—it was in consequence of that I tried the height of the van when I saw it at Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a traveller in the employment of Messrs. Moses, Brothers, 57, Leadenhall-street, bristle merchants—I have known Taylor for some time as the foreman of Mr. Priestley, who used to do our work, and does now—I know a person of the name of Richardson—he called at our premises on Wednesday, October 26th—I did not see him when he called, but he had left two samples of bristles—I saw him afterwards on that day—he left this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he represented himself by this card to be the traveller of Mr. Nicks—I do not know whether the card was afterwards given to Mr. Thorold—when I saw Richardson he produced two samples of bristles, which had been left some little time previous—he took those samples away with him—we asked him to leave them, but he would not—they were tied up with bark—they were tied up similar to this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with the exception that the bark was on instead of having slipped off—the bark was perfect round the bottom—it goes round the bottom—both these bindings were bark—it was twisted bark at the bottom—the samples of bristles that Richardson had, were Mammontoff bristles—they come from St. Petersburg—the German bristles are tied with string, not with bark; that is the generality of them—the Polish are tied with bark; they are sometimes classed with the German—their value depends entirely on the quality of the bristles—the Russian will fetch the highest price; the best sort—this description of bristle, the same as the samples that Richardson had, would be more readily saleable with bark on than with string—being tied with string would deteriorate them from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cwt. in the sale—Edwards did not come and see the casks in my presence—according to what we have given, the price of the white bristles would be about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cwt.—the others, the grey, are worth from 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are what I mean by grey—the price of three cwt, would be 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—three cwt. of the grey at 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Moses and Son, of Leadenhall-street—on 27th October, in consequence of information, I went to Nicks in Worship-street, and took this card with me—I asked ldm why his traveller had net been respecting the bristles he had offered us previously—he said, "Well, the fact is I had a better offer for them"—I told him he had offered the bristles to us, and he must stand by his bargain—he said that he thought his traveller was going to make a mess of it, and was going to cheat him in some way to make something by him—he mentioned Richardson as his traveller—I had not mentioned any name—I only said his traveller—he said that if we would give 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, more than we were going to give, we should have them in spite of his traveller—I was to go back to Messrs. Moses to see whether they would do so, and to hasten my coming back he would pay cab hire and give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself—this was between 1 and 2 o'clock—I went back, had a conversation with Messrs. Moses, went back to Nicks, and told him we should take them, but he ought to let us have them at the same price as his traveller's friend was to have them at—he said, "We cannot, because we are under obligations to him"—he did not tell me the name of the traveller's friend—I asked Nicks for a memorandum, and he gave me this contract—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October </hi>27<hi rend="italic">th, </hi>1859<hi rend="italic">, and signed by Nicks, stating the sale of the bristles at </hi>16<hi rend="italic">l. and </hi>22<hi rend="italic">l. net wish, and that they were to be fetched away within one hour, or the contract to be null and void</hi>)—I asked him why he wanted them away so quickly—he said that if we did not take them away, his traveller's friend would come and fetch them away, and we should not get them—I asked him for some samples which he had in his hand and which had bark round them—he said, "No, they must go with the bulk"—he offered to show me them up stairs, but I said I knew nothing about them—as I went out I saw two of his carts loading at the door, and said, "If you are in such a hurry to send them away, send your cart with them."—he said, "No, I always like parties to take them away themselves"—as I was leaving he said, "You will bring the money for them, of course?"—I said, "I cannot do that as I do not know the quantity"—he said. "Well then, you can bring a blank cheque"—I told him that Messrs. Moses would not allow me to fill up a blank cheque, but I would bring him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he said, "I will give you that which I promised you"—he said that it was the first transaction we had had, and he dare say it would not be the last—when I get to Messrs.

               <p>on me about noon, I think, and presented a card and a bundle of white and a bundle of grey bristles—they were tied up with bark, and I never saw any like them before—he afterwards left and took the samples with him—he returned again about 3 o'clock, or a little before, and in consequence of what he said I accompanied him to Nicks' premises in Worship-street—he went to the counting-house and brought Nicks out, and introduced him to me as having come to look at the bristles—Nicks requested me to go up stain and he would follow—I went up with Richardson to the first floor, and found a quantity of bristles arrauged in piles on the floor, tied up in bundles with bark, to the best of my recollection—a man and a girl were engaged in tying up some loose bristles in a small heap on the floor, which had broken—there were some loose barks with the bristles, but whether they tied them with bark or string I do not know—Nicks was in the room; he followed me up—either he or Richardson replied that the bristles had been packed in bags and some of them had become loose in carriage—I said, "That is a very unusual way of packing bristles, in bags"—he said that he suspected the parties who sent them to him were not accustomed to pack bristles—Nicks said that he had formerly sold bristles on his journeys; shoemakers' bristles, I think he said—they are the most expensive kind, and sometimes sell as high as 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound—the man and the girl handled them very badly, and I said, "It fidgets me to see them handle them in that way," and took a bundle up and tied it myself to show them how to tie them up—there were about three hundredweight of each kind of bristles in the room—Nicks then went down stairs; I followed him and asked him if he could not take some<lb/>thing less for the grey bristles—(Richardson had mentioned the price)—he said no, and that Messrs. Moses would take them at the price he asked—I agreed to take them at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per hundredweight for the grey, and 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the white, subject to 2 1/2 discount for cash, and an allowance of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for those which had been retied and which were loose in the room—he engaged to send them home either that afternoon or the next morning—I said that we closed at 5 o'clock, and he might send them before then or next day—I went there about 3 and left about a quarter of an hour afterwards—about half-past 10 next morning Richardson brought them in a cart with this invoice—(<hi rend="italic">This was made out in ilie name of T. J. Nicks, for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I gave Richardson a cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and crossed it "City Bank," as I understood from Richardson that that was Nicks' bank—the bristles were tied up with string, except one bundle, which was tied with bark like this—this weighs something less than one pound—on Monday, 31st October, one of our people opened some of the bundles, and some of these labels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found in some of those which had been retied; they were evidently accidentally tied up with the loose bristles; here is the name of Memantoff on it—the officers first came to our place, I think, on the Tuesday—Ray came first to make enquiries—I gave the officers the bristles either on Tuesday or Wednesday, and they took them all away.</p>

I said "No we have not, for we believe he has absconded"—I took him into custody—on the way to the station I cautioned him that whatever he said might be used in evidence against him—he said he had known Taylor for the last fifteen years—next day, as we were going to the Mansion House, he either said, "I would sooner have given 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than this should have happened,"or" I would sooner hare given 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than I should have been taken"—on 8th November this letter was received from Nicks at the police-station—I did not receive it or read it—in consequence of directions from Superintendant Evans, I went to Nicks's premises on the 8th—Taylor was then in custody—I did not see Nicks at hh premises that evening—I saw him on the morning of the 9th—Nicks said to me, "Oh you have got him."—I said "Who?"—he said "Taylor"—I said "Oh yes"—he said, "I wanted to give you a little information; where waa he taken; at Islington? as not he?" I said "Yes"—Nicks said, "Did he say anything?"—I said "That is a question I can't answer you,"—that was all that passed at that interview; he did not give me any information—when I went the second time, on the 9th, I did not take a letter with me.</p>

I was formerly an inspector of police—I am now in the service of the Mint—on 13th December I went to 16, Little Warner-street with inspector Briant and other constables, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I found the street door open—I went up to the first floor, forced the door open, went in the room and found the female prisoner sitting by a clear bright fire drawing her hand from a bag which hung by the fireplace; she put her left hand to the fire on which this iron spoon was placed with molten metal in it, and this <hi rend="italic">get</hi> was in it as it now appears—I seized her by the shoulder, and she said, "Oh Mr. Brannan"—I said, "Well Mr. Pomeroy, we have come to pay you a visit"—she said, "I have been driven to this by <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>; I never knew anything about this until he taught me; you knew me when I was a little girl, before I was married: he drove me and my little gifl to it, who is now in Colney Hatch, I never knew anything about it till he taught me"—at that time she called a little boy from an adjoining room and said to him, "Fetch. <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> from the beer shop over the way"—I then instructed a sergeant to go and take Pomeroy in custody—I searched the room, and in the bag alluded to I found a plaster of Paris mould for casting sixpences quite hot, and a piece on cloth forming a pad—on the table I found three counterfeit sixpences quite hot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the same table I found a galvanic battery jar containing a solution of acid, and a file with white metal in its teeth—I found a knife with plaster of Paris adhering to it, and this piece of glass in the cupboard with plaster of Paris adhering to it—this is the pad—it was rolled up for the purpose of holding a mould—it is impossible to hold it in the bare hand—I went to the cupboard and found a galvanic battery<lb/>plate, three pieces of copper wire which had been dipped in solution, some plaster of Paris in powder, two tins containing black composi<lb/>tion used to give the coin a dull appearance, and another bottle con<lb/>taining acid—while I was in the room Joseph Pomeroy was brought up</p>

I reside at 4, Douglas-place, Northampton-row, Clerk<lb/>en well, and am a sub-warder in the Middlesex House of Correction, Cold<lb/>bath-fields—on the morning of 9th December the prisoner was in the prison—I was on duty overlooking him and other prisoners cleaning; it was the middle flight of stairs of the second misdemeanour prison they were sweeping—they had done stoning, and had put the stones on the top of the staircase—they had all done except the prisoner; he was engaged in cleaning with the stones—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are similar to the stones used—they are used for rubbing the floors—this was about a quarter-past 11 in the morning—I desired the prisoner to stone the steps down, and, being very wet over night, they were very dirty, and he did them very badly—I was going down the stone steps, and saw they were not clean, and I desire him to do them over again—as I was walking down the stairs, I had got about two or three steps below the prisoner, I heard something fall; I looked towards where the other prisoners were employed, and asked them to be more careful, or they would hit me on the head—before I had scarcely got the words from my mouth I received a blow on the head which knocked me against the wall almost insen<lb/>sible, and the prisoner rushed on me, and hammered me, and violently used me, and kicked me about different parts of my body, which roused me again—I caught hold of the collar of his coat and waistcoat, and held him till the other prisoners came to my assistance—after they had got hold of him I went, down stairs and called to them to come down, so that I could get some</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, residing at 16, Loraine-place, Holloway—on 22d December, about half-past 1 o'clock in the day, I got into an Islington omnibus to go to the city—I sat on the third seat on the left hand side as you enter—I cannot say whether the prisoner was in the omnibus at the Angel, Islington, but she was there coming down the City-road—she was sitting on my left hand side—Mr. Hudson was sitting on the opposite side, and next the door—I remember the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> stopping at the canal in the City-road to admit a passenger—he took up his position on my right, between myself and another gentleman—upon that the prisoner got up and left the seat adjoining me, and went immediately opposite—there was a lady between the prisoner and Mr. Hudson then—the first thing that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020023"/>
               <p>attracted my attention was this woman moving from adjoining me, where there was only one person in the division, and going opposite where there was already two—she fidgetted about a great deal, and somewhere about Finsbury-square the omnibus stopped, and the lady sitting next her got out—the prisoner then moved up to Mr. Hudson's side—I noticed her throwing her left arm about her a good deal, drawing a large shawl about her, and in doing so she raised her shawl, and I noticed her right arm stretched across her own lap towards Mr. Hudson's side—the omnibus stopped at the Bank and a passenger there got out—while it was stopping Mr. Hudson's took a purse out of her pocket; on opening it I saw she looked very much surprised, passed her hand again into her pocket, and looked into her purse, and flushed in the face a good deal—I enquired if she had lost anything—she said she had lost all her money, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then taxed the prisoner with having taken it—she denied it—I told her to stand up, taking her by the shoulder, and when she got up 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. fell from her lap into the omnibus—a gentleman sitting on my right gathered it up, among the straw, and searched, but 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was all he could find—I requested the conductor to stop when he saw a policeman, and call him, and I would give the woman in charge—the prisoner stated that the money must all be there; that Mr. Hudson must have dropped it herself, and immediately began searching among the straw—she picked up a shilling here and another there, which I presumed she dropped, for they were not there before—8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 98). On Wednesday evening, 14th December, I went with another constable to 5, Wilson's-place, Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields—I saw a man in the passage, who gave a signal, by knocking on the wainscoting with his hand—I seized him by the collar and shoved him into the street—I then looked through the key-hole of the front room, ground-floor, and saw Simpkins standing by a table which had a plate on it, in which I could plainly see some half-crowns—he was turning them over, and Joyce was by his side with a ladle in his hand containing hot metal—I forced open the door, and, on Simpkins seeing me, he threw some<lb/>thing down which looked like plaster of Paris—it appeared to be a mould—he stamped on it—I seized him by the collar—the other policeman rushed to the plate, and got five half crowns out of it, but dropped these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the ground—I picked them up—Simpkins succeeded in struggling to the plate, and got all the half-crowns that remained in the plate, and threw them into the fire—I saw them fall through the grate, and picked up this metal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of the ashes—he then threw this little phial on the fire, con<lb/>taining liquid of some sort, which was spilt, and I picked the bottle out—we secured the prisoners, searched and found two files with metal in the teeth, two phials, some plaster of Paris, a saucer of sand, and some pieces of a mould—I picked up these two unfinished half-crowns—the landlord locked up the rooms, and we took the prisoners to the station—on the way, Simpkins said, "Jim, we are <hi rend="italic">cocked to rights</hi> this time"—nothing was found on them—I went to the room again next day—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint—these five half-crowns are counterfeit, and from one mould—here are some pieces of plaster of Paris which may have formed part of a mould, but there are no marks on them by which I can say for certain—these half-crowns have been made from a mould; and, supposing the metal from which they were made to be hot, the mould must have existed two minutes before—it could not be longer—these are made of precisely the same metal as this in the ladle—it is Britannia metal, or melted pewter pots—I have sufficient experience to know from the touch that it is the same—here are two files which are used for the purpose of making the milling, and some sand which is used to clean them before they put the extra coating on to blacken or discolour them—this ladle is used for melting the metal—this piece of metal fits into the bottom of it, and must have come out of it—I have looked carefully at these coins—I have examined and found that they are all from one mould—here is one little peculiarity in the "r" of Georgius, a small mark or indentation—they all have that peculiarity—here is a little box containing two fragments of a mould for half-crowns—the larger fragment merely represents part of a letter, and the edging of the coin—the smaller piece has the letter "r" on it; and under the lower limb of the "r" is the same mark which is on all the half-crowns—that informs me that these two fragments must have been part of a mould for a half-crown—no other coin than a half-crown of George the Third has such a letter of this size.</p>

               <p>furnished at Mr. Hughes's desire—I think both Mr. Hughes and Mr. Palmer used these offices afterwards, but I understood in the first instance that that was to be separate for Mr. Palmer's use—on going there I occasionally found both there—I cannot say whether any portion of this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Mr. Hughes' writing—I saw Mr. Hughes before he left this country, two or three days previous to the 30th June—I first heard that he had left, when I received a circular, on a Friday after 20th July—in consequence of the receipt of that circular I went down to his office—it was not closed, but there was a notice outside on the door, on some plate, directing his parcels and letters to be taken to College-hill, to Black and Snow—independent of the trade debt there was 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me from Hughes, and there was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not money that I had entrusted to him to invest—it was, more properly speaking, money on call, that I might have when<lb/>ever I chose to call for it—the 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was money entrusted to him to invest, and which I am a loser of, with the deeds—I think there was only 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I let him have on call—when I went to the office I saw Mr. Haines; he referred me to Messrs. Black and Snow, where I went—I saw Mr. Snow—I got no money—I did not learn from them where the bankrupt was gone to—I asked him if he would look at my deeds—I did not learn where the prisoner was, or where he had gone to—I enquired, and was told he was gone away for the benefit of his health.</p>

               <p>would give mo security two or three times the value of my advances—it was not understood between us that he was to be the borrower of these two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he should give me security upon the estates—he did not say what he should give me—it was not understood between us that he should have the loan of these two sums, and give me security—I did not know what security would come to me until it came—I did not know that he was going to have the money, and to use it himself—I did not inquire when this account was sent in, upon what security these sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been invested, not even when I saw Dalston written here—I had such implicit confidence in my own solicitor that I considered any deeds that he sent me were perfectly correct—I had not got any deeds in August, 1856, in respect of these last two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not inquire at all what this "In hand, Dalston" meant—of course I saw that the interest was being paid upon them from the respective periods when I advanced them to him—I did afterwards have handed over to me some deeds, which professed to be securities—you have the deeds there—you can look at them—he sent me those deeds as security for my money—he was my confidential solicitor—I cannot tell you upon what day I got these deeds—I believe it was somewhere in October, 1856—after October, 1856, I felt perfectly satisfied that my 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was safe—I did not know that Mr. Hughes was himself the borrower of the money at that time—I did not know that my money was outstanding and that he was paying me interest upon it as a loan to himself—I never knew it—I believed these deeds were security for my money—I did not consider Mr. Hughes was the borrower—I considered that he, as my solicitor, found me sound security—the last advance I made to him before March, 1856, I believe was in 1854—that was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Perryman—that was a specific loan to Perryman—the sum before that I believe was two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person of the name of Cheatle—I be<lb/>lieve that was in 1852—when he sent me the deeds I considered that it was a specific loan to Cheatle—I advanced these two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 15th and 23d November, 18541 believe—I don't know when I got the deeds—I can't tell how soon after that I learnt that Cheatle had got the money—I never inquired whether he had got the money—Mr. Hughes did not tell me that he wanted the second 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up Cheatle's loan of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he wanted 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and these two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. made the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Cheatle's name was not mentioned to me as the person who wanted the money—it waa mentioned to me when I saw the deeds—here is the application for it—the whole of this is in the prisoner's handwriting—this is the application upon which I lent the two sums of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "9th November, 1852.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you entrusted these monies to Mr. Hughes as your solicitor; did you know the defendant as a scrivener or as a solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard a little about it lately, and I know a little more about it than I wish to know—I heard nothing about it till I heard it discussed under the bankruptcy—I was not aware that Mr. Cheatle was the person proposed: that was left entirely to Mr. Hughes—in 1856, he owed me, I think, 4,445<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was 4,440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—those were the names or as<lb/>sumed names of persons from whom the money was supposed to be due—I received from him in 1856 a bundle of securities—I do not know the precise date—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—this deed does not state from whom the mortgage was, or to whom—I do not know that I took the trouble to open the deed and read it or see from whom the mortgage was—I believe I read a portion of Trist and Lucas' deeds, because I knew the individual who had them before me—this purports to be a mortgage by Hughes—I never got from him any securities for the 4,450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except this bundle of deeds, and I have never been able to realize a single sixpence upon them—I first heard that he had gone to Melbourne about a fortnight after the 24th of July—I cannot say to a few days—I do not think it came out at the same time how he had gone—there were so many rumours at the time that we hardly knew what to believe.</p>

With respect to the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which mortgage is being taken by Miss Yeates, I received instructions from Mr. Hambridge to make the proposal to her, and she having assented to it, the same was forthwith prepared, and as the legacy is due to Miss Yeates I can hardly suppose that Mr. Hambridge would wish to alter an arrangement which he himself first proposed, and which indeed cannot now be changed. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, David Hughes"—on 10th November, 1855, we received 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner—I recollect seeing him in July, 1855—I cannot pretend to say exactly what he said, but he explained the style in which he did business—he said, "I receive monies and I give security; I can give you this security, "taking one out of his safe;" or I can give you another security, at another place"—I also objected to the mode in which his bill of costs was made out; he had not specified the items—he called his clerk to bring in a large book, and explained to me the nature of his en<lb/>tries there; attendance from such a date to such a date, so many guineas—he</p>

I believe—I applied for that money and got it—I made application, I think, 12 months before I got it, and was put off by various excuses—I saw Hughes upon it myself—when I applied for the money, he said that I could not have it without giving six months notice—I gave the six months notice—he did not, at that time, say anything about re-investiug it for me—the note was returned to me as money in hand—I was dissatisfied with that, and required the money—I did not get it at the end of the first six months: I communicated with him again, and insisted upon having the money, and ultimately I got the money—besides these transactions the prisoner has made applications to me to advance money.</p>

That is correct—I took him into custody on 7th June.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury; in order to establish the offence charged, it was necessary to prove, first, that the prisoner was a trader; secondly, that he had committed an act of bankruptcy; and, thirdly, that there was a good petitioning creditors debt; admitting that there was evidence as to the two last named points, he contended that the first was nega<lb/>tived; that so far from any trading as a scrivener being made out, the evidence established merely the ordinary relations of solicitor and client; he referred to a dictum of</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE GIBBS</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">proceeded to take several objections upon the proceedings in bank<lb/>ruptcy; first, as to the petition, upon which the adjudication was founded; the petition described the bankrupt's residence as at 13, Gresham-street, which was in fact only his place of business, and therefore not strictly speaking hit residence: secondly, as to the advertisement in the Gazette; by the 104 section it was directed that such advertisement should clearly appear to be by the authority of the Bankruptcy Court; in the present case no such proof appeared; neither did the advertisement contain the appointment of the two days limited for the surrender of the bankrupt, which the 104 section seemed to require; it did not set forth the adjudication, or any particulars, but merely stated that he had been "declared" a bankrupt, a term, not to be found in the statute at all: thirdly, as to the summons; that was a summons to surrender, not to the Court, but to Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, on certain days, and by the evidence it appeared that that Commissioner was not in attendance on those occanons, so that the bankrupt could not possibly have complied with that summons;</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020055"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">he further contended that the non-surrender must be proved to be wilful; it was not enough to show that he had committed an act of bankruptcy by leaving this country, and so delaying his creditors; the case of Blake v. Lee, Ambler's Reports, 307, clearly shewed that the non-surrender must be a wilful one; all that the evidence disclosed here was a temporary pressure; there was no threat of bankruptcy before the prisoner quitted this country, nor any evidence of any intimation to that effect, but the steps taken were after he was on his way to Australia, when it was physically impossible that he could have any knowledge on the subject.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the assistant curate of the parish church of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—it is my duty to enter the marriages in the register book—this is the register which I now have before me—on the 11th of September, 1859, there is an entry of a marriage between Louis Gashion and Alice Betts—I celebrated that marriage—when the parties came into the vestry I asked them first of all their names, taking the boy first—he said his name was Louis Gashion and that he was 18 years of age—as is usual when persons are under age, I asked whether he had got any parents—he said they were both dead—I asked whether he had not an uncle or guardian—he said he had—I said that he must give his consent to the marriage, or else I should not marry them—we never many persona under age unless we have the consent of their guardians—upon my saying this, the prisoner presented himself—I think I told the clerk to call him in—he was outside the door—I first of all asked him what his name was—he said "William Gashion"—I said "Louis Gashion says that he has no father or mother, and that you are his natural guardian"—he said "I am," or "Yes"—upon that I said "Do you give your consent to this marriage between Louis Gaahion and Alice Betts?"—he said "Yes;" upon which I said "Are you not foolish in allowing such children to marry?"—he said there were particular circumstances in the case—as the girl was under age I said that her father must be present to give his consent—the prisoner then went out of the church to find the father of the girl—he brought him back with him and the parties were then married—my scruples were not removed; but I was obliged to marry them, the legal objection being removed—it is the custom to make all the entries in the egister, except the signatures, before the the marriage takes place, before the commencement of the ceremony, in one of the books, we keep two—we enter all the particulars of the marriage—the book before me is what is technically called the register—I made all the entries in respect of this marriage, except the signatures, in one of the books before the ceremony—I cannot say whether this is the book, I am not sure—the false entry would be in both books—this</p>

Signed, Louis Gashion, Alice Betts, William Gashion, uncle to the man, Thomas Betts and Eliza Betts.")—the name "William Gasbion" is in the prisoner's writing, the words "uncle to the man," are in mine—I derived the information which caused me to make the entry, from the prisoner and also from Louis Gashion—after the marriage Louis Gashion, Alice Betts, Thomas Betts and Eliza Betts came into the vestry and signed the register in the usual course—as the prisoner had professed to be the uncle or guardian of the youth I in<lb/>sisted on his coming into the vestry and signing the register likewise—I called out rather loudly "William Gashion, you must come in and sign the register," and I pointed out to him the usual place for the witnesses to sign—I had not then written the words "uncle to the man"—I did not write those words until the Wednesday following—I should not have written those words unless he had said he was uncle to the man—I wrote them because I believed the statement he had made.</p>

               <p>to the time that they were married I had not seen my mother, or father, or sister, or Louis Gashion, and on the Saturday, a week previous to the marriage, I heard through an aunt of mine that my sister was in the family way, and that young Louis Gashion was turned out of his brother's house, and my sister had gone ostensibly to another situation, but my mother went and inquired, and found she was not there. From subsequent inquiries they found that they were living together as man and wife, in firnished lodgings. My mother and father attempted to separate them. They quarrelled in the street, and Louis attempted to strike my father. The banns were published unknown to me a fortnight. I ran after Louis the length of the street, to inflict some personal chastisement for the injury he had done my sister, but he ran away. I saw nothing more of him till the Friday when they were to be married on the Saturday. My mother came and said, "Well, William, your sister is in the family way, so that they will be together, and they will be married on Saturday; your father is going, and he is so angry that unless there is somebody to represent then they will not be married; your sister is in that state that if you do not go they will have to pay somebody, and they are very poor." I consented afier a little while; I wanted nothing from them, I was earning thirty shilling! a week. I went and did it with an amiable intent, but I have done wrong, I know. I provided them with some food on the day they were married. He said, "I have an uncle living in the lane," meaning Petticoat-lane, "who has no objection to my getting married; he has supplied me with the money, but being a Jew, he will not go to church with me." I thought the difference of creed was the reason. He never promised me a halfpenny; he is in attendance now and you can examine him. I allowed them a trifle a week and did not see them till after I was taken, and I am keeping them at this present moment; that is all I know of the matter; I must leave it entirely in your hands. My mother is in attendance. I should like your Lordship to understand that I had no conception of the law connected with the case when I signed the book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Sir Samuel Morton Peto and others, at Prince Regent's wharf, West Ham—on 13th December we had a gas-pipe lying on that wharf which is in the occupation of the prosecutors—I saw the gas-pipe that morning about 10 o'clock—it was one entire pipe, about nine feet long—I missed it about half-past 4 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners that day about half-past 1 o'clock—they were coming in the direction from the Prince Regent wharf together—they each of them had a bag on his back—I followed them as far as the white gates—they went through a little distance to Eagle-street and put their bags down and rested—the bags were not so large as sacks—they appeared to have some<lb/>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186001020062"/>
               <p>heavy in them—after Jones set his bag down and rested he went away from the bag—he had seen me passing—when I saw he was gone I called the police—I gave Harris in charge, and a minute or two after I saw Jones coming back in that direction—on his coming back Heythom asked him if that bag belonged to him—he said it did, and on his saying that I gave him in charge likewise—Harris said, what did I know about the iron; that iron came off the marshes; that they bought it of two navvies.</p>

Peto aud Co. have had that wharf in their occupation for seven years—I don't know that it ia their private property; it is in their occupation—when I first saw the prisoners they were about half a mile from the wharf, as near as I could guess—it was from a quarter to half-past 1 o'clock—our men come from their dinner and commence work at 1 o'clock we had but very few men at work at that time—some of them come that way to our place when we have them at work—the prisoners were coming in a direction from the wharf—I was at the entrance of the dock, and the place I saw them at was between the place where I stood and the wharf—they came towards me from the wharf in the public highway—I did not ask Harris whose bag it was—I did not hear him asked that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper to Messrs Peto and Co. on their works—on that morning I had to go down to the saw mills near the Prince Regent wharf, in the occupation of Messrs Peto and Co.—I think they have used it for five years—as I was returning from there I saw the two prisoners with something on their backs; it looked like something very heavy in two bags—they were walking from the Princo Regent wharf—I and Lewis followed them, and overtook them just through the white gates in Eagle-street—they had just put the two bags down just at the entrance of Eagle-street—Harris way given in custody; Jones had left—I went through the street and met Jones who was coming back towards the bag—I took hold of him, and he walked back with me to the place where the bag was left—I said to him, "Is this bag your's?"—he said, "Yes"—he was given in custody—the pipe that was in both the bags was broken in pieces—I examined the pieces of pipe; they belonged to Sir Morton Peto and Company.</p>

               <p>direction from Prince Regent wharf; they had two bags with them—I was afterwards called by Lewis—the prisoner Harris was there, and the two bags were lying on the ground near Harris—I asked him what he had got there, he said "Some pieces of iron—I asked where he got it; he said, "We bought it from two navvies who came over in a boat from the mud-ship—I took both the prisoners in custody—I assisted in putting the pieces of this iron together—there were 2121bs, in all—these are the two ends of it—I took the prisoner's boots off, and went to the wharf and compared the boots with marks I saw there—the number of nails in the boots exactly corresponded with the marks—I made a comparison with the foot marks coming from the wharf—my opinion is that those boots made the impressions in the ground—I have not the boots here; the prisoners have got them—I made the comparison of the length and the width, and the number of nails—there were some tops of nails worn off in Jones' boots—there were no toe pieces—the marks corresponded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I went with the policeman to compare the boots with the footmarks, as nearly as we could do it; and, in my opinion, the impressions in the ground were made by these boots—the iron pipe was whole when I saw it last on the wharf—there was no hammer found on the prisoners or near the spot, but in a place in the reed bed, there was a large granite stone, and it had some rust upon it, and some smaller stoues; and there was a hole in the ground where they had dipped the iron in with their hands so as to make it all over mud—the pipe was wet and muddy all over when I found it in the bags.</p>

               <p>and there were marks of a person lying down on the sofa—I saw the prisoner on the Sunday morning; she was coming to the house—I asked her why she did not come in the front way, instead of coming the back way when she come home on Wednesday night, and I told her I believed she had robbed me of some shirts and a sheet—she said, "I have taken the sheet and shirts to iron"—I told her I did not think she had taken them to iron, at my wife never gave out anything to be ironed by her—she went out in the back yard and tried to get away—I said to her, "Don't tear the pawn<lb/>tickets up if you have pawned the things"—she said, "I have not pawned them; and if you will let the matter drop I will take you to Woolwich to the woman's where I left them, and will get them for you"—I said, "It is very cruel of you, and I will give you in charge"—I gave her in charge and I and the policeman went to the place where she said they were, and found the five shirts—they were lying in the room at the foot of the bed—they were rough dried, ready to iron—they had been starched when they were on the sofa ready for my wife to iron—the prisoner used to come to work on Wednesday, and she left on Thursday and went to Woolwich—she had lived entirely with us—she got work elsewhere but usually returned to us on Wednesday night—I did not see her on that Wednesday night at my house; she got in at the back, and the window was left open at the back—the boy got in at the window and unbuttoned it.</p>

On 16th December, in the morn<lb/>ing, I was on duty in the Brixton-road, about half-past 12 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners in company with a third man—they came out of the Loughborough-road into the Brixton-road—not liking their appearance, I watched them—they went some distance up the Brixton-road, then crossed into a dark place—they stood there for some few minutes—one left the others and crossed over to the front of Pickford-place, opposite a gentleman's house—they stood there about a minute and a half, then passed over again to the others—in consequence of what I observed I took them into custody—after I had taken them into custody, and we had got within about 200 yards of the station, Welsdon struck me on the side of the head—he said "You b—I will go no farther with you," and tried to escape—finding he could not get away, he struck me two or three times—I was obliged to release the other prisoner, the third man, and he ran away—we then took the prisoners to the station—upon Wood I found this pair of gloves and this box of silent matches—after the charge was taken I went to the place where they commenced running and I found this candle thrown away—as they were running away, I saw Wood throw out his awn, as if to throw something away; I noticed the place—when it got daylight I went there and in the garden in front of a gentleman's house, I found this chisel—Wood wished very much to have the gloves returned to him again—he asked me for them two or three times—I had not been to Mr. Smith's premise, or noticed any footsteps there.</p>

On the morning of the 16th the prisoners were brought to me at the station—I took the charge, and after they were locked up in the cell, I took the two pairs of boots from the prisoners, and after it got daylight, by directions from the inspector, I went to the footmarks where they had attempted a robbery, next to Mr. Smith's, and I found these two boots correspond with the footmarks at 31, Barrington-road—that was at the back of Mr. Smith's house—I saw the footmarks made on the night of 6th December, on the morning of the 7th—I was the first that was there and saw them after the robbery, the inspector followed after me and he covered them over—the weather had been frosty during that time—I compared this pair of boots which I took from Welsdon; there is apecularity about these boots; the right boot is very remarkable, it is worn iu the sole, and it left an impression in the earth—it is much higher on one side, and that left an impression—the grouud was very soft at the time—the marks exactly corresponded with the shoes—there were other footmarks, but not sufficient proof as to Wood's—I saw the gloves found on Wood—he asked for them back two or three times, and I directed the constable to de<lb/>tain them.</p>
