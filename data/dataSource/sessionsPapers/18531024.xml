On 26tb Sept., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on my way home—I had been drinking—several persons accosted me on my way home—I met two females in Maiden-lane, they asked me to go home with them, which I declined—I am not able to say who they were—they forced me down on my back, put their hands over my mouth, and some male person came up to rob me—they broke the ring and glass of my watch, and I lost my silver guard, and a steel chain intermingled with gold, about three inches long—I held my watch tight in my pocket—I kicked, and called, "Police!" the police came and took them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Brooke, poultry salesmen, of Leadenhall-market. On 4th Oct. Nash came to me—in consequence of what he said I went with him into Philpot-lane, and saw the prisoner with the cheese—I went up to him and said, "Halloo! where did you get this? this belongs to us"—he said, "I did not take it; I was paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for carrying it"—the cheese belongs to Messrs. Brooke—I know it by a piece being knocked out of it in a peculiar way, and Mr. Brooke had complained of it in the morning—it appears to have been scooped out with a cheese iron—that enabled roe to recognise it immediately—I sent one of the boys for an officer, and held the prisoner till he came—it was taken from a cart which was in the course of being loaded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Billow Queen</hi>, bound for Genoa. Last Thursday I was going along Whitechapel, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the day—Pedderson came up to me and asked me what ship J belonged to—I said I belonged to none—I had come home a fortnight ago from the Black Sea and was then going to see my steward—he said he was going as steward of a ship bound for Australia, which was shipping her hands, and if I went with him he would go on board and have a glass of ale with me—I said I would, and we went to a public house in Black Lion-yard, White-chapel-road, and sat down in the parlour—he called for two glasses of ale, and while we were drinking it, two men came in dressed as hawkers, in velvet coats, plaid shawls over their breasts, and oil-skin leggings—they said they belonged to Sheffield—the prisoner Jones then came in, and presented a memorandum-book for sale for me to Pedderson, who said it was not worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would not give it to him—Jones then offered me a black leather purse for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not buy it, I said I was not in want of it—Jones had not hawker's box, he produced the things from his pocket; he took three cards from his pocket, and said if we had no objection to playing he would have a game with us for two sovereigns or three sovereigns, as we liked—the game, was, to put the money on the cards, and if you said "black," and it was on a black card, you got the money—Pedderson put some money on, and I put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other men put 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put my finger <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the card so as they should not move it from me—there were several games, and I lost 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240009"/>
               <p>I did not win any of the games—Pedderson saw me take half a crown from my pocket-book, and he put his hand in my pocket and took my pocket-book—I took him by the collar; he tripped my heels, flung me on my back, and made his escape—the other persons heard me say what I had lost; they were very sorry for it, and offered to go in search of him with me—they pretended to go to look for him, but when they got to the door one went in one direction tad one in another, and I never saw any more of him—when Jones got to the door, he said he would go up this street, as he was better acquainted with London than I was—I do not know what street that was—Jones was standing at the table with the cards when Pedderson took the pocket-book—Jones could see my book taken—he made no attempt to stop Pedderson when he went out with my pocket-book—next day, Friday, I saw all four of the men in White-chapel-road, standing talking together at the public house—I was going towards them—Pedderson cast his eyes on me, and ran away—I went for the police, and Jones walked down Cannon-street-road—I did not see them again that day, but on Saturday afternoon, at 8 o'clock, I was in Ratcliff-highway, and saw Pedderson standing at the Old Rose; 1 had Robert Williams, a ship mate, with me, and sent him for a constable—I went up to Pedderson, shook hands with him, and asked him if he knew me; he said, "Yes, I have seenyoubefore"—the police then came, and I gave him in charge, and said in hit presence that it was for stealing four sovereigns, a half sovereign, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, a written character which I had from my last ship, and a pocket-book—he said nothing—I have never seen the pocket-book, the money, or the character paper since;—when we were at the public house, Pedderson staked a sovereign on the cards—he won eight times, I believe—I saw him paid—Jones paid him—there was one sovereign left on the table; I looked at it, and saw that it was a medal and not a sovereign—that was when I got up from the floor, after Pedderson had taken my pocket-book—I saw the money lying on the card, it was yellow money—I did not take it in my hand—it had Britannia on it—I only saw one side—I have seen a medal produced by the constable, it was not a sovereign—I paid the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which I lost—Robert Williams is not here, he has sailed in the ship—Jones is in a different dress now, but Pedderson has the same clothes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of my cousin, William Thomas Fairy, of the Ram Inn, Smithfield—he is also a batcher by trade—the prisoner was in his employment. On 22nd Sept., I received directions from Mr. Fairy to go with the prisoner to deliver the fat—he was to deliver it at Mr. Snowden's, in Elm-street, Gray's Inn-lane, and Mr. Knight's, in Old Gravel-lane, Wappiug—we had five sacks of fat to deliver—we delivered one at Mr. Snowden's, and four at Mr. Knight's—there was then one piece more, not a full sack, only a piece of a sack—I cannot say how that came into the cart—I did not see it when we started, not till the other sacks were removed—it was underneath the others—I could see the other five sacks—I did not always go with the prisoner—after we had delivered all the fat except the piece and one other, we drove to I rongate-wharf—a boy named John Fairhead was with us—I and the boy left the cart, and went into the wharf, leaving the prisoner behind—we had then delivered all the fat except one sack and the part of a sack—the full sack ought to have been delivered at Mr. Snowden's—I had not been in the wharf two minutes when the boy came running in after me—in consequence of what he said I went out, and found the cart was gone—I ran after it, and stopped it in Whitechapel—I got into it, and asked the prisoner to go back—lie said he would not—I asked what he drove away for—he said, what was that to do with me—I eventually took charge of the horse and cart, and went home with him—I then got out of the cart, and he wanted to throw the part of the sack out of the cart—I told him I would not let him, I would put it into the office till Mr. Fairy came—the prisoner said I wanted it myself—I locked it in the office, and when Mr. Fairy returned I communicated it to him, and gave him the key of the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Israel Smith, a butcher; the last wit<lb/>ness serves in the shop. I was there on 4th Oct., when he sold some suet and a liver; to the best of my knowledge it was to the female prisoner—I saw him come away from her with a shilling, which he gave into my hand—I thought it was bad—I bent it—I came and gave it back into her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the shop on Tuesday, 4th Oct., between 11 and 12 o'clock; I saw the female prisoner in the shop. I saw my wife give a shilling back into her band—I looked at it, and said it was very bad—I gave it back to the female prisoner, and she left the shop—when she left I taw a man standing opposite—I could not swear it was the male prisoner, but the female crossed over the road to him—I went to the corner, and there she was talking to him, and she passed something to him, but what it was I could not say—they then walked on up Chiswell-street—I followed them—when they got to the corner of Milton-street, I saw the female standing against a linen-draper's window, opposite the Paul public house—I lost sight of the man for I moment—after that I saw the man come and join her, and they went into he Paul public house—I went into the house in the course of a minute, and found them both there—no one else was there but the street keeper, who stood inside the door—I said something to the barman about bad money, but I do not know what—I said, "The woman has been in my shop and offered a bad shilling"—the barman said he had bent a shilling that the male pri<lb/>soner gave him, and he had given it back to him—I said, "Was it bent before? I should know the one my wife bent"—the female prisoner said she was sure she did not know it was a bad one when she came into my shop, and that she had thrown away the one that my wife bad bent.</p>

               <p>Oct. I saw both the prisoners come in together, between 11 and 12 o'clock I think—Allen asked for half a quartern of rum—I served them, and he paid me with a shilling—I bent ft with my teeth, and found it was bad—I told him it was bad, and he told the woman she must have taken it—she said, "No, you must have taken it"—the woman then gave me a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieco—I returned the shilling to the man on the counter, and the woman took it up—I saw the last witness and the street-keeper soon afterwards; one of then asked if the prisoner had passed bad money—I said, "Yes"—soon after<lb/>wards my master came in, and he sent for a constable; the constable searched Allen, and found the shilling that I had bent on him—I know it, as the mark of my teeth was on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the White Swan. On the night of 17th Sept. Wood came for some porter—he gave me a shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change, and put the shilling into the till—in a short time after<lb/>wards he came again, and my barmaid served him half a quartern of gin—he gave her a shilling—she drew my attention to it as being bad—I examined it, and found it was bad—I marked it—the barmaid then went to the till, and took a shilling from the till and showed it to me; it was a bad one—I examined the till afterwards myself; there was no other shilling in the till—I gave the two bad shillings to the officer, and the prisoners were given into custody—I should say that no one had been to the till between the time the first shilling was given and the last—hardly two or three minutes bad elapsed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of letter carriers in the London district, stationed at Charing-cross Branch office. The prisoner was a letter carrier in the employment of the post-office there—I was there on 15th Oct.; he was on duty that day—a few minutes after 12 o'clock he was employed in sorting letters for delivery—he was standing at a sorting table for that purpose, taking the letters in his left hand, and placing them in pigeon-holes, according to the different walks—for some reason I thought it right to watch him—the chief inspector, Mr. Edwards, was at the farther end of the office, at a raised desk, looking down the sorting table—it is my duty, while the letters are sorted, to walk backwards and forwards, to see that the sorting is carried on properly—I was about two feet from the prisoner, behind him, so that he did not see me—while I was so stationed I observed him put his letters in the usual course in sorting them—the usual course is to take them up in handfuls in his left hand, and with his right hand sort them into the boxes—I observed him come to a small letter, and with his finger and thumb press it and bend it, so as to ascertain whether it contained anything, and then place it underneath the letters that he had in his hand—he then lowered his hand with the other letters, and placed a few more on the top with his right hand—he had five or six letters in his hand, with the one underneath—he then leaned forward, took his pocket handkerchief out of his pocket, looking intently at the inspector at the desk, then dropped his handkerchief down, wrapped it round the single letter, and placed it in his coat pocket behind—I then drew a few paces back, keeping him in sight, and waited until the sorting was completed, and the prisoner gone to his proper seat—I immediately made the senior inspector acquainted with what I had seen, and he came with me to the prisoner's seat—I said to him, in the prisoner's hearing, "This man I saw secrete a letter in his pocket handkerchief, and place it in his pocket"—the prisoner was sitting on his seat with both hands behind him, looking up at us, and when I taxed him he drew the letter out with one hand, and the handkerchief in the other—it was a small letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I immediately placed my hand on the letter, and said, "This is the letter"—he said he had not had the letter—I said, "I will swear I saw you take it from behind your coat"—I took it up, and asked the senior inspector if it belonged to the prisoner's walk—he said, "No, it did not"—I took possession of it, and proceeded to search the</p>

               <p>prisoner—he bad two letters in one of his coat pockets, which had not been posted, and a third letter in his side pocket addressed to himself, and a pocket-book—he was then taken to the Chief Office, and given into custody—I opened the letter before the Magistrate—it contained a half sovereign, stuck in this card—I can, by pressing the cover with my finger, feel that there is an enclo<lb/>sure—it bears the 12 o'clock post mark of the 15th, and is addressed to Mr. Ellery, No. 5, Lower Crown-street, King-street, Westminster—that would come to the office at Charing-cross in the usual course.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). My Lord and Gentlemen,—Being upwards of 250 miles from home, without any relations or friends in London, and being unable, through want of pecuniary means, to obtain Counsel to defend me, I trust I may not be deemed impertinent in addressing these remarks to you, in answer to the offence with which I now stand charged. During the two years and a half I have been employed as a letter-carrier, I have been but two days absent from my duty; neither have I ever been reported, either for insobriety or any delay as to the delivery of any letter that may have passed through my hands. Respecting the letter now in question, I beg to repeat what I stated before the Magistrate on the day of examination, that I bad no intention to purloin any letter, and that the letter I placed in my pocket was the one directed to myself. I am married, and have a daughter eleven years of age. This is the first time that either myself or any of my family ever stood before a Magistrate, much less a large tribunal like this; and should it please God, through his goodness, to restore me to my family, I shall do all in my power to regain my character by a steady honest life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of Letter-carriers, at the Branch Office at Pimlico. The prisoner was employed there as a letter-carrier—about the 1st of this month I had reasons for paying particular attention to the prisoner's conduct—on that Saturday morning a cash letter arrived from the Chief office—this is it; it is addressed, "Miss Jane Manning, No. 25, Wilton-terrace, Wilton-road, Pimlico"—it contains money—I placed that letter in the prisoner's desk for the purpose of its passing through his hands—it would not be his duty to deliver it; it would not be in his walk—it would be his duty to sort it to the Pimlico walk—his walk was Vincent-square—he was then engaged in dividing the letters on the Vincent-square walk, between hit own ground and his partner's ground—after he had done that, I looked among the letters which were sorted for the Pimlico carrier, and did not find this letter amongst them—the prisoner then left, carrying out with him the letters of his own walk tied in a bundle—I followed him, and brought him back to the office—I told him I had missed a letter addressed to "Miss Jane Manning, No. 25, Wilton-terrace, Wilton-road, Pimlico," and asked him if he had seen such a letter; he said he had not—the other letter carriers were present—two or three may have gone out, but the majority of them were there—I desired them all to put their letters down, and to stand away from the desk; they did so—I took the prisoner's letters from his hand, and put them down—I examined them; I did not at first find this letter—I then asked him if lie had any letters about him—he put his hand into his side coat pocket, and pulled out one letter (not this one)—I asked if he had any more; he said he had not—I then proceeded to search him, and I found one letter in his back coat pocket, and on taking off his hat, in a small cotton bag I found between sixty and seventy letters—I said, "You don't call these letters?"—he made no reply—after finding those letters, I again looked at his bundle, and then found Miss Manning's letter amongst them—he was then taken to the chief office, and given into custody—these are the letters—they have been posted—none of them have been delivered—they would all be in the prisoner's delivery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 5, Pleasant-row, High-street, Camden-town. On Monday afternoon 3rd Oct., about a quarter past 4 o'clock I was in Copenhagen-fields, where the works are going on for the New Market—I saw a load of slack brought to the ganger, that is a person who has charge <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a gang of men—I saw the prisoner there, I did not know him before; he called the ganger over—his mate wanted a barrow of slack, the ganger would not let them have it—the prisoner said he was no man, and he was <hi rend="italic">cheeking</hi> him <hi rend="italic">and jawing</hi> him, and said he would have some—he afterwards challenged the ganger to fight, and struck him in the eye and mouth—the ganger did not fight—the prisoner and his mate went away—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner called the ganger over again, and challenged him to fight, he did not accept the challenge—while this was going on Drew came up from his work, and told the prisoner he was no man for wanting to fight an old man like the ganger—the ganger was an oldish man—the prisoner said to Drew that he had better take it up, and asked him what he had to do with it—he asked Drew whether he wanted to fight, Drew said he did not mind it and pulled off his coat—the prisoner had his coat off—they then began to fight, a great number of workmen were present—a ring was formed—they had seconds, I do not know their names—in the first round Drew laid hold of the prisoner by the hair of his head, and struck him about the head—the prisoner fell down on his knee—the prisoner was the first that fell—he got round Drew's legs in the first round, and struck him with his fist in the Drew said, "It is not a manly action to strike unfair"—that was all that took place in the first round; in the second round the prisoner again got his arms round Drew's legs—I saw no blows struck in the second round—they both fell, the prisoner undermost—they got up, and renewed the fight—in the third round blows were struck by Drew, the prisoner did not strike any—the prisoner fell on his knees, Drew did not fall—they had a fourth round, and they both fell in a scuffle—I did not observe anything in the fifth round, there were about seven rounds</p>

               <p>in all—I did not observe anything particular in the seventh round, at the end of the fight 1 saw Drew fall from a blow, which the prisoner struck him under the ear, it was a violent blow—I heard Drew say to the prisoner, "You have struck me, you have given me a violent blow under the ear, but I won't be done yet," and he got up on his knee and one foot, and fell back again—he never spoke afterwards—a gentleman came op, and in a few minutes he was removed into the City of London Tavern—the prisoner escaped, he was drunk—Drew had had something, but he was not so drunk as the prisoner.</p>

I will come and fetch you out"—he said that half an hour afterwards, that was when the prisoner wanted to strike the old ganger—it was not while he was at work in the hole—the prisoner was all over blood in the first round, from his nose—he got pretty well all the blows—Drew was taller and much bigger than the prisoner, and a stout powerful man—the prisoner was nearly insensible once on his second's knee, there was a call to time and they put him up again—Drew seemed to do almost what he liked with him as to striking—this happened where the carts were going through—there are tracks of the cart wheels there, I did not observe a rut close by—I did not see that Drew tripped his foot in going back when he fell—he did not fall with his back across some earth, he fell on his left side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Gloucester-place, Oakley-square. On 3rd Oct, about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon I was near the New Market, at Islington, and saw a crowd—I afterwards saw the deceased taken into the house and examined him there, he was dead, there was no external appearance—I was afterwards present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was nothing remarkable externally, with the exception of ecchyraosis round both eyes, and some bloody froth from the left nostril, and a patch of blood on one of the ears—on removing the scalp we perceived blood extravasated at the lower edge of each parietal bone to the occipital region, but we could not perceive any fracture—on removing the skull cap we perceived extensive extravasation over both hemispheres of the brain, which extended to the base—there was a quantity of blood clots round the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi>, extending as far as the third vertebra; there was also ex<lb/>travasation of the right and left ventricle—the extravasation under the scalp behind the ear would account for that, it extended all round—a blow or a fall might cause that extravasation—I apprehend that one blow would not produce such extensive extravasation—I could not positively swear whether a fall or a blow from a fist in fighting Would be likely to produce it most likely a blow; but a fall might da it—a blow of sufficient force to cause death might be given there, and yet no mark be left—death was caused by pressure of blood on the brain; and that might be caused by a blow or a fall, I could not positively swear which.</p>

               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">ABRAHAM BORROWDALE</hi>. I live at St. Mary's parsonage, Vincent-square, Westminster, and am the perpetual curate of St. Mary's, Vincent-square; the house is my dwelling house. On the night of 12th Oct. I went to bed a little before 12 o'clock—I went over the house, as is my invariable custom, and left everything safe when I went up to bed—about 3 o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I was awakened by some person apparently trying the door between my room and the room adjoining—I called out, "Who is there?" I received no answer—I then got out of bed, and opened the other door of the room which opens on to the bead of the staircase—I again called, "Who is there?" and with a like result, no answer was returned; consider<lb/>ing it might be one of the servants moving about, my wife rang the bell which communicates with the servant's rooms—I distinctly heard a person moving at the end of the passage to the right of my room—I called to know if any of the servants were moving, they answered that there was no one moving, that they were all in bed—I then distinctly heard a person pass me, and go down the stairs—I closed my door and locked it, threw open the window, and called for a policeman—I was answered in two or three minutes—I told him to go to the door, and I went and let him in—there were three police<lb/>men, two had arrived while I was descending the stairs—on going down stairs, I observed that the dining and drawing room doors were both open—they were both shut and locked when I went to bed—we went first into the drawing room; we there found that a cheffonier had been opened, two desks belonging to my children bad been taken out, and forced, and the contents were strewn on the ground, with the exception <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the articles that were taken—I missed from those desks two pencil cases, a fruit knife, two florins, and some pieces of Maundy money, belonging to the children—none of those things have been recovered—we went down to the basement floor, and there we found everything in disorder, thrown and strewn about—I found that a pane of glass had been removed from the water closet window, and the win<lb/>dow itself was standing open, having been fastened when I went to bed.</p>

On the morning of 13th Oct., I was on duty in Regent-street, Westminster, about 200 yards from Mr. <hi rend="italic">Borrow</hi> dale's house; and about half past 5 o'clock I saw the prisoners coming from the direction of Vincent-square—I had heard of the robbery at that time—took them into custody, searched them, and found this knife on Anderson.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240029"/>
               <p>the prisoners were there, locked up in two separate cells—I heard Anderson say to White that he had made his mind up for a <hi rend="italic">stretch</hi>—White said he had not—Anderson said to White, "How about looking at the hands?"—White said, "Hold your b——tongue"—Anderson told White that he should say he had come to call him that morning—White said, 11 Yes;" he would stick to that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of place is this where the prisoners were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are six cells; three on each side—I was in the middle one of the three, be<lb/>tween the cells in which the prisoners were—they are divided by a brick partition, about ten feet high; the brick partition extends up to the ceiling, but not in front, there is a grating for the air to come through at the top of the doors—outside there is one common passage to them all; the officers are going to and fro in that passage at times—I was about three quarters of an hour in the cell between them—I was there for the purpose of hearing any conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the usual course at the Rochester-row police station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had charge of them altogether; it was not part of the charge given to me to get into a cell between them, and hear what I could—it was not the sugges<lb/>tion of my own mind—I had been ordered to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you were ordered to do it on that occasion, or as a com<lb/>mon practice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only on this occasion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, B</hi>). About 6 o'clock on the morning of 13th Oct., the prisoners were brought to the Rochester-row station—I received the knife produced from Burnett; there is a very great peculiarity about the shape of the top of the knife—the top part of the back of the edge is quite flat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean that it is very blunt at the end? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How deep was the hole that was made through the putty into the wood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps about one-eighth of an inch; that one-eighth of an inch corresponded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the cheffonier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; I found it had not been opened by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>; it was done by a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know it was not done by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no impression from the chisel in the wood, and there was a mark on it with which this knife exactly corresponded; I also examined a desk which was there, and found marks on that which corresponded with this knife—I have the desk here; there are marks of blood inside—I should also say that the knife slipped, and there is a long groove here, which corresponds with the blunt part of the knife (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—it was done by something smaller than <hi rend="italic">&amp; jemmy</hi>,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the marks of blood appear to be recent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, quite iresh; I think there were several papers with blood upon them—I then went back to the station, and examined the prisoner's hands; 1 found on Anderson's left hand a wound from a knife; it was a recent wound; the cut was quite green—he said, "I did it yesterday, cutting an apple."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Anderson.</hi> He did not see me with White; J saw White at 6 o'clock, on Wednesday; I was at home, and in bed, at 11 o'clock.</p>

On 12th Oct., I was in Leadenhall-street—there was a crowd, and I stopped at the corner of Lime-street; while I was standing there I felt a tug at my right hand coat pocket—I turned round, and the prisoner was standing close to my right hand; I missed my handkerchief, it had been in that right hand pocket—I looked at the prisoner, who was looking over the people's shoulders, and I saw my handkerchief underneath his coat—I seized it with one hand, and his collar with the other—I said, "You have just taken my handkerchief"—he said, "I have not your handkerchief"—I said, "No, you have not it now, because I have got it"—he struggled, but I held him till a policeman came—he said, "Do let me go this time."</p>

I was awoke about 4 o'clock in the morning by a side door in the shop opening—I jumped out of bed, went into the back shop, looked through the window and saw a man at the back of the premises making his escape; that was Jackson, who has since been tried here and transported (<hi rend="italic">seepage</hi> 207)—I went to the next house, undid the door and saw three men coming out of the next gateway, Carpenters'-hall—there was a policeman about twenty yards off, and I called his atten<lb/>tion to them, by calling "Stop thief!"—two of them went on one side of the policeman, and one on the other—he was in the middle of the road, and the two went on the pavement about two yards from him—I cannot identify</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Scott—in August, I was living at 10, Enoch-court, Whitechapel—part of the court is in Aldgate—I knew the prisoner and his wife; they resided at No. 7, at the top of the court, in the front room—they have lived there between four and five months to the best of my knowledge—I did not know them before they came there—the prisoner has four children—I did not know what he was—I was in the court on the evening of 23rd Aug., between 6 and 7 o'clock, and saw the prisoner come home; he was very tipsy indeed. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of the prisoner, contended that by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN'S</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">opening of the case the transaction was shown to confine itself to the day upon which the deceased lost her life; and objected to evidence being given of circumstances which occurred twelve or twenty-four hours previously, unless they could be shown to have some bearing on the actual killing. The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">did not think it possible to exclude what passed the night before</hi>). The prisoner was very tipsy—I saw his wife at that time up at Mrs. Lancaster's, who lives on the second floor of the, same house—I saw her in the court that evening; the latest hour was half past 9 o'clock—after the prisoner came into the court, I went up to the gate, and the prisoner's little girl brought him some beer—I saw the prisoner at his window about 10 o'clock that evening, Tuesday—he was alone, only the children with him—on the following day, Wednesday, I saw him come into the court at exactly a quarter past 1 o'clock in the afternoon; he was sober—he said nothing to me as he came through the court—I said to him, "There you are," and he pointed his finger to me and said, "Hush!" and then went into his own house—I do not know where his wife was at that time—about a quarter to 3 o'clock, I was going to his room; he and his wife were there, and I beard her say that if she was what be represented her to be she never would have been his wife—that was the first thing I heard said—the prisoner said, "Never mind, never mind, it <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> occur again," in a very low tone of voice—I then went downstairs,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240040"/>
               <p>and just as I got into the court I heard a noise proceeding from his room—I heard a cry of "Murder!" proceeding from his room—I could recognize the voice that screamed, it was Mrs. Mobbs's, and I called to him from the passage of No. 7, to let her out of the room—Mrs. Jones, who lives there went up stairs and knocked at his door, and at that time I heard a box <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> across the room—I was at that time in the passage—after that I heard the child cry out "Mother, mother!"—I then saw the deceased coming down stairs with the blood flowing from her neck (Mrs. Jones had come down before that)—the deceased was covered with blood, and when she came into the court we perceived that her throat was cut; she was not able to speak; her hair was all banging about her—she was assisted by some of the neighbours and carried out of the court—that was the last I saw of her—I saw the prisoner carried out of his house about an hour afterwards, with his throat bandaged—while I lived in the court, I observed that they lived unhappily together—I remember seeing the prisoner and his wife together on 13th Aug., and saw him do something to her.</p>

                  </hi>, I am the wife of John Lancaster, a carman. He works in the docks now; we lived in the same house as the prisoner and his late wife, and occupied the second floor front room, which is immediately over the room occupied by the prisoner and his wife; there is only one room on each floor—I have known them living under me since the Saturday before Easter Sunday; I lived there before that—there were four children, which the prisoner had by a former wife—I have been told that the deceased had no</p>

               <p>children; I never saw one—I remember the day on which she met her death—I was not in the court the day before that, Tuesday, 23rd—I saw the pri<lb/>soner go in doors on the evening of that day; there was some disturbance in the court—he appeared to be rather under the effects of liquor—soon after he went in, the deceased came into my room; it was then about 6 o'clock, and from what she said to me, I allowed her to remain there till about half past 9 o'clock; when I lent her a cloak to put on, and she left the room—I saw nothing more of her after that—on the following morning, about 10 o'clock I think, I went down stairs, and found her coming with a pail of water, when she returned me the cloak I had lent her—I do not know whether she then went into her own room, I left her near the street door—after 2 o'clock I went down stairs; I had to pass the door of the room where the prisoner lived, and heard them talking quietly, in a subdued tone, not quarrelling; I did not hear what either of them said—I then went down into the court, and after I had been there about a quarter of an hour, I heard a cry of "Murder!" distinctly—it was the voice of Mrs. Mobbs; and then I heard faintly," Murder!" and "Help!"—I also heard the youngest boy, Nathaniel Mobbs, who I think is about four years old, cry "Oh, mother!"—on hearing these cries, I and some of the neighbours went to the door of the passage, and Mrs. Jones, who was there, went up to the door of the prisoner's room—I heard her knock at the door, and heard a noise as of a box being moved away from the door-Mrs. Jones then came down from the door, and Mrs. Mobbs came down after her, with her throat cut and her hair hanging down about her shoulders; blood was coming from her—I watched her walk about one or two doors, I did not go far—I did not see her again till I saw her in the hospital—I then proceeded up stairs, and had to pass their door again; it was open, and I saw the pri<lb/>soner lying on the door, and his little boy sitting in a chair near him—there was a pool of blood by the door, near where the prisoner was lying—I did not notice whether his throat was cut—when I came down with my baby, I saw another pool of blood by the fireplace—I called the officers—I afterwards saw the deceased at the hospital, quite dead; her name was Caroline Mobbs—the prisoner and his wife did not live happily together when he was drunk—she was not a quarrelsome woman at all, and I never saw her otherwise than sober.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240042"/>
               <p>should not murder her—he then got up from the chair, and dragged her out of the room by her clothes, out into the court, and dashed her up against the gates where they live—there is a little garden before each house; she stood there, he dragged her to the street door, and she said she would not go up stairs unless I went with her—I went up stairs into their room, and stayed about ten minutes—only a few words passed between them while I was there—I do not recollect what she said, but I recollect him saying she was with a policeman all night; she said she was not, that she was in my place—I said nothing about that to the prisoner, I made my way and came down stairs——about ten minutes after I came down I heard her screaming—(this was before 6 o'clock in the morning)—I heard her say if he did not leave her alone she would jump out of the window—she opened the window—I did not hear her say anything to him when the window was open, but she said to me, "Was not I in your place, my dear, all night?" and I said, "Yes," and she said to him, "Now are you satisfied?"—he made no answer that I heard.</p>

On 24th Aug., about 12 o'clock, I was at my door, and heard screams of "Murder!" proceeding from No. 7—Mrs. Lancaster, Mrs. Scott, and some other neighbours were called out by the screams—they were all at my door together, and we all proceeded to the door of No. 7, and the screams were so different from what we were accustomed to hear, that we went up stairs; the screams were so very violent—when we got to the door of the prisoner's room, the screams were fainter; it was "Murder! Help!" in a much fainter voice—I knocked very violently, and with shaking the handle I found the door was not locked—it opened a little, and I said, "You wretch, you, let the woman out, and <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> you murder her"—there was something against the door which prevented my opening it wider—the screams then entirely ceased, and I heard no more till I heard a rustling in the room, and my neighbours called to me—it was somebody moving chairs, or something of that kind—I cannot say whether the noise was near the door—some person then opened</p>

On Wednesday afternoon, 24th Aug., I was called to No. 4, Enoch-court—I went up to the first floor, and found the prisoner there, held up on a chair by two parties—he told me to tell George, the cellarman at Mr. Walter Hall's, the wine merchant, at Water-lane, to deliver the things all right—a surgeon was sent for, and I assisted in taking the prisoner to the London Hospital—I should say he was sober at the time I went—after his throat was sewn up at the hospital, and he was got to bed, he said his wife had been out all the night before, and he saw her along with a policeman, one of the Metropolitan policemen, and she was out the best part of the night before that—he said no more then—on the 27th he said he should not have done it if she bad not taken the white handled knife and said she would stab him; that he took the knife from her and cut her throat, gave her two cuts, and then put the knife down, took up his child, who was in the room, and kissed it, and then took up the brown handled knife and cut his own throat—I produce the two knives—they were handed to me by my brother officer—I was examined by the Coroner on 1st Sept., the Thursday week following—I had four communications made to me by the prisoner, three before, and one after my examination before the Coroner—I have named two—they were on 29th, 27th, and 24th Aug.—I did not make any note of them—on the 24th he said, at the hospital, that his wife was out all the night before with a policeman, and part of the night before she was out—I had asked him no question whatever—I was by the side of the bed, standing up—I bad said nothing to him; he used those words, and that was all that passed—I remained with him in the hospital every day—he spoke again on Saturday, the 27th—I never asked him a question—he said he should not have done it, only his wife took the white handled knife, and said she would stab him, and he took it away from her, and cut her throat, giving her two cuts; that he laid the knife down, took up his child and kissed it, and then took up the brown handled knife and cut his own throat—that was all that passed then—on the Monday following, the 29th, he said to me, "Oh! <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, I wish I could die! for they are only making me better to hang me"—that was all that was said before the inquest—after the inquest, on 4th Sept., he said he sharpened the brown handled knife on the whetstone, which was on the table, before he cut his own throat—he addressed me by my Christian name—I have known him a long while—I was examined by the Coroner on Thursday, 1st Sept., after the prisoner had told</p>

               <p>me that his wife had attempted to injure him with the knife—I remembered I that when I was before the Coroner—I told the Coroner all I knew then—this is my signature to these depositions (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at the London Hospital. The body of the deceased was brought there on 24th Aug., covered with blood, her clothes were saturated with blood; there was a wound across the front of the throat about six inches long, and on the face and neck there were ten other smaller wounds; there were also wounds on the fingers of both hands—the wound in the throat divided three of the jugular veins, but not the arteries; that caused her death—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the following day; the organs of life were healthy—I examined a wound across the front of the prisoner's throat, it was between five and six inches long—it opened the wind pipe in two places, and divided one of the principal arteries, it was a dangerous wound—I did not think he would live an hour when he came in—the wounds on the woman and on the man were such as might have been inflicted by these knives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the unfortunate deceased. He was in the habit of keeping an oyster stall in Mortimer-street; he had done so for four or five years, off and on—I know nothing of this accident—I was present, but I saw nothing of it till I was struck myself, which stupified me for a moment; I was taken to the hospital with my father—I stood on the side of my father, nearer to Langham-place—I did not see the omnibuses coming—I was struck by the Chelsea and Islington omnibus on the ear and side of the head, and my father was struck too—the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> passed on from me, I got away—I cannot say where my father was struck—a gentleman who was having oysters pulled the table away, and we both got entangled somehow—I had the flaps of my coat torn off—I know that locality very well—there is a large public house directly opposite that stall—it is what is called a gin palace—there is a great deal of light there—there are four large lamps in front of that house in Mor<lb/>timer-street, and one lamp in Portland-street, and there are some smaller jets in the window—the stall was directly on the pavement, opposite that public house—the four legs of the stall stood on the pavement, about three or four inches from the road—I do not know who was driving the Chelsea and Isling<lb/>ton omnibus—I have had conversations with both the prisoners since—I spoke to Wood on the Sunday after the Saturday night when this happened—he said he did not know of it till the policeman told him on Sunday morning—he did not know there had been an accident at all—I said it was odd his con<lb/>ductor had not seen it—he said he had had a few words with his conductor in</p>

               <p>the morning, and that was the reason he had never mentioned it to him—in a day or two afterwards he said, when he got round the corner he was going to get down, because he thought his splinter-bar was broken; and somebody on the roof said, "No, it is not your splinter-bar; it is the other one;" and then he did not get down—I had no conversation with May—I saw my father in the hospital, and saw him after he was dead—his name was James Mason.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 99, Great Portland-street, and am a painter. I have seen the deceased man, for the last twelve months, standing at the corner—there is a large public house opposite, which has five lamps, four in Mortimer-street, and one in Great Portland-street—on the night of 17th Sept. I was standing directly opposite the stall—the deceased was opening oysters for a young man who was standing near him—the deceased's son was standing opposite me, alongside of his father, to the left—I saw two omnibuses coming up the road at the rate of from eight to nine miles an hour—it was the noise of the two omnibuses that drew my attention to look round—I do not know the width of Mortimer-street; there is plenty of room for three omnibuses to pass—when I looked round the omnibuses were from twenty to twenty-five yards off—the Islington and Chelsea was half an omnibus' length in front of the Clapton—the Clapton was behind nearly the length of the horses—I saw them distinctly, there was nothing to obstruct my view as they came along—I caught hold of the stall, and said, "By G—d you will be killed!"—it struck the son, and the bar caught the old man and crushed him against the post—I said, "0, my G—d, you have killed the man!"—I took hold of the tub the oysters were in, and handed it in at the bar of the public house—I came out immediately, and said, "You had no right to gallop like that"—it was either to the driver or the conductor of the Islington omnibus that 1 said that—the Clapton had then gone away—when I said that, the driver and the conductor were together; they were both off the omnibus, at the horses' heads—I said it in presence of the driver, if not to the driver—he said I had better mind my own business—I heard that the horse had grazed the fore leg—I went round to see, and saw a mark of mud as if the fore leg of the grey horse had been touched with the hind wheel of the other omnibus—it was too high for the fore wheel to have made the mark—I heard the driver of the Chelsea omnibus say, "He fouled me"—the other omnibus was then gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 118, Great Portland-street, and am a stationer; I knew the deceased—he was in the habit of standing at that stall. On that evening, about a quarter to 9 o'clock, I was crossing Great Portland-street,</p>

               <p>at the end of Mortimer-street—I was coming to the post to where this stall was—I first heard a noise of omnibuses coming at a furious pace—I got to the middle of the road in front of the first <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, as I saw there would bean accident of some kind take place from the position of the two omnibuses being so close together, and close on the corner—what I thought would happen was, that one of the omnibuses would be upset, and break in the public house front—I then saw the collision at the corner; and what appeared to me was, that the splinter bar of the Chelsea omnibus had caught the old man, and jammed him against the post—there was a stoppage for a moment, and the Clapton <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> drew round the corner—I then ran across the road, and saw the old man lying in some one's arms with his head back, as if he was dead—in my judgment, these two omnibuses were driving at a pace dan-gerous to each other—they were driving at a dangerous pace.</p>

I was on the top of the Clapton omnibus on 17th Sept.—I got up at Regent-circus, Oxford-street—the Chelsea and Islington omnibus was there at the same time—they both started very nearly together—there might be half a minute difference—they went a slow pace at first—about halfway to Mor<lb/>timer-street they commenced racing, and continued to do so until the accident occurred—so close were they the greater part of the way through Mortimer-street, that one might have stepped from one <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> to the other when the acci<lb/>dent happened; the driver of the omnibus that I was on cleared and got away, and in a minute and a half or two minutes, he turned to some one that sat behind him, and said, "That is the way to <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> them off the <hi rend="italic">perch</hi>"—I can<lb/>not say who was the driver who said that, as my back was towards him—both the drivers whipped their horses through Mortimer-street—they were gallop<lb/>ing, I should say, from eight to nine miles an hour—in my judgment they were going at a dangerous pace.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of this unfortunate business, I was a passenger on the Chelsea omnibus. It was standing at the corner of Regent-street, when I got up; it was the first—the Clapton omnibus started from very near the Circus; it overtook us at the corner of Mortimer-street—there was a van or wagon in the way, just coming out of Mortimer-street, as we were turning round—we turned into Mortimer-street—the Chelsea omnibus was on the near side; we were going a moderate pace on to the corner where the oyster stall was—just as we were going to turn that corner, the other rushed right across, and that was what caused the accident—supposing the Chelsea omnibus had not been swerved from its course, it would have been able to turn the corner, and to have avoided the stall.</p>

I was the outside passenger on the near side—there was one person between me and the coachman—I saw the accident, and I remember the oyster stall, and the poor man who was jammed, and the Chelsea omnibus—the Chelsea omnibus was passing the stall, and pulled up—the Clapton omnibus shot across, and caught the Chelsea omnibus' wheel, and then the wheel caught the splinter bar and drove it against the post—supposing the Clapton omnibus had not struck the Chelsea omnibus, and the Chelsea omnibus had gone on, it would have cleared the old man and the stall—there was quite</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live at Parson's-green, Fulham. I recollect the month of Nov., 1852—I knew the prisoner about six weeks before—he called at my house on the 21st Nov., at 10 o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing; it was Sunday—he remained with me until 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he had luncheon, and dined with me—there were two guns in the room where we were sitting; he had them both in his hand, and said how well he could shoot with them if he bad them—he also saw two coats; one was an over coat, and the other an under coat—I lent him the over coat because it rained, but he returned it in about half an hour—I did not lend him the other—we left the house at 4 o'clock, and went to the Duke's Head, half a mile off—the housekeeper, Elizabeth M'Donald, was left in the house; she has left my service, and I do not know where she is—I stayed at the public house until half past 10 o'clock—the prisoner and myself were drinking porter until 8 o'clock—he asked me to pay for a pot of beer for him, and I said that I would—we drank that, and he said, "Pay for another, that will make 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I will pay you on Saturday night"—the second pot was standing on the table when the housekeeper came in—that was at 8 o'clock—he desired her to take a drink of porter, which she did—he then said, "I shall go out for a little while; I shall not be long before I am back"—he went out, and the housekeeper remained along with me till half past 10 o'clock—I expected him back—at half past 10 o'clock I went home; I found the outside door locked; the sash of the bedroom was broken, and the glass out—the bedroom was on the ground floor, and any one could have got in from the street—I missed the guns the same night, and the coats on the Tuesday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sands-end, Fulham, and am a carman. I was in the Rose public house, on a Sunday in Nov. 1852, and saw the prisoner come in there about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the evening, with two coats and two guns—he asked me to buy the two old coats, saying they were of no use to him, and I bought them for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the policeman came and asked me for them, I think at the latter end of the week, and I gave them to him—I am sure these are the coats, I saw the two guns; the prisoner had them in his possession.</p>

               <p>had had two, and had left a single barrelled gun at the Rose public house-in the parlour there were four young men sitting, who had been working with him at some time—he went off to sleep—one of the young men said I had better take care of the gun, and I put it in the bar—the men woke the pri<lb/>soner up, and he went away with them about 11 o'clock—he came the next morning, and asked me to let him have the gun—I said, "You owe me a score, you had better pay it before you have the gun"—he had two pots of beer and some bread and cheese, and then he wanted a sovereign, and said he would pay me on Saturday night when he came for the gun—I gave him a sovereign and kept the gun—he went away, and I saw him no more—the policeman came for the gun on the next Sunday, and I gave it to him; this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gilder and dealer in enamels, living at No. 419, Oxford-street. I remember the prisoner coming into my shop on 19th Aug.—I believe it was about 12 o'clock—there was some conversation about some pins, and the prisoner asked me if I had any rings—I told him no—he asked me if I bought rings—I said yes, if they suited me—he told me he was commissioned by a lady to sell several hundred pound's worth of jewellery; she had a heavy lawsuit pending, and she did not wish to have her name mentioned—he said he would bring two rings to me to see—he came back again in perhaps not quite half an hour—he showed me these two rings,</p>

I received a letter from the prisoner, from the House of Detention, which was put into my hands by another officer; in consequence of which I went to the House of Detention—he asked me if I had received a letter—I told him I had—he then told me that he wanted to see some papers which I had, as some of them were in reference to the date when he purchased the rings; be had bought them from a person, and would bring witnesses forward to prove that upon his trial; and that the reason he did not say so at Marl borough-street police court was, he thought the parties were out of town from whom he purchased them—I told him to name any paper he wanted, and he should see it—he said he could not do that—I looked over the papers, and I found none of them had reference to rings of any description—the letter was dated, "House of Detention, Sept. 19, 1853," directing me to let him have any papers, or see them, which I had got of his</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I dare say five years—he is a bricklayer's labourer—there are brickfields in the immediate neighbourhood of Shepherd's-bush—there are not many Irish brickmakers—the brickmakers are generally called <hi rend="italic">brickeys</hi>—a great number of persons are employed there in the brickfield—I had not known the deceased for any length of time—I knew her when she used to bring his dinner—that may be two years ago, I dare say—I dare say I have known her for two years—I have never seen her in liquor—I only knew her by sight, no further than bringing his dinner.</p>

               <p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Shirley, of No. 3, Back-gardens, Shepherd's-bush. On Saturday evening, 10th Sept., I was coming home between 10 and 11 o'clock, and saw the prisoner in the market—I had known him before—I saw him knock a woman down—she got up again, and went down the market—I did not see any more of her then—I stopped with my husband at the top of the maket—about an hour and a half afterwards, as I was going home, I saw the woman again—that was near 1 o'clock, about half past 12 o'clock I should think it was—it was the same woman I had seen knocked down by the prisoner—she was going round by the Royal Hotel, down the island—there is a place called Robinson's-gate at the end of the island—the Royal Hotel and Robinson's-gate are on opposite sides of the road—the island does not run out of the turnpike road, it runs alongside the market—the Royal Hotel is at the corner of the island, nearer the turnpike road—the island is also called Shepherd's-bush Back-gardens—you go down the island in order to get to Robinson's-gate—when I got past the Royal Hotel the woman and I came together to Robinson's-gate, and just past the gate I saw the prisoner standing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 69). My beat is at Shepherd's-bush, in the parish of Hammersmith. On Sunday evening, 11th Sept., I was on duty at the top of Shepherd's-bush market, near the Royal Hotel, about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock—there are some unfinished buildings at the other side of the turnpike-road—I heard a scrambling across the road—I could not see, as it was very foggy, and thinking that it was a brother constable, I crossed over—there are some railings which separate the ground where the buildings are from the road—I waited about two minutes, heard no further sound, and then stooped under the railings—I walked ten or twelve yards further on the building ground, with my light turned on, listened for a moment, but did not hear any thing—when I had gone about twenty-eight yards inside the railings, I saw the prisoner standing in front of me—it was a very dense fog, and I could not see two yards from me—I was standing close to the prisoner when I saw him—I asked him what he did there—he said, "What the b—h—is that to do with you?"—he appeared in a very trembling state—he appeared stupefied, and I thought he was under the influence of drink—I told him he had better follow me into the road, thinking he had lost himself; and I went three or four yards, thinking he was following me; but he did not—I went back again, and found him nearly in the same spot, but about six yards nearer to the spot where the deceased was afterwards found—I requested him to come away, and told him if he did not choose to do so, I should be compelled to take him up—he said it was all right; he had stepped off the road, it being foggy, and bad lost himself—he remained in the position in which he was two or three minutes, and then unbuttoned his trowsers, and gazed on the spot which has since been pointed out to me—I turned myself round, and stood by the side of him for about a couple of minutes, and then told him again, if he did not follow me, I should be compelled to lock him up, as he had no business there whatever—he followed me into the road, after stooping under the rail, and then said to me, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> I thought I knew you"—I said, "You don't know roe, and I don't know you; by that <hi rend="italic">means go</hi> away"—his reply was, "If you don't know roe, J wonder at your speaking to such a character as I am"—after that he went away, and I followed him to Norland turnpike-gate, about twenty yards from there, in the direction of Shepherd's-bush; that was all I saw of him that night—I then went back to the spot we had come out from, and remained there some time; but he did not return, as 1 thought he might.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This place is separated from the the road by a railing which runs parallel with the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is a footpath before you get to the railing—the place is an excavation for building—perhaps there are three houses built—the excavation is for foundations—when you get under the rails you pass three houses in shell first, which is twenty-eight or thirty yards, and then you can descend a little into the excavation—there is a slope there, but very little—I did not go down; I descended a little—the excavation adjoins the houses, and the rail is to prevent people from going in; but there are from twenty-eight to thirty yards to go before they would fall into the excavation—they are wooden rails—I got under them—it is very nearly half the distance more than the length of this Court from the road to the excavation—the railing does not go in a line with the houses which are in shell—the houses turn off from the road—the rail does not go to</p>

                  <lb/>tion of about three feet at each end—the whole of it is about sixty yards—in the excavation, just under the perpendicular wall which forms the cellars, there are two or three brickbats—the excavation has been there about two years, or it might be rather more; I cannot say exactly—the perpendicular wall on side, forming the cellars, is about five feet from the surface to the bottom; and right under there is where the brickbats are—the man whom I saw that night 1 say is the prisoner—I might have seen him before—I did not know him by sight—I did not see him again till he was in custody; that was on Sunday evening—on the night in question he walked very well—he was not very much intoxicated—I thought he was labouring under the influ<lb/>ence of drink—he appeared stupefied, trembling and sighing very much—the night was so foggy I could not see two yards before me—it had been so for two hours before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness, and the sister of the deceased. On Sunday, 11th Sept., a policeman came and fetched me to the station—I saw my sister there in a very bad state—I scarcely knew her—she was knocked about, bruised, and disfigured, and had a black eye—she was not sensible—she was removed from the station to my house at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and I continued to attend her till her death, which was at a quarter to 6 o'clock on Sunday afternoon—she never spoke—this is her bonnet and shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have seen her wear them—the wore them in my own house on the Wednesday before the murder happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Sunday morning, 11th Sept., at 7 o'clock, I was sent for to the station house, and found a female very ill, totally insensible—she was very much bruised about the face—her right eye was swollen very much from a blow, and was very livid—there was also a severe bruise on the lower jaw—the left side of her face was as if she bad been struck with some gravel, as if it had been <hi rend="italic">sliped</hi> down with gravel—by "<hi rend="italic">sliped down</hi>" I mean, that it was as if she had been dragged over some gravel—I saw her again at 10 o'clock—she was then in a more sinking state, and totally insensible—5 o'clock was the last time I saw her alive—on the Monday week afterwards I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the head, there was a great effusion of blood on the substance of the brain, underneath the second covering, and also in both ventricles of the brain—there was about two drachms in one ventricle, and a few ounces in the other—the other organs of the body were generally healthy, except the heart, which was very flabby, and had thin walls—I have no doubt that death was caused by the quantity of blood effused on, and in, the ventricles of the brain—a blow or blows would be likely to produce that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I understand you to say that the immediate cause of the death of the deceased was the effusion of blood on and in the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would gradually produce death—I attribute death to that state of the parts which I discovered—I say decidedly that that effusion of blood may have been caused by a blow or blows—a fall might do it, too—it must be a very great degree of excitement indeed to do it—I never met with a case in which it has been done by a high degree of intoxication—in that case it is doubtful if you would have blood in the ventricles—I think you would not, but you would if the concussion was caused by a blow or a fall—I made a careful <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, particularly of the brain—I made an incision into the brain—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240072"/>
               <p>the small vessels which ramify the brain were not in a congested state—the substance of the brain was free from any effusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a body is examined a day or two after death, do not you find that part which is next to the substance on which it was lying gorgedswith blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The skin is; a portion of the blood follows the laws of gravitation, and goes to the lowest part—it would depend on the state of the weather whether I should find structural change in a body after the lapse of a week after death—in the present case, I think it made no difference—I should prefer making the examination within two days, of course—I examined the meningeal artery—it was in a sound state—no portion of the brain was lacerated—the chief source of effusion of blood, in cases of fulness in the brain, is not caused at all times by a rupture of the meningeal artery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this statement correct of Professor Taylor: "The chief source of the effusion of blood to the head arises from a rupture of the meningeal artery, and this may occur from the mere shock or concussion, with or without a frac<lb/>ture of its bony canal?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it is; concussion of the brain, and effusion of blood, may be occasioned in the brain without any marks of ex<lb/>ternal violence—the most severe bruises I discovered were on the right eye and the right jaw—what I have stated was, that there was great effusion on, not <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, the substance of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you coincide with this remark of Professor Taylor, "When the marks of violence are slight, a witness must exercise great caution before be alleges that the extravasation was produced by a blow, especially when it ii found that the deceased was of intemperate habits?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I consider that is correct, scientifically speaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give your assent to this: "If a man, excited by passion and intoxication, is struck on the head, and the blow is very slight, such as an unaffected person would have sustained without injury; yet, if insensibility and death follow, and on examination a quantity of blood is found extravasated in the substance of the brain, can it be a matter of doubt with the practitioner that the extravasation was chiefly due to the excitement under which the deceased was labouring?<hi rend="italic">" A.</hi> I should think that would be the case, generally speaking—I think a blow on the eye, to produce the effect which was produced, would be quite sufficient to cause effusion of blood into the brain—it must knock a person down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the case of a person falling, in a state of intoxication, and being previously much excited, might not concussion and effusion have been the result, independently of any blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should rather doubt it myself—if a person fell a distance of four or five feet, having been previously drinking and in an excited state, I think there would be external marks to corroborate it—I have known cases of concussion and effusion, and death supervening, without any external mark—I have even known fracture of the skull without external marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say, supposing a person to fall five or six feet, who was in a state of excitement from liquor, that the mere fall would not account for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for the quantity of blood which I found in the ventricles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you dissent from this opinion of Dr. Taylor, that extravasation may occur from violence, with or without fracture, and it may take place without any external marks of injury to the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Extrava<lb/>sation might, but that would be in a different place—this was in the ventri<lb/>cles as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said the small vessels which ramify through the brain were not in a congested state; if the person had been in a drunken</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240073"/>
               <p>state, would they have been congested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think they would have been fuller than they were—I saw the woman at 7 o'clock on Sunday morn<lb/>ing—she did not vomit at the station, but there was some food just inside her mouth—I am not able to say whether she had or had not been drinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You examined the heart, and you say that the walls of it were flabby; do you mean the auricles or the ventricles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ven<lb/>tricles—they were thinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say there were, or were not, any appearances which enabled you to connect the effusion of blood with the appearance of any external bruise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not any—I think the external bruise must have been caused by a blow, because there were no scratches, or anything of that kind—the skin was not abraded—I have seen the excava<lb/>tion, and I do not think that the appearances which I found, and which caused death, could be accounted for by the woman falling down there—I think, if she had fallen on her head, there must have been some external bruise, and I do not think the shock would be sufficient to cause those appearances, supposing she was in a state of excitement, unless she did fall on her head, I have a confident opinion of that, nor could it be produced by her falling on any other part of her body—if she had fallen on brickbats, at the bottom of the excavation, that would not be reconcilable with the appearances I found on her eye, because the skin would have been cut by the sharp edge—I opened the head first, and under the scalp above the right eye I found a small mark—it was on the temple, and was as if she had fallen on a small piece of brick or gravel, which was not sufficiently large to cut through the skin, but to mark it underneath—the mortal appearances could not have arisen from that at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 168 Fleet-street. The prisoner lodged in my house with her husband, and her mother occasionally—I think it was in May last she came to lodge with me—for some time previous to the 20th Oct. I had missed money from my till—I did not know who to accuse; I discharged one of my errand boys—I marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of money, and on the night of the 13th Oct. I put 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the till; the next morning it was all gone—I had marked the money after the errand boy was gone—I called in a policeman, who watched for five nights—on the night of the 21st Oct., 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which were marked were left in the till—I found that the whole of them were gone at 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that upon matters of pilfering she has been affected by the state she is in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is more than probable, almost certain, that it was under the influence of her pregnancy that she did this—that is not uncommon—medical men always know that females in that state are affected with peculiar longings and desires, and are likely to do many things that they otherwise would not do—they are scarcely accountable for all their actions, because many of them are done without a motive—I sent a letter to the pie-siding Alderman on the subject—I wished the prosecution to be withdrawn.</p>

Upon the 4th Count</hi> (<hi rend="italic">founded on 15th section</hi>), <hi rend="italic">the question arose whether the omission to see the signal was such a wilful act on the part of the prisoners as to bring them within the meaning of that section</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">was clearly of opinion that the first three counts disclosed no offence at common law of which this Court could take cognizance; he had certainly supposed that this Court had the jurisdiction of a Court of Quarter Sessions, but it appeared that was not the case, and that the Middlesex Sessions stood in that position. With respect to the true construction of 13th section, it would be well that it should be ascertained whether the omission to see a signal, or, in other words, to keep a good look-out</hi>,</p>

I was chief mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Queen of the Teign.</hi> I believe we shipped fifteen Lascars at Singapore, and one Chinaman, and we had nine English—on the night of 22nd July I was at my watch from 12 till 4 o'clock—the captain's watch had turned in—about 1 o'clock I was sitting abreast the wheel aft, on the starboard side—in the course of my watch I had not observed anything unusual—there were men there who were not on the watch—it was unusual for men who are not on the watch to remain on deck—I saw two or three of the watch below, on deck—men who ought to have been in bed—they were moving about—I saw nothing particular done by either of them before the attack was made on myself—the prisoner Ahalt was on my watch—he was one who was on deck, I could not swear to the other prisoner being there—I first heard Goldswortby call to me, "Look out, sir, there are some men coming here!"—I looked, and saw Cree coming on one side of me, and the <hi rend="italic">tindal on</hi> the other side—the <hi rend="italic">tindal</hi> had a kreese in his hand—I could see it—Cree came aft, and when he came abreast of me he raised an iron bar which he had with both his hands, and made a blow at me—I jumped up, and received the blow on my back—I think it took me on the loins—I jumped inside the man's arms and took him by the shirt—I carried him off the poop, which is about three feet high, and threw him down on deck—while I was struggling with John Cree, trying to get the bar away from him, Awang came up; he made a blow with a kreese, which went through my coat and waistcoat, but did not touch the skin—it was a stab—he made a second attempt, a second stab; I saw it coming—I let go John Cree, and received the blow of the kreese on my arm—I seized Awang's hand with my left hand, and held him, and while I was holding him, the <hi rend="italic">tindal</hi> stabbed me several times—the stab once entered my belly, and five or six other Lascars were on me at the same time with knives and bars—as near as I can recollect, as I was in such a state of excitement, the captain was the first man who came to my assistance—he took the kreese out of Awang's hand—he took the blade out of the handle—I received three blows in the body, one in the arm, and several in the back—the wound in the back is quite well; the one in the belly is very dangerous—I have an abscess now in my back—I became dis<lb/>abled; I was carried below, and laid, I think, a fortnight; I could not get out of bed at all—I think the captain did not assist me down; I was in that state, almost fainting, that I hardly knew who was there—the first thing I saw was the <hi rend="italic">Sevang's</hi> wife; she brought me to—I think she had been using brandy—I had fainted; I could not tell whether the fighting continued after I was below—I know Ahalt was in my watch that night—I did not see him near me at the time I was being attacked.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman, on board the <hi rend="italic">Queen of the Teign.</hi> I was in the mate's watch on 22nd July last—I remember two bells striking; that was 1 o'clock—Goldsworthy was at the wheel at that time—I observed the Lascars, who were on the watch on deck—just before the two bells struck, 1 saw Kishner on deck; he was not on the watch—he went to the cask to get some water—about half an hour after, I was sitting down with my hands in my pockets between the winch and the 'midships, near the long boat, and a man knocked me down with an iron bar; that was the first thing I noticed—the man who knocked me down was Seden—he was not on the watch, he was the cook of the Lascars—it was not usual for him to be on deck at that time—he had a right to be below, from 8 o'clock at night till 4 o'clock in the morning—I got up, and be knocked me down again; he knocked me down three times, and when I got up the third time, Alie stabbed me in the jacket with a knife—it did not touch <hi rend="italic">my</hi> flesh—I saw a knife in his hand—I do not know what became of it, but I know he had a sheath knife in his hand—I <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> a piece of wood out of the long boat to defend myself—I made the best of my way aft—there were five after me, and they had iron bars and sticks in their hands—I could not recognise any of them, only the two that strnck me first; they were Seden and Alie—when I got to the back of the poop, a man <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me down against the rail; that was Ahalt—he jumped off the poop, and got hold of the stick that I bad in my right hand—I <hi rend="italic">hauled</hi> it away from him—he let go, and I fell on my back against the topsail brace, and he stabbed me in my left foot with a knife; he gave me three stabs in my left foot, when I had my back against the brace—at that time the chief mate was on the starboard side, and some of the Lascars were round him—at the time Ahalt stabbed me in the foot, there were no other Lascars round me; the others bad left me just between the poop and the mainmast—I should say it was half a minute from the time that Alie cut my jacket with the knife, till Ahalt stabbed me in the foot—Alie was not on my watch; he had been on the watch up to 12 o'clock, the first watch—he belonged to the captain' watch—I do not know where Alie was at the time that Ahalt stabbed me in the foot—the mate was on the starboard side; I was on the larboard side, on my back, on the poop against the topsail brace, when I was stabbed—when I got up again from the poop, I jumped down in the cabin—as I was going down in the cabin, the captain was coming up—I did not see the second mate till they were all lashed.</p>

Gentlemen, I put myself in your hands; it is for you to say if I have not had enough punishment by Mr. Day's <hi rend="italic">swagging</hi> my ale and <hi rend="italic">baccee</hi>; I have been summoned several times on the Grand and Petit Juries, both here and at Hicks's-hall, and if my Lord will postpone the case I will spend 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. rather than I would not beat such a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> as that (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Day</hi>), though he is such a big lump; I have been deprived of a defence, even though those gentlemen (<hi rend="italic">the Counsel</hi>) actually sit here for the purpose; I can afford to pay Mr. Day or any other person to the tune of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 16th Sept., I was living as housemaid in the service of Mr. Trood, of Tulse-hill—the prisoner was cook there—she came on 22nd Aug.; I was her bedfellow—before 16th Sept., I and my fellow servants thought she was in the family way—I had not said anything to her on the subject—on Friday evening, 16th Sept., she complained of the toothache; that was about half past 8 o'clock—she said she was going to bed, and I said, "So do," and she went—two other servants slept in the same room, in another bed—I and the others went into the room to go to bed at half past 10 o'clock—I asked the prisoner how she was—she said she was still very bad with the toothache, and had a pain in her back—as I was undress<lb/>ing she gave a sudden shriek, and cried out as if she was in great pain—I went to her bedside, she desired me to hold down my head, that she wanted to speak to me—I did so; she took hold of my band and desired me to place it down in the bed; I did so, and felt what I conceived to be the head of an infant—I said, "For God's sake what is it?" and she burst into tears—I said, "We all suspect you are in the family way, is the baby born?" she answered, "Yes; what shall I do?"—I instantly went and communicated what had happened to my mistress—Mr. Finch, the medical man, shortly after came, and I saw him take the child alive from the bed, it was a male child—as far as I could judge, it was a fine healthy child—I attended upon the prisoner and the child from time to time, I fed it that same night; I can<lb/>not say whether it swallowed or not—the prisoner had not provided any clothing for the child; some clothes were provided, and it was dressed in shirt, a flannel, a bedgown, cap, and napkin; there were strings to the cap, tied under the chin, I believe there were also strings to the shirt; there were strings to the bedgown round the neck—on Saturday I fed the child again—I did not notice that it swallowed anything then—it had been put to the breast, I did not notice that it drew anything—I saw the child, and looked at it particularly in the course of the Saturday afternoon, and observed a red mark round its neck, such as would be caused by a string or tape—nothing was said to the prisoner about it in my presence—I did not say anything to her about it—Mrs. Smith, the gardener's wife, was there on the Saturday—I was not present when she spoke to the prisoner about it—I last saw the child alive on Sunday morning at half past 7 o'clock, it was then in bed with its mother—it had been in the mother's care during the Saturday night—she was left alone in that room the whole of Saturday night—I went into the room with Mr. Brown, the doctor, about 11 o'clock on Sunday, and we</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Tulse-hill. I was sent for to Mr. Trood's on Friday evening, 16th Sept.; I got there about half past 10 or 11 o'clock—I was taken into a bedroom, and there found the prisoner in bed—I was told that a child had been born, and I proceeded in the usual way to make such an examination as would be necessary, and I then found a living child by the side of the mother; it was still attached to the mother by the umbilical cord—I separated it—it was a male child, and to all appearance a full-grown healthy child—it was handed over to the women who were there to tend it—I then left—I went again about 10 o'clock next morning; the child was by the side of the mother—after speaking to the woman, I said, Let me look at the child"—it was removed by the last witness, and I took it into my arms—I then saw what struck me as being something unusual about the child; the face was very much suffused, and bloody froth was oozing from the mouth and nostrils—I said to the prisoner, "What is this about the child? this ought not to be; have you been lying upon it, or smothering it in any way? now you have got the child, you must take care of it, it is no use making bad worse;" or something to that effect—she said something, to show that she denied having done anything to the child—I then left her; I did not see the child again alive—I saw it dead about 2 o'clock on the Sunday afternoon—I should think it had then been dead a few hours—I examined it in the presence of the mother and Mary Long—I observed a mark round the child's neck, as of a cord, or something having been fastened round it, or drawn tightly round it; the mark went almost entirely round the neck; it was more marked in the front—the skin was broken in the front, and slightly on the left side, I think—the abrasion of the skin showed that it had been done with some considerable force—I do not recollect whether the cap was on then—I have seen the cap with the strings attached to it—in my judgment that certainly could not have caused what I observed—I was present when Mr. Brown made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the principal mark of injury was this mark of a cord encircling the neck—there were two or three little marks, but they might have occurred after death, from the extravasation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240090"/>
               <p>of blood, in the usual way—there were internal appearances of Injury, slightly corresponding with the external appearance on the throat—there was a consi<lb/>derable amount of congestion about the lungs—I thought it probable that the child had died from injury received during life—I should think the congestion of the lungs was the cause <hi rend="italic">of</hi> death—that was most probably produced from some circumstance applied externally, interfering with the breathing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything to show the application of anything externally to interfere with the breathing, except the mark round the neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you think that the interruption of the breathing was caused by that which produced the mark; do you mean that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you ask me if that in my judgment was the only cause of the breathing having been inter<lb/>rupted, I must say no—I do not mean that whatever injury was done by that which caused the mark was not of itself sufficient to cause death—I thought the question put to me was, Was that injury to the neck the sole cause of the congestion of the lungs? or might there have been any other? I think there were some others—my reason for saying so is, that I saw the marks of an interruption of the breathing before the mark of the cord was observed on the neck—my own impression is that there were other causes in existence, pro<lb/>bably sufficient, independent of that, to cause death—if I had been called in and knew nothing of the case, except seeing the dead body, and the mark round the neck, I should have thought that the injury that caused that mark was sufficient to cause death—there was no mark there on the Saturday morning—I did not see the child on the Sunday till it was dead—I know there was no mark on the Saturday, because I made an examination to see whether there was such a mark to account for the symptoms which I have already described—if I had found the child's breathing defective on the first night, soon after it was born, I should not have been surprised at the conges<lb/>tion of the lungs, and the consequent death—I observed how the bedgown was tied round its neck; it was tied behind loosely—I think it was possible, accidentally, to draw the bedgown so tight as to produce an injury, that is, to produce an effect; but there was no evidence of its having been drawn so tightly when I noticed this exudation of bloody froth—it is a common thing for children not to breathe freely from their birth; but if a child breathe freely after it is born, congestion does not usually come on, except from some definite cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Saturday, 17th Sept., I was sent for to the house of Mr. Trodd, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was shown into a bedroom, where I found the prisoner and her child in bed—the prisoner was quite under the clothes, and in a state of great perspiration—I asked her what made her so—she gave me no answer—I asked her if she had been scolded, thinking it might be the effect of agitation—she said, "Yes"—I told her to uncover the child and show it to me—I examined it—it was breathing badly, and it bad bloody froth exuding from its mouth—I told her to give it more air, that she was smothering it—I went again next day, Sunday, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I then found the child dead; it was in bed with the mother—I asked her how long it had been dead—she said about an hour—I had the body removed to another room, and examined it—I observed marks round the neck, particularly in front of the neck—it was rather a broad mark in front, with the skin abraded; the mark was nearly a quarter of an inch broad at the widest part of it—that mark must have been made by something applied tight round the neck—I observed nothing more—I afterwards, in conjunction with Mr. Finch, made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—we opened the body, and found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240091"/>
               <p>a good deal of extravasated blood under the skin where we supposed the liga<lb/>ture had been applied, and also some froth within the windpipe; there was also great congestion of the lungs—I did not observe anything else of an un<lb/>healthy character—the immediate cause of death was the congestion of the lungs—I attribute that to something which impeded the respiration—the mark round the neck was sufficient to account for the respiration being im<lb/>peded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you had seen impeded respiration before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the mark would not account for that—I did not observe the mark then; I cannot undertake to say there was no mark then—I supposed that it was impeded by her having it too close in bed—I do not mean merely by being under the clothes, but by its being pressed upon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it an uncommon thing for children, at their birth, to suffer from congestion of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a common thing for them to breathe imperfectly when they are first born; it is not a common thing for them to suffer from congestion after they have once breathed perfectly, unless there is some cause to produce it—it sometimes happens that children are born with diseased lungs—the injury might have been caused by the child having been lain upon; she might have done it in her sleep—women are generally in a very weak state for tome days after their confinement—they do not sleep particularly heavy after a short labour like hers; after a severe and lengthened labour it is so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 3, Peter-street, Berwick-street. About eleven months ago I had a little boy. I suckled him till Tuesday, 4th Oct., and then put him out to nurse to the prisoner Nash, who I have known, I should think, nearly three years—I knew her by the name of Burch at the time I put the child out to her to nurse—she was then living with the male prisoner—they passed among their neighbours as Mr. and Mrs. Burch—I was to pay her half a crown a week for nursing the child, and I was to find food for it—she was then living with Burch, at 6, Little Dean-street, Soho—the child was with them from the 4th till the 14th, when it died—I was in the habit of seeing it twice or three times a day; sometimes she brought it to me, and sometimes I went there—I last saw it well on Thursday evening, the 13th—the last time I suckled it was Wednesday, Oct. 12th, between 1 and 2 o'clock—I did not hear that anything was the matter with it till Friday morning—about 2 o'clock on Thursday the female prisoner told me that the baby looked pale and faint, and I bought a sole, and desired her to boil it, and give the baby some of the water to drink first,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240092"/>
               <p>and then some of the sole—I took the sole myself to Little Dean-street between 6 and 7 in the evening, and saw the child fast asleep, wrapped up in a cloak; I did not disturb it, but returned home—on the following morning Nash came to me at 3, Peter-street,-and said that the baby was dead—I went directly, and saw it at 13, Bond-street, Borough-road, on a bed, in the first floor back room—I observed that it was very much bruised on the forehead; and when the person in the next room was washing it, I observed a bruise on its back and side—it had had no convulsive fits while it was in my care; its health was generally very good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burch. Q.</hi> Were you not aware that we were going to Bond-street nearly a week before we went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you moved there on Thursday night, the 13th—I was willing that the child should go there with you—it was ill some<lb/>times while it was under my care—I cannot say what was the matter with it, but I had a doctor to it twice—he did not say each time that the child would not live—I do not remember telling the Coroner that the doctor had told me that the child would not live, on the night of the inquest—I do not think I said so; the doctor did not tell me so—I came to see the child at your house every day till the last day, Thursday—I had the child in my possession fur three or four hours of the Saturday afternoon before it died, and the whole of Sunday—previously to the Saturday I had the child home twice or three times of a night on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the 4th, 5th, and 6th Oct.—I first observed marks on its side on the Sunday before it died.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not you tell the summoning officer that you could show two letters from two different doctors who said that the child would not live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I told you I had two letters, one from the Dispensary, and one from the Hospital; and the remark I made was, that perhaps the medicine the child had would show what it died with—I said that on Friday morning, immediately after the child's death—you brought the child to me on the Monday night previous to its death—I did not examine it then—it was in my possession about two hours—I did not suckle it then; I was weaning it—it was brought to me about half past. 9, and remained with me till near midnight—I took it back myself, to 6, Little Dean-street—at the time it came to you it had a <hi rend="italic">snuffling</hi> at the nose.</p>

We occupy the second floor back—the prisoners were there about a fortnight; they occupied the room under us, the first floor back—they might have had a child with them on the Saturday night—I was not aware when I let them in whether they had one—I first beard the child cry on the Monday, I think; I am not certain—I think there was one child there before the other came; I am not sure—I saw the deceased child twice; the first time was on a Tuesday, the first week they were there—I think the first time I heard the child cry was on Tuesday—I heard nothing else besides cry<lb/>ing—I did not hear the child smacked on the Tuesday—on the Wednesday I heard the prisoners beat the child three times in ten minutes—I know it was them because I heard both their voices—I could not hear what was said—the next thing I heard was that Ann Dakin, who lived in the first floor front, interfered—I did not hear either of the prisoners say anything to the child oil that day; but on the Thursday afternoon I heard them beat the child again, and heard Burch call it a little devil—between 11 and 12 o'clock on that Thursday night, as I was lying in bed, I heard some one beat the child in their room, and heard Burch call it a little b——r—on the Friday, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went down for a pitcher of water, and as I came up stairs I heard the child cry; I listened, and heard them beat the baby—the smacks were flat—I beard the voices of both the prisoners—there is a crack in the wainscoting; I went and looked through, and the child was lying on its belly, by the crack, and the man had hold of it by its arms, by both arms, and he knocked its bead against the wainscoting, eight times: I counted—I heard him say, "No, you little devil, I am d——d if you shall master me"—I heard the woman's voice as well—I went up stairs to my own room then, and the child was crying still—on the Saturday the child was crying, and they were beating it, but I did not hear any voice—the child was there very nearly a fortnight, during which time I heard the child beaten a great many times; I did not count—it was beaten every day—I did not make a complaint to anybody—the child was eleven months old—I did not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside in London-road. About 9 o'clock on Friday morning this child was brought to me by two per<lb/>sons—the female prisoner was one—it was nearly dead—it died almost imme<lb/>diately after I saw it; about half a minute afterwards, or it might be rather more—I examined it externally, and found two or three bruises on the fore-bead—I did not take off the clothes, I merely passed my hand along the spine, and examined the arms—next day I saw it undressed—I then examined it externally, and observed bruises on the forehead—the child had laid on its back some time, which had caused the blood to gravitate, and prevented my making a proper examination there, as that had produced discoloration of the skin, which made it difficult to discern whether there were bruises there or not—on the next day, Saturday, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I re<lb/>moved</p>

               <p>the upper portion of the skull, and examined the brain—I found very great congestion of the brain in its membranes, and an effusion of serum into the ventricles of the brain—I examined the viscera—they were all healthy—I found no symptoms of water on the brain, and no trace of any organic disease, no symptoms of any disease of any standing—there was no old disease—there was nothing about the state of the child to account for its death, except the appearances I observed on the brain—there was no trace of softening of the structure of the brain, nothing but the congestion and effusion—if a child of eleven months old had been beaten day after day for eight or nine days, that would be likely to produce congestion of the brain, and effusion, such as I found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think it would be likely to be produced by weaning, and sepa<lb/>ration from the mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen that effect; but I should wish to add, that anything which would excite the passions would produce it—any excitement has a tendency to produce such a state—fits and convulsions pro<lb/>duce the same appearances—I have not ascertained anything to lead me to think that the appearances I saw were produced by fits and convulsions—the appearance of the child was not such as led me to suppose that it had been subject to fits or convulsions—danger to the child from beating would depend upon its age—the beating of so young a child as this would be likely to pro<lb/>duce a dangerous state of excitement—the beating of a very young infant, eleven months old, such as has been described, would be liable to produce congestion of its brain—congestion is an engorgement of the blood-vessels of the brain—they would be over-filled with blood, an unnatural fulness; and when the blood is too plentiful, then the serum pours out, and that causes death—the serum is the watery portion of the blood—congestion might have lasted for several days—I cannot say the exact time—it might have been only twenty-four hours—in my opinion it could only have been twenty-four hours, to the extent I saw it—there might have been a less degree of congestion for two or three hours, and an intense degree for twenty-four hours; in my judgment effusion had taken place seven or eight hours, or it might have been to a small extent more—the effect of a great degree of congestion or effusion is to produce a state of stupor—a person suffering from an intense degree of congestion or effusion appears to be in a state of heavy sleep, so that it is possible that a mother, seeing a child under such circumstances, may have supposed that it was fast asleep—I suppose that, if the mother had seen the child asleep at 7 o'clock in the evening, and it died between 8 and 9 o'clock the following morning, that it was suffering from congestion at the time she saw it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burch. Q.</hi> The only question is, whether congestion of the brain might not have been coming on for some days previous to the death of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have stated that it might—taking the child away from the mother at such a period might add to the congestion still more—I think I have stated that a convulsive fit is sufficient to cause the death of a child when it is suffering under congestion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADDISON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose congestion, as soon as it exists, immediately shows itself by external symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does—the child could not be considered to be well when it was suffering from slight congestion—very shortly after congestion commenced, it would not appear well—there would be a degree of heat about the head, and it would put its hands to its head, and it would he restless—the eyes do not generally show it in infants.</p>

               <p>open hand, that could be done without leaving marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on the severity—it would produce a redness of the skin in a child of that age, but would not produce marks of bruises, unless it was very severe—I observed two or three bruises on the forehead—judging from my experi<lb/>ence, I should say that they had existed four or five days, or it might have been more; it is very difficult to ascertain—I should say they must have been there four days at the least—it is very uncertain how long marks of bruises remain—it depends on the severity, and on the degree of effusion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Burch's Defence.</hi> The child was brought to me on Tuesday, 4th Oct., by the mother herself; she has been in the habit of seeing it three or four times a day; sometimes she had it three or four hours at a stretch of a morn<lb/>ing; it was labouring under a severe cold, and had a dreadful <hi rend="italic">snuffling</hi> of the nose, which produced a very unpleasant noise; on the Tuesday, as I was washing myself to go out to work, there was a button off my shirt; the female prisoner, who was nursing the child, put it down to put the button on my shirt; the child made a noise; I took it up, and it dirtied me, and I gave it two or three smart pats on the bottom; Mrs. Dakin then came, and the female prisoner spoke to her; she gave me abuse, and of course I gave her the same—I found it was getting too hot for the female prisoner, and I went out, and told Mrs. Dakin to mind her own business, and attend to her own children; she said she would fetch a policeman; I told her to fetch three; she used bad language to me, and I thought it was high time to retaliate; on the Wednesday we went out to tea at the female prisoner's sister in law's; we returned at half past 7 o'clock; on the Thursday I went out in the morning into the city, and did not return till past 8 o'clock; I went to my uncle's, and stopped there, and it was during that time, they say, that she heard me beat the child, and call it unnatural names; on the Friday, when the woman says she was listening through the wainscot, I was at my brother's in the Borough-road, and from there I went to my mother's, in the Artillery-road, Westminster, who had heard of a place for me; it was then half past 6 o'clock—I wrote a letter there, and did not get borne till past 8 or 9 o'clock; on the Monday we both went over to my brother's, about 8 o'clock in the afternoon; we were living in Dean-street, Soho, and he in Bond-street, in the Borough; my brother is a costermonger; he had cut the quick of his toe nail, and he asked me if I would go round with him and push his barrow, for which purpose I went to his house again on the Tuesday, at 6 o'clock, and did not return home till half past 8 o'clock at night; on the Wednesday I did the same, and the female prisoner came to me at 6 o'clock, and returned with me at a quarter to 10 o'clock; on the Friday I left Dean-street, Soho, between 6 and 7 o'clock, and have not been in the house since, therefore it is utter perjury for the woman to say she heard my voice in the room, beating the child; my brother is here to prove what I assert; on the Thursday night in question the child would not eat its supper; I took it down to my sister in law, and gave it a spoonful of castor oil, as its bowels had not been opened; on the Thursday I went to my brother's, and when I returned the child bad got out of bed; but it could get no blow, because we sleep on the floor; I went on my rounds again with the barrow, and the female prisoner sent for me, and I found the child in a convulsive fit; the women came and advised her to take it to a doctor, and when she brought it back it was dead; it stands to reason, that if I had hit the child eight times against the wall, it would have hurt the skull; if I had beaten the child, it stands to reason that the women would have told the mother.</p>
