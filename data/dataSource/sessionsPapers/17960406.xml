Jack, I am sorry it is you; I don't recollect that he made any answer; immediately upon that out ran a pig out of a sack; I took hold of the sacks, and found something heavy; I looked close by the sack, and there lay a pig hardly dead, quite warm; I went round the cart, and clapped my hand on Morris's shoulder, who was at the back of the other cart, and said, come with me, or words to that effect, and desired Bradshaw to take hold of him on the other side; we took no further notice of Crossby, till the next morning; when the constable, hearing what I had to say, took him into custody; I desired my man to take care of Morris, while I called up Mr. Denby, and the pigs were left with him; there were two live pigs in the bag, besides the slaughtered one, but one of them made his escape.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Young bring you any pigs that night? - A. Yes; one dead, and one alive, in a sack, they were my pigs; the dead one had a particular mark, it was a boar-pig, and I was going to cut him, but I thought the string was so swelled, it was not proper; the live pig I have no doubt was mine, from the size and age of it, and its mother took to it.(The prisoners did not say any thing in their defence).</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Does she rent the house too, or you only? - A. Myself; I am the only tenant: On the 17th of February, about six o'clock, I lost a gravy spoon, four table spoons, six tea spoons, two salt spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, two pounds of tea,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060005"/>and a pound of coffee, they were taken from a closet in the drawing-room, there was a mustard pot with them, and that was left behind; I had used them in the afternoon.</p>




               <p>Q. What was the value of the gravy spoon? - A. The silversmith that bought part of them, valued them yesterday at Clerkenwell; it cost me 3l. 5s; and the prisoner came and took lodgings of my sister for his master and mistress; he was footman to a family that visued a gentleman that had a part of our house; he lived with Mrs. Coles of Highgate; I have seen him come with his mistress very frequently, for this year and an half; he dined at our house that day, and said, his master and mistress would come in the evening.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How late did he continue after dinner? - A. He went for his master and mistress between six and seven, and never returned; our servants set up for them till one in the morning; the next morning, the lock where the plate was, was broke, and I missed the things I have before-named; I gave the information at Bow-street; he was taken by a gentleman he robbed in London-street.</p>
               <p>- DONALDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of February, in Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; upon going to Duke-street, with a gentleman of the name of Williams, that had been robbed, I searched him, and found a pair of silver tea tongs, a silver tea spoon, and this parcel of tea, (producing them), twelve guineas and an half, 8s. 6d. in silver, and 4d. in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aldridge. The spoon don't belong to me, the tongs do, and the tea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How do you know the tea belongs to you? - A. Only from my grocer's having sworn to it.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mrs. Short: On Thursday morning last, the tallest of these two boys, Purcell, came into the shop and asked for some ribbon to tie on his hat; I shewed him some galoon; he said, that would not do, he must have broader; these two coloured ribbons were lying upon the counter at the time; I shewed him some broader ribbon; he said, he wanted eight yards, would I give him a pattern; while I turned round to reach the box down, he took the ribbons that laid on the counter; I did not see him take them; I did not know that they were gone till the boy was brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those ribbons; are you sure those are the ribbons that laid upon your counter? - A Yes; they are our's.</p>

               <p>On the 31st of March, a little after ten, I was going to Covent-garden, about my own business; as I was going along Holywell-street, in the Strand, I met a man that I knew, and he told me there were two suspicious characters about; that there was one standing at the corner of the alley; I left him, and went past the alley, and saw him, that was the little one, Bailey; I passed him again, and stood at a few doors distance, and saw the tall one come out of Mrs. Short's shop, facing where the little one was standing; when he came out of the shop he walked slowly into the alley facing the shop, and then ran into the Strand; I pursued him, and he turned his head back and saw me coming; and I called out stop thief; I did not see him take any thing out of the shop; the moment I called stop thief he dropped the ribbons; those are the same ribbons; I picked them up; I pursued him, and he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Purcell's defence. When I was first taken they took me to that gentlewoman's shop; this boy I know nothing of; I never saw him till I saw him in the shop when I was taken; they charged me with taking the ribbon; he took me to a public-house, there were two gentlemen, said, had I got any money; if I had any, or friends, they would soon settle it; I told them, I had no money, and very few friends, and they were very poor; "we will let you go if you can get as much money as five guineas;" these two men went to my friends, and could not get five guineas; they came back and took me to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Stapleton). Q. Did any thing of this kind pass? - A. The man that gave me the information begged somebody to stop at Bow-street, while he sent for his friends; and out of curiosity went to one Mrs. Gibbons, she said, she did not know him, and she could not come down; I stopped a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about compounding it for felony? - A. Not a word.</p>

               <p>I am butler to Mr. Denys; The prisoner quitted Mr. Denys' service on Saturday the 19th; he was employed on that day to distribute some cards; it was after nine o'clock that I quitted the house; he stayed behind me; I was obliged to go; upon my return from the opera, with my master, and Captain Palmer, I found he was not returned; he did not return at all; I sat up till past one o'clock on Sunday morning; at half past eight I made a search, and missed the articles specified in the indictment; I found him afterwards at Woolwich, on Tuesday the 22d; I had heard that a person of that description had been about the Warren; I employed a constable, and he was taken up; he was then in regimentals, at drill, in the light artillery; I said, Thomas, I am sorry to see you in this situation; he said, I am not sorry at all; if you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060008"/>take me to London I shall soon return; upon that, his brother fetched the plain cloaths that belong to my master, which he has on now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to induce him to confess? - A. Not the least in the world; he signified that these were the cloaths that he took away from Mr. Denys; at the Marlborough-street office he acknowledged they were my master's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it those cloaths that he has on, that he said he had taken from his master? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where they his own livery cloaths? - A. Yes; and there was a new pair of boots, that I believe were Captain

               <p>Court. Q. They were made for him, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It may, perhaps, be too much to say, that a man going away with his own cloaths that were made for him, can amount to felony.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner run by Mr. Murray's house; I was coming out of the house where I live; I stood at the door a bit; a person said, some chaps were going to rob Mr. Murray's shop; I watched them about twenty minutes; I saw them cross the way to Mr. Murray's shop windows several times, and they looked about to see if any body saw them; then they went away; and the other witness said, we had better go and acquaint Mr. Murray of it; then I saw Randall on the opposite side of the way; we turned back to a house near Mr. Murray's, and stood in the passage and watched them; Williams said, when we see them brake the glass we will go and take them directly; accordingly we heard them break the glass, and he took Williams, and I took Randall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see if the window was broke when you were going to tell Mr. Murray? - A. We looked at it was cracked, but, I believe, no part out.</p>

               <p>Court. We must not hear what your servant said to you. - A. The next morning I went over to Clapham to learn the truth of their account, and found no such persons came from Mrs. Newland, and there were no persons of that description in her house; suspicion immediately sell on the prisoner; I took out a warrant at Guildhall for his apprehension on the same morning; I traced him to the Merlin's-cave, in Spa-fields, where he was taken on the Friday, and this piece of cambrick I have in my hand, was found in his lodgings by my servant.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they obtain what they wanted for Mrs. Newland? - A. That was only some little slips for patterns.</p>

            , being engaged in the East-India service, went into the shop of Mr. Hounsom, for some patterns of ginghams and calices, and knowing Mrs. Newland, I made use of her name, in hopes of being used better: when we went into the shop we saw nobody but Price and another man; Price came up to me; I informed him I came from Mrs. Newland, of Clapham, and wanted some patterns of gingham for jackets and tsowsers; he made answer, they had no ginghams in the house; in the mean time Mr. Hounsom came into the shop; Price informed him who I came from, and what I wanted; Mr. Hounsom said, he would get some patterns, and send them in a Penny-post latter to Clapham; I said, they were not to go there, but I would call for them; he said, he would get them ready by four in the afternoon; I told him, I would call for them about that time; I went to the India-house, and called for the patterns about the time appointed, and saw the same two men in the shop; Price informed us the patterns were ready, and desired us to walk into the counting-house, which we did; Price went up stairs, and came down and delivered the patterns, with Mr. Hounsom's compliments; Williams asked Price for a sheet of paper, and the loan of a pen and ink; accordingly the paper was produced, and we were desired to walk into the counting-house, which we did, and Williams proceeded with writing his letter; Price was in and out several times while we were in the counting-house, and we were not there above ten minutes; I am positive, the cambrick was not taken while we were there; nor could be taken without his seeing it; and it was not missed till the Tuesday following; can Mr. Hounsom swear, that between the 11th and 16th, that Williams was not in the shop or counting-house, or with any other person besides me? or that he had not been there by himself? or can Price, when he is out about his master's business, can he say who has been in the shop? can a man, by seeing a person only once, swear that Williams, who was there with me, was not there at any time after? my Lord, may this impress your Lordship's mind, and the minds of the merciful Jury; we parted that evening, and I went on my way to the Haymarket: on the Monday afternoon Williams called upon me, at my lodgings, by Merlins'-cave, and begged of me to let him leave the piece of cambrick; he said, that he was going to take it to his uncle at Copenhagen-house; he left my apartment, and I have never seen him since; on Friday, Price, and the constable, Allen, came to me at the Merlin's-cave, I came to the door with them, and Allen said, I had better go to my apartments; he said, he had a search warrant to search them; I said, he was welcome to search any apartment I held; they found this piece of cambrick on the table, and Price took and put it in his pocket; they searched my trunk and chamber, and found nothing more; they told me I must go with them to Guildhall, because Price was going to take it to his master to see if he could swear to it; I told them I had no objection; as we were going along, in Cold-bath-fields, he took the piece of cambrick out of his pocket, and I put a mark upon it; that I might know it again; is it to be supposed, gentlemen, that if I had known the cambrick to be stolen, I should have been so ready to have my apartments searched, and having it marked, unless I was in hopes of being able to find Williams? that I shall leave to the determination of a Jury, where mercy will always prevail, and reason is always studied. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, after I had put the mark upon the cambrick, Price then left us and went to his master's alone with the cambrick in his possession, while the constable (Allen) and myself proceeded towards Bow-street, instead of Guildhall; that my friends were all disappointed when they went to Guildhall and found me not there; I might have had friends to have bailed me out; if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060012"/>they had not so disappointed me at Bow-street; I gave every information in my power, that the constable might have found Williams, if he had not heard that the cambrick was found; Williams could have heard it was found, and has never been heard of since; I told the Magistrate the way in which I came by it; my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, Mr. Hounsom could then find a private mark; Mr. Hounsom then said, that if I would tell him where the cambrick was, he would not hurt me; I told him I did not know, but if Williams was found, there would be a likelihood of obtaining it; that I was an entire stranger to it; and that if he had taken it from the counting-house, it must have been taken at some other time, I was a stranger to it; I was fully committed for trial; then Mr. Hounsom told me he was obliged to prosecute me; but he would do any thing in his power for me; and if I wanted any thing, if I would write to him, I should have it; I received a letter from him, in which he promised me 5s. a week, and desired me to send my wife for it any time after twelve o'clock, which he did; he desired her to call every Monday; he allowed it me for two weeks running; and one Thursday Mr. Hounsom visited me in prison; I asked him if he had heard of Williams; he said, no; he would make him suffer if he could find him; I asked him what I was to do upon my trial; says he, if you take my advice, which is that of a friend, when you are arraigned, plead guilty, that will save a great deal of trouble, and I will intercede for you; I told him I could not do that, for I should be injuring myself, but I would consider of it; he left me; on the Monday I sent to him for the gratuity which he had been so kind as to allow me; he stopped it from that time; and the only reason I could give for it was, that I would not plead guilty when I was arraigned. My Lord, and Gentlemen, I hope what I have said may have some pressure upon your minds, in favour of the unfortunate prisoner at the bar, one young in life; and, Gentlemen, the heavy losses and expences that have attended me, and my losing my former friends, and throwing disgrace upon my character, have turned their backs upon me, that I have been unable to employ counsel; I trust to your Lordship, where mercy abounds, and to that Jury, where mercy is ever shewn to an unfortunate prisoner.</p>

               <p>On Sunday night last, about eleven o'clock, I was going up Holborn, the prisoner at the bar took me by the arm, nearly opposite Ely Place; she asked me to give her some money; I told her I had no coppers; I was going to leave her; she gave me a sudden pull by the arm, and put her hand round me; I got myself disengaged from her, rather suspecting that she might have picked my pocket; I put my hand in my pocket, and discovered that my money was gone; I had not three minutes before put my hand in my pocket; I had three guineas and two half-guineas; I immediately turned back, and took her by the right hand; I asked her where she lived; she said, in Covent-garden; I told her it was too far, but I would take her to a nearer house; I led her to the end of Fetter-lane; she turned up Fetter-lane, and seemed to wish to get herself disengaged from me, by pulling off her pattens, and various manoeuvres; I called the watchman, and delivered her to him; she was there searched; three guineas and an half-guinea were found in her pocket, with a sixpence, and some halfpence; on bringing her to the watch-house, the watchman said, he heard something fall; we searched, but could not find any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish him to be asked for the money that he gave me, and then took away from me again.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Had you any toying with her, or any communication with her)? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. He was in liquor, and he gave me the money out of his waistcoat pocket, and said he would sleep all night with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that so? - A. It is not, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Nor you had no improper communication with her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you quite sober? - A. Perfectly so.</p>

            : On the 12th of March, Saturday night, (I had some reason to suspect the prisoner before), when the prisoner was paid his wages, I followed him out of the house, and shut the door; I had, previous to that, got a constable, he was at my hall-door; I told the prisoner I wanted to see what he had got; and in his breeches he had got two pounds and three quarters of tobacco; the prisoner had lived with me a very short time, two or three months.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Saturday the 12th of March, about seven o'clock, Mr. Haynes sent for me, and said, he had a suspicion of his man robbing him; I took the prisoner, and searched him, and found the tobacco in his breeches, before and behind, as much as he could stuff in.</p>

It was not Mr. Haynes's property; I was out ten minutes after I was paid; I have a wife and three children; I have very little wages, and I bought this tobacco of a coachman, or guard, I am not sure which; I thought I could get a shilling by it, and I wanted it to get bread for my children.(The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character).</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you know he had dealt in the hardware way? - A. No; he asked me first if I had any pocket books; I told him no, I had some snussers; and he told me he would help me to a good customer.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the evidence, and I could almost say, I am sorry to say, it does not appear to amount to selony; it is obtaining the goods by false pretences, but the prosecutor parted with the goods to the prisoner under the idea, that he was to return either the goods or the money; I cannot state that to be selony, and, therefore, I must tell you, that you are to acquit him; whether they chuse to prosecute him afterwards, for obtaining them under false pretences, lies with themselves.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to what your daughter said in her presence? - A. No; she never denied having them.</p>

Yes; There was a woman beating a child facing our door; I said to my papa, that woman would kill the child, and my papa sent me up stairs for his staff, he is a constable; and I went up for it; he said, it was in his best coat pocket; I took it, and as I came round the foot of the bed, the maid had hold of the collar of his coat, and put her hand in the pocket; I told her she had no business to look there; and then I went down stairs; I did not say any more to her; I did not see her take any thing out; I left her with her hand in the pocket.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Loosely.) Q. I believe you have been to the friends of the prisoner, since she has been in custody? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, after this woman was committed for stealing the notes that are charged in this indictment, did you not go to her friends for the purpose of making up this matter, and receiving the difference of your loss? - A. I went to them.</p>

            Answer my question, sir; now did not you wish, in your own mind, to recover the loss you had sustained? - A. To be sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, upon your oath, did you not go to the prisoner's friends for the purpose of recovering your loss? - A. I told them, I thought, as honest people, if they knew any thing, they ought to make a discovery.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you had been before the Magistrate, and the woman committed? - A. I don't know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that it was not? - A. It is a month or two ago.</p>
               <p>Q. That it would be better for them if it was made up upon the payment of a sum of money? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell those honest men what you did go for? - A. I went to endeavour to find out my property; I left not stone unturned to recover my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after this poor woman was committed, did you not go to her friends and offer to lose 10l. if you could recover the remaining part of your property? - A. I don't recollect that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, this poor woman's liberty, and, perhaps, life, is at stake? - A. I recollect saying, if the property was restored, if it was 10l. short, I should be glad to have it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bloomfield. It has my private mark upon it, I believe it to be the hand-writing of one of my young men, it is my private shop mark; I had just been taking stock the 9th of last month, and this corresponds with my stock, within two, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060017"/>some of my young men think I have sold; it is an article I keep very few of, for they only bring me in such customers as these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Deptford, I am wounded in my thigh, and have got a pension for it, besides losing my arm; I have got one about my neck of the Spitalfields sort, and it is all gone to pieces, and I wanted something of the India kind, and in coming out, a young man was behind the lady, she cried out directly, the man has got something; I went out and cried holloa, you have got something; I could not run, I walked, and there was a mob, and a cry of stop thief; my friends are not here, and who could prove that I never had any thing on more than I have at present; I have been nineteen months in the French hospital, I never wore a book, or any thing of that sort, it is impossible that I could have put them into this sleeve; I will leave it to any gentleman whether my arm would uphold a hook, the French surgeons cut it six or seven times, and my thigh too; I did not expect my trial to come on till to-morrow.</p>

I went round to a passage, and told them of it, and they denied it; I sent to Spitalfields watch-house for somebody to take them up, and they would not come from there, and they went away; accordingly Mr. Ferris, and another gentleman, came in in about four or five minutes, and I told them what I had lost, and they took me along with them, and within three yards of the place we caught Martin and Jenkins, and they were taken to Spitalfields watch-house; I never got any of the things again.</p>

I bought that saw of Mr. Howell, in Coelsea; if it is mine, there is a tooth broke out near the handle, and another within two inches of the bottom; I was going to look for a job; I have been so long out work, that if I could not have got a job, I should have been obliged to fell it.</p>
               <p>Forsdick. The Magistrates were not sitting, and we went to a public-house, and there he saw the saw, and the mark upon it, as it lay upon the table, there is Mr. Howell's name upon it; I am sure it is my saw, I have had it three years.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the night of the 9th of February, any thing happening, and what? - A. Yes; on a Wednesday I heard a noise between four and five in the morning; I slept in the warehouse below stairs; I saw three men enter the room, one of whom came before the rest, with a lanthorn in his hand; he ran up to me, pushed me down in the bed, and told me, if I did not he quiet, he would shoot me; they then covered my head over with the cloaths, and asked me for the keys of the iron chest, which, I told them, were out of the house; they broke open all the locks, and took out the lace; and then they asked me questions where the key of the till was, which I told them was up stairs; they said, that would not do; they then asked me if that was my watch that lay upon the counter; I said, yes, it is, but, I am sure you will not take that; they said, no, they would not; but they did take it; after lying sometime, and asking me a few questions, they broke open the till, and all the drawers round; and they were quiet some time; I heard the man next me take one step from me; and I supposed they were gone; I got out of bed and holloa'd as loud as. I could, and the watchman sprung his rattle; I opened the street door, and ran round to the back door, and the watchman pursued them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men at the bar? - A. The man in the brown coat, Smith, is the man who stood by my bed; the other man, Parrock, is the man that had the lanthorn in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure of that? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see them again? - A. A very little time after; it might be a quarter of an hour, or not so much, at she watch-house; when I came to the watch-house our goods had been taken from them; they were both in custody; one at the Mary-le-bonne watch-house, and the other at the watch-house in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the property? -

               <p>Q. There is a room which you consider as his room, when he is there, that you call Mr. Hillier's room? - A. No.</p>

            Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore, whatever persons you saw, you saw them with all that terror upon your mind? - A. Yes; I saw them two minutes before they came to me; as if they were surprised to find me there; I had a full view of them from head to foot.</p>
               <p>Q. For a short time, and that only by the light of a dark lanthorn? - A. They turned round, and were all over the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Still you were under considerable alarm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person was likely to be mistaken it would be at a time when under considerable alarm? A. When I awake from my sleep. I know what I am about, as well as if I had been awake a long time.</p>

               <p>Q. Over which they have no controul? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard this alarm given by your nephew? A. Yes; I had been disturbed for a quarter of an hour or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where the house was broke? - A. Yes; I ran into the street with a cutlass in my hand; I thought my nephew had pursued the prisoners, and went to assist him; I always make it a rule, every night that I am in town, to see that the doors are fast; and I can answer that every thing was safe; there were three or four hundred empty cards of lace lying about the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have two partners in your business? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. To whom is the lease granted? - A. To me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the rent paid generally, or is it paid to you, by them, as a consideration for the trade? - A. It is paid out of the general account.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the sum allowed out of the trade the sum you paid for the rent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Still that rent is paid out of the partnership fund? - A. Yes; and so is every thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. It arises out of the profits of that trade? - A. Yes; my nephew comes to town once a year, as a visitor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And he does contribute to the rent when he comes? - A. There is no room appropriated to him at all; and when he comes to town, he always comes as a visitor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Don't you conceive that all the partners have a right to sleep there? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am an officer belonging to the Public-office in Worship-street: On the 4th of March last, I went to Blue-anchor-yard, Rosemary-lane, we had had an information of coining going on, we went to search the house, and a little girl ran out into another house, where these two people were found, two doors from the other house; I followed her, she knocked at the door, and somebody opened that door; when I went into the house, the prisoner Read was sitting close by a table, and Rymes by the fire-side; Read was rubbing something close by that table where this board was,(producing a long deal board,) as soon as I went in, he got up from his seat, and went near to the middle of the room, there was a bed in the room, with both his hands behind him; I then called Ray in, and asked the prisoner Read, what he had in his hands; I took his hands from behind him, and the ends of his fingers and thumbs were white with the scowering-paper, I should suppose, or whatever he had been at, and the other part was very black; Ray searched the room, and I searched the prisoner; I saw Ray find some sixpences upon the table, close to where this man was sitting down; several pieces of sandy paper, and some cork, and a file, with the file dust in the teeth of the file; I saw all these things found, and I took care of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare that file dust upon the file, with the counterfeit money? - A. Yes; and it exactly corresponded, and so it was upon the board; I did not find any thing else; I searched Read, and Rymes was all this time sitting at the fire; I knew him before, and I said, you shall go to the Magistrate too, says he, Mr. Harper, you won't take me, I am doing nothing; it matters none, says

               <p>Q. Did you find the room door open or shut? - A. It was opened to the girl; the street door opens into the room, there is no other door, I slipped in behind the girl.</p>
               <p>Q. In all your experience, who have taken as many coiners, as most men, did you ever see a person at work with the door in that situation.</p>

               <p>I belong to the same office; I went with the last witness and found the two prisoners and searched the house; upon a table there laid these sixpences (producing them,) that had been just fresh field, and this file by the side of them; and in the drawer, I found some brimstone, and some cream of rather, some scowering-paper and some cork; over the fire-place, I found in different papers, parcels of sixpences,(producing them,) these two papers I found likewise,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060023"/>upon the mantle-piece; I then got up upon the dresser, and in a bason I found these, (a great number of sixpences,) and I also found the blacking faucer, (producing it,) and a leathern apron stained with aqua-sortis, (producing it,) two pieces of scowering paper that lay upon the ground, that had been worked with; the prisoner(Read) said, that apron belonged to him; I found also, a pair of pliers, and some composition file dust.</p>
               <p>(To Harper). Look at those things. - A. This blacking is what they do them with, when they are almost finished, to make them sit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. From your experience of these things, are those materials such as are proper to make counterfeit money sit for circulation? - A They are.</p>

               <p>Read's defence. My Lord, I am entirely innocent of the charge; I am a cabinet maker by profession; my wife went to see her brother, and picked up these things tied up in an apron; I have a little girl at home subject to pull things about the room; and they were found in that situation; I am entirely innocent of the charge; Mr. Harper has said that which is false.(Rymes was not put upon his defence.)</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Baird: On the 18th of February, I went out for some tea, and left my fellow servant, William White, in care of the kitchen; I shut the kitchen door, with a spring lock, and the scullery door with a latch; when I came back, I found the scullery door open, that opens into the kitchen, and the kitchen door shut; and the area steps door was open; we suppose he came down those steps.</p>

            Is there any outer door from the scullery to the area? - A. Yes; I left that shut, and found it open; when I came into the kitchen, I shut the door after me again; I then saw that man come from the laundry door, at the back part of the house; he told me, he had come of an errand; I asked him a second and a third time, what he did there; he said, what did it signify to me what errand he came on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him? - A. No; I placed myself against the kitchen door, and told him he should not go without telling what errand he came on; and he told me, I might kiss his a-e; he went up stairs, and dropped two aprons of mine; they are not worth much; they are only sit for wiping candlesticks with; they are not worth above sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me drop them? - A. No; it was too dark; I was the last person that went down, and he the first that went up; and there was nothing upon the steps when I came down.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patroles belonging to Bow-street, and on the Uxbridge-road: On Tuesday the 8th of March, as I was going on my beat, a little on this side of Kensington Gravel-pits, I met the two prisoners; and hearing of a robbery committed upon that spot on the Thursday before, I had got so plain a description of the men, that I immediately took them into custody; I searched them; but did not find any thing upon them but a penny or threehalf-pence; they had no arms On the Thursday night, when the robbery was committed; I was coming by the end of Oxford-street, I saw these very men, whether they had watched me to see which road I took, I don't know, but I took the Harrow-road that night.</p>

            (To Bagley.) What had you been drinking that day? - A. Only a pennyworth of porter; and I had walked from Somers-town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the duplicate? - A. No; I had neither duplicate nor money; when I came out, I threw the gown over my shoulders, without any thing upon my neck; and a person in the neighbourhood saw me, and sent a little girl to ask me in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hughes, or any body else, give you a duplicate for any part of your things? - A. No; the constable found the duplicate upon the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her the cloak? - A. No; I did not give her any part of the things.</p>
               <p>Downes's defence. She gave this woman at the bar the cloak to pawn; she gave one shilling for liquor, and wanted more; she was so intoxicated in liquor that she could not walk; and she gave that woman the cloak to pawn to get more liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to have the constable here that found the duplicates? - A. I thought he would be here; I did not see after him.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, a circumstance struck my mind very sorcibly, in the evidence: she says, that upon the shilling being extorted from her she gave her no change; it struck me that no change could have been expected.</p>
               <p>Court. She said, they would have money of her to get drink, and did not bring any change.</p>
               <p>Bagley. My Lord, the woman is here that I lodge with, to prove I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prisoners.) Q. You say that this woman was in liquor; now you shall have your choice, whether she shall be examined or not, as to whether this woman was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Hughes. She certainly was in liquor very much; I cannot pretend to say what time she got home.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any information from Ody, about your having lost a sheep? - A. Yes; and I went directly to Iver Moor, on the 12th of February, about three o'clock, to see whether I had lost one or not, and missed a ewe sheep.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN ODY sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am bailiff to Squire Higginson; I live within half-a-mile of Weatherby's</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gowlett? - A. Yes; I have known him about a twelvemonth: On the 12th of February, I was going from Uxbridge towards Iver; I met him at the distance of forty or fifty yards from me, with a sheep, with a small cord tied round the horns, driving and dragging it along; the sheep had a very fine turned horn, with an old riddle mark across the shoulder; I helped to shear Weatherby's sheep, and I believe I have helped to mark them; I have been at the marking however.</p>
               <p>Q. You were well acquainted with the appearance of his sheep? - A. Yes; and to avoid me, he took over the Moor, through a lake of water, I suppose, knee deep, up to a bridge that goes over the New Cut; and that was the last I saw of him.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a singular thing, driving sheep through water? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That made you observe him the more? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt whose sheep it was? - A. I had a thought it was Mr. Weatherby's; but I did not see his name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular about the horns of Weatherby's sheep? - A. Nothing more than that it is a fine turned horn.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did you give any information to any body? - A. Yes; as soon as I got home, I told my master, and he sent another servant to let Mr. Weatherby know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You are servant to Mr. Higginson? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore it was not likely that a man should be afraid of meeting you on the road, with a sheep not belonging to your own master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At about forty or fifty yards distance you first saw this sheep? - A. More than that when I saw him first; but the nearest I was to him was forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been at the shearing of these sheep; were you at the last shearing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are sheared, are the marks cut out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you mean to swear to that mark, at the distance of forty or fifty yards? - A. I swear to the mark I saw; it is a usual mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Many other farmers use the same mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to the crooked horn of the sheep? - A. I could swear to it, if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear to the crooked horn of this sheep at that distance? - A. I took that notice, that what I saw I will swear to.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you and Norman had any conversation about this sheep? - A. Yes, to be sure; that the sheep was gone so and so.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not asked Norman, before he went to the Grand Jury, what he said before the Magistrate? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath. did not you ask Norman some questions, as to the manner in which he swore to this sheep? - A. I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you believe you did not? - A. I cannot tell that I have had any conversation in that respect.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not ask Norman what he said before the Magistrate in the country? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you again, and remind you of the language, did you not ask him by what mark he had sworn to the sheep? - A. To the best of my knowledge, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask him, what kind of description he had given him, by the prosecutor, of this sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that unless Norman would tell you what he had swore before the Magistrate, you would not undertake again to swear to the sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this sheep dirty or clean when you saw it? - A. Very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said it was so dirty you could not tell whether it was black or white? - A. I said, it had more the appearance of a black one than a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you will swear to the marks? - A. No; you try me too hard there; I said, it had more the appearance of a black one than a white one.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you, not with standing that, venture to swear to the mark, at that distance? - A. I swear to what I see; I said, I saw an old ruddle mark upon the shoulder, and a fine turned horn.</p>
               <p>Q. But you don't mean to swear it was the prosecutor's sheep? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. My learned friend has asked you, whether it was likely Gowlett should get out of the way; likely or not, is of no consequence; did he in fact avoid you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Have you never heard of a reward for prosecuting a sheep-stealer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard it from the constable? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Do you mean to say that it was black on account of the dirt? - A. Yes; being dragged over the Moor.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are farmers used to change their marks? - A. No; he has stuck to that mark these ten years, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You immediately gave an account of this to your master; that he had got Mr. Weatherby's sheep? - A. He had some sheep which I thought to be his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Weatherby.) Q. What marks had your sheep? - A. A mark of a W on the near side; a black pitch mark, and a ruddle mark, along the neck and across the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the information you had had from Ody, where did you go to? - A. I went to Uxbridge to make enquirles what to do; I was a poor man, and did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. After receiving any information, where did you go to? - A. I went to Mr. Bishop's, the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Read, the prisoner? - A. Yes; he is a little butcher, at Hillingdon end of Uxbridge town; I went to his house before I went to Mr. Bishop's; I asked him whether he had not got a sheep brought to him; I did not mention Gowlett's name; then it was about four o'clock; he said, he had not bought any such thing for a fortnight; I said to him, sir, you have had one brought to you within about these two hours, or thereabouts; and I told him, Gowlett had brought it; says he, now Mr. Weatherby, I will tell you the truth of it; I met him in Cowley fields, and I bought it of him, and gave him 16s. 6d. for it.</p>

            What is the value of that sheep? - A. About a guinea; she was big with lamb; it was not fit for marketing; we kept them, at that time, to breed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Then no butcher would have bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060028"/>A. I should have thought so. Then I asked him to let me see it; then he humm'd and haw'd and said, he did not know where it was.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a constable, at Uxbridge; I was applied to, to execute a search-warrant at Read's house, he was not at home; I searched his house, and could find nothing in the house; he came down to my house at night, I had him into a little room, and Flack, the other constable, asked him what he had done with the skin of Weatherby's sheep, of Iver? he told me he had carried it to Rislip, and sold it to Mr. Newman's man, a fellmonger, which is about six miles from Uxbridge. On Wednesday morning he came down to me, and told me. he had not told the skin; he told me, it was in a little shop he had under the market-house, he told me to go and take it; I went with him to look at it, and it resembled the marks of the skin that I had had a description of; I took the skin, and kept it till I went before the Magistrate, but they would not swear to it; it is here, I put a particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the skin wet or dry? - A. Dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. The prisoner was not at home when you first went? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he came to you at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore he must have known that this sheep had been lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked to see the skin of the sheep that he had, he offered to give you the keys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And shewed you where it was? - A. Yes.</p>

            Therefore, whether this was the skin of Mr. Weatherby's sheep you cannot say? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Then if Ody has said he did not ask you that, he has told a falsehood? - A. I told him we were bound in a twenty pound bond to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you what you said about the marks of the sheep, and that if you would not undertake to swear to it, he was sure he could not? - A. He did say something as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a constable of the town? - A. Yes; and a corn-chandler.(The skin was produced in Court).</p>

               <p>Mr. Knatchbull. I have not the least doubt in the world of these being my property, they have my crest; I never missed them, we were a great deal out of town, and always keep a certain quantity of plate out for constant use.</p>
               <p>Q. You trusted to Greary, your butler? - A. Yes. Prisoner's defence. I received these things from Geary, he told me Mr. Knatchbull wanted money, and as he knew I was in the habit of pawning plate for a gentleman that I lived with, he asked me to pawn it; he thought if he went himself to the pawn-brokers, he should be stopped; I never brought a bit of plate out of Mr. Knatchbull's house, they were all brought to my lodging by Geary; I did not suppose I should be brought into trouble for this, I did it very honestly.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Swale). Q. Were any of the articles he brought to your house redeemed? - A. I believe they have been.</p>

Yes; there is a person in Court that saw me put them on; my hand was very red, but it was not blistered; she had insulted me on the Thursday before; as I was coming across Leicester-fields, at the corner of Bear-street, she was standing there, and a very ill-looking man along with her; she called to me, mistress, I want to speak to you, says she, how do you find money? I said, like all the world, sometimes I have some, and sometimes I have none; she asked me if I had any now, I said, no; she asked me to go with her to the wine vaults, in Castle-street; I told her I had rather not; she insisted upon my going with her, and as she was going along, she made a kind of a jump, as if she was about to jump upon his back; she put a pin into his shoulder, and then he turned round and

               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. I wash and iron, and go to gentlemen's houses sometimes, and she insulted me with that on the Thursday; I met her about a quarter of an hour after; I left her at the wine vaults, and she followed me to my lodgings, and told my landlady I was nothing but a common woman of the town; she said, if she ever catched me going that way again to pick up gentlemen, she would give me a glass of aqua-fortis to drink, and there was a woman with her, but she has gone away, and would not appear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurny. Q. You are the wife of John Parker? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what is your husband's business? - A. A smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Mary-le-bonne; we have been parted between two and three years.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have got your living, since that time, by washing and charing? - A. Yes; my father allows me twelve shillings a week; and I keep my child.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a muff and a muslin petticoat, and had been to Covent-garden and back again; upon your oath, have you no other way of employment than charing? - A. No other way.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much offended therefore with the prisoner, for charging you with walking the streets; your virtue was offended with such a charge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were particularly angry at this, because there was not a word of truth in it? - A. She had no right to charge me with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it true or false? - A. It is true she insulted me with walking the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it true or not you did walk the streets.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not ask that.</p>
               <p>Q. A woman of character, however, of course, would be angry at being charged with it? - A. I did not mind any thing she said about it.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask, whether, when you spoke to that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060032"/>watchman, you did or not state to him that the prisoner was upon the spot, and desired him to take her into custody? - A. Not that very night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not call out to the watchman as if the transaction had taken place but a moment before, and desired him to take the prisoner into custody? -

            I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you go to a Magistrate? - A. That very instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Magistrate before you spoke to the watchman or after? - A. I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. It is impossible you should have forgot? - A. I did before I went to the watchman.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Justice Addington grant you a warrant directly? - A. No; the clerk of the office gave orders to two constables to go after her; one of them said, he had known her a long while; and I got no warrant till Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the conversation you had with the watchman, when you saw him? - A. Yes; I told him, he was a very odd sort of a man, not to take her when she was abusing me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell the watchman you could not swear that the prisoner threw this upon your gown? - A. I cannot swear to it now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you could not get a warrant, because you could not swear positively to her? - A. I did say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am entirely innocent; I would be much obliged to my counsel to ask where she saw me last, and drank with me last.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You felt no particular inconvenience from this? - A. It did not hurt my hand a great deal, my eyes were very much damaged; I had wiped my face with my petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. The skin never came off your hand at all? - A. No.(For the prisoner.)</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether it was before or after the prisoner was taken up? - A. It was as I began to call seven, or half past seven, I am not sure which; she desired me to take the prisoner; I told her, she had better go and get a warrant; and she said, you shall take up your acquaintance immediately; I said, I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say the prisoner had done to her? - A. Burnt her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - A. After that, I told her, she had better go to the Justices; in about an hour I saw her again; she said, she had been to the Justice's, and he could do nothing in it, without she could swear that it was the prisoner that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of life is that woman? - A. I really don't know.</p>

I travel the country with glasses: I was with Davis, at a cook's shop, saw him pack up a basket; he put in two silver watches, and one metal one; several cards of sleeve buttons, several pair of buckles, and some rheubarb; he wrapped them in brown paper, and put them into a white handkerchief, and then into the basket, with some straw; and some oranges were over them; and packed them with a packing needle; he gave me 6d. to carry it to the Gravesend boat, which I did, and put it on the seat myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was the basket light oa heavy? - A. Not very light, nor very heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Davis before? - A. I had seen him before; I was sitting there at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. How many oranges were there? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. So you reformed in the House of Correction; that is the place for reformation, and you determined to be a good lad for the future? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before this had you looked over the plate? - A. I never looked over it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot pretend to say but these various articles were taken at different times? - A. They might; it happened that we had had no company for three weeks; and if we had not the four spoons at the corners of the table, I made no enquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe a spoon is the largest article you have lost? - A. Yes.</p>

            Had he access to the place where this sugar<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060042"/>was deposited? - A. Yes. We followed him to Leadenhall-street, opposite the India-House; we called him, and took him to a public-house, and then to the Public-office, Lambeth-street; but in going to the Office, in the coach, from our house, we discovered a quarter of hundred bag under his shirt, it was a paper bag, he was taking a book out, which pulled his shirt a little open, and I saw this bag; it was an empty bag, made similar to some that we have; we searched him at the public-house in Lambeth-street, and found a quantity of sugar in his breeches, and some in his inside pockets, or somewhere about him, but I know the officers took a quantity out of his breeches, some in brown paper bags, and some in handkerchiefs; I told him it would be better for him to confess it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that that lead that was in the cellar was the property of Mr. Burton? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, but throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you do so that evening? - A. I did, there were a few articles of no great value that we don't lock up; I returned a little after nine o'clock, I knocked several times at the door, and could not get admittance; I then enquired of a person in the neighbourhood, if she had seen the servant; I have never seen her since, till she was apprehended; about eleven o'clock, I got two neighbours to force open the door; when I got in, I observed one of the covers of the shew-glass turned, and the side of it broke, and several articles, ear-rings and other things stolen; I then went to the jewel room, where I had hung the key of the iron closet, and unlocked it, and missed the diamond articles that I had locked up before I went out.</p>

               <p>On Easter Tuesday, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was at Mr. Ralph's, the sign of the Duke's-head, Priest-alley, Tower-street; I went in about a quarter after seven, and called for a pint of porter; I found the prisoner and Simmonds there, they were quarrelling together, something about dictionary words.</p>

            About the meaning of the words? - A. Yes; Simmonds asked me if I had got any porter; I said yes, a pint; he said he would be a pint with me, and make it a pot, and we drank together; Simmonds got up to Newton, and doubled his fist at him, and called him a foolish something, I cannot say rightly what the word was; I pulled him by the coat, and said, George, sit down; he sat down, and got up the second time; I said, do sit down; he doubled his fist at him the second time, and called him a foolish something again, I cannot say what the word was; Newton said to him, if you strike me I will enter an action against you, or serve you with a copy of a with;

             then said to Newton, come out; he stripped himself, and they went out into the yard, and I followed them; Simmonds was stripped, Newton was not; George insisted upon fighting; I said they should not; accordingly I went in between them, and said, if you will fight you shall both fall upon me, and when you have beat me enough you will leave off, they then went in doors, I went to make water, and before I was done, they were both out again beginning to fight; George Simmonds had his cloaths off, Newton had not; Newton said to him, are you in carnest?

             then fell backwards, and cut his head on the back, here, (pointing with his finger to the part), he turned on his right; side, and made a noise in his throat, as if he had the rattles; by that, somebody in the yard said, Newton you have killed the man; Newton said, if I have I will not run away; we put Simmonds in a chair, and rubbed his head with brandy.</p>

            Did you go any where before you went to the Lord-Mayor to make any search? - A. I don't recollect that I did; Sapwell, the constable, went with me afterwards to the prisoner's lodgings, Sparrow-corner, Tower-hill; we searched his lodgings and found two small pieces of linen cloth, upon one of which was my private mark, it was found in a room that had the appearance of a kitchen, in a drawer; I am quite certain it was my property; we did not find any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jackson. Q. You dissolved the partnership on the 20th of February? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you settle the matter? - A. I paid him his proportion of the profits, and took upon me the property, and all the debts; the agreement left the whole of the property with me; I was to pay for it as soon as the attorney had drawn out the deed, that was in about ten days, or a fortnight; I believe, not a fortnight.</p>

On the 6th of Feburary, I went to the warehouse of my own accord, with Neal; Neal did not go into the warehouse, he went with me; I took some samples of tobacco from Mr. Frydag's warehouse; I took them on my back.</p>
               <p>Q. How many samples did you take out? - A. I cannot tell the quantity; Neal waited in St. Mary-Axe, at the corner of St. Helen's; I found him in the same place when I came out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far is that from the warehouse? - A. A little better than one hundred yards; within sight of him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did Neal know you were going to steal those samples? - A. Yes; he went with me to Houndsditch, to Mr. Newman's, the other prisoner; Neal staid in the street, about two hundred yards from the house, when I left him; the tobacco was lodged at Mr. Newman's house, I sold it to Mr. Newman, it weighted two hundred and twenty pounds, at one shilling per pound; I saw the prisoner Newman and his brother.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Brandon.) Q. Is that part of the tobacco that was taken out of your warehouse; - A. I cannot swear to it, but it looks like part of it; it is sample tobacco, being tried by the string, the mark of the string shews that it was in samples, and it is like the quality we lost; I attended Sapwell with the search-warrant, and we found them in a dark place in the cellar, we were obliged to have a light to look into it; and then we found it covered with other tobacco.</p>

            (To Mrs. Macnanus.) Was the prisoner brought to your house afterwards? - A. No, I found her in the passage; she came, I suppose, to take some more things. I asked her what she wanted? and she said, she wanted to go backwards; a constable was sent for, and she was detained till he came; I searched her and found these keys upon her, and the duplicate; there was no violence done to the door. These are my stays, I had only wore them twice; there was a dirty lace in them, and they were made for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming through Smithfield, I met with another woman, that told me my husband would be at home in a fortnight or three weeks; we had no money, and she went and brought these stays, and pawned them; she left the duplicate upon the table, and I took it up; I went to enquire for Mr. Dawson, and this good woman came and asked me what I wanted; she took me up stairs, and used me very ill. I know nothing about the stays any more than the child unborn. I found the keys as I was coming from Chelmsford to London.</p>

What is it, says I, it is only a bit of waste paper, I dare say; says he, there is some substance in it, I am sure there is something of value in it, and we will not open it here; we will go into some house, says he, we must not talk of it here; we are just before the Duke of York's house, and it may be a thing of very great value; we walked on to the first - ale - house we came to, which I believe was the George; we went into a room there, and he took it out, now, says he, we can examine the contents of it; he opened a brown paper, in which was a little morocco pocket-case, and pulled out a receipt for 3401 for a diamond cross; I said, that is a receipt, that is of no value; then he said, there is something more within, he opened it, and there was a diamond cross, which he just shewed me, and then shut it up in the pocket-case again; sir, we have found a very valuable prize indeed, says he, and then he shewed me the receipt and read it; he asked me, what we had best do; I told him, he had better go to the jeweller, whose name was to the receipt, by which he might have information who the proprietor was; just at that time, the prisoner came in; the man, who had been with me before, said, I do not think that adviseable; the prisoner came in with a pen and ink, as if he was upon business; I believe the prisoner had sat down before he had asked me what was best to be done; the man that was with me, said, as we were both strangers, we had better ask that gentleman what he thinks of it, and handed it across to him; he looked at the receipt, and read it, after putting on his glasses; the man then asked him what he thought was best for us to do in that case; the pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060059"/>soner said, I know the jeweller, and if I was worthy of advising you, I would not do so, or you will not have the reward that will be given; if you please to keep it a profound secret till Monday, you will see the advertisement in the paper what reward will be offered for picking it up; I said, I did not think that adviseable at all; I knew two or three jewellers in town, if he would go along with me, I would take it to them to know the value; no, by no means, says the prisoner, or else you will spoil all your fun or sport; I told him I had no concern in it, that I did not pick it up, if there was any reward for picking it up, it was for the other man.</p>

               <p>Q. The prisoner was not at the picking of it up? - A. No, he was not; each of them answered, that I was entitled to one half, whatever the reward was; the prisoner further said, as we lived in different parts of the town, it was not proper that he should have it without depositing a sum of money in my hands; the prisoner asked the other man what money he would deposit in my hand if he kept the property till Monday, to meet at such an hour on Monday, and see the public papers, to see what the reward was for picking it up; I would not consent to that, because my stay in town was very short; he then asked the other man what he would put down if he had the property by him till Monday; he answered, he would put down any sum he proposed, to the value of thirty or forty pounds, that he had no money in his pocket, but that he would go out to his friend, and would be back soon; then he delivered up the pocket-case to the prisoner, and insisted on my not going out of the room till his return; during his absence, the prisoner addressed me, and said, I am a gentleman who lives in the neighbourhood, says he, you are equally strangers to me; I think you are an honest man, and I will see that you are rectified in this matter, that he shall not take this property with him, without depositing a sum of money to your satisfaction; he prosessed a very great friendship for me, as a stranger in town; says he, I have the property by me, and he shall not take the advantage of you, for he may not be a man of the best character, but I will take care of that, and if you want any money to put down, I will advance you any sum of money, to the amount of twenty or thirty pounds, for you, if he has none to put down; I thanked him for his proffer, and told him I would not be so troublesome; in the mean time, the other man returned, in about five or ten minutes, and the prisoner asked him if he had succeded, he said, no, his friend was not at home; then the prisoner said to me, what money will you advance, if you have the property in your care; he said, if I had not enough, he would advance for me, as from the conversation he had had with me, he believed I was an honest man; then they asked what money I had by me, I told them I had not much by me, but what paid my fare up, that I had three guineas and a half and some silver in my pocket, and that I was to receive some money before I went out of town; they asked me how much I had to receive, I told them, 241. I was going to the Governor of the Queen Anne's bounty, and it was then too late to wait on Mr. Stevens, and they asked me how I received it of Mr. Stevens, I told them I usually received it by sending a friend with a receipt, it is payable half yearly: then they asked me if I had any acquaintance that I could get some money of, before I went to Mr. Stevens, as it was not payable that day; I told them I had, but it was a good way off, and I preferred going to a jeweller, and if the cross was to that value, he might come along with me, and my friend would advance the money for me; but the man that went in with me, would not hear any talk about the jeweller, and the prisoner got up, and said, that would never do, he had 20l. and upwards in his pocket, and he would advance any sum of money, and give me credit, rather than we should quarrel about it, and asked me if I would deposit the three guineas and an half, that I had in my hands, he would take care of the man and the property till I returned from my friend; and then I gave him three guineas and an half, and I was to take a coach, and be back before six o'clock, at the White-bear, but they begged me not to disclose to any man what the money was for, and to come back alone, or else I should torseit the deposit money; and he said, if you are the man you prosess to be, you will return without mentioning what you want it for, and then we shall conside in you, that you will keep it a secret; they said, they must not lose time, got up in a hurry, and called a coach; I asked the coachman what the fare was to Aldgate and back, he said, 5s. Come, come, said the prisoner, don't lose time about the fare, and they both of them rose me up into the coach, shut the door upon me, and desired the coachman to drive on; I went to my acquaintance, and he gave me a check on his banker for 201. I returned by the same coach, near to the White-bear, Piccadilly, and at a little distance, I could see the prisoner on the other side of the street, looking into the coach, as I thought, to see if I was the person, and he then immediately came up to the coach door; he asked me if I had got the money, I told him I had; he asked me how much, and if I had told my acquaintance what it was for; I said, I told him that I had a use for the money, but did not explain what use, and that my friend made no farther enquiry what I wanted it for, but gave me a check payable to bearer; just at that time, the other man came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060060"/>up to the side of the coach, and asked me if I had the money, I told him I had; yes, says the prisoner, he had got 201. he has done very well, he has not told his business; then they desired me to pay the coachman, and we would go in and settle the matter; I told him I did not intend to make any stay, and the coachman should take me back again; no, say they, pay him now, you may return back by another, we will get you a coach, and take you back a shorter way; I paid the coachman, and they took me into Panton-street, to a little ale-house there, the Union-arms; I told him I did not like to sit down in that house, that that was not the White-bear where they promised to meet me; the prisoner said, I need not be afraid, for he knew the man of the house very well; I told them I had got no cash; the other man seemed to be ignorant, and not to understand whether it was payable or not, and asked the prisoner whether it would do or not? yes, says he, it is very good payment, it is payable to bearer; the other man scrupled to take it at first. He then said, I should have the property if I would give him the check, and three guineas and a half, upon condition it should be sealed up with my seal, that I should not open it before one o'clock on Monday, nor disclose this business to any body, otherwise I should forseit all the money I had deposited; I begged leave to see it, and examine it; but they were in a great hurry, and wrapped it up in brown paper, and sealed it with three seals, left one should break, and gave it me into my hand, and they were to call on me on Monday noon; we then all went out together, and they walked with me to a coach; the prisoner said, he would see me restified, and would wait upon me with the other two on Monday at one o'clock, at Mr. Francis's, No. 63, Aldgate. I waited at home till one o'clock, and they did not come; I then told Mr. Francis I was afraid I had lost the check I had had of him. On the Wednesday following, I went to the Boltin-Tun, Fleet-street, to take the coach, to go out of town; I told the coachman I would go on to Oxford-road, and meet the coach there; and, as I was going from the inn, between that and Templebar, I met the prisoner; as he passed by me, he was in conversation with another person; when they had passed me, I told the young man that was with me, that that was one of the men that took my money; I turned back and addressed him, Sir, how do you do? and begged him to stop, he was in a hurry going on; I said, don't you recollect seeing me on Saturday evening? No, says he, I don't, you must mistake the person; I told him I knew him perfectly well; that I had reason to recollect him, if he did not me; I asked the gentleman who was in conversation with him if he knew the prisoner? and he said he never saw him before; I said he had taken my money from me on Saturday evening, and he was then walking away very fast, he would not hear the conversation; I turned back to keep my eye upon him, and the gentleman stepped on one side, and I saw no more of him; the prisoner said he would not be detained, that he was going upon business; I said, I would insist upon his going before a Magistrate; he said he would, but he would not be stopped in the street; I enquired for a Magistrate, and went over with him to a Mr. Wright's; he said he would not be detained; Mr. Wright was not in the way, but somebody there said, I will detain him; you are my prisoner, Sir, and then a constable was sent for, and he was taken before a Magistrate; the next day he was bailed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the same dress then that he was in on the Saturday? - A. I believe, chiefly; but I did not take so much notice of his dress as of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he have been with you on the Saturday in the whole? -

            By one of their watches it was twenty minutes after four; when I came out of the house, to go for the money, I looked at my watch, I don't know what time it was when I came from the White-horse-Cellar; we might be in the publick-house about three quarters of an hour, or it may be an hour; when I met him on the Wednesday, I spoke to him, and from his articulate manner of speaking, I was confirmed that he was the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. In the first place, let me ask you, whether you were not apprized at the Magistrates office, on the second day, by the officers, of who Mr. Wilson is, and that they knew, as well as they know where St. Paul's stands, who it was that had played this trick upon you? - A. No such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not apprized who Mr. Wilson was? - A. I believe him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let me try your feelings a little; do you or do you not feel you have injured that gentleman beyond the power of reparation? - A. I should have felt it if I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you really persuade your heart, at this moment, after all you have heard, that he was the person? - A. He is the man that took my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the first time of your being in London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you never heard of any thing of this kind? - A. Yes, I have, but it never occurred to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the man produced a receipt for this thing first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            What became of this diamond cross? - A. I have it; (produces it).</p>

               <p>Q. You advised them to find out the jeweller that had made this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an opportunity of seeing who the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060061"/>jeweller was by the inspection of the receipt? - A. I just had the inspection of it once.</p>
               <p>Q. It was this third person that told you you were entitled to half with the finder? -

            Each of them did.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore all your solicitude about the jeweller fell to the ground when that was talked of? - A. I saw the receipt, and wanted a copy of it; if I had had it I would have gone to him.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it that you opened it; because there is no apprehension of your forfeiting the deposit-money now? - A. I never opened it till the time was expired.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I take it for granted, are a clergyman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it, that this thing being found, and no right of property being in you, with the opportunity of finding out the jeweller, you did not take more active steps; what was your expection of advantage resulting from this business? -

            From the value of the property, as I thought, entrusted to my care, and I never had the examination of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to be at all this trouble, and lay out all this money, merely to find its proper owner? - A. I conceived, if it was real, it was an equivalent value.</p>
               <p>Q. But why was the owner to pay so much money as you advanced? - A. They both assured me that there would be more than that to each of us for finding it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is only three guineas in the indictment? - A. They returned me half-a-guinea when I gave them the check of twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not open it till the Monday, and therefore you could have no anxiety about it on the Sunday? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. All these prossers of friendship from the person you supposed to be Mr. Wilson did not astonish you at all. - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any fight of this rich jewel during the time you and the first man were talking together? - A. I cannot recollect; I believe I had a glimpse.</p>

               <p>I live with my father, who is a butcher in Aldgate; me and Mr Morgan were going to the Boltin-Tun, Fleet-street, on Wednesday last, between ten and eleven o'clock, he took a place in the stage, and paid his fare, to Gloucester; Mr. Morgan had to call in Cavendish-street, and we went on before the coach, and met Mr. Willon and another gentleman; Mr. Morgan said, that was one of the men that had sharped him; and he went up to him, and touched his hat, and said, how do you do, Sir? - Mr. Wilson touched his hat, and said the same; and said, I think you are a butcher, are not you? I replied, and said, yes, I was; we walked down to the bottom of Fleet-street, all four of us; Mr. Morgan told him he was one of the men that sharped him of his money; Mr. Wilson said, he was wrong, he had made a mistake in the person. Just before we got to the bottom of Fleet-street, I turned round, and said to the gentleman that was with him, do you know any thing of this man; and he said he never saw him before in his life; we then enquired where we could get a constable; and I looked round for the gentleman that was walking with Mr. Wilson, and I lost him all on a sudden; we took Mr. Wilson over to Mr. Wright's; a constable was sent for, and he was taken to Guildhall, and from there to the office in Hatton-Garden.</p>

I brought Mr. Morgan from Whitechapel, and then two gentlemen met him; I set him down near the Whitebear, about twenty minutes after five; I got off the box to let Mr. Morgan out on to the pavement,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060062"/>and these gentlemen came to the off-side of the coach, and let him out into the middle of the street; Mr. Morgan paid me my fair, and they went towards the Haymarket.

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; was he one of them? - A.

               <p>Q. How near was this to the parlour that looks into Stationer's-court? - A. They are two houses, and there is a communication at the top, and at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. What passage was the prisoner taken at? - A. At that which goes up to the printing-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Between one and two in the morning; I asked the prisoner what business he had there; he told me he had been at two or three clubs, or public-houses, I cannot say which, that he wanted to ease himself, and thought that a proper place; and made his way up this passage to go and ease himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the door of this passage always open of a night? - A. It was till then.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it possible he could get into that house through that door? - A. Yes; he could not get into the dwelling-house that way, he might through the cellar; but he must have broke a large iron bar to get into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say the cellar-door was broke open? - A. No; when the bundle was found, I sent a person to see if the cellar was broke open, and it was not.</p>

There is a door out of the kitchen into the other house, but it was bolted on the contrary side to where the prisoner was; part of the things were brought out into the passage leading into Ave Maria-lane.</p>

            (To Mrs. Vint.) In what manner did the persons get out from your house? - A. I fancy through the kitchen-door; it was barred when we went to bed; I suppose somebody must be left in to undar it, and let somebody out, and then bar it again.

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man? - A. No, that is not the man; I returned, and found the prisoner in the passage; that is all that I know.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go in? - A. No; he went away from the door with the things, and told me to stop; he walked as far as New Cavendish street, I followed him as far as Mansfield-mews; when he came there, he took the things, and ran away with them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060066"/>as fast as possible; I cried out, stop-thief, and the watchman here stopped him, and then he dropped the things; a young man took up the things and gave them to me, they were not out of sight.</p>

            (To Thomas.) I believe this young fellow, except being a bit of a coxcomb, and going where he ought not, is a tolerable honest sort of a fellow? - A. I wish to shew him all the lenity I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Thursday, a friend of mine agreed to go with me to the masquerade, I asked him to be so good as order the dominos; he said, he would, the boy was so long before he brought them, that I met him in Holles-street; I went with the boy to a friend's house, in Mary-le-bonne-street, being a respectable house, I thought it better to take him there; my friend did not come so soon as I expected; I sitted the dominos and masks, and made an excuse to the boy; I was thinking, if I did not meet my friend, I would leave the boy at a gentleman's house, to look for him; I told him, in five minutes, I would call and pay for the hire of the dominos; the boy, I believe, suspected something, and instantly followed me; I was making all the haste I could to my friend for the money; I had not sufficient in my pocket to pay for them, and the boy called out, the watchman was at my elbow, and the idea of being put in the watch-house made me run; I concealed my money, and told them I had none; I had two guineas and a shilling in my pocket; the watchman treated me extremely ill; I did not take them away designedly; if the person had called in the morning for the dominos, there would have been the money and the dominos.(For the prisoner).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. His mistress had paid him 14 or 15l.? - A. She told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. You take the money away from them the first thing, don't you, when you apprehend the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any information of any money being taken? - A. No; I had the Magistrate's orders for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, had you orders from the Magistrate to take his money before you went to him? - A. No; I told the Magistrate I had the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Then how dared you to seize all the money a man has; now we will see how these officers conduct themselves; had you any-complaint that this lady had lost a watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any orders from the Magistrate to take that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not take the man's watch, and have kept it till this hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And are you a constable? - A. Yes; of Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you seen so? - A. Ever since it was established.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is always your conduct? - A. Yes; if I have done wrong, I beg the Court's pardon; it was not demanded, we did not know what there might be against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, has there been any charge against him since that relative to a watch or money? - A. No.</p>

               <p>They all belong to me; but this is the only one I can identify, on account of the marks being taken off; here is a yard and a quarter of black silk lace, I have a corresponding piece, which nothing but of scissars have parted, and they match exactly on each side; the pattern and threads match exactly where I cut them asunder; I had missed it, and likewise some of the other property, which he told me had been sold, it was cut out of the middle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You swear to that, because it corresponds with a piece you have at home? - A. Yes; it was cut through the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncommon pattern? - A. I don't know that it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there is any haberdasher's shop in London in which you could not find that pattern? -

            Therefore, I take it, that would match precisely with any of the same breadth? - A. No; because we cut it in equal lengths, and it depends upon the length of the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was cut in the same place, a piece of a similar length? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other piece, cut in the same way, in the same place, would match just as well? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been no scolding, or a little quarrelling between you, had there? - A. It is a very impertinent question.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am in the Somerset militia, I obtained a furlough to leave my regiment, and came to London; I hired myself to Messrs. Ellison and Oakley, musical instrument makers, in Fountain-court, they make instruments for Longman and Broderip. I have seen Baskerville and Geast together at different times, but never to take notice of their conversation. In the month of March, I believe it was, I was drinking at Anson's, a public-house, in Fountain-court, and Baskerville came in, and called me out to take an instrument away for Mr. Geast; when I first saw it, it was out of doors, about half-way down the arch way; Mr. Geast, the prisoner at the bar, helped me up with it on my knott; I don't know which way Baskerville went after he called me out; Geast directed me to take it to a butcher's-shop, in Noble-street, he said it was his own lodgings; I saw the butcher in the shop, and his wife, the butcher helped me up stairs with it, I was not paid for carrying it; I saw Geast several times afterwards, he told me he had no silver, he would pay me on Saturday night one shilling, for taking the instrument away; it was a square piano forte.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Trebeck. I am a music-seller, in Manor-row, Tower-hill; I know the prisoner, I have seen him very often, I know him very well; I bought a piano forte of him in the month of February. Sometime previous to the purchase. I was at Mr. Longman's warehouse, I saw Geast, he was tuner there; he asked me if I wanted a piano forte cheap, as he knew a person who had one to dispose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060069"/>of; I enquired who it was; he told me his name was Longate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that Longate is? - A. No; in about a week, or ten days, after this, he gave me a direction to call at Longate's, in Union-court, Holborn, but I had not an opportunity of going there; a day or two after that, I saw Geast, and told him I had not been able to go up to Longate's; he told me Mr. Longate wanted him to draw the strings up for the piano forte; a day or two after, a porter brought me the piano forte, the prisoner came with him, this was on Saturday, the 19th of February, about ten o'clock; he wanted the money for the piano forte; he said, that the man was very much distressed for it; he asked seven guineas; I agreed for six guineas; I told him, it Longate would step down in the morning, he might have the money as soon as he pleased; Geast came in the afternoon, and brought a receipt, as from Mr. Longate. (Produces it; it was read):</p>
               <p>Received, February 20, 1796, of Mr. Phillips, the sum of 6l. 6s. for a piano forte.</p>
               <p>Federick Longate.</p>
               <p>It was a new one since the introduction of the grand piano fortes; the small ones have grown of less value. I thought I have a fair price for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been able to find out any thing about Longate? - A. I have not been able to find such a person. Mr. Davis called at my house, it might be a fortnight after, and saw the instrument the Geast sold me.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Allen.) Q. Did you take that piano forte from Mr. Ellison's premisses, or Mr. Longman's? - A. Neither; I took it from the court.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no proof that this property was lost from Mr. Longman's. Gentlemen of the Jury, it is stated by the Counsel, that the accomplice is a man of infamous character; an accomplice cannot be received unless a foundation is laid for the felony; and in this case, without the accomplice, there is no proof at all, as against the prisoner at the bar, that this piano forte was a piano forte in which he had any concern; and that the piano forte is the piano forte of Messrs Lon man and Broderip-Under these circumstances you must acquit him.</p>

               <p>Q. Among the variety that he confessed he had stolen, did he point out where any one of those he had stolen was deposited? - A. This is one, he said, that had been sent to Clebows; I, and Geast, and Mr. Davis, and Johnson, all went in a coach to Mr. Perry's house, and when we came there, he examined this instrument, and said, that was it, and I put my initials upon it.</p>

            Where was this acknowledgment made? - A. At his house in Melina-place, near the Obelisk, in St. George's-fields; he told us where it was, and accompanied us to Mr. Turner's; he said, he sent it there; when we came to Mr. Turner's, he saw this instrument, and said, that was the instrument that he had sold to Mr. Turner, that belonged to our house; he did not say how he came by it; Mr. Holland, and Johnson, the constable, were with me at the time. I put the initials of my name in the instrument.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that piano forte of the make of Longman and Broderip? - A. It is; there was originally a number upon it; there is part of it now remaining; it appears to me to be a seven.</p>
               <p>Q. That seven may be a part of any number, you know? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it cannot be by the number that you swear to it? - A. No; I missed such a one as this exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Bates's, was it to you that Bates said this instrument was sold to him upon sale or return? - A. He did not say any thing like it in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect his saying this was brought or sent to him by Baskerville to sell? - A. I don't recollect any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Where that number is crased, is that the place where Longman and Broderip generally put their marks? - A. Always; it is stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of sending out instruments upon sale or return? - A. We have done it, but not lately.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you never sent any instruments, even to Bates, upon sale or return? - A. I believe we have, before the bankruptcy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Bates's business? - A. A musician.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept a shop in Melina-place, did he not? - A. There was a shop in the name of Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a shop for the sale of music there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any instrument been sent from Longman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060073"/>and Broderip, upon sale or return, since the commission? - A. I don't think there has, since the commission.</p>

(Produces the receipt for the instrument.) Mr. Bates gave it me at my house, at the time he accompanied the piano sorte to my house; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, at any time, seeing Bates in company with Mr. Holland and Mr. Davies afterwards, at your house? - A. I do; the prisoner said, this is the instrument, without any thing more; I gave eight guineas; and another instrument which he reckoned at six guineas; the receipt is for fourteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I scarcely need ask you whether any part of Bates's conduct shewed he had sold any thing that was stolen? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept a shop for the sale of musical instruments? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was exposed publickly for sale? - A. No; it was in the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other instruments in the house for sale? - A. Yes; and, I believe, the reason this was not in the shop was, there was not room for it to stand.</p>

            Give us an account of all the wicked practices you have been guilty of that apply to this case; do you know Bates? - A. Yes; I don't know that instrument from any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take an instrument of that sort to Mr. Turner's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. I would have you take care what you are about, you are in a very perilous situation; because if you don't speak the truth, you may depend upon it I shall watch you very narrowly; you will find yourself in a sad scrape, I assure you, if you don't.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Q. Do you know of any transaction in which you, and the man at the bar have been concerned? - A. Yes; he came over to me one night, as I was going from work, and asked me if I knew of any piano-forte sent to his house, between Geast and I; I told him I sent it, and told him what I received for it; he told him, he had sent it, and he aked me if I would consent to have any dealings with him; I told him I would, we had a long talk.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this, and where? - A. It was in Fountain-court, Cheapside, at Longman's warehouse, I was porter and packer there; the first instrument he ever had from me, was a grand piano-forte, the next was a square piano-forte, taken from the warehouse in Cheapside; I took it out of the warehouse; when I had got it out of the warehouse, I took it over into Gutter-lane, Bates went a small distance before me, I pitched it under a wall, in Gutter-lane, and left Bates with it, while I went for a porter, from Lad-lane, to carry it; a porter came, and Bates and I helped it on his back, where they went with it, I don't know; a few days after, I asked Bates about it, and he told me he had sold it, he did not say to whom.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did he give you? - A. I had nothing upon that, it was a small piano-forte, like this, I don't know whether this is it or not, it was almost a new one, or quite, I am not certain, it was made by Gib, it was standing up an end in the warehouse, just within the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it opened before? - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060074"/>Q. Had you any other transaction with him about one of Gib's piano-sortes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I think you did not come into Court the usual way a witness does; which way did you come in? - A. Through the door behind.</p>
               <p>Q. You came out of Newgate, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the fittest place for you a great deal; how long have you been there? - A. Nine or ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up for stealing this piano-forte? - A. I don't know what I was taken up for.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you know what you were taken up for? - A. I was taken up upon suspicion of it, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were not you taken up for plundering your masters of piano-sortes, as many as you could lay your hands upon? - A. Nothing else that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Your attachment was confined to piano-fortes? had you no affection for harpsichords? is this the only instrument you play upon? - A. I don't play upon any.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you steal? we have heard of some violins, you know, that were stole? - A. There was a violin stole.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were taken up, you know, you stated that if they would let you go, you would swear against some people or other? - A. I did not say any such thing to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. But you wanted to be at liberty, and would swear against somebody, and then you should go free? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not send that piano-forte to Bates upon sale or return? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect to be believed upon that or not? - A. You may believe me or not, as you please.</p>
               <p>Q. You positively swear you did not send it upon sale or return? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. We have your oath for it to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who was present besides you, in Fountain-court, when you took it out of the warehouse? - A. Nobody else but Bates, who was in the court waiting for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you settled which instrument it should be? - A. We had settled for a piano-sorte.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the porter that carried it? - A. I dont know, he was a ticket-porter, I hired him from the Crown in Lad-lane.</p>

            (To Davis). Look at that piano-forte, and see if it is made by Gib? - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>- PEACH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I got this piano-forte from Mr. Turner's, I marked it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, the principal witness, Baskerville, I have been acquainted with about four months; I told him that I meant to apply to Mr. Longman for a few instruments, upon sale or return, which I shall prove is the habit, and has been the continual practice of that house for many years, and when those instruments are sold, they pay the money, and what are not sold, they return; I spoke to Baskerville, I had spoke to Mr. Longman first; he could not do it without the consent of the assignees; Baskerville said, he would speak to them for me; I told him, I would be much obliged to him; in a few days after, I met Baskerville, and he said, I might have two or three instruments, as I had had instruments before, and paid for them regularly; he said, the vans were all gone to Tottenham-court-road, and they had ordered him to carry it; he took this piano-sorte, and carried it to the spot that he has said; he went to fetch a porter, who carried it to my house; I sold it for eight guineas and an half, and a short piano-forte, which I afterwards sold for three guineas and an half; he said, if I would give him the money, it would be better, as I did not know any of the assignees, and he would take care that I should have credit in the book; I have had a vast number of instruments upon sale or return; he told me he had applied to the assignees for me.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Baskerville). Q. Did you receive any money for this piano-forte? - A. Not a halfpenny.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable: Mr. Harris came to me on the 12th of March, Saturday night, and said, he had had an order come to his house, a false note, for some soap; and he recollected, the man that fetched it was a porter; I found him on Sunday, and took him into custody; not this porter, but another; he said, he was not the man that fetched the soap; I went and found him out, and he found the prisoner; we took him in the Butcher-row.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of these porters: I know nothing of the crime I am charged with; I am innocent of it.</p>

            (To Stanton). Do you know any thing of Peters at all? - A. No, I don't.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Harris). Q. Did you take the note yourself, or your father? - A. He gave it to me, my father and I were close together; I read it to my father.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know nothing about Peters, what kind of a man he is? - A. No; I understand he gets his living by porters' work.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stanton. The prisoner, about last November, asked me where I dealt for soap; do you deal with such a one in St. Giles's? do you deal with such a one, do you deal with such a one? I said, no; says he, then you deal with an oilman; no, says I, how came you to think of that; I deal with Mr. Haris in Fish-street.</p>
