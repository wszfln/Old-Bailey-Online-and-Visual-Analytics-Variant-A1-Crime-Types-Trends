            . I am the keeper of New Prison, Clerkenwell. I knew the prisoner very well; I was present when she was convicted in June sessions, 1813, of being a common utterer of counterfeit money; she was ordered to be imprisoned in New Prison Clerkenwell, one year, and to find sureties. She suffered her punishment. I have no doubt of person at all.</p>

I gave it her again, and told her to go away.</p>

            . I keep the Poacock public-house, in Gray's-inn-lane. On the 7th of October, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came into my house, she asked for a glass of gin; she gave me a shilling; I looked at it, and said, it was a bad one, and put it down by the side of her. My wife took it up. I am quite sure it is the same. My wife then said, that woman brought bad shillings one day last week. I then said, she is a smasher, she shall not smash no more here. She then attempted to run away; I catched her by the arm. She threw a shilling from her hand directly on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen what she did with the shilling that she took off the counter - A. She was never out of my sight. I saw her take up the shilling off the counter; I saw the shilling that she offered me in payment; I saw her hold it in her hand up to the time of her throwing it away. I saw the shilling that she dropped; that was the shilling she had offered to me. Mr. Loveday picked it up, and gave it me; I knew the shilling perfectly well; it had two marks, like C upon it. She had no other shilling then that, that I know off. I sent for Dickens, the officer. Dickens searched her before me. I delivered the shilling to the officer, after I had put a mark upon it. I told Dickens to search her mouth; he searched her mouth. She appeared to all that were present, to be trying to swallow something. She would not let him look into her mouth; she made a desparate resistance when he endeavoured to look into her mouth.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I was sent for on this occasion. I took the prisoner into custody. When I went into the bar, Mr. Kilsbey said, do you know this woman; I told him I did; I had taken her once before, and she had then a twelvemonth confinement. I searched her, and found on her one bad shilling in her pocket. This is the shilling I found in her pocket, and this is the shilling the landlord gave me; I have kept them separate.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the shilling that was picked up, and that she offered to me. I put a W. upon it; I was going to put W K upon it, I thought W would be sufficient.</p>
               <p>Dickens. She fought a great deal to prevent me from taking her. I put my finger in her mouth; she had something in her mouth, that she swallowed; I tried to make her bring it up; she would not. I know the prisoner well; she knew me as soon as she saw me. I also found three shillings and five pennyworth of halfpence all by themselves in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bailey. The tea and sugar came to three-pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kilsbey. The gin came to two-pence. The Peacock public-house is about one hundred and fifty yard apart.</p>

When I went away from dinner, I left the deceased there, she was at work when I came out from home; she had the linen about on the tubs in rotation for the woman to come to work the next morning; the linen was in the room below. there is a little bit of a passage from the door of that house to the room where that linen was, and a door in the passage to that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you work at that time with a man of the name of Clark - A. Yes; he asked for some water; I told him to go to the house to get a mug. I said, I did not care if I had some myself. This might be a quarter after three. I was then by the barn door, at that time, about fifteen yards from the house, as near as I can tell; we were taking out tools out of the barrow into the barn; they belonged to the Company, and were deposited in the barn.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of something that Clark told you, did you go home - A. Yes; when I came home, the door was wide open, the outer door was wide open, and the inside door too. When I went in, I saw the deceased laying down by the side of the copper, growing; I went to take her up; I could not; I ran back, and called for Clark to assist me to get her in a chair; Clark came immediately, and we lifted her into a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the deceased - 
               <persName id="t18141026-2-person67">A. </persName>
            Her head was cut open entirely; the brain I believe was in the head, but the bones were scattered about the place, and I saw my poker standing up by the side of the copper, bent, and all bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever speak afterward - A. No; she lived about a quarter of an hour, but never spoke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was she a single woman before you lived with her - A. A widow; she went by the name of Buchanan.</p>

            . I am a labourer, in the employ of the Hampstead water work Company. I returned to the barn about three o'clock, with Dobbins; I asked for some water; I told him I was dry; he sent me to his cottage for a mug. I went to Dobbin's cottage; I found the door fast; I spoke twice, I called Mrs. Dobbins; I received no answer; I thought I heard something groan. I went and told Mr. Dobbins so; he said, he would go himself, and get a pot for the water. I stopped at the barn, and put my tools in, while Dobbins went to his cottage.</p>
               <p>Q. How much time might elapse from your getting from the door of the cottage, and his return there - A. It might be ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any body to have been in Dobbins's cottage and wanted to go away towards London, would he pass in the same direction as Dobbins would come, or go the contrary way - A. The contrary way. After Dobbins went to the cottage, Dobbins called me from the barn to the cottage; he remained at the cottage, hallooing out for me; I went to the cottage immediately. When I got to the cottage, I saw the woman lay by the copper hole; the cottage door was open; Dobbins was in the house, and the woman laying by the copper; she was not quite dead then; she never spoke; her head was very much cut, and bleeding I set the chair, and helped to put her in the chair. A docter was sent for; he sent me to the pond where I had been working, after the other men.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether that is the man that you saw at the cottage - A. That is the man that I saw standing at the post of the gate of the cottage; his back was towards me; he turned as I went by, and I had a view of his face; he had on a fustian jacket, and a black handkerchief round his neck, seeing a stranger made me notice him. I saw him again as soon as he was in custody, at half past three or four o'clock the same day; I am clear he is the same man I saw at the gate at half past two; I was clear of it then; I know it was the same man directly I saw him.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM TYLER. On the 4th of October, I was at work at Mr. Whitehead's, about twenty-five yards, from Dobbins's house.

               <p>Q. Is there a gateway fronting of Milfield-lane - A. Yes, it was in the inner door of the house; I saw him he was eating a large piece of bread and butter. Mrs. Dobbins was in the house; she said, I might have the barrow and welcome. I went away without saying any thing more to any of them; this was about three o'clock. I saw the prisoner again the day he was in custody, about half after six o'clock, I was sure he was the same man that I had seen in Dobbins's house; and that is the man at the bar.</p>

            . I was working with the last witness. I saw the prisoner Sharp, in the road; I observed him coming down the same side of the road where I was working, that is the left hand going from London; I observed him bringing a bundle of linen loose, with the sleeves of the shirts hanging out; he came near us; he crossed down the road; it appeared as if he turned out of the road; on seeing us, he got up a bank, through a gap in a hedge, opposite where we were at work; I thought that was done to avoid our observation. Bremmer first went into the field after him; I was close to Bremmer. The prisoner was kneeling on one knee packing up the linen. Bremmer asked him what he had got there; he replied, he had got some things he had bought of a gypsey man, with a donkey, within a mile of Edgware, he gave nine shillings for them. I told him that was a poor story to tell; he said, that was were he got them from. I told him I thought he must have stolen them some where near the spot; I was sure he had not come honestly by them. He said, he bought them, they might be stolen, or they might not; he bought them of a gypsey man, with a donkey. I pursuaded him to go back to the place from whence he had stolen them, and the people might probably forgive him; he still persisted that he had bought them, that he had not stolen them. We took him down the road; then he said, for God Almighty'-sake, young man, do not bring me to any hurt, or trouble; I bought the things; it would be a sad thing to bring him to any trouble; he said, he was the eldest I think of eleven children. When I talked to him to go back, I offered to go with him to where he took them from; he said, he could not go back, he did not know where they came from: any otherwise then he had bought them of a gypsey.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took the bundle - A. He took it himself down the town; I took it over the hedge; he was taken to Mr. Iver, of Kentish Town the bundle was given into Mr. Bush's the constable's care.

He took me to a bye place, knocked me down two different times; he knocked me about till I was insensible. I was quite insensible when he robbed me. When I came to myself, I saw the prisoner with my tin box; he kept my tin box, the fifteen shillings, and the discharge, that were in it; in the tin box were three three-shilling pieces, one eighteen-penny piece, four shillings, and one sixpence. I went home to my barrack; the prisoner was not to be found. I was all over mud, and my face was cut. When I heard he had came home, I went forward, and took him by the collar; I said, this is the man that robbed me. On the night when I came home, I could not get any instructions of any body where to find the prisoner. I heard he came home late at night. The next morning I got up early. The prisoner got over the back wall, and the next morning to that, the serjeant took the prisoner. I told the adjacent he prisoner was the man that had robbed me. I told him the particulars. I went afterwards and shewed the serjeant and the police officer the spot where he robbed me. The prisoner saw at the bar is the man that robbed me.</p>

He told me he had been knocked down by the prisoner, and robbed of his tin box, fifteen shillings, and his discharge. The prisoner belongs to the 27th regiment of foot. I saw nothing of the prisoner until the morning of the 7th, I seized him by the collar at the York barracks; he did not seem surprized at my taking him. He denied taking any money from

I was conducting him home to the barracks, I could not get him along; he fell down a great many times; he dropped the tin box; we went back several times to look for it. I went home. He fell down a great many times, and when he got home, he made this complaint that I cut him; he cut himself by falling down.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 8th of June in the night, was your house broken open - A. After twelve o'clock at night it was. I went to bed about twelve o'clock on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260007"/>the 8th of June; I was the last person up in the house; before I went to bed, I made the house secure, every part of it, particularly the kitchen door; I am sure I shut that close to when I went to bed. About half past six o'clock or seven o'clock, I was disturbed by my children; I got up; I found my kitchen door buttoned on the kitchen side; there is a door at the bottom of the stairs which leads into the kitchen. The button was fastened on the inside of the kitchen; it must have been done after I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the door open - A. I put my son out of the window; he by getting out of the window, came in backwards, and so got into the kitchen, and turned the button that was inside of the door in the kitchen. I then came into the kitchen; the drawers were all open, and every thing was gone. It appeared that they got into my yard from another yard, over the wall. The door was broken open. Whether they got in at the door or the window, I cannot tell; they were both fastened. I bolted the kitchen door on the over night; the kitchen door opens by a latch. I am confident I latched it to go in by the kitchen door. The yard is surrounded by a wall; it is a ground floor kitchen. I went to Worship-street office; I got a officer. I went with the officer to Burgess' father's premises; they are situated close to mine. I knew Burgess before; he is his father's horse keeper; his father is an hackney coachman. Burgess was in the loft. In the loft we found a japanned waiter, a brass candlestick, a silk handkerchief, and a blue quart decanter, it is not in the indictment. Part of them were in the parlour, and part in the kitchen, and I also found some duplicates: they were given up to me; there were about four duplicates. I have taken the things out of pledge; they were found in the loft, hid under some hay bands. The duplicates had been in a desk in the parlour. I bought them; they were my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the articles in the indictment taken from you that night - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear afterwards of any desk being found - A. Yes, on the 29th of July; I was out at the time it was brought to my house. When I came home, it was produced to me by my own family; it was broken all to pieces. I know nothing where that was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before this - A. I did not. I knew Burgess. I saw Burgess and the prisoner speaking to my little girl on the night of the 8th; I am sure the prisoner was with Burgess that night, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You have said Burgess was the son of a coachman, why did not you tell us he was a notorious thief - A. I know he is now; I did not know it then.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Burgess - A. Yes his farther's yard ajoins Mr. Fisher's. I met the prisoner after the robbery was committed; I saw him at the end of Nelson-place, between four and five o'clock in the morning; I knew his person before; he was an associate with young Burgess: there was another one with him; I did not see Burgess with him at that time. I went up New-street; I saw him turn up Bath-street, towards the New buildings; this might be the morning of the 10th, I cannot speak exactly to the day of the month; it was the morning after the robbery. I met the prisoner, I thought it had a suspicious look; I went to my brother watchman, and informed him of it, and when I came to Nelson-place, there were none of them to be found. I went to Burges's yard; I found the wicket not as I found it before; I went into Burges's yard; I saw the loft door open; I went into the loft. I saw Jones and another person with him in the hay loft. I desired them to come down; I told them they had no business there; they refused at first; I insisted upon their coming down. I told them I had more with me, then they came down; then I took them to the watch-house. I am sure the prisoner was one of them; I had seen him before in Nelson-place; I knew his person before. The next morning they were taken to the Police office and discharged. I did not search the loft.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 11th, of June, I went with Mr. Fisher to Mr. Burgess's premises I saw the father; I told him I was come to search his premises; the prisoner was not present; the loft was open at that time; I went up into the loft with Mr. Fisher. I found a blue decanter, a silk handkerchief, a japan waiter, a brass candlestick, and a great quantity of duplicates; we then came out of the loft, and went down into the yard; I saw young Burgess in the harness-room; Mr. Fisher gave charge of young Burgess; I took him into custody, I told him what I took him in custody for; he denied any knowledge of it; he said, he did not know whose the property was, nor who did the offence he said he had nothing to do with it, nor did he know any thing about it. I knew nothing of the prisoner at that time.</p>

            . My father is a Hackney Coachman; I used to clean his horses. I have known the prisoner about seven or eight months; I saw him on the 8th of June, he came to my father's stable he asked me if I would go with him to get a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>COURT. What time in the day was this when he came to you - 
               <persName id="t18141026-4-person99">A. </persName>
            Between seven and eight in the evening; he asked me to go with him to get a pair of boots; he told me I could get a new pair of boots if I would go with him; I at that time, I did not know where I was to go; I told him to stop, until I fed the horses; and shut up the gates; he then told me; I was to go to Mr, Fisher's house; Mr. Fisher's house is opposite of the gate. He said, there was a pair of boots hung up in the back kitchen; he said, between twelve and one o'clock would do. I walked about with him until I thought it was time to go and get my supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the children of Mr, Fisher that night - A. The prisoner did; I was with him; the prisoner asked the child what time her father came home; the little girl said, sometimes at one time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260008"/>and sometimes at another, but she was generally in bed; it was about half after eight when this conversation took place; then we walked about until almost ten o'clock; then I went to get my supper about ten o'clock; I told him to stop until I came out; I went home and got my supper; I came down stairs as if to go to bed; I slept below, and got my supper up stairs, and came down as if to go to bed below; I slept in my father's house, in little Moorfields; the stables are in the City Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed - A. No, I went out: when I came out I saw the prisoner, he was waiting for me. The prisoner and I walked about until almost one o'clock, then we went to Mr. Fisher's house. it was nigh one when we went to Mr. Fisher's house, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any illumination that night - A. I don't think there was. When we got to Mr. Fisher's house, we got over the wall into the back yard; the prisoner went and lifted up the latch, and put his toe under the back kitchen door, and the door opened; the door opened easy; we came back again. I am sure he lifted up the latch. We walked back to the bottom of the yard; we went both of us and set in the privy; after we opened the door, and just as we got into the house, the watchman went past two; it was so dark then, we could not see in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you wait in the privy all this time - A. For fear they should have heard us open the door. We waited in the privy an hour; we went back, and we both went in; we stopped a little time until it became a little light. We packed up a great many clothes out of all the drawers, and tied them up in a large table cloth; there were childrens clothes and different things; there were a pair of snuffers and stand in the desk. Then we went into the front parlour; we packed up a quantity of glasses and bits of old rags all that we could find; then we went and got two desks from the parlour; we put into the entry that leads to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Among the glasses that you took, were there any blue decanters - A. There were two blue, and several white ones; the big writing desk was heavy; there was gold upon the decanters. We went into the cellar where the fowls were; we killed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no fowls in the indictment - A. The snuffers and stand we put them together in the desk, and we put the desk in the hen roost, in my father's yard; the other things we put in the hay loft; after we had taken them out, we then unchained the front door, and unbolted it. The decanters we also put in the hay loft. We went out at the front door, it is a spring lock; after we went out, we pulled the door to gently, we went out both of us, and took the things into my father's stable-yard; we opened the desks there; there were a great many swivels and card racks; we found some little tin boxes, they contained various things, two large boxes of jewellers tools and weights. We covered the bundles over with the hay hands in the hay loft; we covered the desk too; we shut the hay loft door after us, it was not locked. We walked about a little while, and then we began to work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you see Mr. Fisher after this - A. We were cleaning the horses and washing the coaches; between seven and eight o'clock I heard Mrs. Fisher and the children say, they had been robbed. I said it was a very bad job for them; we left the things in the loft until Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it that you committed the robbery - A. I cannot say the day of the week.</p>
               <p>COURT. It was Thursday these things were stolen - A. The next Saturday after the robbery had been committed; the prisoner came and took away two bundles and the writing-desk out of the hay loft; I was in bed at the time. He told me afterwards where he took them to. I went in the afternoon to

               <p>Q. What is Stacey - A. She is a girl that walks the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these things at Stacey's - A. Yes. I told him I could not stop, and made an appointment to meet him. The next morning he came to the stable yard; when he came to the stable yard, I went with him into my father's hen-roost. He looked into the desk, and took the snuffers and stand out; he said, he would keep them until he saw me again. He came to me between three and four in the afternoon. I went with him into Old-street, and from there into Tabernacle walk; we went to a pawnbroker's, the corner of Tabernacle-row; he said, he would pawn them at Mr. Walker's if I would wait at the door. He went into Mr. Walker's, the pawnbrokers; he came out again with a shillings worth of penny-pieces, and a duplicate; I had six penny-pieces. We went into Chiswell-street, we got some victuals to eat; we walked about and parted. I was taken up first, and at Worship-street office, I was discharged. I was afterwards taken up for another robbery, by the Hatton Garden officers, and made a witness of; I was charged with this offence afterwards; I gave the same account I have to day. I was a witness here last Sessions, and gave my evidence; those persons got convicted.</p>

               <p>Q. This was on the 8th of June that the prisoner spoke to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the night of the illumination, was it not - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. You pretened to your father, you ate your supper and went to bed; you deceived your family, and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought the stolen property and put it into your father's stable; so that your father might be hanged? What time of the night was it when you went into the prosecutor's premises - A.

               <p>Q. More so than his own pocket? I dare say you did not go into the pawnbroker's - A. He went in himself; I stood at the door. He pledged them in the name of Jones, Peerless-row. Instead of that, it should have been Poole-terrace. His father is a milkman, and lives in Poole-terrace; he lived with his father-in-law; his father-in-law has his name up Cunningham.</p>

               <p>COURT. Did you perceive the stair-case - A. Yes, they came into the kitchen; there is a stair case door; we buttoned that. I buttoned that I believe, it was either I or the prisoner that buttoned it, to hinder the people from coming down stairs.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILLER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Walker, pawnbroker, No. 19, Tabernacle-walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. When I came to the examination at Hatton Garden office, I had a faint recollection of the prisoner; I was not positive to him; I had a recollection of his person. I have a stronger belief now then I had then. I have a stronger recollection of him the longer I look at his person. On the 17th of June, I took in pawn a pair of snuffers and stand; I cannot say what time of the day. I advanced a shilling upon them, to a man of the name of Jones, in Peerless-row; in all probability, I paid him in penny-pieces. In harvest time, we are short of silver, we generally pay for small pledges in penny-pieces. I believe at that time, I paid in penny-pieces.</p>

I went out of doors, I saw the glimpse of somebody go out; I could not tell whom. When I came out of the room first, I saw somebody going out, and I saw my door open; I went out of doors, I asked if any body had gone in; a little boy, his name is Foster, gave me some information. I returned to my room; I missed live silver tea spoons, a table-spoon, a desert-spoon, and a silver watch. I did not get a view of his person so as to be able to say who he was.</p>

             lodges - A. I do not know the name of the place; I know the house when I see it. I saw the prisoner go into the house; I think it was on a Monday; it was in the middle of the day. I saw him take a watch, a salt-seller, and some spoons, seven articles altogether; he took the watch from the nail or a peg, and the spoons from a shelf in the cupboard. I could perfectly distinguish the articles he took. I saw him bring the articles out of the house; I saw him put some into his pocket immediately upon getting to the door, and the others he carried in his hand, and put his handkerchief round them. The prisoner when he came out, took down a turning, and then went another way. I then walked about to amuse myself until my meals was ready, and then I went home to my meals. I gave information of what I had seen some time afterwards; I cannot say how long it was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I am accused of the robbery, I was in Pall Mall with my fruit. The officer saw me the day after the robbery, he never said a word to me about it; if the officer did not see me, I saw him. He took me in custody on the Wednesday. I am innocent of the charge.</p>

On Saturday, the 24th of September, about half past eleven at night, I had just swept the shop out, a man told me that the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260011"/>had taken away a piece of bacon, and pointed out the prisoner to me; the prisoner then was turning up a court. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I pursued him, and took him in a court; the prisoner then was in the act of putting the bacon in a basket that he had with him. I brought the prisoner and the bacon back to the shop. I gave the prisoner into the charge of an officer. I am sure that the bacon that I took from the prisoner, was the bacon I lost; I cut it from the side myself. I value the bacon at five shillings; six pounds at ten pence a pound.</p>
               <p>DAVID CONWAY. On the night of the 24th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was coming down Whitechapel.

I searched him; in his basket I found five pieces of mutton, and a bunch of onions.</p>

I went after her, and overtook her; I told her she had stolen some of my shoes; she said, she had not. Two pair dropped at her feet; I picked them up. I saw them fail; them two pair are mine.

            . My husband's name is James Smith. On the 3rd of December last, the prisoner met me at the corner of Park-lane, the Oxford-street end; it was between eleven and twelve when he accosted me; he accosted me after the same manner as if I was an unfortunate woman; he said, if I chused to go and have any concern with him, he would give me a shilling; I told him I wanted nothing to do with him, to go about his business; he would find enough to answer his purpose. I then walked away from him. He crossed over the way. I saw nothing more of him for near half an hour afterwards, then I was going down Park-lane when he met me again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so long in the street there - A. I was waiting for my husband. He then asked me if I was in the same mind; I told him, I was, certainly. He told me it would be better for me to comply. He walked away, and I walked away; I walked towards Oxford-street. He walked the other way. I walked down <placeName id="t18141026-9-crimeloc43">Park-street</placeName>

He told me it should be worse for me, not to give him any more of my impudence, or he would not leave me an eye to look out of, nor should I be able to tell who hurt me; that he spoke to me. I then went to turn myself sideways from him, he gave me a blow on the side of my head, which knocked me down to the ground; I cried out murder, and endeavoured to rise, and before I got up he repeated his blow, and knocked me down again; he then kicked between my shoulders, and my neck, and at the same time I felt a violent pull at my side, which tore off my pocket, and the front of my petticoat. What passed afterwards I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whose hand did that - A. It was him that did it; I am sure of it; there was no one near. What passed afterwards, I know not. The blow entirely deprived me of my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come to yourself - A. I did not come to myself until the latter end of the week following; I was without my senses until the surgeon opened my head, and took the bruised blood out.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in your pocket - A. I had an eighteen-penny piece, a shilling, a sixpence, and eighteen pennyworth of copper, I do not know whether it was in halfpence or penny-pieces; I think I had two farthings. That is all I know that passed between him and me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I give you any money - A. No, you did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in a public-house in Oxford-street with me - A. I never went into that public-house with you; I never went a yard of ground with you.</p>
               <p>JEREMIEH ABEL. I am a watchman. On the night of the 3rd of September, I was in North-row; I heard the prosecuterix

In going to her, I met the prisoner runing from her; he was very nigh one hundred yards off her, when I met him, he was runing, as fast as he could; he was in North-row. He got past me; I called out stop him; the patrol stopped him. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260012"/>dropped the pocket and the piece of petticoat when the patrol stopped him. The night constable examined what was in the pocket; I did not. I left the prisoner with the patrol.

I stopped the prisoner; he was running as fast as he could. I took him to the watch-house; I saw the pocket down at our feet; I did not see the prisoner drop it. I had hold of the prisoner, scuffling with him to stop him. The prisoner acknowledged that he tore the pocket from the woman; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house by Jeremieh Abel, the watchman. I was present when it was examined; there where in it an eightteen penny piece; a shilling, a sixpence, and eightteen penny worth of copper. The prisoner was present when it was examined. The night constable took possession of the pocket and the money, to produce it at Malborough Street office.</p>

When she could speak, she said, she had been knocked down, and robbed of her pocket. The prisoner was nearer to me than the prosecutor. After she gave me the charge, the prisoner said he gave her an eighteen penny-piece for her to accommodate him, and afterwards she refused to accommodate him; she refused to give him the eighteen penny-piece back again. He told me he wanted to get the eightteen penny-piece back again; she tumbled down and that is the way the blood came. I examined the pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this girl at the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street; I made my bargain with her, to stroke her for eighteen pence, I had no more about me only three pence and a pound note. I went to Mr.

I asked him to lend me eighteen pence, and I would leave the pound note with him. I asked him for liquor; he would not give me any, I went out with this girl. I gave her the eighteen penny piece; I went with her as far as Park street, then she unbuttoned my breeches, and took two pence out of my pocket, and put it in her own pocket; she strove to get out of my hands; I kept hold of her until her petticoat broke; she fell down, I saw the watchman by the side of me; I passed the watchman, and dropped the pocket out of my hand. I have two witnesses but they are not here to day; I hope your honour and the Gentleman of the jury, will give me liberty to have my witnesses to morrow.</p>

I defended myself, and told him not to molest me. The prisoner turned round, and spoke to his companions. He and his companions, made a second attempt to take hold of me, and I having some property about me which had been paid me by some merchants in the City, I was determined I would not be robbed. The prisoner made a strong hustle, and go my gold watch out of my fob; he actually took the watch out of my pocket; I collared him with one hand, and seized hold of the watch with the other, and insisted upon his delivering my property up to me again; a scuffle ensued, in which the prisoner was assisted by his companions. The prisoner and I both fell down on the pavement, in which situation, I was very ill used by the prisoner's companions. my head suffered and my body; my coat was torn in pieces. I got up again, and succeeded in wrenching the watch from him; the chain broke, the watch fell; the body of the watch got seperated by the fall on the pavement. I held the prisoner fast, although I received the ill treatment from the others, until assistance came. The body of the watch was picked up, and gave to me. No constable being near. the gentleman who assisted me, helped me to take the prisoner to the watch-house, a Mr. Shearman; he held the prisoner requesting some person to go for a Constable; that constable did not come; some more assistance came of the neighbours; a desperate effort was made by the party to rescue him from the people who had him in possession; the attempt to rescue him, by bludgeons, and sticks, and desperate blows were received by those who held him; the prisoner made a desperate resistance himself to get away, by fighting and beating those about him. He was taken at last to the watchhouse, and there the property was delivered to the headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the case and the body of the watch were separated - A Yes, it is still altogether but in a divided state. The person who robbed me took the watch and chain altogether; he had full possession of it. I seized him by the collar, and fought for my watch. In the course of the scuffle, I said, give me my watch;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260013"/>the case and chain did not fall out of his hand, it was the body that fell out of his hand. Mr. Shearman gave it me again; I did not see him pick it up.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHEARMAN. I live in Church-street, Bethnel Green. On last Saturday night, about half past eight in the evening, I heard the cry of give me my watch; about ten yards from my house; I went out; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner struggling together. I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and sent some one to Mr. Jackson, the constable. I heard something drop on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing these persons, did you observe the prisoner - A. Yes; I knew the prisoner well before. I never let him go until he was taken to the watch-house. I heard something drop on the stones directly I said the words go to Mr. Jackson, the constable; it fell from the prisoner, as I supposed. I did not see it fall from the prisoner. Mr. Jackson, the constable, would not come and take the charge. I sent a woman for Mr. Hichman, the headborough, and while that woman was gone, another woman picked up the inside of the watch, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the case, chain, and seal - 
               <persName id="t18141026-10-person158">A. </persName>
            Yes; I observed it when the prosecutor was wrenching it out of the prisoner's hand. I saw the case, chain and seals, fastened together; I saw them in the hands of the prisoner. I assisted in taking him to the watchhouse; in turning round the corner where the robbery took place, several unknown persons to me made an attempt to rescue the prisoner. I felt them push to endeavour to throw us down. The prisoner would not walk, he made us carry him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any blows pass - A. I did not see any. The prisoner endeavoured to rescue himself by biting my finger; I thought he would have bit it off. I received no blows; there were a great many people about us. I was inside, holding of the prisoner. I cannot say whether there were any blows or no. The prosecutor was walking by the side. My attention was taking up in holding the prisoner, in case he might get away. In going along to the watch-house, we were pushed into an entry; we pulled the prisoner out of there, and succeeded in taking the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

             I live at No. 19, Church-street. On last Saturday night, about half past eight, I heard the prosecutor cry out give me my watch, or words to that effect. I immediately ran to the spot, about thirty yards off. I then saw the prisoner struggling with the prosecutor and Mr. Shearman. I immediately laid hold of the prisoner. Mr. Shearman sent for Mr. Jackson; he did not come. My attention was particular taken up with the prisoner. I saw the watch first in the prosecutor's hand; I saw the body of the watch when we got to the watchhouse, not before. I was with them in the watchhouse. The prisoner would not walk to the watchhouse, he cried out as if we were murdering of him. He bit my hand as soon as I laid hold of him. There were a great mob; we were completely pushed about, out of the path at times. I did not observe any blows. The prosecutor received a blow-by the side of his head; I saw the marks of it when he came to the watch-house; who gave it him, I don't know. He said, he had been badley beat when he came to the watch-house.</p>

On my road home, on Saturday evening, in Church-street, Bethnel Green, I saw the prisoner make a violent struggle to get away from the prosecutor and witnesses; the crowd made a great struggle to get the prisoner from them, and particularly they had great sticks, which I saw them make use of. I can only corroberate the testimony of the other witnesses.</p>

               <p>Q. You assisted in sorting Country letters - A. Yes; I threw out those which were for the Two-penny Post.</p>
               <p>Q. A Wandsworth letter would be separated from the London letters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. In the first instance, you separate all the London delivery from the Country delivery, and then you have them in two separations, those which are for the Two-penny Post; a Wandsworth letter would be delivered by the Two-penny Post - A. Yes. It was the prisoner's duty and mine, to tell the charge of the Two-penny Post.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. For instance, suppose a hundred letters to be sent by the Two-penny Post, that hundred letters would be charged two-pence each, and a hundred two-pences would be the charge of that quantity of letters, that would be handed over - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that day secrete any letter that passed through your hands - A. The whole of the letters that came into my hands, I gave regularly over. We finished our duty by eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>JAMES WENTWORTH. I live at Wandworth; I am a servant to Mr. George Hall, he is a millwright. The establishment is at Dartford. I was doing millwright work for him at Wandsworth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 20th of July, receive any letter from Dartford - A. I did not; I expected one; it did not come. I expected a remittance of money; it never came.</p>
               <p>Q. Has a bank note 5325 come to your hands for ten-pound - A. It never did. No letter came to my hands on that day. I received a letter on the 22nd, but not on the 20th.</p>

Yes; I saw him on the 20th of July last, at Mr. Ellsworth's shop; I think about one or two o'clock; he came to buy some handkerchiefs; he bought six handkerchiefs, he paid for them in a ten-pound bank note; I desired him to put his address on it; he wrote his address on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it when you saw him again - A. At Giltspur-street Compter, about a week or a fortnight ago; I knew him as soon as I saw him; he was with several others. I have not the least doubt he is the person that came to our shop on that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You had seen the prisoner on the day before - A. No. I had seen him a dozen times before.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking to the identity of a person that you saw in July - A. Yes. The ten-pound note drew my attention to him; from that circumstance, I have not the least doubt he is the person that gave me the note.</p>

I came down stairs and found my cellar door broken open; the cellar door is underneath the house. I had seen it at eleven o'clock in the evening; the last time, it was perfectly fastened then; I am quite sure of that. I fastened it myself; there is a chain and bolt within side; I unlocked the door in the passage to go into the cellar; I went into the cellar; the patrol and watchman went into the cellar first and

I asked him who he had with him; he said he did not know. The watchman told him he had better tell who they where; he said he knew nothing about them. We found seven bottles of wine standing by the cellar door, some on the butt head, and some on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bottles there when you left the cellar at night - A. No; they were in the wine cellar, and I had the key in my pocket. The wine cellar door was forced open by some sharp instrument or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else besides - A. Some bottles on the floor that had been broken; they had been taken out of the wine cellar, and taken as far as the cellar door that goes out into the street. I missed nothing but the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wine taken away - A. There were to the amount of two dozen taken away from the bin. I found seven bottles, there were four broken; I missed two dozen entirely; how many more were taken away, I cannot say. The watchman told him in his way to Queen-square, he had better tell who was with him; he said, he knew nothing about them, he was going by promiscuously; the man told him going by if he would help him up with the basket, and go in for two or three bottles that were handy, he would give him one for his trouble. That is all he would say. When he went down for the bottles, the watchman closed the door upon him that is the way he was detained.</p>

               <p>PARTRICK LEONARD. I am a patrol. I was going my round, on the morning of the 18th, my dog was with me, about three doors of Mr. Bloomfield's house, I saw

When I came to Mr. Bloomfield's door, I found his trap door open; I waited a moment or so; I heard the noise of a foot among the broken bottles; I called to the watchman, and bid him pull the bell. I pulled out my pistol; I put the trap door too, and stood there untill we disturbed the Landlord. I told the Landlord to come down, there were robbers in the cellar; I went down with the pistol in my hand; I saw the prisoner,

Then I went down again; I searched all about, there were three bottles on the top of the butt full, and four down along side of it; I found part of three bottles that were broken, and the wine spilt, just by the side of the bottles; the wine cellar door was opened, the lock had been forced open; I went into the wine cellar; I saw the sawdust scattered about, and a bottle broken among the sawdust. Then I took the prisoner to the watch-house. I went to Mr. Bloomfields house again. After that I was going my round; I went to get a pint of beer at the wine vaults; the prisoner

            . On Monday night, the 10th of October, my cellar was fast at eleven o'clock my cellar window is under my bar window, at the front. I fastened the cellar window myself; I went down about eleven o'clock to see that every thing was fast; I saw every thing was fast at eleven o'clock, On the next morning, I went down into my cellar to get some liquors to put into my bar; I missed three casks, one of peppermint, another of shrub, and the other containing brandy bitters, but they were not all full; the shrub was two gallons, value twenty four shillings, the peppermint, thirty six shillings, the brandy bitters; half a guinea, and the casks, seven and three pence I had seen all this in my cellar the night before when I closed the cellar, and when I went into the cellar in the morning it was gone. I looked at the cellar window; the bolt of the cellar window had been wrenched off; I imagine by a crow; there was the impression of a crow. I did not see the crow, only the mark of a crow. or some other instrument. I heard no noise in the night. I have a witness here that did.</p>
               <p>MRS. WEBBERS. I live next door to Mr. Hearn. On the 10th of October in the morning, I heard a noise near my cellar window. I had some lodgers which I had tored to take their goods out, I was fearful it was them taking their goods out, it was not, because I found their goods in the room in the morning.</p>
               <p>JOHN GILLMORE. I am an officer. I went with Waller and Wetson to the lodging of the prisoner, on Friday the 14th of October, to the prisoners lodging in Vine Street, within two hundred yards of the prosecutors house. On searching the lodging's I found these small slaves, and two pieces of heading; the heads have got the prosecutor's name, written in chalk upon them. We found several hoops in the fire, and two pieces of heading, and we found more pieces of staves burning, and in the same room we found a bottle containing rather better than a quart of brandy bitters, in a stone bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody lays claim to that bottle, do they - A. No. Mr. Hearn was desirous of trying the bitters with those of his own. I gave Waller, the constable, the bitters to take to Mr. Hearn, for Mr. Hearn to compare it.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Had your name been writ upon the casks that were missing - A. Yes, and I have no doubt the cask with my name chalked on it. That is the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mills. Do you know the staves - A. I do, by the race mark, and I know the cask by my writing upon the head; the staves answer with the head; they are three gallon cask staves, and this is a three gallon cask head.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Gillmore and Waller to the lodging of the prisoner; he was in bed when he was apprehended. I took these two pieces of the cask out of the grate, they were burning; I found the other pieces at the bottom of the cupboard, in the prisoner's room; it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260017"/>there with a number of hoops, now present; these are the hoops of three cags.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mills. Look at these hoops; can you tell how many casks these hoops formed - A. They belong to three casks, twelve hoops upon three casks; here are nineteen there ought to be thirty six: these hoops had been on more than one cask; some were two gallons, and some three gallon cask hoops; the name is written by myself; that head was a three gallon cask of peppermint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought two casks of a man up by St. Giles's church, they were empty casks; part of the staves were in one of them; he had a stone bottle in his hand, for which I gave him five shillings. I asked him how he came by them; he said, he had been cleaning out a publican's cellar, and what was in the bottle was damaged shrub.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your dressing case locked when you went away - A. No it was not locked.</p>

               <persName id="t18141026-14-person221">A. </persName>
            Yes; I know him; he was a servant to Mr. Harrisson, who keeps the hotel; he was porter there, and lived as one of the servants of the Hotel at the time. I have seen my watch since at Bow Street, about five weeks ago; Perks, the officer, produced it before the Magistrate. I shall know it again when it is produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Did you live in town last June or only there on a visit - A. I lived in town; the town is my regular residence, I had no servant at the Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Crisp was not employed about your person - 
               <persName id="t18141026-14-person222">A. </persName>
            He was employed about the house as boots.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not leave your watch in the water closet - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the prisoner at all employed about the rooms - A. He did not attend the lodgers in any of the rooms as I know of; my room was up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the Hotel - A. Mr. Harrison; he lives there.</p>
               <p>JOHN PERKS. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody on the 20th of September, on the charge of stealing a one pound note of his Master, at the Tavistock Hotel. I took him to the public office Bow Street, and locked him up. I asked him where he lived; he told me his wife kept a chandler's shop, at No. 2, Cross Lane; I went there, and searched, and in the parlour there were a chest of drawers, and in one of these drawers' I found this watch his wife was present and a young man living at the Hotel, of the name of Wilsdon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the house kept by - A. The lower part of the house was kept by Mrs. Crisp, the wife of the prisoner, the lower part of the house is a shop, and parlour, kept by the wife only; she had two little children, and seemed forward with child again. When I found the watch, I took it to the office, and looked into the robbery-book; I found the number talley with the number of Mr. Tulloch's watch; the number tallied with the number in the hand bill. I took the watch to Mr. Tulloch; he attended at the examination. The watch has never been out of my possession since I took it out of the drawer; I found this watch in the drawer. There was another watch, five spoons, and some other valuables, all put together.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that watch, is that your watch - A. It is; I know it by the maker's name, and by the general appearance; there was no chain to it, only merely the watch; it is of the value of fifteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the watch in the water closet, and when I found it there was a piece of coloured string to it, and a single key.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I did not know who had stolen it. I ascertained I had lost it; I advertised the pocket-book, some suspicious persons were taken in custody, among them was this boy. Some of my articles were found on this boy. On the Monday following, Armstrong, the officer, took this boy in my presence, and carried him before Mr. Moser, the magistrate; there the boy acknowledged he had changed the five-pound note; he also acknowledged, he was the person that took the pocket-book out of my pocket, and that he was with the others; he told me where he laid out the five-pound note, and upon going to the place, I ascertained it was my property; it is here, and the pocket-book is here likewise. The prisoner said, he had taken the notes out of the pocket-book; he acknowledged that he himself, in company with one or two other boys, took the pocket-book out of my pocket, and when he had taken the notes out, he threw the pocket-book down a privy in Petticoat-lane. He said, that he had spent one five-pound note at Mr. Meadows's, a clothes-sale shop, in Houndsditch. He gave no account of the others. I have the pocket-book now in my possession. He shewed us the privy; in dragging the privy, the pocketbook was found. I can swear it is my property.</p>

               <p>MR. MASON. I am shopman to Mr. Meadows, 39, Houndsditch; he keeps a clothes-sale shop. On Saturday, the 12th of October, there were several boys came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Denham. What day was the 10th of September - A. On Saturday. I lost my pocket-book about twelve o'clock at noon.</p>

               <p>Mason. He came to our shop between four and five; they asked me whether I had got any clothes that would fit them; I asked them what sort of clothes they wanted; one of them said, a velveteen jacket, and trowsers; the waistcoat and a short coat the other boy had. There were four or five boys together; I believe the prisoner to be one of them; I think he is the boy that had the velveteen jacket and trowsers. After they had tried them on, they asked the price; I told them; they paid me. I took four pounds eight shillings for the two suits. I think one of the boys presented me with a ten-pound note, I cannot say which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a five-pound note - A. Not of the prisoner, I had not. Two or three boys came afterwards, they gave an order for a coat; they gave a five-pound note; this boy was not there then. I gave the ten-pound note to Mr. Meadows, my employer. I cannot say where it is now; the five-pound note was paid on the same day; the prisoner did not offer that, it was a boy a considerable deal bigger than him; there were three of them I think came afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner in company with them - A. I did not see him in company with these boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the boys the clothes - A. No; he had the clothes afterwards, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Mason, who was it that came to the shop, how many boys came into the shop - A. There were four or five I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say there were only two - A. I beg pardon, I have said, no such thing; there were four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. Take care what you are about? You have said the prisoner ordered a velveteen jacket - A. The prisoner asked for a velveteen jacket and trowsers; that is all. The prisoner put them on in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they come to - A. The two suits came to four pounds eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take for the boys suit - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said this boy's suit came to one-pound sixteen shillings - A. They were both paid together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, consider, whether he gave you a five-pound note, or a ten-pound note - A. I don't think he gave me a five-pound note; I cannot take upon me to say he gave me any money at all; I cannot tell who gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you have said, he gave you a five-pound note or a twenty-pound note - A. I do not recollect saying any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect whether he gave you a five pound note or a ten-pound note; you have said here a ten-pound note once? Have you seen the clothes again - A. I saw them at Worship-street, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know them; do not shuffle with me? you must know whether they were the things that you sold in your shop or not - A. Our shop when out of articles go and borrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was the prisoner the person that came into your shop - A. I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know he was; have you never sworn he was the boy - A. I swore that he was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260020"/>the shop, and that he was the person that bought the velveteen jacket and trowsers; I have seen the boy once before; I see him now, and I saw him at Worship-street office.</p>
               <p>COURT. You upon your oath, don't know whether it was a five-pound note or a ten-pound note? You disgrace yourself very much.</p>

I dont recollect; I was standing at the door seeking customers to masters, business; the five pound note was brought out to me to get change; Mr. Meadows said he had not change; Mason gave it to Mr. Meadows, and Mr. Meadows desired me to go and get change; I went to the next door, and got change, five one pound notes; I gave the five one pound notes to Mr. Meadows. It was in the early part of the day; the prisoner was in the shop before I got change at the next door.</p>

            . On Monday, the 12th of September, Mr. Denham came to me; after I had heard what he had to say, in about an hours time; I went to Spread Eagle Court, in a room in that court, I found this velveteen jacket, trowses, and hat, with other clothes. I took posession of them clothes. and went to the office with them, and in half an hours time, the little boy, the prisoner was brought to me at the office, by a person of the name of Hareson, (who is now under confinement for an assault upon his wife) I locked the boy up; the boy said, sir, I will tell you all the truth; he then gave me to understand that he was in a market with a boy of the name of Denham; that Denham picked the gentleman's pocket of the pocket-book; he, the prisoner, being a little way off; and they both ran away together. I asked him whether he knew what Bank notes where; he said, no, he did not; but they had throwed the pocket-book with some of the papers down a privy, which he would shew me and the gentleman; we went that night to a privy, but not the right; the boy might very easy make a mistake; we dragged the privy; we did not find it; we dragged another privy, and found the pocket-book which the prosecutor knew to be his; with three sixteenths share of lottery tickets; we searched further for the two bills of exchange; we never could find them. I shewed the boy this velveteen jacket, and trowsers; he said, these are mine. Where did you buy them; he said, he would shew me and the gentleman; we went into Hounsditch with him, I holding him by the arm. I asked him what he gave for them going along; he said sixteen shillings. I said boy, how did you get the money; he said by holding gentleman's horses. I went into the shop, and shewed the boyes cloth's, and they had every reason, they said to believe they were the clothes that they sold. I then asked, with what they were paid for; I was answered, by master, or man, by a five pound note. Where is that Next door; I sent the gentleman with the change of the money there, and by that means I came into the possession of the five pound note. The prisoner was taken back to the office. and committed, I never have been able to get young Denham, yet he and young Knightly I the prisoner that was tried before this, and Griffiths, were all in company at the time of the robbery. The prisoner had a velveteen jacket, and trowsers on, which I took off him. These are them.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mason. Look at these things - A. These are the same, or like what I sold; I might have sold them, I cannot pretend they are my clothes or they not; because every shop that is out of an article, they can go and apply at the wholesale warehouse for the same article, and the next shop can go and get such an article with the same mark on them.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Mr. Hall's wharf. On the evening of this present month I saw two men on the wharf at half past ten. I could not hear distinctly what they talked of. When they came nearer to me, one of them said, Damn him, he will not split. I suspected there were no good intentions by these words. They went down the steps to the vessel. While these two men were talking together, the prisoner made his appearance, walking too and fro upon the wharf, and about five minutes after the men had gone down to the vessel, the prisoner went into a shed, where the packages were stowed. I was placed in a situation where I could see him come out; he could not see me. In about three minutes after he come out with a package under his left arm, and in going round to the landing-waiter's box, going to the water-side, I came out, and went after him; I seized him by the right collar. I said friend, what have you got here? He said nothing, and instantly dopped the package. I said, what is it that lies here dopped down? He said he did not know; he was near stumbling over something. I then said, what was your business down here at all then. Do you know any thing of those men that went down the steps. He said, they came with him to go with the Gravesend boat. The Gravesend boat does not go from that place. They haul off there sometimes. I do not believe the tide served then. I sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mesrs. Borradailes. I watched the gate about half after seven o'clock. I saw three men on Wednesday three weeks come within the gate. I saw the prisoner Hart with three papers of hats in his hand. I rung the bell for assistance to come out. The prisoner threw the hats behind him when he saw me. I stepped outside of the gate; he threw the hats down behind him. I then took the prisoner into custody, and took him into the accompting house. He took these hats from a package that was in the gateway; a large package, that held twenty-two dozen; these hats were taken out after the pack was cut, but there were some taken out before. I cannot say who cut the pack.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent of this charge as the child unborn. I have served in the army eighteen years. I have been transported before for seven years for a crime that I was guilty of. I applied to the society for the refuge of the destitute; it was too full to admit me. They furnished me with one pound; I went into the city; I was taken up by a police officer; it was impossible for me to get any employ, as my character was gone. Should I unfortunately be found guilty, I hope to be sent out of this country for ever, as I am certain I could not get my living in this country.</p>

            . I am clerk to William and Henry Breen. They are malt factors in Mark-lane. On Saturday evening last I was passing the prosecuter's door, about six o'clock. The prisoner, with a lad about sixteen years old, in a white jacket, passed me within about half a yard. The prisoner sent the boy in a white jacket to take up the stove that was standing by the prosecutor's door; the boy took the stove up, and carried it into Jewry-street. I went into Mr. Evan's shop, and informed his man that a boy had taken a stove away. The man went round the corner, and I went with him; he took the stove off the prisoner's shoulder. The prisoner had got it then upon his shoulder; we took the prisoner into custody, the boy escaped.</p>

I am sure it is my employer's hat.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your tobacco? - A. On the nineteenth of September I secreted myself in a part of the warehouse. I saw the prisoner come up the warehouse; he took two handfuls of tobacco from a cask, which he put into his coat pocket, and returned again almost immediately, took two handfuls more, which he put into his breeches pocket. Soon after he went out, I followed him, and collared him, and took hold of his coat pocket, and brought him back. I sent for an officer, who searched his pockets, and took out of his pockets fifteen ounces of tobacco, in the whole, from his coat and breeches pockets, of the value of seven shillings.</p>

            . I have for a considerable time suspected that the prisoner robbed me. On Sunday last, from the appearance of the prisoner's dress, I perceived that he had a great quantity of clothes on; I requested that he would walk up stairs with me, and open his box; which he did, very reluctantly. I then perceived by his legs, that he had more stockings on than belonged to him. I put him down on the bed, and took the stockings off his legs; he had five pair of stockings on his legs, three pair in his bosom, a waistcoat on belonging to Sparks, and shirts belonging to a gentleman that is dead, who lodged in my house when he was alive.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not in the indictment - A. In his pocket we found a silk handkerchief, belonging to me; he had other property in his box.</p>
               <p>MR. WOOD. I am an officer. I produce the property. All these things were found upon him, and some in his box.</p>

            . The prisoner was my servant. On the 20th of September, I went to Spitalfields to buy my goods, as I used to do. I bought the goods there. When I came back to my door, it was locked, with the key outside of the door. I had left the door open, and the prisoner in my house. She was gone when I went in; the first thing that I missed was a light linen gown, that I had left in the arm chair; the next thing was my bed curtains.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is not in the indictment - A. The other articles I had them set down, because I have a very bad head piece; the articles are here present. I missed shoes, petticoat, a silk handkerchief, a silk skirt, two gowns, a white cambrie skirt, besides a dimity petticoat, a shawl, a pair of white stockings, two pounds in money, and two one-pound notes each, that was in the same drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these notes marked - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them if you were to see them again - A. I think I should. I found one upon her, under one of her arms, and the other she said, she had changed; she acknowledged that. I found the prisoner at the top of the Minories, about twenty minutes after nine. I went out at half past six, and returned about half past eight. When I took her I came by Bishopsgate Church, it was twenty minutes after nine; I found her at the top of the Minories,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260024"/>and I found every article upon her, except one gown, petticoat, and stockings, which she had pawned for ten shillings; a flannel petticoat she had on when I took her, and my shawl, also I found a one-pound note under one of her arms, and sixteen shillings under the other. She said, she had changed one of the one-pound notes, and had the sixteen shillings about her; she had four shillings out of it. The prisoner was very much in liquor when I took her. I called her up at six o'clock; she slept in my apartment. She got drunk after she robbed me I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two one-pound notes in the same place - A. Yes; in a little box, in the middle drawer, in the room that I slept in. It was all the money that I had in the world, and there was a sheet and one blanket, she tore in half.</p>

               <p>COURT. I cannot enquire into those things that are not in the indictment? What did the prisoner say - A. At the top of the Minories I saw the prisoner; I took hold of her by the shoulder; I said, you hussey, I have got you; she said, I will come along with you, do not hurt me. My husband came up, and he took her to Worship-street office. Mr. Armstrong searched her. I was not satisfied, and when I found the one-pound note, I took her into a room by herself. Armstrong only found the wearing apparel. I searched her; by taking her clothes off. Armstrong searched her as far as decency with propriety would admit them. I found under her arm pit, the one-pound note, and then she owned to taking the other, and having the change of it, and said she had spent four shillings; and she had sixteen shillings left.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you find any note under my arm - A. Yes, next to your skin, and found sixteen shillings under your other arm, wrapped up in a handkerchief of mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where did you find the duplicate - A. The officer found that in her pocket; a duplicate of a gown, stockings, and petticoat; pledged for ten shillings.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to the office by the prosecutor, and his wife, on the 20th of September; I searched her, and in her pocket I found seven shillings in silver, and seven shillings and seven pence halfpenny in copper; I then desired the prosecutorix to search her, more narrowly, and she found that money on her.</p>
               <p>Q, Did you see her searched - A. No; I was in another room; she gave it me immediately she found it. I produce the duplicate of the gown, petticoat, and stockings, I found on the prisoner; the things are here; these are them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These things are all mine; a pair of shoes, petticoat, shirt, and a gown, in the handkerchief; it was found in her bundle; I had it in my house before she went away.</p>
               <p>Q, What is the value of that - A. two shillings a silk petticoat nine shillings a silk skirt, five shillings, the black cotton gown, five shillings, a cambrick petticoat, two shillings; they are all mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.

They then said one to the other, they would turn back from whence they came. I walked on fast, and they walked on after me; I was walking <placeName id="t18141026-36-crimeloc194">from Bedfont to Staines</placeName>

               <p>Q. Then they immediately left you, did they - A. Yes. They examined my hands. They said, if I hallooed they would murder me. They all three left me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did they leave you, with respect to your clothing - A. They left me an old pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260025"/>trowsers, a waistcoat, and they put an old cap over my head; they left me in that state until half past six o'clock in the morning, the things they left me were very old indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that they were with you, had you an opportunity of seeing their faces? - A. Yes; I am not quite clear of all, but the tall one was the man that stood over me from the hour of nine until ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was there? - A. It was not dark, it was dusk just at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed the prisoner Anderson, did you, first? - A. Yes; because he caught hold of me first. They were all dressed in soldier's clothes. I am not so clear as to the short one as I am to the tall one. I firmly believe the short one to be in company with Anderson, I think I can recollect him being pock-marked; he threatened my life the last time he spoke to me, I firmly believe Dooley to be the man, he is a little pock-marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no particular observation of his features? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Only being pock-marked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more particular to say respecting that man which you believe to be the prisoner, Dooley? - A. No; I have a letter I received from the prisoner Anderson. They told me to strip; I did, and they assisted me in stripping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all assist? - A. I am not quite clear as to that. Anderson in this letter confesses that he was guilty of the robbery. This letter was sent to me by the post.</p>
               <p>Q. to Anderson. Do you recollect that I begged a coat of the other man to keep you from starvation? - A. Yes, you did; they refused it first; you begged a coat for me</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other men say any thing of taking your life away; I pleaded with the other men to spare your life? - A. I did not hear that.</p>

            . I live at Kensington. On the morning of the 8th of September, I was at the Ship public house, in James-street, between three and four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person come into that public house while you were there? - A. I did, about a quarter before four; two were dressed in soldier's clothes, and one in black. I remarked two of the persons so as to know them again. The man in black was one, and the tall prisoner the other. They asked the lad who served at the bar for half a pint of rum, they had it put into milk; and after drinking it, the man in black offered a ten pound note in change; the lad refused to give them change. I was standing close by the bar when the man offered the note; he begged very hard for change, that is the reason I took notice of them; he held the note between his finger and thumb; the lad, after being asked several times for change, asked the man in black what note it was? He said it was a ten pound note, and after another question or two, he said it was a note of the Staines bank. I took my nephew in with me to give him something to drink with me, before he went home; his name is

            Wore you in Covent-garden on the morning of the 8th of September; - A. Yes, I was at Mrs. Grigg's, the pastry-cook's shop. When I was there I saw both the prisoners at the bar; the other person was standing upon his legs, just going to leave these men to go out; the other man was in black. The two prisoners had regimentals on; they had the cross-belt with the bayonet on it, and on the plate of the belt, there was 45. I took particular notice of the prisoners, both their collars and cuffs were turned up with green. They had something to eat and drink; they had only a bottle of ginger beer while I was there. I saw them pay for nothing. I did not stay for the man's return that went out. I am positive sure to the persons of the prisoners. Both of them I took particular notice of. Dooley did not sit in the chair any length of time, he was in and out of the yard. Dooley set next to me. The man in black went out; I did not observe his uneasiness until the man in black went out. I heard him wish for his return. I thought there was something extraordinary in their conduct. I walked round the market to see if I could see any of the officers of Bow-street, to come in and look at them. The next day I saw Bacon, the captain of the patrole. I communicated my suspicion to him on the Tuesday following. The one in black came to the same house. I told Bacon that one of the men came back, and had left an umbrella with Mrs. Grigg. Bacon went in the course of the afternoon, and found that man within one hundred and fifty yards</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Bishop when both the prisoners were apprehended, I know nothing more than what Bishop has related. I was present when he searched them; we shewed them each other; they denied any knowledge of each other. We asked Dooley, whether he knew Anderson? he said he did not, and Anderson said he did not know Dooley.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that handkerchief produced by Bishop. - A. It is mine. I know it by the holes, and by being the fellow to it in my possession; they came both off one piece, the pattern corresponds exactly. I had this handkerchief in my pocket at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence I was compelled to do it, or else I was to share the same fate as the man that fell in my way. I at last agreed so far, if they would not hurt any one. When we met Mr. Longhurst, Strangeways asked him the way to the next town; he replied, about a mile. We replied, then we will go back from whence we came. Strangeways ran, we followed him; the gentleman fell; Strangeways laid hold of him first. Strangeways pulled off his clothes, I begged of him to give the man clothes to keep him from starving with the cold. I asked Strangeways to let me put my coat on the man, and when we came back again, Strangeways said, let us kill him. I begged of them to spare his life; they were both angry with me all the way we came to London. I was ignorant of the man having any money until we came to London. We then went into the King's head: the other man told me, he had a pocket-book and a note; Strangeways said, it was a three pound note. I asked to see it; we went to get our breakfast. I asked him if he had got change, he said no, it was a ten pound note. I was compelled to do it, in order to save my own life, and I saved the prosecutor's life. I plead guilty.</p>
               <p>Dooley's Defence. I am innocent of the fact; I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of September Mr. Bulmer informed me, that his floor cloth was exposed for sale at Mr. Read's, London-wall, which had been stolen from his premises at Westminster. I went with Mr. Bulmer and his two men; I found seven pieces of oil cloth; I now pro duce that Mr. Bulmer said was his property. Mr. Read was at home? I asked him how he became possessed of it? He said he bought it of Mr. Levi; he had given three pounds ten shillings for it; afterwards he corrected that, and said, it was two pounds ten shillings. I took the floor-cloth, and desired Mr. Read to accompany me to the Lord Mayor. We then went in search of Levi. We could not find

             was there, whom we call Struttering Jack. In short, he said he could get some floor-cloth, about twelve or thirteen yards, and some of it was two yards wide, at four shillings a yard. I said if it was two yards wide, it was cheap of the money. I did not ask him if it was new or old, and on the Monday following I went out. I had a fowling piece to sell, which I sold in the Strand for eight guineas, to Mr. Ashman, a pawnbroker, facing Hungerford Market, and I bought a lot of brokery of him for six pounds ten shillings. I called a coach, and took them home. About four o'clock in the afternoon, when I came home, my wife said. Jack has left here some floor-cloth for you; I found it lying on my chair. I then went to Wallis's public house. Jack was sitting there; he said he had left some goods at home for me. He went home with me to my house. I looked at the floor-cloth; I said, here is none two yards wide, they are odd remnants, we call them wasters I then said to

            . I am a stone mason, On the 15th of October, I saw the three prisoners together, in Grub street; I followed them from Grub street into Honey-suckle court, leading into Moor lane. At the corner of Moor Lane, Fore street, they all went into a wine vaults; I waited there until they came out; I then followed them down Fore street; in Fore street there is a ham shop opposite of Coleman street; the prisoner Brown put his hand to a fine ham there, the two women stood along side of him, they just meddled with it and walked away. Then somebody happened to come into the shop, or else I believe it would have been taken from there. They proceeded to the pavement Moorefields, the prisoner Smith and Wilkinson looked at a pellise hanging at Mr. Clark's door; Brown stood by them; it was hanging outside of the door, each of them looked at the pellise, and walked a little distance, and had a little conversation together. They returned back; the prisoners Smith, Wilkinson and Brown stopped. When they came back, the prisoner Wilkinson. began to unpin the pelisse, so did Smith, until they got the pelisse down. The prisoner Smith then gave it to Brown; he put it into his apron, and ran off with it. I pursued Brown, I followed him back again into Grub street; I saw where he went with the pelisse. I went and gave information to an officer, what had happened; he came with me, and on coming down Grub street with the officer; I pointed out the three prisoners at the corner of the court, where I saw Brown go up with the pellise; I left them there when I went and informed Mr. Clark how his property had been taken from his door. Mr. Clark came with me. I pointed out the prisoners; he gave them into Hutchins, the officers, custody. After the officer had searched them Mr. Clark and the officer were proceeding to go where Brown had taken the pelisse; the prisoner Smith said, they might go; she had taken care to plant it where it is safe enough We found it afterwards; it was pledged at Mr. Flemings's Fleet market; we found it there on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it stolen - A. On Saturday the 15th of October between one and two in the afternoon. I am positive to the three prisoners at the bar; knowing them before induced me to follow them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of this month, Jackson came to me, and said, there were three people in Grub street that had stolen a pelisse. When I got into Grub street, I saw the three prisoners at the corner of Jacob's Well court I told Jackson to go to the prosecutor; I kept them in sight till the prosecutor came; then I took them in custody. I searched them, and found eight duplicates upon the prisoner Smith. I then asked them if they knew any thing of a pelisse; they denied all knowledge of that. I was proceeding with the prosecutor to go and search Brown's lodging; Smith<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260028"/>said, let them go, and search; I have planted that safe enough, meaning the pelisse, I thought. I searched Brown's lodging, and found no pelisse there. I took the prisoners to the Comote.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a watchman. On Thursday, the 22nd of September, about half past three in the morning, I saw a ladder put through the window, about eight foot high, and the prisoner descended. I set about twenty yards from where he came down. and at four o'clock he came back; he passed me with a bag in his hand. I got up, and said, what do you do here; he said, I am watching a craft. I said, I have been watching of you for half an hour. What have you got here; I looked. He had got a little bag in his hand, and seeing the rags, I asked him how he came to take them; he said, he did it through distress. I took him to the watch house.</p>

I went out to light my candle, and when I went in, I missed the watch off the mantle-shelf. I saw the prisoner go up the court where I live. My husband went and found out the prisoner. I got information that the prisoner lived in Dean-street, Soho. A constable went, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner at the bar - A. My husband saw the prisoner come out of the public-house. The prisoner is the man I saw in my court; he has a wooden leg. He said, he had given his wife the watch, she has it in her boson. I went up to the prisoner's wife, and took the watch out of her bosom. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I gave the watch to my husband, and went for a constable. I asked the prisoner what possessed him to take it; he said, a young man gave it him at the bottom of the court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever see me before - A. Never, until the Sunday morning; you were within eight or ten steps of my door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked the watch up in a dust-hole in a court in Barbican; in about an hour after, a man and a woman came to me, and said, I had picked up a watch; I delivered the watch to them. They gave me in charge of a constable. I am innocent of the charge against me. I have served my King and Country fifteen years, and lost a leg in that service.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming down stairs - A. Yes; he came down stairs in an hurry, about the middle of the day; I cannot ascertain the exact time. On the 15th of October, I saw the prisoner again in the Compter. I asked him how he could think of robbing me and my children? my little child cried; he said, do not cry my little man. said, he was very sorry for what he had done. That is all he said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in the Compter where your property was - A. Yes. A gentleman wrote into the country in consequence of what he told, and my property came back. I live in the house, and my husband lives with me.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he lodged in the house - A. About ten days. I opened the door for him, and I locked the prisoner in the room; because he said, he allways stripped himself start naked; he said, he allways locked the door when he stripped himself, I locked him in, and I went up stairs to feed, the rabbits. I did not come down untill half an hour. I ran down, and fetched the key again; then I came, and unlocked the door again, and I asked him if he was ready; he said, yes, and just after he came out of the room; I went into the room to put on a clean shirt to go with the prisoner to meet his ship.

On the 29th of September last, I heard a noise at the public-house, called the Ship and Blade Bone; I went into the house to get half a pint of beer.

I catched hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he did what he had struck me for; etc gave me no answer. He threw me down, and hit me in the mouth, in the house. I got up again, and I crawled out of the house on my hands and knees, and as soon as I got out, I was knocked down again. My lips were out to pieces, and my teeth knocked in, and one of my fingers bruised. I cannot say who knocked me down; there were three or four of them.</p>

               <p>Q. When you first came into the house, did you see these four prisoners there - A. No; only the one that I swear to; that is Hannaway; I did not see any of the other three prisoners there. After I was knocked down out of the house, I sprang my rattle, and several watchmen and a patrol came to my assistance. We went behind the house, and found Hannaway. I gave Hannaway into custody; King, the watchman, had Hannaway in custody, and when I went into the house there were fifteen or sixteen men; four or five followed me out.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether the prisoners were of the party, do you - A. Only Hannaway; he followed me out of the house; he gave me a blow. I gave charge of him for that blow. The rest of the party that followed, I do not know who they were.</p>

               <p>Q. When King was taking Hannaway to the watch-house, were you attacked by any body - A. Yes, by Connolly; he ran at me to do me some mischief, he had no weapon in his hand; he was trying to get hold of me; I guarded myself with my stick, as well as I could, until he got my stick from me. I went to Old Gravel-lane, and called for assistance.</p>

The prisoner Connolly took it out of my hand. I put up my hand to save myself, and Conolly struck at me with the cutlass; he cut my fore-finger of my right-hand as I laid down almost off.

            . I was called in about twelve o'clock at night, the night he received the injury. He had received six blows on his head, three of which were very considerable. They were inflicted with a blunt instrument, one wound on the right temple, and one on the left. One on the right side the crown, and the other on the left. He lived until Monday twelve o'clock, that is four days. I opened the head with my brother surgeons; we removed the upper part of the skull, and, after removing, the first covering of the brain in the membrane of the brain, we found a quantity of serum.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that an indication of an injury of the brain? - A. No doubt, Sir; this was underneath where one of the blows were; the blows on the right side of the head, that was sufficient to account for his death, with the other appearances we saw. I have no doubt he died in consequence of the injuries he received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord with respect to the prisoner Hannaway, he cannot in law be responsible for the sudden act of others in which he took no part; this case cannot be murder, at the most only manslaughter.</p>
               <p>COURT, Gentlemen of the jury, upon this evidence you cannot convict Hannaway; you will acquit Hannaway, and then you will consider that of the other prisoners.</p>

             the watchman came into my house, a quarter past eleven at night. He seemed to be rather intoxicated. When he came into the house he and another man had a quartern of gin; he had no beer at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a person of the name of Hannaway there? - A. Yes, he was standing close to the bar. I was coming out of the bar with a pot of beer in my hand; he put his head to my shoulder, and shoved me away in jest; he did me no injury. I never had an angry word with him in my life; he lodged with me. I took no notice of his shoving me away. I went into the parlour with the beer, and returned into my bar again. I then saw Jaarvis the watchman and Hannaway have hold of each other. I cannot say who laid hold of the other first. I saw Hannaway trip the watchman up; immediately the watchman went out, and sprang his rattle, and three men came in, and took Hannaway; that is all I saw.</p>

               <p>Q. Your father and your mother lived together, did they? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day on which your mother died? - Yes, it was last Michaelmas-day; it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. My father came down stairs, and asked my mother to account for the money. I do not know what money; she said she would not give any account. Then she went to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your father sober at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother sober? - A. No; she was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she run away to the window, had your father said any thing else to her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she run to the window for - A. I don't know. My father cried, and then went and shut down the window; that was before she jumped out. She did not attempt to get out then? she threw up the window, and stood by it; my father went and shut it down. A few minutes afterwards, a Gentleman came, Mr. Allcroft; then my father went out out of the room with Mr. Holcroft; my mother staid in the room. My father came back when Mr. Allcroft was gone. My mother told him to take pen and ink and she would render an account. Then she gave account of all the money but twelve shillings; then she hesitated a little, and went and threw it up. She went to jump out; my father went to lay hold of her; she fell hackwards out of the window into the street; she cut her head by falling backwards into the street. She bled; she got up and knocked at the door. My sister opened the door, and let nor in. I went to meet her; then she had her hand to her head, and said, O! my head! The tea-pot laid on the side-board; she threw it at my father. I don't know whether it hit him or not; but the water went over him. He shook it off; he was going to strike her, but he did not. I pulled him by his coat; he then tore his hair, and cryed, and said, what a woman is this? My God, children, what shall I do with her? He went to lift her up, he could not; she was reeling on the floor. When she threw the tea-pot at him, she then tumbled down by the sideboard, and hurt her eye. When she fell down on the floor; she kept rolling about, and tearing her clothes off. When My father tried to lift her up, she would not let him, and continued rolling about. She tore her pockets off; I picked them up. I examined the pockets for money; I found a one pound note and some silver. I gave it to my father. My mother was crying; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260032"/>my mother did not speak any more. She was lying all along dead on the ground; my father went and fetched the doctors. He came and said my mother was dead, and went away. I did not see my father commit any one act of violence upon my mother.</p>

They were inside of the door when I last saw them. I saw the prisoner take them. I immediately went and took the prisoner by he collar, and took the shirt and waistcoat from under his jacket. I am sure they were my property. The prisoner said he had made a mistake. he meant to pay for them. I delivered the things to Forrester; I am sure they are mine.</p>

               <p>CHARLES JAMES FOX. I was guard of the Gloucester mail, on the 24th of December, the Gloucester mail arrived at the Post office, between six and seven o'clock, it was one of these foggy mornings; all our passengers left us at the Post office; we there put the luggage in the boot, into the inside of the coach, to get at the passengers luggage. The coachman drove on along Cornhill; I walked down Cheapside after the coach, to the top of St Martin le-grand; there was a stoppage in St Martin le-grand at the narrow part; I returned back to the coachman, to tell him there was a stoppage there, I saw a person go, and open the coach door, and take a box out, about a foot wide, and about a foot and a half long, I directly seized the prisoner by the neck; he had hold of the box in his left arm; we had a struggle together, and fell down; both our hats came off. The prisoner got up, and, ran; I got as quick as I could, but having boots on, and my great coat, I could not run so quick as he could. I followed him down St. Paul's Churchyard; at St. Paul's Church-yard one Seymour got hold of him, and when I came up I was knocked down dead as a bullock. I cannot tell by whom. When I recovered myself. I found that the person that Seymour had hold of was gone away. He had had left his hat behind him.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. On the 24th of December I was in St. Paul's Church-yard; was returning at St. Paul's Church-yard into Cheapside about a quarter before seven in the morning. I heard the rattle spring, and the guard cried stop thief! Instantly the prisoner came up, and the guard pursuing him. He was threatening vengeance. The prisoner is the man. He held his fist up at me, saying, Da - n you. I laid hold of him, we both fell down together; he overcame me. I got up, and soon was down again. I am positive the prisoner is the man. The guard came to my assistance; he saw him kicking me in the groin. I believe the guard cut him over his nose, by the blood running so furiously down his face. When I was down, and the prisoner was kicking me in the groin, a tall man came up and struck Fox over the head. One of the prisoner's companions knocked the guard down; I said, you have struck the wrong man, at that time supposing he was an officer. A tall man, or a man with a crape over his face, knocked Fox down. I still kept my hold of the prisoner, and before I could take up my hat a bludgeon hit me over the head, and I was knocked down, the prisoner got away. I saw the prisoner again the day he was brought to Bow-street. I knew him again directly.</p>

            . I am an officer. I know the prisoner perfectly well by sight. About three weeks afterwards I saw the prisoner in company with thieves; before that I had him in custody. I saw him at the White Horse, in Old-street-square. After some coarse language, the prisoner asked me if there was a screw loose? I said there was. I will get the guard to came to see if he can point you out. He said I should appoint my own hour, and he would come. The prisoner did not come. I saw the prisoner next in Piccadilly, at the time when the balloom went off. He was in the company of three or four thieves; he looked round and saw me; he made his escape under the coaches. The next time I sew him was on a Sunday evening, at the Shepherd and Shepherdess, in the City road. Harrison was with me at the time, and when he came into the room I took him there.</p>

            . I am the coachman of the Glasgow Mail. The box was taken out of the coach, and after the struggle between the guard and a man, it was given to me. I took it to the Inn, and delivered it to Mr. Willian's bookkeeper. I believe the box was worth a shilling; it was in my way-bill. I made no observation on the box. When the box was given back to me, I took it to the Inn. I had not a box too many, nor a box more than was in my waybill.</p>

On the 17th of September, I set a watch upon him. I stopped the prisoner at eight o'clock, Drinkwater was placed in the passage, through which the prisoner must pass. On leaving the counting-house, I stopped the prisoner; I told him I wanted to speak with him; he immediately pulled out of his breeches a bottle of spirits of wine. Drinkwater, the officer, then came, and searched him, and found some Castile soap, Epsom salts, and pepper upon him; they are the articles that we deal in. The prisoner then said, he was sorry for what he had done. We then searched his lodgings, in a court in Cow-lane; we found two or three bottles, one containing spirits of wine.</p>

At the end of the week, I found she was not likely to suit me; I gave her a months warning, in case either of us was suited before the month was up, we would part. On the 28th, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I went up stairs; I found she had gone away; she went away saying, she would go and get some pump water. She never returned. I examined the tea-spoons; I found four of them were gone. I had seen them that evening at tea, at eight o'clock. They were silver. I gave a pound for five of them; they are worth eight shillings. I missed four silver tablespoons after that; they are worth a pound. I missed four table cloths; they are worth a pound. I went into the parlour to look for the salt-spoons; they were also missing; they were worth four shillings. I have never seen any of the things since. On the Saturday following, I met the prisoner in Artillery-place, she went into a public-house with a man. I had her taken up; the prisoner abused me.</p>
               <p>MARY CUMMINGHAM. I was a servant to Mrs. Clark; she appointed me to come that night, on the 28th, I saw the silver tea-spoons; there were five silver tea-spoons went up, and four came down.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner leave the house - A. Between nine and ten; she said, she was going for water; she never returned. I saw the prisoner wipe the four tea-spoons, and place them on the dresser. What became of them after, I don't know. I have never seen them since. I know nothing of the tablecloth, or table-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner leave her clothes behind her - A. No; she lert an empty box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told the girl when she brought the things down I was going for some pump water; she said, she had come to live there; I told her to call her mistress; she would not. I went away as my mistress had brought this servant into the house, and had undermined me; I had no clothes; I had made away with them through sickness. I am innocent of this charge.</p>

               <p>'I have been waiting for you for some time, and now I will do for you.' I received several successive blows while on the ground. I felt something like an incision in my eye; I had two incisions in my eye. I did not see the instrument; I saw him lift up his hand when these blows were given me; He repeated the words,</p>
               <p>'I have been waiting for you, and now I will do for you.' I then felt something had struck my, eye, and then I growned dismally; and could not be heard. I then roused myself from the ground, and lifted up my hand to protect myself from further violence; I put my hand across my head. I received an inscission in my hand while I was protecting my head. I then articulated the word murder as well as I could; I was heard by some neighbours in the place, and a watchman came to my rescue, who is my evidence; the watchman picked me up, and gave me to a gentleman, who is here; he brought me alight. I was delivered to this gentleman, and taken to a public-house cut and maimed. I described the person of the prisoner; he being in a blue jacket, and white buttons on his sleeves; his feature I could not observe. I was knocked down like a bullock, twice; he laughed, and sprang at me. I was taken to a public-house across Haberdashers'-street, directly opposite to the lamp, and I was sent in a coach to Bartholomew's Hospital; I remained in the Hospital near three weeks.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Shoreditch parish. On the 20th of September, I heard the cry of murder; I went up to the prosecutor immediately; I saw Mr. Harris laying down bleeding. I saw the prisoner at a small distance, and as soon as I had lifted up Mr. Harris, the prisoner was pointed out to me by the people that were about. The prisoner was daring any body to come near him. I was confused at the time; I cannot tell the expressions he used at that time exactly. Some of the people said, watchman, that is the man, take him. I got hold of the prisoner in the most cautious manner I could, and one or two young fellows assisted me in going to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any weapon - A. None that I discovered I could not see any weapon; I got him to the watch-house, and I told the night constable of it he said he was not in charge. I told him I left the man bledding; he was not able to come. The prisoner said, if any man came that he had been scuffling with, he would do for them with the poker, or something. The constable told him if he was not quiet, he would lock him up in the cage; he still persisted, and the constable, or house man, sent for another constable; during this time the prisoner stood by the fire place; the constable said here is a knife, whose knife is this; the prisoner said, that is my knife. This is the knife, it was given me by the Magistrate; he desired me to produce it; I cannot exactly say this is the exact knife, it was a knife of this size. The constable said. if it was his knife he might take it; he was silly enough to give him the knife. When he had got the knife he became more outrageous, and the other constable that arrived put him into the cage; he resisted being put into the cage. After being in the cage he pulled a knife out, and rubbed it, and said if the prosecutor came he would do for him with that or something else. This knife was delivered to me by the magistrate. The prisoner said, if he had injured the man, he was very sorry for it, he would go down on his knees, and ask his pardon, or make him any recompence. I went from there to the public-house to see the prosecutor and the constable went with me for the charge. Mr. Duncombe desired to see the prisoner; he came, asked the prisoner, now he came to injure the man, he was almost dead; the prisoner said he was very sorry, and he was willing to go down on his knees, and ask him pardon. I think the prisoner was in a state of intoxication.</p>

            . I live in Haberdasher-Place, Hoxton; I am an insurance broker; I live almost opposite where this transaction happened. On the 20th of September, I heard the cry of murder repeated twice; I went out in consequence of hearing it; when I first opened the door it was extremely dark; I returned and took a candle in my hand; I saw Mr. Harris laying on the ground, he was calling for help. The prisoner I think was within two or three yards of him; I think it was the prisoner; there was no other person near him when I first went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that person say any thing - A. I took a stick in one hand, and a candle in the other; I heard a voice say take care of that fellow with the stick; I was then chiefly occupied in rendering what assistance I could to Mr, Harris; a young man came up and immediately gave charge of the prisoner. The first time that I opened the door, I heard a voice say, we have found the devil, let us kill him. I then accompained Mr. Harris to the nearest public house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260035"/>and went for a doctor, an assistant of Mr. Weston's in Shoreditch came; he was afterwards taken to the hospital, and attended by the Hospital surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again while he was at the watchhouse - A. I did; I went to the place where he was confined; I asked him how he could think of injuring Mr. Harris in such a manner; he said, if he had hurt him, he was sorry for it, and asked to be let out of his confinement; he said he would go down upon his knees and, ask the gentleman's pardon, if they would let him out. I then retired from the watchhouse, and went to the public house where Mr. Harris was; in a little time a surgeon come; he wanted to bleed him; Mr. Harris was disinclined to be let blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think the prisoner was the person that injured Mr. Harris - A. Because he was the only person on the spot; I had a light in my hand. I did not observe his features I cannot indentify the person. He was given in charge by a young man, and taken to the watchhouse. I noticed his sailors dress generally; that is all I can speak of my own knowledge. The prisoner I think was very far from being sober that night.</p>

            ; he was brought to the hospital on the night of that day, I think about twelve o'clock; I examined the state he was in; he had three wounds, two on the left eye, and one on the back of the right wrist; two wounds on the lower eye-lid on the same eye-lid, and one on the back part of the right wrist. I concluded it was done by a sharp instrument; there being no laceration or cotusions it appeared to be an unscissed wound on the back of the wrist; it extended through one of the integuments, and divided that one at the right hand.</p>

I met the prisoner; he came and run right up against me. I never saw him before with my eyes, although he told me he was an old acquaintance, I looked very hard at him, to see if I had any knowledge of him at all; in the mean time, some one pushed me up to him, and at the very moment I felt a rush at my side pocket. I clapped my elbow against my pocket, to give my pocket book protection. I found it was gone; he did it as sharp as he could, and took the pocket book out. Upon this I was very much alarmed for a moment; I saw the prisoner walking off with the pocket book in his hand; the prisoner walked quietly off; I was so alarmed for a moment or two I did not cry out. At last I cried out, Stop thief! The prisoner was pursued and brought back to me. They asked me whether he was the man, when they brought him back; I called out that he is the man, hold him. The prisoner went into some ruins; I saw him brought out of the ruins; as soon as he came out of the ruins I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man who went into the ruins took your pocket-book away - A. I have not a doubt of it. I had my pocket-book brought back to me again; that was the pocket-book that the prisoner had taken away.</p>

I stopped him and searched him, and delivered him into the officer's' hands. The prisoner said, for God's sake let me go; some persons came up; he wished me to deliver him into their hands. I threw the prisoner down; by way of detaining him. One of the party struck me; I fell upon the prisoner; I delivered the prisoner to the officer Bacon.</p>

I had seen her several evenings when I went patroling, in company with a man, and other evenings in company with the same man. She was going into different shops, waiting for an opportunity, as I suspected, to thieve something. I watched her: she went up to 126, I saw her go up; the man was walking by the side of her; she walked by the shop two or three times, looking into the shop. The man took her to the window, as I thought he was shewing her something in the shop lying on the counter. I went on the opposite side, watching them. The man he fell back to the left hand side of the door. She stepped forward and very fast, She threw herself across on the counter; I could see her bring something off the counter. I took it out of her hand the moment she came out of the the shop. She crossed to the opposite side of the way, where I was watching her. I took hold of her hand, and took the handkerchiefs out of her hand. I gave her to Mr. Newton, the constable.</p>

               <p>Mr. NEWTON. I am a constable. The patrole delivered the prisoner and the handkerchiefs into my hands. These are the handkerchiefs.</p>

It was my own property; there were three breast pins in my pocket book, two new shirts in the bundle, and in the pocket book my discharge from the ship; and in the bundle a pair of new shoes, and one pair of white cotton stockings; it was a new silk and cotton handkerchief; these are the whole of what they took from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see their faces? - A. We walked together from the public house; I saw them at the public house before I was robbed; they walked along with me from the public house until we came to the canal; they there took my things, and ran away, after they had knocked me down. I saw them in the public house; there was a light in the room, I observed their persons so as to know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the persons who knocked you down and robbed you were the persons that were with you in the public house? - A. Yes, I am sure that the two prisoners are two of the three men who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your things since? - A, Yes, the ten pound bill, Mr. Forrester has got it.</p>

The prisoner Gardner tendered me a ten pound note, and asked me to change it for him, in the presence of one another. Looking at the note, I saw it was the Consul's handwriting. I asked Gardner how he came by it? he said he got it for his wages. I asked him what ship he was on board of? he said he forgot the name. I asked him the Captain's name? he also had forgot that. I told him then to put his name on the back of the bill, and to call in an hour, I would give him an answer. He indorsed the bill in the name of Westerland. They then went away. I immediately inclosed the bill in a letter to Mr. Tottel, the Consul:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260037"/>the bill was returned back, and a letter from Mr. Tottel, saying it was stolen from a sailor. I am certain it is the same bill returned back with Gardner's indorsement. There is now the indorsement of Gardner upon it. Gardner called; I told him to stop a few minutes. I sent for the parish officers, and had him apprehended, and the other also; they both came together. Not being able to walk, I gave the bill to Forrester, the officer, to shew the Lord Mayor, I never had the bill since,</p>

            . I am an officer of Aldgate. The place described by the prosecutor where the robbery was commited, is in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney, in the county of Middlesex. Mr. Murray gave me charge of the two prisoners. This is the bill that Mr. Murray gave me. It has been in my custody ever since. It is in the same state now as it was then. On searching Gardner, I found a paper that was in the pocket book where this note was.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell that the note was taken out of the pocket book? - A. No, only what the prosecutor said.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HENNERSLEY. I am an officer. On the 20th of September. I was sent for to Mr. Murray's to apprehend Osmond. I found him at Mr. Murray's home; I took him into custody. I asked Osmond going along to the Compter, if he knew any thing of the robbery? he denied it. The next day he said, he would tell me all he knew of the robbery. I neither promised him any favour, or threatened him; he said he had been drinking with the prosecutor, in company with Gardner; that Gardner had persuaded him to go and rob the prosecutor; he said he had plenty of money about him. Osmond said he would not go; Gardner said he had better come along, that he should have part: through his persuasions Osmond went with him. I asked him if he had seen any thing of a bill; he said they all run away when they had robbed him; he said he saw the bill in the begining of the bustle, but he never had seen any thing of it afterwards. I asked him if he had any part of the money. He told me he had. I asked him what became of the breast-pins? He said he saw Gardner give a girl of the town one or two. He did not know which it was; he said he was sorry for what he had done; that was all he said; he said he was persuaded by Gardner or else he should not have done it.</p>
               <p>Gardner's Defence. I picked up a draft in Ratcliff Highway, on Monday morning. This man was close behind me; he said, what have you picked up? I said, I did not know; I can neither read nor write. I shewed it to a clothesman; he told me to go with it to Mr. Murray, I should have money for it.</p>
               <p>Osmond's Defence. I saw him pick up something; I did not know what it was at the time.</p>

I left the till in its place; the till was not locked, the key was missing. I got up the next morning some time after five, not quite daylight. I went to take down the shutters, and I discovered a wooden pannel in the window out of one side of the window. The shutter had been taken down and put up again. The pannel had been taken out by some instrument; they must have taken the shutter down, and have put it up again I am certain on the over night it was perfectly secure. They had left my bar door open; they had unbolted my bar door that goes into the street, and they went out that way, that door was fastened the over night perfectly. I found the bar in a confused state; the till was completely gone; there was a one pound note in the till the over night, and upwards of forty shillings in silver, and from ten to twenty shillings in halfpence; all were gone together. There were four packages of halfpence on the counter; they were left; they visible enough if there had been light enough for them to have seen them, whoever they were that had broken into the house; they had forced a lock exactly underneath the place where these halfpence were. They had not got that till open; the key of the other till was in that till, but they did not get that till open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a German pipe there? - A. Yes; I had used it the over night; I missed that, and I had got some cordial bottles; four of them were disturbed and two were taken away. They were common quart bottles; one with Noyeau, and the other with lovage, with gilt labels; they had left a pair of napkeen breeches behind them. They took some articles of linen, and they took a penknife out of my desk. I lost a whip, that hung over the door, and I missed a table cloth and a bank note. I am certain it was in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoners - A. Yes; Morrison was in the habit of using the house before I came into it, and often; I never saw Stevens in the house.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Mitchel-street, Lisson Green. I know Stevens; he was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to me, he did not live with me constant. The Wheatsheaf public-house was broken open last Thursday night three weeks; that was the night he came to me. I had seen both the prisoners that day, between five and six o'clock; I saw the two prisoners in Crown-street, Soho, at an old iron shop; I went there that evening; between five and six, and while I was there Stevens and Morrison came in, and we remained there until between nine and ten o'clock; then we all went home to Mitchell-street, to my place, and they staid there until eleven o'clock; it was a very wet night, it rained very hard. Morrison said, come Stevens let us go, they cannot lock the till, I have got the key; he put his hand into his pocket, and took a key out. They both left my place then, and between one and two Stevens came in, he knocked two or three times at the door, who let him in, I don't know. He brought a bottle with him; he said, here Amelia, here is a bottle, where shall I put it; it is marked Noyeau on it; he pulled out two shirts. I told him to put the bottles on the table; a handkerchief with five shillingsworth of loose halfpence he put on the bed, a silver thimble, two old shirts, two table clothes, a German pipe, and a pen-knife, that is all I found when I got up in the morning. The next morning, the two prisoners came, and took breakfast with me. We all three went to Whitechapel. They took the German pipe with them. I left them between four and five in the afternoon, at the Red Lion public-house. I did not see them again until the next day. I gave these table-cloths to Bettey Allen to pledge for me. These table-cloths were brought into the house by Stevens; they were very dirty; I washed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the officer coming a few days afterwards - A. Yes. The things that the officer took were the things that were brought in by Stevens and Morrison. This thimble was one of them; I had it by me a few days. When Morrison and and Stevens were together, I said, this thimble fits me. They told me I might have it. That is the way I became possessed of it. I know the table cloths; they were tied up in my pocket-handkerchief, that I sent them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the house that was broken open - A. Yes. On the Saturday following, I went down with Morrison; Morrison said, he was going to Stevens's father. I waited at a public-house until he came out, and then me and Morrison went home together; in our way back, we went by this house; he said, this is the house that me and Stevens got into; I don't know the street, or the sign; it was almost dark. He asked me to drink there; I said, no, I rather would not have any thing to drink there,</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. The till that you lost was not locked, was it - A. No; the key was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that German pipe, is that yours - A. It is; I gave half a guinea for the head before it was mounted, the mounting cost me two shillings. I lost this pipe. I had been using it the over night; it is worth thirteen shillings. The pen-knife sixpence; the wooden till a shilling. I lost above ten shillingsworth of halfpence, besides forty shillings in silver.</p>

These shirts I was upon that very night, cutting of the wristbands; these are the very same wristbands I cut out; the shirts are worth two shillings; a yard of Irish cloth is mine, worth two shillings, and this iron-holder I bought that very same day, it is worth twopence. The stays are mine; I had unpicked them, worth sixpence; this handkerchief, worth sixpence; the two table cloths they were there that night; they are worth two shillings, and the thimble is mine, it is worth one shilling; I lost it that night.</p>
               <p>Stevens's Defence. On Saturday morning I met Morrison in the New-road, as I was going into Edgewere-road; he asked me if I wanted to buy any shirts; I said, no, I had got no money. He asked me if I was going to Mitchell-street; I said, yes; I had not been there for two or three months before. He came to Amelia, and brought these things; he asked me twelve shillings for them. I bought them, and gave them to Amelia. I left him with Amelia, as he had been there before. On Thursday I was not at all with Amelia, and when I have been with Amelia, Richardson has come there; I have always got out of bed when he came; he has come there with property.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Sowerby. On the morning of the 13th of October, I discovered that the bottom part of a pane of glass had been shoved in; I do not know what time it had been done; it could not have been done a day. I knew there were ear-rings placed directly opposite where the whole was made, within an inch of the bottom part of the glass, about dinner time, on the 12th, there were ear-rings there; nine of the earrings were missing, one ring was taken from a card, and one left. I saw the ear-rings the next morning at the watchhouse; I knew them to be my master's property. The prisoner was in custody at the time I saw him.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser. On the evening of the 12th, I was standing at my own door; I saw two lads at a watchmaker's window, in the street I live in; the prisoner was one of them. I heard some glass drop from the watchmaker's window; immediately the prisoner's companion ran away. The prisoner went to two windows further on, looking in at Mr. Ellis' window, a furrier. The patrole came up to me; I told him of the prisoner; he laid hold of the prisoner, and took him to the watchhouse. The other boy made his escape.</p>

               <p>GEORGE HENLEY. I am the patrole. From the information of Croft, I laid hold of the prisoner; I asked him what he was doing of; he said, he was going home. I felt in his breeches pocket, and found he had this wire in it. I took him to the watch-house, and searched him; I found these nine earrings in his fob-pocket. These ear-rings were claimed on the 13th by Moss, Mr. Sowerby's apprentice, as his master's property. These are the earrings, and this is the wire, The prisoner attempted to threw the wire away going to the watchhouse; I prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Moss. Look at the ear-rings - A. They are all Mr. Sowerby's property. This ear-ring tallys with the one I have got. The value of the nine earrings are eleven shillings.</p>

My house was broken open on the 11th of October; I went to bed about a quarter before twelve; I was the last up in the house. When I went to bed the house was secured; I went into the kitchen the last thing, I have only my wife myself, and lodgers, in the house. I am sure all my lodgers were in the house when I went to bed. The next morning, I got up at half past seven; I was the first up in the house that came down stairs; as I went into the kitchen I saw the kitchen window wide open. I fastened it myself the night before, the last thing; that is the way the thieves got in. They got in at the kitchen window; there is an area at the kitchen window; they had put some instrument between the two sashes, and so opened the window; the window was not broken. I turned my head round, I missed my two pair of boots. I am a shoemaker; I missed my umbrella; a bag of dirty linen was hanging behind the door; they had removed them from their situation. The boots and the bag of linen that had been hanging behind the door were taken away; two shifts, two pillow-cases, a shirt, a pair of sheets, a pair of stockings, a curtain, six towels two napkins, a handkerchief, a night-cap, a canvas bag, a pair of trowsers, and a shaving-box; in one of my waistcoat pockets there were sixteen pennyworth of halfpence, these were all taken away. I saw some of my things the next day in the afternoon, about four o'clock, at Hatton Garden office. I knew them to be my property that had been stolen the night before. I arose about half after seven, it had been day-light then I suppose about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any marks in your kitchen of any candle having been used - A. Yes, on the frame of the window; there was a place where a candle had been stuck there, and droppings of tallow all the way down. A candle must have been burning there some time by the appearance of the wood, the wood being all scotched. I found a piece of tallow candle on the ground the next morning, it had been placed on the seat of the window, and had tumbled down underneath it.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a piece of candle underneath the window on the floor? - A. Yes; I went to Hatton-garden office, and gave information.</p>

            . I live at 26, Field-lane. My husband buys and sells old boots and shoes. On the 12th of this month, about half after eight in the morning, the prisoner brought a bag with boots and leather in it; he threw the things out altogether, he asked me if I would purchase them. The bag contained two pair of men's boots and some leather; the boots were almost new, they had not been much worn; a pair of boot legs and a number of women's clothes, and one shirt.</p>
               <p>A. Did you know this man before - A. No, not till then. I found amongst them napkins, towels, and stockings. When he shot these things out on the ground, he asked me if I would purchase them, I said I would call my husband down stairs. Mr. Lee came down stairs; he being an officer, took the prisoner into custody. My husband asked him how he came by these things? he said he got them at Highgate. He said he would not tell where. Mr. Lee said, you have stolen them. He then went down on his knees, and said, if he would let him go he would leave them. He was taken to the Compter and afterwards to Hatton Garden office. My husband has kept the things ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the office - A. Yes; I saw Mr. Welch claim the things.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Andrew's parish. I live at 26, Field-lane. My girl called me down stairs. I found the prisoner sitting on a chair, the boots and leather were on his right hand side. I asked him what he wanted for the boots and leather? He said a guinea. I looked at him in the face; I knew him. I said you are a thief. Where did you steal these things? He said he had stolen them, and instantly went on his knees, and begged me to let him go. I said I shall do my duty, you may depend upon it. He then said he found them in a yard at Highgate. He said he should not say any more as I was determined to keep him. I kept the articles, and took him to the Compter. First of all I took him as a city prisoner, afterwards I took him before a Middlesex magistrate. I removed him from the Compter; I searched him in the thigh of his pantaloons; between his pantaloons and breeches I found this tin tobacco-box, with fresh tinder and matches, this knife was in his pantaloons pocket; the back of the knife is jagged with striking a light. In his waistcoat pocket I found this button-hook, this is claimed by Mr. Welch. In his hat I found this silk handkerchief, it is marked with G. W. the initials of Mr. Welch's name. Mr. Welch claimed the things that he shot out of the bag. I then went to Mr. Welch's house, to ascertain how it had been entered. The earth outside of the house is tlay; the inside of the wall is about six feet high, and the garden mould fresh dug. I examined the footsteps with the prisoner's shoe. I found on the prisoner a thick pair of nailed shoes. Mr. Read and I applied the shoes to to the footsteps on the clay and on the mould; the shoes corresponded with marks of the footsteps. I found no other footsteps than his. It appeared to me it had only been done by one person. I afterwards examined the window; it has a hoop spring catch; it appeared to me to have been opened by pushing one sash up, and pulling the other down, and then sliding this knife between, up it opened the catch; there is the mark of a knife of this size on the window. These things have been in my possession ever since. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have looked at these things, they are mine; I am quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that handkerchief found in the prisoner's hat. - A. There is my initials G W. upon it. I left it on the sofa the over night, and I missed it the next morning when I came down. The boot-legs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260041"/>are mine, and all the rest of the property. This button hook was in my waistcoat pocket with the halfpence, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I have looked at the linen, I know it to be my husband's linen. Some of them have our initials on them. Some I had before I married Mr. Welch, which has the initials of my maiden name.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I am an officer. I went to the prosecutor's house. I observed a piece of candle had been stuck on the lining of the sash; it had been burning there some time; it is a wonder it had not set fire to the lining of the window. I observed the footsteps; I compared the prisoner's shoe with the footsteps in the mould, and the clay. I could only see one footstep; the prisoner's shoe tallied with the mark of his footsteps.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I implore your Lordship's forgiveness in taking the liberty to address you I am evidently with a heart broken down with grief; yet I feel some commisseration that every justice will be done; and if I am correct in the pale of reason, when I say, the charge admits of much doubt. It was my misfortune to pass where the robbers had done the violence. I never committed the act I am charged with. Never in my life did I commit a felonious act that actually has not been proved; this ought to have been done. Am I to suffer for the violent act of others; I expect to meet with that compassion which justice so warmly demands.</p>

When he took hold of my shawl my hand was up to my mouth, the shawl was up to my mouth in my hand. He stuck his nails into my hand before he could get it away.

               <p>Q. Had she picked up the shawl at that time - A. She had not got it in her hand; the prisoner asked me to let him go. A gentleman come up, and told me to take him to the watchhouse, and search him, he thought he was a young thief. The prisoner asked me if I thought he would do any such thing; I said I did not know. I met his companions; the prisoner was just behind them there were two young women also; they were running away from the cry of Stop thief; I searched him at the watchhouse. When I took him, he had an handkerchief, which he attempted to throw away. He had an handkerchief on his neck besides that that the officer has. He wanted to throw away a stiffner that he took out of his hat; he he took the silk handkerchief from some where behind him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JACKSON. I am an headborough; the prisoner was brought to the watchhouse about half past twelve in the morning by the watchman, charged by the prosecutrix that he had struck her, and robbed her of a shawl. The watchman gave me a silk handkerchief and a stiffner that he wanted to throw away; I have kept it ever since. There is no mark on it; when she charged him with striking her, and taking the shawl, he kept crying, and said, did I think as he would do any such a thing. The shawl was delivered to me; this is it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is the shawl that was taken from me by force; I gave it the watchman; it is worth eighteen pence.</p>

Coming along, the woman went about an hundred yards away, when the patrole took me; he said I was charged with taking a shawl. I said I know nothing about a shawl. he said come along back; with you, I said; I will in a minute. I asked the lady, whether I had taken a shawl of her's; she said, she believed I did. The patrol said I had; then the lady said I had. I knew no more about the shawl than nobody,</p>

I was then induced to go to a place where the prisoner was in the cabin; he appeared to be in a tremor, and was quite agitated upon my looking in. The prisoner is a custom house officer; he was superintending the delivery of the cargo. I went into cabin; he was then sitting on a box, near the door; there was a quantity of pepper running from the waistband of his pantaloons; he said he did not know how he could commit such a crime. Upon searching him, about a pound of pepper was found in his pantaloons. This is the pepper. it is worth eighteen pence.</p>

            . A quarrel with my father threw me upon the world eight or nine years ago. I held a menial situation with Mr. Townend. Mr. Townend said he observed somethind in my manner far superior to my then situation. He desired to enter into my history. I gave it him; he promised he would put me forward in the world. My brother died; my family took me by the hand, and Mrs. Townend and I corresponded for nine years. I married Miss Savory in the year 1803. I entered into his majesty's service, and after being separated from Miss Savory seven years, I returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260043"/>into England. On my return home I found Mr. Townend was dead. In consequence of a correspondence that originated between Mrs. Townend and me, I went down to York, and was in the habit of dining with her three or four weeks previous to our marriage. I have sent down the deed to Mrs. Townend, and I trust my service for my country thirteen years; although I may have erred in this, yet I hope that will be taken into consideration.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 30th of September last, was that house under repair - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of the day had you been in the house superintending the work - A. Yes; several times. I was there while the workmen were there. A quarter before eight, I went there to see if all was safe. No. 27 and 28, both the houses join backwards. I entered the house 28, I heard a noise over head. There is a room that Mrs. Howell always had projects into my house; there is a door which has communication to my house from hers; there had been a new door fixed up.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of September? my question is whether there was any door which by being opened would communicate from one house to the other - A. There was a door on the two pair of stairs, which was not in the house, by which you might go from one house to the other upon that door being opened; the door was fastened up, till this time, nailed up; it was considered as a party partition, and nailed up not to be used. Upon my hearing this noise, I went into Mrs. Howell's house to desire some friends to give the alarm that there were thieves in the house. Mr. Howell and I were providing ourselves with weapons. After having done so, I went out at Mrs. Howell's front door; young Mr. Howell was just before me; Mrs. Howell I believe, was standing at the door. She saw the two persons come out.

I went to the door No. 27, Mr. Wilson's house, I found a bag at the door. I supposed the man had escaped them; I did not know. The bag was full.

            . On the evening of the 30th of September. I was in Surry Street. Miss Howell ran over to me and asked my assistance in catching the thief, saying, he was in the next house to Mrs. Howells. I saw the two men come out of that house. Hary Griffiths passed about a yard from me, and the other about two yards. Griffiths run towards Howard street, and Beck run up Surry Street, through an arch-way, which leads into Strand-lane. I pursued Beck, he was crying stop thief lustily. Beck ran through the Arch-way into Strand-lane; he crossed the Strand, and ran into Newcastle Street, I kept within a yard and a half of him all the way; he knocked a person down in Newcastle-street, that person never left hold of him. I came up, and caught hold of his wrist. I am quite certain he is one of the two men that came out of the house. I never lost sight of him; he resisted violently while I had hold of him. Mr. Wilson came up, and he was taken to Bow Street.</p>

            . I heard the cry of stop thief in Newcastle-street; Beck passed me at the end of Albemarle-street, he was stopped; he made great resistance; he knocked a person down. I assisted in securing him. We took him to Bow-street; as we were going along he said, d - n your eyes, let a poor fellow put on his shoes; he halted, and let him stoop. Instead of touching his shoes, he put his hand to the hind part of his heel, and dropped a key. I was in the act of picking the key up, a gentleman put his hand forward, and picked it up himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to get from you as you were taking him along - A. He tried to get from us; he did not. At Bow-street I saw the gentleman that picked the key up, hold the key up, and I saw the officer take it from his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Now Miss Budger - A. There is a dress of mine, value ten shillings; a petticoat, value five shillings; two yards of black crape mine, five shillings; these things were in the drawer in the chamber, that stood against the door. I had seen them at five o'clock in the afternoon, when I locked the drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Limbrick. When you went to Mrs. Howel's house, did you go to Mr. Wilson's house - A. Yes, I examined the door by which they were suspected to enter. I found the door had been nailed up, and two or three of the nails were pushed off one side. The nails had been partly driven in and turned down on one side; the door had been forced open on Mr. Wilson's side; by forcing the nails up; there were marks of the nails being forced up; it did not want much force to get the nails up, it had been done on Mr. Wilson's s side. I found this crow lying down by the drawers; the drawers had opened by the crow, and the crow appeard to have been left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260046"/>behind in Mrs. Howell's room. I compared the crow with the impressions on the drawers; it fitted the impression.</p>
               <p>Beck's Defence. Does it stand to reason that I could put my arms down to drop a key on the ground when there were twenty or more people around me. I cried stop thief all the way I heard the mob coming up Strand-lane, and the key that was found on me was the key of my room door, it was given me by my landlord.</p>
               <p>Griffiths's Defence. I was in hopes of bringing forward a respectable witness to prove that I was in his company a few moments of my being taken in custody; I left him because I had some business to do on the other side of the water. I was going from Temple-bar to Arundel-street, and on my going through the arch-way there was a cry of stop thief, and as I came along Mr. Hamblen said stop: I stopped; a minute or more elapsed before Mr. Howell came up: he said, you are one of them. I said, do not accost me in that way, I will knock you down if you do. Gentlemen of the Jury, there are two men charged in this indictment; whether one or both are guilty is for you to determinate: if any doubt should arise in your minds on that point, it is better that ten guilty men should escape punishment, than one innocent man should suffer. I have made every enquiry in my power to get my friend to come forward to prove I was in his company: he is gone down I find to Saffron Walden fair with horses; I cannot have the benefit of his testimony.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see anything of the prisoners wife - A. Yes I had been walking with her; she asked me to take a walk with her. I went with her. I saw the prisoner come out of a pawnbroker's shop at the corner of Widegate-street, with a pound note in his hand: I went up to him, knowing him. He took his wife and me to a liquor shop, and treated her and me to a glass of peppermint each of us. When I went home, I went to my husbands, and asked him if he had got in at the window and taken the watch; he said not. On the next day a young man and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260047"/>prisoner's daughter brought me the watch; she said, her father was very sorry for it. This is the watch. I am sure it is my husband's.</p>

I am astonished my prosecutor is not here; I wish he had been here; I expected to see him; I then should have had an opportunity to have asked him whether he did not tell me to go to his wife to borrow some money, or if I saw his watch to bring it to him; he and I had been drinking together all the day.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I live in Coventry street. On the 15th of July Mrs. Larkin left a watch with me to repair as early as possible; as soon as the watch was done, I sent it with my servant; my young man went with the watch; he was to get my watch back again. He returned and said he was answered, she was out of town. I called myself with it a third time, and as I had no suspicion with me at that time, I left the watch with the servant. I had been once before, and was answered she was out of town. I never saw the watch after I left it, until I saw it at Marlborough street office.</p>

               <p>JOHN BASTER. I live at 21, Southampton-street. Russell-square. I know the lady that calls herself Mrs. Larkin; she has lodged with me, and afterwards she visited me. She informed me that she had a house at the east end of the town; she went first by the name of Larkin. One morning she cried to me very much, and said she had left a good husband at Bengal; his name was Ford, and desired me always to call her Ford, and not Larkin, her husband Ford was now living in Bengal. She begged me to write a letter to reconcile her to her husband; I promised so to do for her. I asked her how she came by the name of Larkin? She said she lived with Mr. Larkin five months; that he took her away from her husband. She said that Mr. Larkin presided at the Marine Board at Bengal.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was this? - A. About fifteen years ago she begged me to write to reconcile her to her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote that letter for her, did you? - A. No, I made a copy of it for myself; I never shewed it her. Yesterday week she told me she would swear one hundred and fifty oaths, and swear black was white, and white was black, but she would transport Mr. Swinton; and if the judge and jury should acquit him, she would blow his brains out. It is true, I assure, you gentleman; and she has said, at other times to me, frequently, that she was sure Mr. Swinton had no intention to do her any harm, or of robbing her of any thing. I then asked her how she came to charge him with felony? She said she was advised to do it; she did not say by whom in particular. She said she had written for this watch in the country; she could not write herself; she employed a lady to write to him to send her this watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. What business are you - A. I am in the coal trade; I do as other coal merchants do; I draw from the wharf. My office is at my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no wharf, no carts, or horses, nor any accompting-house - A. I keep no clerk whatever, nor any carts or horses; I am my own clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. She said she had been married at Bengal to Mr. Ford, did it not strike you as very odd - A. I thought her a very odd character.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you, she would swear one hundred and fifty oaths, that black was white, and white was black, to either hang or transport Swinton, and if the Judge or Jury should acquit him, she would take the first opportunity to blow his brains out - A. Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. But at other times she said to you, that Swinton never meaned to do her any harm, or to rob her, did not you say how can you swear black is white, and white is black, to hang or transport him; did you never make that observation - A. I might.</p>

               <p>Q. You might, or you might not. Perhaps you advised her to go to Newgate to see Swinton - A. I deny that ever I gave her any advice of any kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never give her instructions about the indictment - A. Nothing more than from her solicitation. I did it out of common charity. She had no person to go with her; I went with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You the friend of Swinton to go with her to give the instructions about the indictment - A. I do not know that I am the friend of Swinton.</p>
               <p>Q. You can say whether you are or not. How came you to go with Mrs. Larkin to give the instructions about the indictment? what date did you give in - A. The date she gave; I don't know what particular date.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Swinton to get you - A. I was subpoened; the subpoena was served me in the street; I had been to Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Swinton knew you had been to proser the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never tell the attorney you would give him some money if he would get the bill throwed out - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Mrs. Larhin. Can you write - A. I can, but not so good a hand as I could wish.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that pursuaded you to go to Newgate to see Swinton - A. Mr. Baster; he told me not to take my other two witnesses there, Mr. Salton, the jeweller, and

               <p>Q. If the Judge and Jury should acquit him you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260049"/>would shoot him - A. I never said that; I do not know how to use a pistol; I could never have said that; that never was uttered by me.</p>

I left my tools in the shop at night, and my fellow workmen also. I fastened the doors of the workshop myself that night, with two bolts, and the next morning when we came to our work, the door that I fastened myself was open; a hole was cut through, so as to shove the bolts back. We looked for our tools; they were gone. We came up to Town, and made enquiry at the pawnbrokers, and in Compton-street, Soho, while we were in enquiry at the pawnbroker's a man came in with a basket of tools, and went out again; this was about half after ten. The shopman said, there, a man came in with some tools, he has gone out again; we went out, and saw the prisoner with my basket at his back; I ran after him; he dropped the basket directly I got up to the basket; I fell over the basket. The prisoner ran up a court where there was no thoroughfare; my partners followed the prisoner over the wall, and took him. I secured the basket; it is my basket, and my tools are in it. These are my saws; I can swear they are mine.</p>

               <p>HENRY BREWMAN. I am a shopman to Mr. Griffin. On the 21st of September, the prisoner came to look at some handkerchiefs; the price was too high; they were seven shillings and sixpence. I then shewed him some at three shillings, which he held up to the light to examine with one hand, and with the other hand he put the four handkerchiefs in question in his pocket. I saw by his actions that he was putting some thing into his pocket; I saw him move his hands. I did not see him take the property. I saw by his actions that he was putting something into his pocket. I got over the counter, and touched his trowsers. I asked him what he had got there: he instantly took the handkerchiefs out, and throwed them on the counter, and said he had nothing. We gave him then into the custody of the people at the watchhouse. These are the handkerchiefs; they are Mr. Griffin's property,</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Paul's, Covent Garden. At three o'clock I heard the watchman call watch; I went to his assistance: he had hold of the prisoner by the tail of his coat; he said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. I took him to the watchhouse; at the watchhouse he was searched, and the prosecutor's handkerchief was found in his pocket. In taking him to the watch-house, he threw something away. The prosecutor said it was his watch. After I had taken him to the watchhouse, I returned the way I came, and looked into all the areas; I could not find the watch. The prisoner and the prosecutor were both in the dark.</p>

We found this pocket-book with four one-pound notes in it. We found no watch. We found these keys; they belong to the prosecutor.</p>

In the course of the day I lost it, I believe between eight and nine o'clock. I went to Bow-street to give information, and to enquire about it, and while I was looking for an officer, the officers who are here, came to my house in my absence. I returned about ten o'clock, and found they had the property in their possession.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GODFREY. I am a patrole of Bow-street. On Thursday, the 20th of October, I received private information that there was a barrow wheeling along Broad-street, and a large box upon it. I went to a place in Charles-street, where they supposed the property was; I proceeded along the passage to a back room on the ground floor; I knocked at the door, the door was locked. They asked me who was there; I told them a friend; it was full five minutes before they opened the door. I saw the four prisoners in the room, and a box containing soap, two men and two women. The box was there broken open, the cords cut. Gardner was sitting down on the box smoking his pipe, Yates was on the bed, Crouch was washing, and the other woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260051"/>sitting by the side of her. I asked how the box came there; Crouch said, she and Gardner brought it in out of the passage, supposing it was left by some person. I searched the whole of the prisoners; on Crouch I found two pieces of soap in her pocket, which matched the soap in the box. The barrow was taken to the watchhouse by the watchman found in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose them all at one time - A. I cannot say. I left my lodging to go into the country three weeks ago last Monday. I left the the prisoner there lodging in the house; he lodged in the same room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he - A. I don't know. These things were in my box when I went into the country. The landlady sent for me. I came home, and found my things gone. I have only seen my locket since.</p>
               <p>MRS. HILL. I am the owner of the house where King lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing to prove that the prisoner took these things - A. There was no other person in the room but he and a young man.</p>

            . I am a city officer. On the 20th of last month, on my going up Holborn, I met the three prisoners. Suspecting their intention, I followed them from Holborn to 100, Holywell-lane, Shoreditch, to Mr. Lack's shop; they continued in company all the way. At Mr. Lack's shop, Perry and Mascall went in; the other waited outside; the one outside I took into custody before Perry and Mascall came out of the shop. I had a gentleman with me, his name is Musgrove. I desired him, when the two others came out of the shop, for him to take me, and I would take the other. I laid hold of them when they came out, with his assistance; Mascall had the umbrella. I saw by the appearance of the umbrella, I thought there was something in it that ought not to be. In the umbrella there was four pieces of ribbon at the bottom; here are the three pieces that are marked; these three pieces were shown to Mr. Lack, and claimed by him and his wife. Mascall said she had not taken any ribbon, she had purchased a bit. The three pieces were taken into Mr. Lack's and there they were claimed. These are the the three pieces of ribbon.</p>

I saw before I went to bed, that the house was all perfectly safe, and security fastened. I fastened up my house, and my cellar flap as usual. I am a licensed victualler. About four o'clock in the morning the watchman said. I had thieves in my house. I came down to the watchman; he told me a drayman had been past, and had told him he saw a man coming out of my cellar flap. I went to the cellar door and found it secure as I had left it the over night; and on my examining the cellar. I saw a box that was left in my care, and the contents of the box scattered about in the cellar, and I saw the prisoner in the corner of the cellar, hid behind a butt. The contents of the box, the the greatest part of them, are in the indictment. I had been in the cellar in the afternoon; there were none of the things in that box scattered about then; the prisoner I have seen come in and out of the house, I knew his person.</p>

            . I am a setter in the employ of the prosecutors. The prisoner was a setter; on Monday the 10th of October, the prisoner asked me if I was going out; I said I should go out and have a pint of beer at one o'clock. The prisoner said he would do the same. Some of the men were gone to dinner; they lived thereabouts. No one was left in the field but the prisoner and me. I returned in about three quarters of an hour; the prisoner was not there; he did not come to work no more in the course of that day. There is a place in the field where these pieces were put when they were dry, and they are left until we have done work.</p>

When I went on board, I saw Lewis on deck; I asked him if there was any King's stores on board, he said not that he knew of. I then proceeded to search the ship, and in the hold I saw three casks, and underneath the casks I found a quantity of casks. I produce this bag of chips; I found these chips under the casks; there was then part of the broad arrow upon many of them; they had just been cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been done to the casks to conceal the chips being cut off - A. Yes, they had been painted; the paint was wet upon them; the casks had been originally painted all over, but they were fresh painted over the parts that had been cut off. There had been chips taken off by each side of the bung-hole, and also on the head of the cask; the places where the chips had been taken off are the places were the broad arrow is usually put on. I went on board and asked Lewis where the casks come from; he said from France, by the commissary in France; he said he had taken soldiers; these casks were sent on board to contain water for the soliders. I then asked him how they come not to be returned at Deptford, when he returned the other stores; he said he was freighted at Bourdeaux with brandy, I asked him why they were not returned back? He said that 
               <persName id="t18141026-89-person848">Wallis</persName>
             the other prisoner, who went out as supercargo of the ship had told him that the casks were given to him by the commissary in France, and that he had no occasion to return them. Lewis told me he was master of the vessel himself; I then asked him who cut the marks out of the casks; he said he did not know who had done it.</p>
               <p>Mr. BELL. I am master cooper of the victualling premises at Deptford. The casks are usually marked on each side of the bung and upon the head. On these casks, the marks on each side of the bung are taken out or defaced. They are the marks that we usually put on them. I have no doubt they were the stores of the victualling office, Deptford; the rase mark is taken out; it is a little mark. I have examined all the three casks; I have no doubt or hesitation in saying they are part of his Majestys stores at Deptford.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am an apprentice to the owners of the ship. I remember Mitcnell coming on board, and seizing these three casks.</p>
               <p>Q. What had been done on these three casks - A. When he came on board that morning, he gave orders to get them out from underneath some wood that was forward; he cut out the marks of the broad arrow, and told me to paint them over; he painted some, and I the others, and afterwards, in about three or four hours, the officer came on board.</p>
               <p>Lewis's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand before you charged with an offence against an act of parliament, to this time unknown to me. On the 31st of August I shipped myself on board the brig Bactor, Captain Wallis, commander, at three pounds a month, and continued on board as mate. Soon after I became acquainted with Captain Wallis; he told me a young man of the name of Shew, who was subject to the impress; he said it would be necessary for me to have my name on the book as captain, and Shew as mate. I never took any charge of her. I was always obedient to the orders of Captain Wallis. Three puncheons came on board, and were filled with water at Bourdeaux, for the ship's company. I arrived at Deptford, and was informed, the ship casks were not to be delivered at the victualling office; Captain Wallis ordered me to take out them marks of the three casks; I did as he commanded me before all the ship's company. I thought I was correct. I still left most conspicuously the broad arrow on the hoops of the said casks. I had my chests in the deck of the vessel, when a Thames Police officer came on board; he said the three casks were concealed, that they had his Majesty' mark defaced; he found by the men on board that I had done it. I was then taken to the Thames Police office, and then ordered to attend the next day; not knowing the difficulty, I attended the following day at the office, where I met with the captain, and instead taking to himself the ill consequence of this act, in consequence of his command, he converted it into a shield for his own protection, saying that I was captain, and that he acted as supercargo; that the magistrate would not believe, and from the evidence then adduced, the magistrate committed Captain Wallis and me for trial, whereas I acted by the captain's commands.</p>

No; I had known them before, but at that moment I did not recollect their persons, although I had known them before; I had known many of them perfectly, and the others I had seen before. They were noisy. I was going off the pavement to make way for them; the prisoner Andrews either was or appeared to be in liquor, he staggered against me, and threw me against the pavement, seven or eight immediately came round me, and took from me my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. The staggering against you, you say was done by Andrews - A. Yes; I am positive to his person, he had a white apron on. I had a knowledge of him when I got to the watchhouse. The man that took my watch is not here. I struck him, as he staggered back I saw my watch drop out of his hand. I could have recovered my watch if it had not been for the prisoner Wall.</p>

I laid hold of Wall by the collar, and kept hold of him by the collar, and kept hold of him until the watchman came up. Tooley and Andrews followed us to the watchhouse; the watchman took Wall to the watchhouse.

            . I am a watchman. After I had called the hour of half past twelve, I heard the call of watch; I ran up immediately. I found the prisoner Wall in the custody of the prosecutor; the prosecutor gave charge of him to me. He told me he was the man that prevented him from recovering his watch. There were several people around us in two parties of two and three. We proceeded on to the watchhouse. The prosecutor said, as soon as you deliver Wall at the watchhouse lay hold of the man with the apron on, and I will take the other. On our coming into the watchhouse, Andrews and Tooley came in also, and Mr. Ives gave charge of them immediately; the prosecutor said they were part of the gang that robbed him in Oxford-street, and taken his watch, chain, seal, and key from him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Ives. What kind of a watch was it - A. It was a fine tortoishell watch, the watch cost me twenty-five guineas; the chain was a heavy gold curbed chain, I gave five guineas for it. I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260056"/>never seen it since. I advertised the watch, with ten guineas reward.</p>
               <p>Wall's Defence. When I was coming up Brunswick-street towards my way home I ran down Oxford-street, Mr. Ives catched hold of me by the collar; he said, I have lost my watch, I shall take you; he appeared intoxicated, and when I was going into the watchhouse, these other two men were taken into the watchhouse. I never saw them before. Mr. Ives stated to the magistrate that I stooped down to make away with the property, although Mr. Ives knew the man who had taken the watch. and as to my moving my arms, they were tired with the watchman holding of them tight.</p>
               <p>Andrews's Defence. I am innocent of the crime I am charged with.</p>
               <p>Tooley's Defence. I saw Wall in custody of the two watchmen; I followed them into the watchhouse, and then I was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>JENKINS WILLIANS. On Friday the 2nd of October, I saw the prisoner unpin a pair of stockings, that were against the door, they were under cover in the passage; he brought them into the shop he stood close to the counter, with the stockings in his hand, nobody behind the counter could see the stockings in his hand; be kept them concealed before the counter; he asked for something on the counter, and then he asked for change of a twenty pound note; he did not tender the note. I answered, I could not change it; the shopman was serving a customer with ribbons. I saw the prisoner take from the box, a coloured ribbon, and then he asked the shopman to let him see some white ribbon; it was shewed to him; he bought one yard, and paid sixpence for it. I saw him put his hand into the box, and take a piece of white ribbon. I then sent for an officer. I went round the counter, and would not let the prisoner go. He asked me what I wanted with him; I said only my own, he threw the stockings on the counter, and said if I would give him change he would pay me for them. I asked him for the note; he said he would not give it me. Then the officer came, and took the ribbon out of his pocket. These are the two pieces of ribbon, and these are the stockings they are my masters property.</p>

I applied at the place where he gave me directions; there was no person of that name lived there; there was a shed to the house; I looked in the shed; my truck was not there. About a fortnight after, I met the prisoner; I asked him why he had not brought my truck home; he said, he would bring it home that afternoon; by what he had under his arm, I thought he was a weaver.

               <p>MR. STRANGE. I keep the Green Man, at Paddengton. On Monday the 17th of October, Conliffe applied to me to buy some cheeses, about the middle of the day and told me a boat man had some cheeses to sell, if I wanted to buy any. I asked him the weight and the price; he did not know either. I told him to bring them to me, I would buy if I could, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260057"/>between eleven and twelve at night Conliffe came to me again, As I was coming out of the parlour he called me to come to him; he took me into the kitchen in my house, there sat Cooper, I saw a couple of cheeses in a bag. I asked them the price of the cheeses. They were both together. I will not be positive whether it was fifty or sixty shillings. I thought it was a fair price, according to the size of them. I told them they were too much for me; they said, one was about forty pounds; the weight of the other they could not guess. I went from there, and told my wife, and when I returned to them, they reduced the price, until they got down to thirty shillings; at last, I was to have them at my own price. I heard that they were stolen cheeses. I left them in the kitchen. I told them the cheesses were all safe. They said, they wanted money; I said, to Conliffe, I will lend you six shillings. The next morning Cooper came into my bar; I asked him where his companion was, and said I must see you both together, and then we would see about it. I then had them both taken into custody. These are the cheeses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the cheeses that I lost from my boat.</p>

He set them at the counting-house door, where we usually take the money; he then went into the shed again, where he remained some time; during which, I examined the leaves of deal he had brought up, which were divided into two parcels; I took the money and attended the gentleman; I asked him, what number of leaves of deal he wanted; he stated the number to be the larger portion, taking no notice of the smaller he had put of one side; he said, he wanted as many as the larger parcel contained; the larger parcel contained five or six leaves; the smaller parcel was three leaves. I made the entry in the Cash-book. I cannot tell the exact price. I think it must be seven shillings. I gave him the opportunity; he took both parcels. I saw him take them both.</p>

This is the wood.</p>

I came down, and she followed me, and when I came into the street' I missed my watch. I turned back to look for the prisoner, there was nobody to be perceived in the passage. I took the patrole with me up stairs to the room where I had been. The door was fast; I knocked at the door, and a dog barked. Afterwards he dog growled, as if somebody was holding its mouth. I asked for the door to be opened; nobody answered. I went with the patrol to the watchhouse to ask if we might break the door open. The constable would not give leave: we went back and knocked at the next room door; there was a man and a woman there; we stood a considerable time on the landing of the stairs; the patrol hid his light, thinking somebody might come up the stairs. In about a quarter of an hour, the prisoner Neal came up the stairs; the prisoner Neal came up the stairs, the patrol seized him by the collar, and while the patrol had hold of his collar, Neal dropped the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Neal been in the room - A. Not as I know of; there was no light in the room, and the watch was without a case. We took him to the watchhouse; it had a case when I lost it. I found it on the stairs without a case. I am sure I had the watch; I felt the watch as I went up stairs; I am certain I had the watch with me. I lost the watch after I got into that house. I am sure of it; I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

            . I am a patrol. Between twelve and one, on the 23d of October, in Charles-street I met the prosecutor. He said he had been robbed of his watch; he took me to the house; I went up stairs with him, and knocked at the door; I went down to the watchhouse to know whether I might break open the door, The constable would not give me any order. I went back and waited a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner Neal came up stairs. I then took the lantern from under my coat; Neal then jumped down two or three stairs, I followed him, and perceived the watch go against my thigh, and it fell down on the stairs. I called for Baker the watchman to take hold of him, while I picked up the watch. I picked up the watch without the case. I took Neal to the watchhouse. I went back and found the case on the stairs where I found the watch.</p>
               <p>Davenport's Defence. I put the watch on the bannister of the stairs; I certainly took the watch, and laid it on the bannister of the stairs. Neal knows nothing about it, no more of it then a child unborn.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PELLIS. I am an officer, On the night of the 10th of October, a quarter before nine o'clock. I stopped the prisoner in Broad-street, St. George's parish. He was carrying across his shoulder a bag and basket. I asked him what he had got there; he told me oil, he said he come from Mr. Hubbuck, and he was going to carry it to Mr. Hubbuck's customers in Whitechapel. I had a suspicion all was not right; I took him into a public house and asked him for a bill of parcels; he said he had none. I asked him where he was going to carry it to? he said to a private house, but he did not know the name. I asked him if Mr. Hubbuck knew of it? He said he did not. On examining the can, I found two gallons of sperm oil, and a gallon of turpentine in the can in the bag. I took him to the office; I then went and searched his house, and in the cupboard in the first lower room, I found a tin can, containing two gallons of lamp oil, and a bladder containing a pint and a half of turpentine, and ten pound weight of red paint, and two pounds of stone blue, the whole of which I took to the office. I asked the prisoner about them; he said he brought them from Mr. Hubbuck's a little at a time, his wife had been very ill, and he was in great distress. This is the property</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the whole of the tin cans; I know the blue, and the tin can containing the red paint. I dealt in all the the articles.</p>

I went home with her to her apartment; I had not been with her five minutes before she picked my pocket of my watch, She stepped out of the room; she said she wanted to go and get something to drink, I was surprised to see her go out of the room. I felt for my watch; I went to the door to go out after her; she had locked the door outside, so that I could not go after her. I knocked at the door, she returned in three or four minutes, and asked me what was amiss. I said she had robbed me of my watch, I laid hold of her by the arm, and pulled her to the street door, and hallooed out watch. There came seven or eight women in the passage, and the prisoner made her escape. I went to the watchman and patrole; I could not find her. This was twelve o'clock at night. In eight days afterwards I saw the prisoner again in Drury-lane. She denied having any knowledge of me at all or of my watch. After a good while she confessed where she had pawned my watch; it was pledged at Charing Cross, I went and found the watch.</p>

I put it in my drawers, in the ward-robe, in my bed-room; it is a drawer I always put the money in. I had frequently missed money in that particular drawer. On the 8th of October, between seven and eight in the morning, when I had done breakfast, I went to the drawer, and applied the usual key; I found a difficulty in opening it; I at last, opened it; I counted the money. I found an eighteen-penny piece and a shilling short of the marked money. Mr. Emblin went, and fetched an officer. I saw the officer take the marked eighteen-penny piece and the shilling out of the prisoner's box.</p>

I asked her where; she said at Bow-street. I asked her to leave the address, and I would send them. She said, she was going there, and if I would send any person, she would send them to the lady. I sent my shop woman with them, with two lace shawls. I did not hear any more until the person came back again.</p>

            . I am a shop woman to Mrs. Rennie. The prisoner asked me to go with her; as she went along, she said, she was quite a stranger in town, and her mistress was a foreigner in Bow-street; when she got there, she told me to go into the parlour, and she would go up, and tell her mistress she was come; she came in again in a few minutes; she said her mistress being a foreigner, did not like to see strangers; and she would take one of the shawls up stairs to her, and show her. I waited there a little time, and she never came. I saw two servants in the passage; I went; and asked them where the young person was; she told me to sit down, she dare say she would not be long. I waited there a long time, after that, and began to be quite uneasy, and asked her again; she said the person was gone out that came in with me. I asked her what she was gone out for; she said, to shew her mistress the shawls. They said they knew nothing of the girl, she was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was this - A. The Brunswick Hotel in Bow-street, Covent-garden. I never saw the prisoner again, until I saw her at Bow-street; I am sure she is the person to the best of my recollection; it is her, I have no doubt about it I never saw the shawls again.</p>

The prisoner came to my shop on the 24th of August, about twelve o'clock in the day, she asked me if I would send some spencers to a lady, the lady was not able to come herself; I called one of my young woman to go with the spencer, and the prisoner. The prisoner conversed with me in the shop near twenty minutes, which gave me an opportunity to recognise her again. When the young person was ready, I packed up the spencer, and gave it to her, and told her to go with the lady to Hart-street. I worked for several ladies in Hart-street, Bloomsbury, and thought it might be for some of them. The young woman returned to me again, as white as ashes, and in such a tremble, she could not tell what to do; when the servant came back, she told me she had been to the Bath hotel. I went to the hotel, and asked who the person was that wanted the spencer; they said, they knew nothing about the lady. The second time I saw the prisoner was in St. Martin's-court; a lady that was with me, said only look at these two girls; I looked at them, and stood looking at them ten minutes. I said, there is the person that took the spencer from me; her face was towards me as she was eating the pastry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she look off you - A. Not that I know of. I went away from the window with intent to get a person to take her into custody; the person with me said, I would not take her now. We watched her out; I said, I would go home and fetch Louisa, and see if she was of the same opinion. She walked up New Street; I fetched Louisa; she said, that is the person, I first saw her on the 24th of August, this was on the 25th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from your looking at her in the pastry cook's shop, and your seeing her in New Street - A. An hour. I had a full view of her in the pastry cook's shop; she might not see me. When Louisa recognized her in New-street, Covent Garden we followed her up King-street, down New-street again; I went into George-street to inquire for a constable; not finding one, I went into a public house, saw a watchman; he went with me, I laid hold of the prisoner; she was with Clara then, that is her and then I got to the light, I said, to the watchman, this is the woman take charge of her; she pulled herself away, and said she was not the person. I was mistaken. She went to the light because I would not let go of her, she pulled off her bonnet at Bow-street, at the first examination I swore to her; the same as I did the second examination, and the more I see her the more I think it to be her.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to the prosecutrix. On the 24th of August, I went with the prisoner to the Bath hotel, in Hart-street, Covent Garden, at twelve o'clock in the day; she knocked at the door, and a servant let her in; she walked into the back parlour; she desired me to set down until she returned, I thought she went up stairs to a lady. Finding she did not return, I went out to the landing-place, called the boy who was cleaning knives; I asked him if he knew any thing of the person who had brought me there with the spencer; he said, he knew nothing of her; he called a person of the name of Mrs. Brown. I asked her if she knew any thing of the person; she said, she did not. I went out of the room, and I never saw the spencer after that. When the prisoner came to me, she said, give me the spencer, and I will go and fit it on the lady. That is all I know, I gave it her. I am certain the prisoner is the person.

I had been watching her half an hour, I saw her take a pair of spectacles out of Mr. Clark's pocket. She was going out of the court. I caught hold of her; Mr. Clark claimed the spectacles when I shewed him them. I took the prisoner into a public house, and searched her; I found a silk handkerchief, a cotton handkerchief, and a pocket-book upon her, and a shillings worth of halfpence. I shewed the handkerchiefs, and they were owned.</p>

            . I am a soldier in the third regiment of guards. The prisoner informed me he was discharged from the marines on the 10th of October. I left my overalls in my room about one o'clock; the jacket did not belong to me, it was taken from the barrack room where I sleep in the Tower. My overalls were taken out my box under my own bed. I put them in my box on the 10th, about one o'clock in the afternoon; on the following morning I went to put them on to go on parade, they were gone. In the morning when I complained I had lost my overalls, a man complained he had lost his jacket. The prisoner was taken in custody on the evening of the 19th, I saw him in the guard-room; I asked him where my overalls were, and the jacket, when he informed me they were in a house in Westminster, he had left them there, and I might have them if I would call for them at a house the right-hand side in Tothill-street, where they sold old clothes. I went to the house and enquired for a pair of overalls and a regimental jacket; the jacket has been found since. I was stopped thirteen shillings and sixpence out of my pay for them. I had them, I know, the day before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HILL. I am in the third regiment of guards. I lost my jacket on the 10th of October, It was left on my bed in the barrack-room.

I have seen the jacket since; this; is the jacket; I went into the barrack-room where William Street slept; I saw the jacket, and claimed it immediately.

On the 21st of October, having some plumbers and carpenters work to do, we engaged several men to do the same three days. After the plumbers had worked, I found a piece of lead secreted in a shed, under some bits of wood bent half round, apparently to fit the body, with a nail projecting at about half an inch from the centre. Having a suspicion that it was intended to be taken away, I took the earliest opportunity of marking it I marked it before dinner-time. In the afternoon I made my observations of the different men, and my suspicion fell on the prisoner. When they left work at night, I ascertained the lead was gone.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260064"/>I disguised myself in my great coat. I followed the workman to Bow, thinking to detect the receiver; but being foiled in that, I immediately seized the prisoner with the lead on him. I found it secreted under his waistcoat or jacket, in the front of him, with the nail projecting, as I supposed, for the nail to catch the waistband of his breeches, with a loop to his shoulders. This is the lead, with my mark upon it. It is mine and my partners property. The prisoner is a plumber.</p>

I placed the prisoner in it to take care of it, and to shew it to such persons as wished to see it. She is a married woman; I think I placed there on the on the 40th of June last. On the 18th of last month, by the prisoner's husband's master I was informed; he came down to me, and told me; that he had been informed by the husband that she had been making away with the property. Her husband is a chair-maker by trade. From which I went to Marlborough street; the magistrate sent me with an officer to the house to search it, to see whether, the property was stolen or not. I searched it, and found the articles in the indictment missing, and a great many others. There was missing two blankets, two sofa covers, eight chair cushion covers, two pillow cases, a swing glass, five bedside carpets, six bed curtains, 4 hearth rugs, one baize cover, four flat irons, a set of bed furniture, and a pillow; all these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260065"/>things were taken out of the house. The prisoner had not given me notice that she had left the house. When I went to the house the husband was there. I expected to find her there. I accompanied the husband to the house where he thought she was. I found her in a room in Windmill-street, where she delivered to me part of the duplicates of the property she had pawned. I then requested she would accompany me to Devonshire-street, where the officer was in waiting; and when she got to Devonshire-street she delivered part of the duplicates to the officer, and part I have received since. She has been in confinement. I took her to Marlborough-street office, She was there committed. On the husband I found no duplicates. I do not think he was accessary to it, nor did he know it, in my opinion. These are the the duplicates I received of her when I found her.</p>

I went up to him directly; he said he had lost his watch, his silver snuff-box, and this handkerchief. I looked about the room; after I got the prosecutor dressed I took him to two or three different rooms; he said they were none of the girls that he knew.

I took down his place of abode; I and Cowley went and informed the landlord, if he did not find the women he would get into trouble. There were three apprehended. The prosecutor spoke to these two, he would not speak to the third. I shewed him the room; the prosecutor said that was the room, and the landlord of the house said they were the two women that were with him.</p>

I pursued him, and brought him back to Mr. Moss's house; he went to the ladies in the house; he said ladies, I have brought you the door. The ladies said, they knew nothing of the door, or him. I then took him to the watchhouse. This is the door.</p>

My pocket-book was in my jacket pocket; my pocket-book contained a bill of exchange for thirteen pounds five shillings and eight-pence, and three one-pounds bank notes. The prisoner took the bill for payment. I took an officer, and apprehended him.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. On the 18th of October, Mr. Tuddensham applied at the office, saying, he had lost a bill of exchange, and other things; I went with Mr. Tuddensham to Mr. Lancaster, a butcher, Spitalfields-market; I there apprehended the prisoner, and searched him; I found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>MR. LANCASTER. I am a butcher, in Spitalfields market. The prisoner Dixon offered me this bill; I can swear to the bill. When he brought it, he asked me to accept it. This is the bill.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the bill; I lost it; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went for payment of the bill, Mrs. Lancaster said Mr. Lancaster was not at home; the daughter told me it was a stolen bill. I paid for the bill in the public market, Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The bill is not negotiable; I never endorsed it.</p>

I am surprised at that, for I have been at that church several times to search the book of marriages. I would defy any two persons of the name, who were not very dissimilar in the advantages of that part of education, to write their names without being able to trace the resemblance of each to the other; a man's name being usually written with rapidity, and are very negligent of the form of the letters. I entreat the jury to consider the nature of the evidence is by no means positive. Miss Timson, if her attachment to me was so violent would have spurned at my disgrace, when she knew her own character could not have escaped in such a compromise; and one of the papers given in evidence against me was in pencil writing, which I submit is not cognizable in a court of justice, and whatever I have said at best is evidence; I submit whether that might operate against me; it has not been misproved that

               <p>Q. Where had you been on Sunday - A. To chapel; I was returning from chapel when I met with this; I returned from chapel about a quarter past eight in the evening; I was about twenty yards from my own house in Grovesnor-row, Chelsea; I was coming home from chapel, in the foot-path, in the main street; my son screamed out, here he is: he screamed out, that something was thrown over me, and I understood him to say Butcher; I perceived the effect immediately on turning round; I have the things in court. I tested it; it burnt my skin off my lip, and water poured from my mouth in torrents; it burnt my mouth very much, and made my mouth water very much.</p>
               <p>Q. What effect did it produce upon your clothes, what clothes did it injure - A. Stockings, shoes, a shawl, and a gown; I valued my gown at twenty shillings; this is my shawl that I had on on Sunday evening; it has burned my gown in seven places, it has burnt it all to pieces; that was produced by the liquid thrown over it; the gown was quite whole, and almost new. The shawl has many great holes in it; the shawl was worth ten shillings, and more than that; I believe it was valued a pound at the office. They were both in a perfect state before the liquid was thrown over them. When the liquid was thrown over me, I saw the prisoner cross the way; my son accused him of doing it; he said that Mr. Butcher had thrown something over me; Butcher denied it; he said, would he say that he did it; yes, the boy said, he would say so before any magistrate in England. That was all that happened at that time. The boy supported his charge, and the prisoner denied it. My husband laid hold of him; he did not search him, he being a neighbour, and it being a Sabbeth evening.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a neighbour - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been upon good terms - A. We had no words; I did not know that he owed me the least ill will in the world. When my husband laid hold of him, he let him go; he did not want to take him from his wife and family that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all see the liquid or whatever it was that came from him - A. I did not see; it was behind me.</p>

I asked the prisoner, how he came to do it; he denied it. The boy accused him of it. I found my wife's clothes were burnt. The prisoner touched me on the waistcoat, which stained my waistcoat; my waistcoat is stained now. I am not acquainted with the smell of aquafortis; there was a very strong smell upon it, and a very unpleasent one; it was a strong smelling liquid that stained my waistcoat. I washed the place since; I believe the is a stain upon it now. I let him go directly; I was not aware of it at the time it happened; at the time I laid hold of him. I was not aware that the waistcoat was stained with his touch; not till I got in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person touch your waistcoat - A. Not at all. There was some gentleman took hold of him when I let him go; I requested he might not be kept in custody that night; I said, I knew him very well, he was a neighbour, I knew where to find him; the next morning in consequence of which he was suffered to go at large.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he - A. He keeps an eating-house. I told him he had done an unmanly action, and I hoped he would consider of it, and prepare himself against the morning; he wanted to know what I ment by calling it an unmanly action, and seemed to want to fight; I told him I wanted no disturbance in the street at all; I should not defend myself that way; therefore, he would be prepared for the next day. My wife's clothes at the instant fell to pieces, not immediately, but in a short time afterwards. The next morning I did not take him before the magistrate; in consequence of his having gone to Marlborough-street to obtain a warrant against me for assaulting and stopping him in the street; I thought it necessary to defend myself; I went to Bow-street, and got a warrant, and had him taken up.</p>

            . I am 16. I returned from chapel all the way with Mr. and Mrs. Bailey; I walked all the way behind my mother. In consequence of having received information of my mother on the Thursday evening, On Sunday evening, I saw the prisoner come out of an entry with a phial or something that held liquid in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that entry - 
               <persName id="t18141026-141-person1209">A. </persName>
            That is Grosvenor-row; it is a cart way to a factory and paper stainers. He had a phial, and his thumb on the top of the phial; when he came out of the entry he was about a yard and a half, or rather better from Mrs. Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other person as near as him to Mrs. Bailey - A. No; I fanoy he watched that opportunity. I say him throw the liquid out of the bottle; the liquid came some on my mother, and some on the ground; some fell on my stocking, which I instantly felt it come through my stocking, and made my leg smart a little. This is the stocking; the acid is in the stocking now; I was so near the prisoner, that he nearly tripped me down; there was no other person near that could throw it on my mother. Upon my screaming out the prisoner hovered over me, and said, do you say, I did it; I said yes, I will swear it before any magistrate in England, I now say upon my oath the prisoner did it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him the character of a good tempered man.</p>

            . I am a constable of padington. I apprehended Parker on Monday, the 24th of October, in Oxford Road; Mr. Martin asked me what I thought of that man, he had some lead on his back; he put the lead down in a gateway, and set upon the lead; a soldier helped him up with the lead; he crossed Oxford-street; he came from the corner of Queen-street, Grovesner-square, to the further end of Oxford-street; there I laid hold of him, and asked him where he was going with the lead he had on his shoulder; he told me he was a porter to Mr. Stevens in King-street Seven Dials. I told him that was not the way to take it to the Seven Dials; he was going towards Grovesner-square. I took him to Marybone watchhouse; the watchhouse keeper was not there then. We took the prisoner with us to find his master at the Seven Dials; we could not find a Mr. Stevens; he got into a public-house at one door, and ran out at the other. I pursued him and catched him again, in a cellar in Munmouth Street, and brought him again to Marybone watchhouse. I could not find out a Stevens, his master. The weight of the lead he had is one hundred and thirty pounds. I went to the house in Upper Berkley-street; I saw that lead had been taken away, and the lead that Parker had been a part of that lead.</p>

He lives near me in Corporation-lane; he had a handkerchief, apron, a child's frock, and a child's shirt; his wife had put them in the yard to dry; they were lying by the field to dry.

I saw him about half after eight; I recollected him again; I am sure he is the same boy. I saw Ward with him; Swainson took the things.</p>

On the night of the 19th of October, I was alarmed that the robbers had been in between the hours of seven and nine. I went into my parlour, and I missed a looking-glass, some drinking-glasses. and two decanters. I saw the looking-glass brought in; the looking-glass I borrowed of Mr. Elliott; it was not my own, and the wine-glasses were brought back, and the prisoner; the wine-glasses were broken to piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner get in - A. I do not know; the tap door goes with a pulley, and the parlour with a spring-lock.</p>

            . I watched the prisoner above an hour: he was lurking about on a rainy night in the street. I thought him to be a suspicious character, and when he ran away I pursued him; he had a looking-glass under his arm; I did not see him go into the house; he went into the house either at the door or the window. I saw him in Goswell-street with the glass under his arm; he threw the looking-glass into a butcher's shop. I followed him and took him.

            . I watched the prisoner with my brother. I missed him all of a sudden; I saw two persons come from Mrs. Ives's public-house. I ran up to Mrs. Ives's; I saw the parlour window wide open. I went into Mrs. Ives's, and asked her whether she knew her parlour window was open, and whether she had any thing there that she could lose. She went into the parlour, and said she had lost a looking-glass. I immediately ran out with my youngest brother into Goswell-street. He said there was a man over the way with a looking-glass under his arm. We crossed over to him; he began to run; he passed the butcher's shop as he was running; he threw the glass in at the window. We pursued him and took him; we never lost sight of him; we brought him back to Mrs. Ives's. The constable searched him and found upon him two knives, and two decanter stoppers. He was taken to the watchouse; this is the looking-glass.</p>

He sat down, and was soon after joined by another person. My little girl said they were the men that where there on Monday, when we lost three pint pots and some glasses. They called for a glass of ale; I was particular what glasses I sent in. A gentleman came in and called for sixpennyworth of gin and water; the gentleman, after he drank the gin and water, went out, and left the glass in the room. I opened the door, and looked in, and saw one of the glasses were gone; one or them went out; I ordered Piall the constable if the prisoner offered to go out, to stop him. I then asked the prisoner if he had got any properly of mine; he said he had not. I told him I missed a glass. Piall came and took the glass out of his pocket; this is the glass; it is mine.</p>

I was at Knightsbridge-green. I had my supper at the Marquis of Granby, being soon to go to bed; I took a walk with two men and two women into the town; the prisoner was one of the women. After they had persuaded me that it was too late to go to bed, I laid down on the green with one woman on each side of me, I saw the prisoner step over the mans' back; she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse with the money. I understood she took a coach. and drove off to St. Giles's. I saw her run away; she threw her shoes away, and ran away. after she had got my purse. I told the other woman she had better go with me, and shew me where to find the prisoner. The prisoner took a coach; the coachman has come forward; his name is William Fox.</p>
