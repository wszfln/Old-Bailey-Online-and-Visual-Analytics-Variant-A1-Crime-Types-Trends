                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. I watched Messrs. Cooper's premises on Saturday evening, 23rd May, with Scott, another officer; and about 7 o'clock saw the prisoner leaving the premises in Monument Yard—I followed him to Wood Street, Cheapside, and in crossing from there to Falcon Square, I saw him take this bag, done up in this handkerchief, from his pocket, and carry it in his hand—he went down Castle Street into Redcross Square; he joined a woman, whom I afterwards ascertained to be his wife, and they turned back up Redcross Square, and went into a public house—the prisoner came out in about two minutes, having in his hand this canvas</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale tea dealer and grocer, of No. 5, Monument Yard. The prisoner has been in my employment about three years, and was employed on the fruit and refined sugar floor, as a porter—he had access to goods of this description; the tea was not in his depart<lb/>ment, but he had access to it—there was similar sugar candy to this on his floor—our servants are occasionally permitted to purchase goods, and an entry of them is made in a book at the counter by one of the men—there</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 32 1/2, Gray's Inn Lane. I know the prisoner—on 11th May I saw him, at a few minutes after 6 o'clock, at Mr. Bowles's public house, the Coach and Horses, Church Street, Soho—Mr. Blizzard and his father were with me—we remained a couple of hours, and then went to a public house in Compton Street, Soho—we had to meet Mrs. Blizzard again at the public house; we waited about an hour, and from there went to Bowles's public house again to meet Mrs. Blizzard—I do not know the name of the public house in Compton Street, but it is the second door on the right; it is a large house, with two entrances in front—I saw Mrs. Blizzard again at the Coach and Horses—the prisoner was in my company the whole of the time; he was not out of my sight five minutes.</p>

I have been in the habit of passing Mr. Jamieson's premises in the morning, at twenty minutes or half past 7 o'clock, and have seen Donovan there—I saw her there three or four mornings before I took any notice of it at all—she brought a bundle of sacks, ready made, away from the premises that was on Wednesday, 22nd April—I noticed her go home, but not as she ought to go; she turned round several times to see if anybody was watching her, so the following morning I watched her again—she did not bring a full <hi rend="italic">turn</hi> of work out, but a <hi rend="italic">turn</hi> of canvas on her head, and I wrote to Mr. Jamieson on the Friday week—I was in the trade, and knew that she had no business to bring sacks out—I saw Wright and Glynn go there about a quarter of an hour before I saw Donovan—Wright opened the warehouse, but he did not come out from the warehouse before I saw the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This is a mould for a shilling; here are the obverse and reverse sides of it—these two shillings are counterfeit, and are from that mould—these implements ire used for making coin, but they have not been used for some time—these files are used for making good the place where the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> comes off, but they have not been used lately—they have white metal in their teeth—the metal appears the same as the coin—these jars contain what is used for plating the coin—these bottles contain acid used for charging the battery—all these articles are for the purpose of coining—these spoons are used for melting the metal, but have not been used lately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would it not require many more things to make coins besides what are here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this good shilling does not at all refer to the mould or the counterfeit coin.</p>

               <p>saw Mrs. Blackstone show a shilling to her husband, and he gave it to me; I said that it was bad—Mrs. Blackstone took it back to the prisoner—he is the man—I asked him where he got it from—he said, "God knows"—he put the shilling to his teeth, and bit it nearly to pieces—he then asked for a match to light his pipe, and pretended to be tipsy—he left, and I followed him; he walked along Jermyn Street—he crossed the road at the corner, and there was another person in a cart—he got into the cart—the cart went on a little distance, and stopped against the United Service Club—a man came to the back of the cart for an instant, and then went away—the cart then went on along Charles Street to the door of the Opera Tavern—the prisoner got out, and went into the tavern—he brought out a pint pot with something in it, and passed it into the cart to the other man—they seemed to be drinking—they then went on—I went into Mr. Monkton's, and asked what they had passed—I came out, and followed the cart; the same two men were in it—they went on to Cockspur Street, and there by Waterloo House I saw the officer, and gave the two men into custody—I told the officer they had been uttering bad money.</p>

On the night of 11th May, about 9 o'clock, I was at the Hunters' Arms public house—I met the prisoner outside—he interfered with me as I walked up the street, and asked whether I had spoken to the landlord of the Hunters' Arms about him—I said I did not know whether I had or not, but I would do so; and then, as he got at me, I pushed him away twice with my arm, and he deliberately opened a knife and stabbed me, under the gateway, in front of the house—he came in with the knife in his hand, and struck me—I was in the act of calling for a pot of porter—I said, "pot," but had not power to say, "porter," for the knife was put into me in a moment—he struck me at the side of my head, I bled a good deal—I have known the prisoner for years, and his father and mother also; they are very honest, industrious people—I had not struck him, or spoken to him on this occasion; he spoke to me first, and asked if I had laid any information about him to the landlord of the Hunters' Arms—a pair of boots had been taken off a man's feet some eight months ago, and I saw</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 26, Compton Place. I was outside the Hunters' Arms on the night of 11th or 12th May last, and saw the prisoner there—I heard him say so help his God he would do for Connor—he went in at the side door after Connor—I heard a mob inside, and went in and saw Connor standing against the door, bleeding from the face—I put my hand to his cheek to stop the blood; it was spirting out, like turning a water cock on—he was taken to the surgeon's, and I got a policeman, and secured the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Bachrach, a merchant, of No. 38, Clement's Lane. Bahmer was employed as his clerk for about four or five months—on Saturday evening, 2nd May, about 6 o'clock in the evening, he came and asked me for the key of the office—I took it, and went down with him—I went into the office with him, and he pointed out to me a certain quantity of goods in the office, which he said would be sent for, and he desired me to give them up to the person coming for them—he went away, and at 7 o'clock the boy Mohr came with a truck—he gave me this letter—it was in an envelope—I did not open it—just as I had token it from the boy</p>

               <p>Bahmer came up stairs—I handed the note to him—he opened it, and said, "It is all right"—he, and the boy, and I, went into the office, and Bahmer pointed out to the boy the goods he was to take—the boy took three bundles of cloth leather, and Bahmer immediately took down three dozen calf skins—he took them away himself—the boy took the three rolls of cloth leather—they were very heavy, and I assisted him in taking them—I allowed him to take eighteen rolls of this leather cloth, which was as much as I thought the truck would carry—I asked him where he was going to take them—he told me he was going to take them to Whitechapel—I told him to keep his eye on the goods, as I knew Whitechapel was a dangerous place—he went away with the eighteen rolls of cloth leather—Bahmer had before taken away the calf skins—at about 25 minutes to 10 o'clock that night Bahmer came again, and rang the bell—he asked me to put the lights on the stairs, as some persons were coming for the remainder of the goods—I waited till about 10 o'clock, and no one came—I then said I thought it was an unreasonable hour to deliver goods, and, whatever blame might be attached to him, I would not let them go; they might have them on Monday morning—on the Sunday I spoke to the prosecutor, and on the Monday morning Mr. Mohr and another man came with a truck, about half past 8 o'clock—they brought this note; but, in consequence of the communication I had had with Mr. Bachrach, I refused to let them have any goods—I sent for the inspector, and gave them in charge—they were taken, but were discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, in Gower Walk, Whitechapel. Hahn came to my father's house on Saturday evening, 2nd May, about 6 o'clock—I was just having my tea—he said to me, "You come with me; I want to remove out of Lambert Street"—I said, "Yes, sir"—he took me down to Back Church Lane, and I got a truck, and he took me up into the City—he took me to the corner of a street, and gave me a letter, and sent me to the house—I gave the letter to the housekeeper, Reeves—before Hahn gave me the letter I saw the prisoner De Gruyter—we met him just at the beginning of the City—he and Hahn went into a coffee shop—I stopped outside, round the corner, with the truck—they stopped in about ten minutes—they came out, and they said, "Come on"—I said, "How much further?"—they said, "A little further"—when we got to the corner of Clement's Lane, Hahn gave me a letter, and told me to go to the house, and give it to the lady or gentleman—De Gruyter was not with him then; he had just left—I went to the house, and saw Mr. Reeves, and gave him the letter—while I was giving the letter Bahmer came in—he opened the letter, and read it, and said, "Come in, my lad"—he showed me the things—I said I could not take them at once—he said, "Can you at twice?"—I took eighteen pieces of cloth—Mr. Reeves helped them into the truck, and he pushed the truck off—I went to Aldgate, and met Hahn and De Gruytei just by Aldgate Church—Hahn said to me, "Go on ahead, and I will meet you just by Whitechapel Church"—I went on, and they followed me behind—when we got to Whitechapel Church, they took me up Union Street, and</p>

               <p>these articles with the boy to a pawnbroker's, and pawned them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Mr. Bachrach, Clement's Lane; this pawnbroker's shop was in High Street; I went back with the boy, and fetched those pieces which I had left at my friend's; I there met Bahmer, and he asked me why I should have sent a truck with such a little boy, who was not able to take a quarter part of the things; I said had I known it was so much I would have sent him a horse and wagon; he said he would return immediately to his office, and I was to send a larger conveyance to fetch the rest, because those things were absolutely to be pawned that very evening, because the master had a very urgent account to settle on Monday morning; Bahmer then went away, and I sent some person to get a larger van to get all the things at once; in the meantime I pawned the nine pieces exactly for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of Mr. Bachrach, Clement's Lane, and when I came back they told me I was too late to get a larger conveyance; I then went to Worf's, where I had left in the morning a part of my things when I removed, and there I met Bahmer again; he knew I should meet him there, because De Gruyter had told him that I had removed; we did not tarry there very long, but went to Hounds<lb/>ditch, to a coffee shop, where I paid to Bahmer 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the three duplicates, in the presence of De Gruyter, and Miss Retzliff can give evidence that I paid that amount; I said to Bahmer that I was obliged to sleep in a coffee shop that evening, because I had not got a bedroom; Bahmer said also, "I and De Gruyter will stop here to night," and he asked for pen and ink to write a letter, saying that he had pawned these things himself, and that was nothing because Mr. Bachrach was his brother, and if I would send the next Monday for the rest of the things; I said, "No, you had better leave off that, a very great accident or misfortune may follow these things;" he asked me to take a letter to his residence; it was about 11 o'clock at night; I said, "It is too late, I will take the letter to-morrow;" he repeated his request again, telling me that he would accompany me there; as we were going, he said to me that I was to tell the people he was gone to Liverpool, and if he were at Liverpool he would send money here; we went the next day to a friend's, where we staid all day, because I had no room to go to; Bahmer asked me to go on Monday morning and get some more things; I said no, it was too dangerous; Bahmer said he would pawn them himself, and I was to give the letter to the man who was going with the truck to fetch the things, and as he repeated his request, and said he would pay me well, I agreed, and he wrote a letter to the housekeeper, and gave it me; I did not know that this letter was a forged one which he had made in presence of De Gruyter and Miss Retzliff, because he had agreed upon that with the housekeeper, who would deliver all the articles; I was rather late on the following morning, and I came to Mohr's about 7 o'clock; I gave Mohr the order, which he was to hand over to the housekeeper; I know Bahmer said he would go to meet the man there, and then he would take the man, and go and pawn the things; and as I had to deliver this letter to Mohr as I went to work, I stopped there till half past 8 o'clock, and then went to my own dwelling, and then I heard that they were gone to Colchester, and I was to follow them down there; I believe Bahmer must have been informed that somebody had informed against him; about 11 o'clock I was in Leman Street, and there I met Worf; we took a glass of beer together; the wife of Mohr came to me and asked what was become of her husband, because he did not come back; about 11 o'clock I sat in a public house reading a paper, and Worf came and called me out of doors; when I came out, Worf said to Mrs. Mohr, "There is Hahn, he was the cause of your husband being taken into custody;" upon which I said, "If</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150037"/>
               <p>you think so, do as you think proper," and I was taken; Mrs. Mohr said, "It was the fault of this fellow that my husband was taken, take him in charge;" I had given the letter to her husband that morning to fetch the things, that was all I know; the policeman said, "You must go away;" Mrs. Mohr was following me up, and in order to avoid a noise I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and drove away; in the afternoon I went to Colchester, De Gruyter was also there, mending watches; I had been in company with him from the morning till 9 o'clock at night, on the Sunday previous to our being taken into custody; we returned to London the same evening; Bahmer called on his landlord, and when he came back, he said, "If I were to inform against you, I would be free;" the thing was only to know where De Gruyter and I were; on the Tuesday evening Bahmer went to his master, and in order to excuse himself, he said that I and De Gruyter were the guilty parties; Bahmer did not require any temptation to do this bad thing, because he had been obliged to run away from his home on account of having stolen a letter with ten Prussian dollars, and in London he had made many attempts to swindle; I was never intimate with Bahmer; I did not seek for his friend<lb/>ship, but he sought for mine; in the time, eight weeks since, that I made his acquaintance, he called on me more than ten times; he repeatedly asked me to come and see him; I have been there only once, and was there only five minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Worf's Defence.</hi> I cannot say that I was out on Saturday evening; on the Saturday evening these three men came to my house, and said they were going to Liverpool in the morning; I asked Hahn what he had done, he said, "Nothing at all;" Bahmer made me a present of the three dupli<lb/>cates; I went to Mr. Bachrach, and asked him if he had offered 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one that gave him information; he said, "No;" I said, "Put down on a piece of paper that you are willing to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and so he did; I said, "I expect a letter from those men, and as soon as I have a letter I will tell you who they are;" he said, "I don't want them, I want my goods back;" he said he did not believe my word what I said; I had the three tickets, but how could I know that Mr. Bachrach would get his goods back; I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Bachrach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bahmer's Defence.</hi> I never knew Hahn before; I made his acquaintance through another man; I knew De Gruyter; he came from Germany, and brought a letter for me from my uncle; through that I got acquainted with him; Hahn knows perfectly well that I am not brother to Mr. Bachrach, because Cook told him my name was Bahmer; Hahn came to me, and asked me to get him a situation, and I gave him an address to Stockmer and Co.; he afterwards told me he was conversant with the French language, and as my master had a letter to be written in French, I called on him, and got him to write it, and from that time, after writing that letter, he told me that my master was a swindler, and it was no sin to swindle a swindler, who was swindling other persons, and he said if he had any things, he would pay me; I also got daily visits from De Gruyter; my master had American leather, cloth, and calf skins, and Hahn came to my office, and said he was going to take his things away, and he would write a letter for me, that I might say I had received an order for the goods, and I should be free, and we would go together to America; at last he prevailed upon me with this letter; the boy came with the truck, and gave me the letter; I opened it, and gave the boy the pieces to take away; after that I got in such anxiety I did not know what to do; I ran away from the office, and went to my friend Hahn, and he said to me, "You need not be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150038"/>
               <p>afraid," that I had got the order, and it would be nothing, "You have only to say that the order came from your master;" Hahn said that eighteen pieces were too few, they were a trifle, that I should go and fetch the calf skins, else we should not get away; and I went and fetched the three dozen calf skins, and he pointed out which pawnbroker's I should pawn them at; I pawned them, and got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them; I never received a farthing from Hahn, nor a ticket; Hahn received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the articles he pawned himself; he never gave me any money; the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I received for the things I pawned was taken from me by De Gruyter, he saying that he was much older than I was; Hahn told me that I was to go in company with De Gruyter, and he would follow us in the evening, because he was afraid the thing might be known, and we went to Colchester, Hahn having bought razors for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he sold again; I never had the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house painter, living at No. 28, Gifford Street, Caledonian Road. I occupy the ground floor there—the prisoner occupied the whole of the second floor of that house—on the morning of 7th April, about half past 2 o'clock, I was awoke by some noise—I got out of bed, and unlocked the door—I was in the dark—when I unlocked the door I heard Mr. Scott's voice—he said, "Mr. Silence, come up stairs"—I partly dressed myself, and went up stairs, and saw Mr. Scott and the prisoner together—I had no light—there was no light up stairs when I got up—Mr. Tripp said, "Mr. Silence, can you get a light?"—I went down stairs, and got one—it was not more than two or three minutes before I came up again with a light, and I gave it to Mr. Tripp—they were on the stairs during that time, within a stair or so of the top of the landing—they were both on the stairs; not on the same step, but one above the other—Mr. Tripp was above—that was their position when I took the light up—they were both quite dressed—before I gave Mr. Tripp the light he unlocked the front door, on the second floor—it was his own door—I passed Mr. Scott on the stairs—Mr. Tripp was in the room when I gave him the light—I went into the room, and gave it to him—I had heard a noise before that, but I could not say what they said—it was a loud talking—I was in bed when I heard it—I did not hear any loud talking after that—it might have been quarrelling, or talking, I cannot say; I could not understand a word that was said—there were two flights of stairs between my room on the ground floor and the room in which Mr. Tripp lived—when I gave Mr. Tripp the light he lit his candle, and turned round and picked up the sword, and stabbed Mr. Scott—I cannot say whether the sword lay on the table or on a box; there were a lot of things lying about the room—I cannot exactly say where he took it from—it was lying about with other things—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sword; it was one very much like that—I cannot say whether it had any sheath on it at the time he took it up—when he picked up the sword he stabbed Mr. Scott—he was in the room when he picked up the sword—Mr. Scott was standing just outside the door at that time—he was about two or three steps from Mr. Scott when he picked up the sword—I was between them—he had to pass me to get to Mr. Scott—he stabbed him in the left side, between the ribs and the hips—Mr. Scott was then standing still, in the attitude of reading a paper—it was a small bill; I cannot say what it was; I saw it afterwards—when he was stabbed he staggered back against the hand rail, and said, "I am stabbed"—the prisoner made another strike at him, which I warded off by holding my hand up—I assisted him down stairs, and when he was in the passage he asked me to take him to the doctor's; I did so—I left Tripp up stairs—I did not see him again after that till I saw him at the station house—I did not say anything to him at the station—I had no conversation with him at all—I never had any conversation with him since about the reason of Mr. Scott coming to the house—I have known him in that house for very nearly twelve months—he was in the habit of coming home at all hours of the night—Mr. Scott was the landlord of the house—he had a latch key, and could come in at all times.</p>

               <p>that to get him quietly out of the room—there was another officer standing on the landing—he did not come out of the room; he kept his seat; he asked me how Mr. Scott was, if he was hurt much—I told him I believed he was hurt very much—he asked me if he was dead—I told him, no, I believed he was not dead—he said, "I am sorry for that; I am sorry I have not given him his death wound"—he repeated that several times—he asked me several times if he was in my custody, and I would not satisfy him until I had secured the cutlass, and also this knife, which was lying on the table—I seized them, and then I told him he was in my custody, and must go to the station house—when I got to the station house I examined the cutlass; I found marks of blood on it; I went back to his lodgings, and found some marks of blood on the stairs, but none in the room—he was not drunk—I had seen him the night before, about half past 11 or 12 o'clock—he was standing at the corner of Gifford Street, Caledonian Road, talking to Mr. Scott; they were talking and jangling together—they were talking angrily; I did not hear any threats made use of—I did not hear anything that was said—I judged from their tone they were quarrelling about something—I left them there—it was on my beat—I returned there in course of my beat—the prisoner was then gone—I saw Mr. Scott again about 2 o'clock, in that street, by himself—he made an inquiry of me—I did not see Mr. Scott after that, till after this occurred, when I went to his residence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw Scott again, you say, at 2 o'clock in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was standing in Gifford Street alone at that time, about twenty yards from the house where I saw the prisoner—I had some conversation with him at that time—he asked me if I had seen the old vagabond that was talking to him—I said, "Yes"—he said, "He is one of my lodgers, and he owes me some rent"—he said he intended to wait till he came home, and wait there till the morning, and then put the brokers in for his rent—that was about three quarters of an hour before I heard the alarm of "Murder!"—the other time that I saw Scott and the prisoner together was about half past 11 or 12 o'clock; I did not notice the time exactly—I had been on that beat, but he had been home, I believe; I did not see him about there all the time—they were wrangling together about half past 12 o'clock—they did not appear to be excited, either of them, particularly—they were both talking together—I did not know Tripp before—he might have had a little to drink; he was not drunk—I did not see Mr. Scott after he was stabbed—Tripp did not speak to me at any time that evening about Scott obstructing or molesting him.</p>

I was at the station house on the morning of 7th April, about a quarter to 4 o'clock, when the prisoner was brought in in custody by Hill; he stated that the prisoner was charged with stabbing Mr. Scott in the left side with a sword—I then inquired of the constable where Mr. Scott was—he informed me that he was taken by another constable to a hospital—the prisoner immediately said, "Oh! I did it"—I told him it was my duty to caution him that anything he might say would be noticed, and might be used in evidence against him—he made no reply to that—he afterwards said that, had it not been for a lodger inter<lb/>fering, he would have given him a right one and a left one, that there would be no occasion for our taking him to the hospital; that he was justified in doing it; that Mr. Scott had no right to come at that unseasonable hour for his rent—the witness Silence then came in to the station, when the prisoner turned towards him, and said, "If it had not been for your interference, I would soon have made a finish of him"—I then inquired as to the nature of</p>

               <p>the wound that Mr. Scott had received, of the constable who had taken Mr. Scott to the surgeon—I was told that it was an inch and a quarter deep—the prisoner immediately made answer, and said, "I wish it had been six inches deep."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bemmerton Street, Caledonian Road. I am a house agent by trade—I know Mr. Scott and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner on 3rd April last, at his residence, in Gifford Street—he had some conversation with me about a distress that had been put on his goods—I was in the parlour of Mr. Silence; I had called in that morning, and while I was there Mr. Tripp came down stairs, and asked Mrs. Silence to allow him to eat his chocolate there—I said, "Good morning, Mr. Tripp"—he said, "Good morning"—he asked me if I had seen or heard anything of Scott; I said, "No, nothing particular"—he said, "Why, you know how he served me last time by sending the brokers in; it was the means of driving me to a very great expense, which I have not forgotten yet"—"Oh," I said, "that is passed over and gone, think no more about it, Mr. Tripp"—he said, "I cannot pass it over like that; it cost me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in getting the brokers out, and I have not forgotten it yet"—I said, "I should think no more about it if I were you, for when landlords and tenants disagree, they are much better apart;" and I said, "If I were you I would leave, and have no more to do with it"—he said, "Oh, no, I shan't leave till I like; he shan't do as he likes with me again"—I said, "You appear to work yourself up in a state of excitement, and I really think if I were you I would think no more of it, and go away"—he repeated again, "No, I won't go till I like," or something like that; and I believe I got up, and left—he said, "Well, if he attempts to serve me so again, I will serve them both out, and give them something that they shan't forget," or something like that; I suppose he meant the broker as well—I said to him then, "You seem very much excited and out of temper, and therefore you hardly know what you do say, perhaps; I should think no more of it if I were you; and to prevent all further dispute and trouble between you, you had better leave; I should recommend you to do so"—he merely replied, "I shan't leave till I like; they won't do as they like with me again"—I have seen him since he has been in prison—I knew him through living at the house; I lodged there—I informed him, the same morning when I saw him in prison, of the lamentable death of Mr. Scott—I went down for that express purpose—he said he was very sorry to hear that he was dead; "I did not think," he said, "that he would have died under it, for I did not think I had pricked him so sharp"—I did not see Mr. Scott after he was wounded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>would come home at all hours of the night—I do not think he is given to drink much; he generally keeps late hours, and is very singular in his habits—I have heard him talking night after night when he came home; he would go talking to himself up stairs—unless he is provoked, I think he is a peaceable man; but when excited and out of temper, he is very violent—Scott was a fine strong, powerful man; he was rather irritable; he was not a drunkard, he would like a glass, not out of the way; he used to spend his evenings amongst tradesmen, and so on—I think he could drink a great deal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 1, Thornhill Square, Islington; that is not far from Gifford Street. On the morning of 1st April Scott was brought to my place between 3 o'clock and half past—I had known him slightly, living in the neighbourhood—I had him taken into my room, and removed his trowsers and belt; I then found a severe penetrating wound in the side, about an inch above the hip bone; it was bleeding somewhat freely—he complained of being sick and in great pain—I sent him home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and followed him immediately—I had him put to bed, and then made a more perfect examination of the wound—I could not say positively at that time that it had penetrated the bowels, but from symptoms that came on shortly afterwards I suspected it must have done so—I saw him every hour during the day, perhaps oftener—he gradually became worse—he became delirious a very short time after I first saw him, and died about half past 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 8th—I afterwards made a post <hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> examination—I found that the weapon had penetrated two portions of the small bowel, one lying next to the other—the sword had passed completely through one, and penetrated the one lying next it—such an instrument as this sword would cause such a wound—I have no doubt that wound was the cause of death.</p>

               <p>moment, to my recollection; I did not see any, I was intent on Murrell, seeing the state he was in, I did not look round—I do not know who was behind me—the other man who had been with the prisoner was gone, he was not behind the women—he could not have been in the street or I should have seen and secured him—I did not see anybody but Murrell, the pri<lb/>soner, and the four women at the moment the pistol was fired—others came up immediately afterward, other constables came up immediately—I have no doubt that the pistol was fired by the prisoner's hand, from the direction of the smoke—I could not undertake to swear positively that it was fired by him, but the smoke came from the direction of his hand, and I saw his hand up at the same time—I should judge that three of the women were the same that I had seen with the prisoner and his companions in the Hay-market, by their dress and appearance, but I had not the opportunity of seeing their faces—Murrell had hold of the prisoner's left arm, I believe, getting the pistol away from him—I could not say exactly what they were doing, I could not say they were struggling—the prisoner's back was towards the railings, and Murrell was facing him.</p>

I was on duty at the station, on Saturday, 6th June; in consequence of a message that was brought there, I went to the Haymarket, and found sergeant Crocker at the corner of Pan<lb/>ton Street—I was in my police uniform, and so was Crocker—we went into a public house to see if the prisoner was there; he was not—we waited a few minutes outside the public house door, and we then saw the prisoner in company with another man at the corner of James Street; we went down towards them, Crocker went first—the two men separated, and ran away up James Street, towards Leicester Square—they took different routes Crocker went after the prisoner, springing his rattle, and I followed him; I observed Crocker come up with him—the prisoner turned round and faced him deli<lb/>berately, when I was within two or three yards of them—I told Crocker, in the prisoner's hearing, that he was the man—I had been looking for him before; for some reason I had I thought it proper that he should be appre<lb/>hended—Crocker and I secured him, and walked back down Panton Street, into James Street, the same direction in which we had followed the pri<lb/>soner—when we got into James Street, Crocker said, "Where is the other man?"—I said, "I do not know;" the other man had entirely disappeared then—Crocker said, "You take charge of the prisoner, and I will see if I can find him;" he left me with the prisoner in James Street—as soon as Crocker had left, the prisoner asked me what he wanted him for, I told him he had better ask him—we walked about two paces further, when he fired the con<lb/>tents of this pistol into my face—I did not observe where he took the pistol from—I had him by the right sleeve, and he put his hand up to my face—it was with his left hand that he fired it; it was close to my face when he fired it, I should say not further than three or four inches, if so far—I was wounded in the mouth—I retained my hold of him, wrenched the pistol from his hand, and called for assistance—Crocker came up, and on his coming up the prisoner fired a second pistol at him—Crocker was then about two or three yards off, coming towards me from the Haymarket—the pri<lb/>soner fired the second pistol with his right hand—I did not see any one near at that time—I believe there were some women, they did not interfere—this pistol I wrenched out of his left hand—I could not find the other pistol, and I never have found it—I was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the hospital—there was a pebble in my face that had been fired from the pistol; it was cut out, it had gone through to the jaw.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Charing Cross Hos<lb/>pital. On the morning of 6th June, Murrell was brought there about 3 o'clock—I found a lacerated wound on the left side of the chin, about a quarter of an inch in circumference—it was not bleeding then, but evidently had been—I probed the wound and discovered a foreign body impacted in the soft parts round the chin—this is the pebble (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it reached the bone—it had evidently been stopped in its progress by the bone—the wound in itself was not dangerous, through the stone not having gone farther, and also from the impulsive force not having been sufficient to injure the jaw; I suppose there was not sufficient gunpowder put in—it was directed inwards, and to the right side; the chances are, if it had gone in straight it would have turned towards the neck, towards the large arteries; it is a great Providence that it did not do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Ashby Street, St. Pancras. The prisoner is my husband—on the evening of 3rd June, between 6 and 7 o'clock, he came home dreadfully drunk—I had been out selling some fire ornaments, to help to get a living, for he had been out of work for a fort<lb/>night—I had brought home some coals in my apron, and had just lighted my fire, and put my kettle on, when he came in—he said, "I have got drunk, you b—, on purpose to <hi rend="italic">do for</hi> you;" and with that he gave me a blow over the eye, and broke what things I had on the mantel shelf with the blow—they belonged to my poor father, who lies in St. Pancras workhouse—there was a carved eagle hanging up over the shelf, and I said, "You shall not break this," and I put it under my right arm—he turned to the cup<lb/>board, and seized a knife, and seized me by the left hand—I put up my right arm to protect my throat or face, and received the stab on the back of my hand, and the eagle fell, and its wings were broken—I went out, and fell on the landing—at the time he did this, he caught me by the frock, and said, "I have got drunk on purpose <hi rend="italic">to do</hi> for you to-day"—he said that a second time; it was before I received the wound—I was rather confused with the blow that he gave me over the eye, and am not quite sure what he did say—he seized me by the hair of my head, and tore my clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went home on 3rd June very drunk, and asked my wife where she had been; she made use of very bad language, and I said, "You have been out along with Mr. Cox again;" that is a man that she is keeping company with. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not use bad language to him; I have seen the man Cox once—he did not say to me what he states.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Judd-place, St. Pancras. I saw the prosecutrix on the evening of 3rd June, about 9 o'clock, at the police station—I examined her arm, and found three incisions on the back of the hand, extending to the thumb, about two inches in length, and about a quarter of an inch deep—it is possible that it might cause permanent injury, but not very probable—the effect is want of power in the muscles of the thumb—such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) would cause such a wound—it must have been used with a good deal of violence—she could not have done it herself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, living at Collier's Row, Doctor's Com<lb/>mons. On the night of 12th May, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was in Goswell Street, near the Church, on my way home from a club meeting in Oxford Street, Hoxton—I met the prisoners, and the female spoke to me, and used indecent language—I turned round, and Merrick knocked me down and gave me two black eyes—he fell with me on the ground, and took my watch from my waistcoat pocket; I missed it before he got off me, and said, "He has taken my watch away"—I had seen it safe about five minutes before—he ran across the road, and I picked up my cap and followed him, but lost sight of him—the woman ran along with him, and I lost sight of her—I got a policeman, and he took me to Little Arthur Street—I saw the prisoners there together, and said, "That is the man who has taken my watch"—I was a little the worse for liquor—I am able to say positively that Merrick is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 5, Upper Thomas Street. I was with Tomlins in Goswell Street, on the night of 12th May, and when we were opposite the Church, between 12 and 1 o'clock, the prisoners were standing against the railings—the female spoke to Tomlins, but I did not hear what she said—Tomlins turned round, and they had a few words, and Merrick struck him three or four times, and he fell down—I turned round to pick him up, but I did not know whether Merrick was on hint or not—I cannot say whether Merrick fell, but as soon as I picked Tomlins up, he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "My watch is gone"—his chain was hanging out—Merrick ran, and the female followed him in the same direc<lb/>tion; I saw them going across the road, and we followed them, and met a policeman, who said, "You follow me"—we went with him, and he took us to No. 1, Little Arthur Street—we watched there a few minutes, and out came Merrick and the female prisoner—I can swear he is the man—they were taken into custody—I had seen Tomlins' watch safe five minutes before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know the prisoners before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Tomlins and I left the club together—it was a little after 12 o'clock when we left Hoxton—I had only belonged to the club about four months, and had only been there three times—I do not know how far it is from where this took place; it may be a mile, and it may be two miles—we walked straight from the club to the place where he was robbed; we never stopped anywhere—we did not stop to have a little drop of drink—the female spoke to Tomlins, and they were jawing each other before he was knocked down—I was perfectly sober, still I cannot tell you how long we were walking from the club to the spot; I never timed it—it was several minutes after Tomlins was robbed that he gave the prisoners into custody—we left the club at 12 o'clock; I know that by their shutting up the public houses; they shut the club up, and would draw no more beer—I never looked after the public houses we passed, to see whether they were shut up, and never walked into one; I have no doubt of that—the moment the prisoners came out, Tomlins said, "Those are the people"—he had previously told the policeman that a man and woman had robbed him—he did not tell the policeman that it was a man with a smock frock; he described him to the policeman by his features, and he might have described him by his dress—I will not say whether he did or did not say that he had a smock frock on, and looked like a countryman—we were not talking to some girls in the street after the robbery; I spoke to nobody before I spoke to the policeman—I cannot answer for what my friend did while I was running after Merrick and before Tomlins—I did not call out "Police!" when Tomlins was knocked down, nor did he at that moment—when Merrick was given into custody he said that he was in the house with the woman, and that it was a mistake—I saw no people fighting in the street when Tomlins was knocked down—I decidedly did not go into a public house from the time I left the club; I walked straight home with my friend, side by side, till</p>

               <p>this occurred—I mean to tell you that deliberately on my oath—if anybody says that we went into a public house, it is a downright falsehood—we did not make the policeman make some inquiries at the houses in the court—I did not hear him ask for a man with a smock frock, or for anybody.</p>

               <p>Square, Minories. I know the prisoner—he was formerly in their employ<lb/>ment, going out with a cart—he has left from nine to twelve months—on Tuesday, 5th May, I went out with the van, delivering goods, from Haydon Square warehouse, at about half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I had a lad named Dicks with me—I had, among other things, to deliver a box for Morrison, Dillon, and Co., of Fore Street—as I went out I saw the prisoner sitting against the gate—he asked me where I was going—I said, "Into the City"—he said nothing about getting into the van, and I drove on to my first place, in Houndsditch—on stopping there, I turned round, and saw the prisoner in the hind part of the van, with Dicks—I took no notice, but went on to several other places delivering goods, and at the end of Alderman<lb/>bury, Dicks gave me a parcel to deliver in Fore Street—the prisoner asked me if he should take it to Messrs. Morrison's, and deliver it for me, and then I could call and get the signature—I said, "Yes"—I had not observed him interfering with the box, but when the boy was giving it on to his shoulder I noticed a breakage in it, which I had not noticed before—I saw no more of the prisoner after that till he was in custody—I called at Messrs. Morrison's about three minutes afterwards, but heard nothing of him or the box, and they refused to sign my book.</p>

It would make them a far better parcel, and perhaps during the next month they could be placed. Let me know per return what you think. I could have sold the last well three weeks back, but two or three of your Lurgan friends have glutted the market. I find you have offered them in most houses before coming in to me, as Mr. Roberts wished. Your's very truly, W.

I find that the list you first had and the one you left me to sell from at 2 1/2 off, and sixty days' bill, is 20 per cent. to a pound; he can buy them at 22 1/2 off, up to and including the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and an extra five from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upwards; terms for payment, half cash in one month from the time the goods are in and examined, and the other half by sixty days' bill at bankers'. Of course you take off the 2 1/2 for cash, and bill payment as usual. You can either write me per return or Mr. May. You must let him have the low numbers you have coming round. Your's, etc., W.

Mr. W. Taylor. Dear Sir, I was from home on Friday and Saturday, or I would have written to you sooner. I do not know Mr. J. H.

In your note you refer me to the Lurgan Banking Company; there is no such thing as the Lurgan Banking Company; there is the Belfast Banking Com<lb/>pany, the Northern Banking Company, and Ulster Banking Company. You know the goods would amount to a good sum of money, and I would not wish to let them go to any place but a good house; and I depend on you not to place the goods in any house you have the least doubt of As I intend to go largely into the handkerchief trade, our friendship may continue long. Concerning Mr. May's offer for the goods, could not accept it; but when I receive your answer, I will let you know immediately the discount and terms on which I will sell them to him.

However, as he is strange to you, I write to say that Messrs. Myers and Co., late of 45, Ludgate Hill, will buy the lot, if as good as sample, at 27 1/2 off nett, and will give you cash cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on delivery, and the rest in some three or four bills having some thirty to sixty days to run, and all of them endorsed by Myers and Co. I would say to you that I would sell them this moment 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, and not ask them one question. They also refer you to the following in Belfast, with whom they have long had dealings: McGee and Co., clothiers; Lindsays brothers, drapers; Tucker, starch maker.

               <p>Mr. Myers had paid me the invoice price of 640<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time I wrote the letter of 16th April, I certainly should not have given him into custody; if I had got my property, or my money, I should not have cared about public justice—I do not think any man would when he has got his pro<lb/>perty; he has got justice when he has got that—on the first occasion I only gave Taylor and May into custody—Myers attended before the Alder<lb/>man without any warrant, but if he had not attended there would have been one—he attended of his own accord, when he was sent for—I think that was about four days after Taylor and May were in custody—it was on the second hearing I think that Myers attended—in one part of the conversa<lb/>tion I had with Myers he stated that Taylor kept May in his house—I inquired where they were living, and found that they were living together in the same house up to Jan. last, and for some time previous—I do not think I made that inquiry between the 13th and the 16th—I think it was at the time the proceedings were on at the police court, but I heard it the first time I was up.</p>

I will write you again to-morrow, Wednesday. I hope to find out something better: if it prove true, I am ruined entirely. Let me know if I have put your bill down correct date in my cash book, sixty days from March 10th, due June 13th. I feel beside myself. If your cheque and bill are met, I shall indeed be thank<lb/>ful; say per return. I will devote all my time to the affair, if moving. I hear Messrs.

I feel completely done up, because I know the misery he has caused. Any transaction I have ever had with the man up to last week was met honourably, and to the very letter of the word. He has promised me, through a friend, an interview with my attorney to-morrow at 10 o'clock; whatever transpires I will either write you or telegraph.

I am a schoolmaster, of No. 1, Cripplegate Buildings, where Mr. Townsend has his warehouse—one door which leads into the warehouse is not used by any one else, it is used exclusively by Mr. Towns<lb/>end—the door leading to the passage and staircase is always left open in the day time—Mr. Townsend communicates with his warehouse by my passage and the outer door—on 13th May I left my house about half past 12 o'clock in the day—I returned in the evening about half past 10 o'clock—as I approached my house, I looked up at the front of it, and made an observation to my son—I stood about a minute looking up—there is a shop window in front of the warehouse—while I was in front, I saw the prisoner and another man come out from my house as I was just stepping from the road on the pavement—the prisoner partially closed the door—he held the knocker, and pulled it to as he went out—I followed them, and asked what business they had there—I followed them to Philip Lane, and approached the prisoner with the intention to stop him—he turned and threw a dark lantern in my face, which cut my face and made my nose bleed—he ran down Philip Lane, turned up Aldermanbury, and was stopped in Three Nun Court—I saw him stopped—the furthest distance I was from him in the course of the pursuit was three yards—I did not lose sight of him for a moment—when they got to Philip Lane, they separated—I followed the prisoner—after he had been taken to the station, I returned home, and examined the doors of the warehouse; I found the door which leads into the passage from the warehouse had been forced open—inside the premises</p>

               <p>I found a wedge—on the top of the stain was a roll of sacks, and behind the street door a crowbar, which I gave to the officer who was with me—Mr. Townsend's warehouse is held separately from me—I am not his landlord.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Hope Cottage, Hammersmith. On Wednesday, 20th May, I was returning home from town—I called at the Sussex Arms about half past 3 o'clock—I had something to drink; I do not exactly know what, but the landlord will state better than I can; it was very trifling—I recollect several persons being there—they asked me to stand some beer, and I did, and paid for it—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were there—I had that day received from my son two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and I had two sovereigns wrapped in each of the notes, and I had a separate sovereign for the purpose of change—when I was at the public house, I must have taken the notes out, but I have no distinct recollection—I had a puzzle purse—I should imagine I left that house in about ten minutes—I proceeded home, and called at the Windsor Castle Hotel—I merely went to gossip—I had nothing there—I should think I remained scarcely five minutes—a man came in and had some beer, but I do not know who it was—having stayed there about five minutes, I went towards home—I went to cross over to Hog Lane; the Hampshire Hog is at the corner—there is a urinal at the corner, but I did not go to that; I went on a little further—I had not used the urinal; I had not time to undo my trowsers—in going from the gateway further on, a hand was violently thrust over my right shoulder—my coat was buttoned, and the money was in the breast pocket of my coat, having no waistcoat on—an iron hand rushed over my shoulder, tearing my coat open, and the pocket and the money were bodily taken away—I was not injured, but I was thrown or fell on the ground—I was not struck—my back was towards the gateway, and towards the man who touched me; and before I recovered my feet, they were round the corner—before I got to the corner, they were out of sight—my coat is here; the pocket is torn out.</p>

               <p>Arms—Hog Lane is about 200 yards from the Windsor Castle—it turns out of the High Street—the Windsor Castle stands back on the right hand side—in getting from the Windsor Castle to Hog Lane, you pass down the High Street, having to cross over—the urinal is at that corner of Hog Lane which abuts on the High Street, just round the corner—a person passing the High Street, and looking down the lane, would necessarily see it—beyond the urinal there is a rail to prevent cattle going down—I think I was not so far as that rail; I was within the rail, I might be four or five yards down—I know the Hampshire Hog, at the corner—I know the path there—a person on the path could not see a very great distance down the lane, it is so narrow; he could see a few yards—if you were out in the road, you could see a little way down—in front of the Hampshire Hog, you could not see down the lane—the door of the Hamp<lb/>shire Hog is in the middle.</p>

On Wed<lb/>nesday afternoon, the 20th, Mr. Forsyth came, and soon afterwards Sad<lb/>dington came in for a glass of ale, and asked the barmaid whether that gentleman, nodding to Mr. Forsyth, was not a little wrong in his head—after he had drank his ale he went outside, and stood talking to the prisoner Barker—they stood talking about ten minutes before Mr. Forsyth went out—Mr. Forsyth went down towards home—Saddington went in the same direction—I did not see where Barker went—I did not see Barker at all—I was against the window, outside the house—I walked down to the post; I could see both ways of the road—the post is down on the kerb in front of the house—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw Mr. Forsyth come back—he made some complaint—his coat was torn, and he said that he had been robbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, a meat sales<lb/>man, in Newgate Market. Ramby and Wilson were in our employment many years; Ramby was a collector of money, and had also to hang up in the shop—Wilson was scale man; it was his business to weigh the meat and deliver it to the buyer, to stand between the sold and unsold goods—after meat is sold and weighed, it is in his charge—he would not notice the name of the consignor at all—on 23rd March I received a communication from Newbiggin, a butcher, in consequence of which I went that evening to his house in Harford Place, and saw two flanks of beef there; one was part of a consignment from Goocher, of Ipswich, and the other was Scotch, I could not swear to it—Mr. Goocher had consigned beef to us on that very day, and the flanks could not be made right, but I did not count them over—on Friday, 24th April, I missed four quarters of Scotch beef, consigned by Mr. Liddingham, of Huntley, which were received that morning in my presence, between 5 and 7 o'clock—I sold two quarters of beef, about 7 o'clock, to a person named Gregory, and when he came to weigh his quarters, between 7 and 8 o'clock, he could only find one, and we let him take another, to make up the one that was short—Ramby was there, and Wilson also—I went down to Newbiggin next evening, and saw a quarter of beef, one of the same lot—on 6th May I called in Ramby and Wilson; I told Ramby that it was my painful duty to give him into custody, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150092"/>
               <p>Wilson also, though I did it with much pain and sorrow, but there had been so serious a defalcation of meat abstracted, that it was impossible for me to look over it—they said that they knew nothing about it—I said that Pluckrose, who had been the receiver of the meat, was already in custody, and I could not proceed against him without putting them with him; that they had been watched for several weeks, and opportunities had occurred from pressure of business and every one being greatly engaged; that they had <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> meat by the side door, and that it had been Ramby's custom to seek Pluckrose and tell him that something was ready; that he then sent his lad or a porter named Slark, and Wilson or Ramby had delivered the meat to these porters when they came, and received from Pluckrose a portion of the proceeds—they were very much affected, and so was I; perhaps I was more so than they—they begged I would think of their families—I told them I had thought of them while this was going on—I showed them a written list of meat delivered to Pluckrose, in which were two flanks of beef on 23rd March, four quarters on 24th April, and a flank on 1st May—Russell, an officer, was present, and I gave them into custody—Pluckrose has a stall at the other corner of the market; we are south-west, and he is north-east—I have never sold him any meat.</p>

               <p>comes to get a quarter of beef he would come to me or my father first to buy it, and not to Ramby, or Wilson—we are always there of a morning—I am there about 6 o'clock, business begins about 5—an hour's business takes place before I get there, but my father is there—the place may be opened at 3 o'clock, but no one would sell meat then—Ramby's special duty is to carry meat into the sold room, and to hang it up on it's arrival—Wilson carries it in to the customer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of No. 2, Harford Place, Haggerstone, and have dealt with Pluckrose for meat since last summer. On 23rd March, in consequence of some suspicions I had, I made a com<lb/>munication to Mr. Hicks, and he came and saw two flanks of beef at my place, which had been put into my cart that morning—Pluckrose had told me that his boy would put them in—I saw Pluckrose that morning near his stall, in Newgate Market, near the Red Cross public house—I do not think I saw either of the other prisoners there that morning—I left him there, went round the market, and met him again, and he told me that there were two flanks of beef put into my cart by his boy, and that they were coming from Mr. Hicks's—I shortly afterwards went to my cart, and saw the two flanks of beef, which I afterwards showed to Mr. Hicks—I paid the boy 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Pluckrose told me they weighed 6 stone 6 1/2 lbs.—I paid Pluckrose for them the full market price—I on each occasion paid the ordinary price—I had before that occasionally seen the other men in Pluckrose's company; I have seen them go in and out of the Red Cross public house, and drink with Pluckrose occasionally—I do not remember seeing them that morning, or that day—in the evening Pluckrose called at my shop to see the flanks weighed—that is not the ordinary practice; meat is generally weighed in the market—he did not receive the money till the following Sunday morning—on 24th April I saw Pluck<lb/>rose again at his stall in the market, and while I was there I believe Ramby went into the Red Cross public house with Pluckrose; they came out together, I think—Pluckrose told me that he should have something for me that morning, some beef—I saw him again three or four hours afterwards, and he said that he had been down to my cart with a very good fore quarter of beef, which came from Mr. Hicks's, and he had been down to my cart that I should not have to pay a porter for putting it in, and would call in the evening and see it weighed—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a stone for it—I saw him next morning, and told him that it weighed 16 stone 1lb.—he said that Hicks's man told him that it weighed 17 stone 4lbs.—on the following Sunday he came into my shop, and I paid him some money for some meat which I had previously owed him for—that money included the 16 stone—he brought me a bill, which Mr. Russell has, as he took it away again at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185706150095"/>
               <p>night, having the quarter of beef in it—I made entries of all these transact<lb/>tions in my books—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill he first gave me; it does not contain the 16 stone 1lb.—he took it away, and gave me this other on the next morning, including the 16 stone 1lb. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the only difference in them—it is adopting the weight which I had stated—when he took away the first bill he said that his brother had made a mistake, that he had omitted to put in the quarter of beef from Hicks's, and he gave me this next morning, which I afterwards showed to Mr. Hicks and his son—on Friday, 1st May, I was at the market again, and bought a sheep and some other things of Pluckrose—I saw Wilson at the Red Cross—he said nothing to me when he came out—he told Pluckrose that he had left him something to drink; Pluckrose was then at his stall outside—Pluckrose told me he should want to see me again, as there would be a flank or two of beef, but he should want to see Hicks's man first, and that the boy would put it into the cart—I waited some time at the cart—I had been about the market, and I went back to Pluckrose, who was in the tap room at the Red Cross at that time—he gave me a bundle, with a piece of beef tied up in it, a cloth—he had got it in the tap room with him, and the boy put it into the cart for him, and Pluckrose said that he would call in the afternoon and see it weighed, but, instead of coming himself, his brother came—I found in the cloth a flank of beef, weighing 2 stone 4 1/2 bs—I saw Pluckrose at his shop next morning; he asked me the weight, and I told him; he said that it ought to have weighed 4 stone; that the scaleman told him so, and that it came from Goocher, at Ipswich—his brother saw it weighed—there was a "G" on the cloth in black—he told me that the skirt was in it—I said that it was not—he said that the scaleman told him it was—I believe he said that he was to pay for it, I understood him, to Wilson, but it is so long ago I do not recollect—this bill is 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I objected to the price—I showed that meat to young Mr. Hicks, and the cloth also—Pluckrose gave me this bill of the beef (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him again the following Sunday; something was said about his charging too much, and he agreed that I should have it at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a stone—when I had meat of this description it was always carried to to my shop before it was weighed, as far as I know—the other meat that I bought of him was weighed at the scale opposite his stall—on Monday morning, 4th May, I again saw Pluckrose—he said that he should have nothing more to do with any meat from Hicks's, for he had heard that there would be a regular <hi rend="italic">smash</hi> there before long, and he should get into trouble if he was found out—next morning he said that he had stopped just in time, as a friend had told him that there were three policemen in private clothes watching him, and that one of them had been locked up in Mr. Hicks's shop all night watching.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>whether it was a Scotch quarter or an English one—they would differ in size and form—we put them into the scale in the morning, to ascertain the weight—a dozen oxen consigned to us from Ipswich do not differ much in appearance—I was afterwards deputed to go to Haggerstone—I took notice of the whole that arrived on this particular morning—I did not take any particular observation of any particular carcase—I did not happen before-hand to know that one was going to be stolen, or else it would not have been stolen; I should take care of that—I never was prepared to take my solemn oath that what was at Haggerstone at night had been in our possession in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. On 24th April and 1st May I was clerk to Messrs. Hicks &amp; Son. It was Wilson's duty, on weighing, to call out the weight to me, and call, "Ready"—I then book it—these two flanks, on 23rd March, were not called out to me by Wilson—I cannot say whether they were sold; but whether they were sold or not, they were not sold to Pluck<lb/>rose or to Newbiggin—a Scotch fore quarter was not sold to Pluckrose or to Newbiggin, on 24th April, nor called out in connection with their names—a flank of beef was not sold to either of them on 1st May, nor called out in connection with their names—we could not tell exactly whether the two flanks of beef were missing; we thought so—the Scotch fore quarter was missed on 24th April, before my master went to Mr. Newman's—we missed the flank on 1st May.</p>

On 1st May, I went to Mr. Newbiggin's shop, in plain clothes, and saw him weigh some meat—Pluck<lb/>rose's brother in law was there—I saw him take a cloth away, and followed him to Pluckrose's house, No. 7, King Henry Street, Ball's Pond Road, Islington, with the cloth—I then went to a public house opposite Pluck<lb/>rose's house, and saw Pluckrose standing in front of the bar—I eat down, smoked a pipe, and remained there some considerable time, sitting next but one to Pluckrose—the person came in who had taken away the cloth from Newbiggin's—he told Pluckrose that he had been to Newbiggin's and seen the weight of this flank of beef—Pluckrose said, "All right, what did it weigh?"—he said, "2 stone 4 1/2 lbs."—Pluckrose said, "All right, go over and put it down at once; put it down at four and four, and don't make any mistake"—on the Monday following, 3rd May, I went to Newbiggin's shop—I was in the parlour behind the shop—there is a glass partition—Pluck<lb/>rose came in about 11 o'clock, and Newbiggin told him that he had charged him too much for that flank of beef from Hicks's—Pluckrose said, "You have got nothing to grumble about for I have paid the b—9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—he then asked if he had got any of it left—Newbiggin pointed to a piece of meat at the door, and Pluckrose went and looked at it and made some observation which I could not hear—I saw Newbiggin pay Pluckrose some money, and Pluckrose went away.</p>

I am an unfortunate woman, and live in an apartment in that house—the pri<lb/>soner has occupied another apartment there—she was not doing so when this happened—she was staying with a party that was living in the house—she had not slept there that night—she had slept there the last week, up to that time—before that she had been seeing her friends in the country for two months—she had been back a week—she had been sleeping in the front parlour of that house—I occupy the back parlour—on Monday, 1st June, I returned home about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner sitting on the step of the door—I asked her to let me pass in, but she did not—I asked her again to let me pass in, and told her she did not pay the rent of the whole house—on my saying that, the prisoner got up and gave me a violent blow, and knocked me down—I had a dreadful black eye—she gave me a great many blows—she knocked the senses out of me—the blow fell on the back of my head, and took my senses away—I called to the landlord to assist me, and carry me in—I do not recollect anything after that—I do not know how I got in; I was taken in—the next time I saw the prisoner was on the following morning, when I saw her about 1 o'clock, just in the par<lb/>lour door—I was up stairs; I went down stairs, and said, "Jane, what did. you give me such a black eye for?"—she said, "You b—, I will give you.</p>
               <p>another"—I stood at the door, and she came at me with a pair of scissors—she struck me over the forehead; there is a mark there—she pushed the scissors at me—she took hold of my hair, and I took hold of her's—I after<lb/>wards went up stairs, and fastened myself in a room; she came up stairs and broke the door open—in my room there was a quart pot on the table; I saw the prisoner take it up—my fellow-lodger was in the room, and she said, "Jane, I will not have any disturbance made in my room"—the pri<lb/>soner took up the pot, and held it up first at her; she then came up to me, and said, "You b—, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—I moved to the other side of the fire place—she came and struck me a blow over the head; she cut my head open—my eye was still bleeding—I put my hands up to my head as the blood was flowing from me, and said, "Oh, Jane! how can you be so cruel?"—I got hold of the ledge of the window, and cried out, "Murder!"—the cut with the pot was right on the top of my head—the first blow was struck down stairs, at the street door—the prisoner was standing just in the front parlour door—that was in her room—it was the room where she had been sleeping—she had not slept there that night—she did not pay any rent.</p>

               <p>did not when she knocked me down—it is a middling sized passage—I did not push her at all—the first thing she did was, she got up and knocked me down—there were a few people round when I was knocked down; there was not a mob—there was not a scuffle between me and the prisoner—she would not let me pass in—there was no scuffle between us—there had been no disagreement between us before—we were not particular friends—I cannot say whether she sent for two oysters to put on my eye; I had some in the house—they were applied to my eye—I do not know that she expressed her sorrow at what had taken place—I do not know that she asked me to lie down—I do not know when I recovered my consciousness—I have heard the prisoner say that she was about to remove from that house where she had been lodging with me, to another house—the second assault took place on the next day, about 1 o'clock in the day—I did not go down and open the door when I heard her knock—I was up stairs at the time, I went down after she had come in; I asked her why she gave me that black eye—she said that if I was not satisfied with that, she would give me another one—I did not take hold of her hair before she took the scissors—I believe she took the scissors from off the drawers, but I cannot say—the drawers were standing close by the door, in the parlour—she was just inside the parlour door—I did not see her go to the drawers and take the scissors; I cannot say whether she did or not; she had them in her hands when I saw them—we had no scuffle before the scissors were used—I am not in the habit of using bad language—the scissors were not used in a struggle between us; it was all done in a moment—I had not put my fingers on her before she took up the scissors—I cannot say whether she had the scissors in her hand before I was struck—the parlour is not a very large room—she did not rush suddenly at me, she was standing just inside the door—she was close to me all this time—there is a pair of scissors generally lying on the drawers—I do not know whether they require scissors in their work—I believe I was struck with the scissors at the same time that we had one another by the hair—it was all done in a moment—I do not know that I saw the scissors before I felt them—I am quite sure it was done by some<lb/>thing sharp, and the blood came down—I am quite sure I did not seize her by the hair first—it was not long after that she struck me with the pewter pot—after the scuffle she went down stairs, I think; I did not see her go—I did not rush at her with a piece of an iron bolt; I had nothing at all in my hand, I can swear that—there was only one woman in the room when she struck me with the pewter pot, Alice Bayley—she did not attack her—the door was locked—it was not very strong, she broke it open—she did not say any<lb/>thing—I did not say anything to her—she held the pewter pot up at Alice Bayley first—I did not do anything—I got to the other side of the fire place, out of her way—she was not in a very excited state—she was not intoxi<lb/>cated on either of the occasions—she might have had a glass before that time; she was not tipsy—I do not know that she had been drinking; I did not see her drink anything—I did nothing on this second occasion when she struck me with the pewter pot—Jonathan Adams did not come up and say to me that I should murder the woman—I was not separated from her by any one—when she struck at me with the scissors some one got me away, and I went up stairs, or she might have murdered me then—there are two other women living in the house besides Mrs. Barton, the landlady—they did not take any part in it—they might have said, "Don't hurt her;" I do not know—the prisoner was not attacked by the other women—she did not call them names—I had had no disagreement with her before—I cannot say</p>

               <p>whether she had any opportunity of taking up the scissors after she had me by the hair, or whether she had them in her hand first.</p>

I was in the house when this transaction took place, on Tuesday, 2nd June—I recollect being in the room with the prosecutrix that morning—I cannot exactly remember the time—there was nobody in that room besides the prosecutrix and myself—I was in the room, and the prosecutrix came up stairs, out of the way of the prisoner—she had not been there long when the door was burst open by the prisoner—she did not speak—she took up a quart pot from the table, and held it up to me—I said to her when she came in, "Don't come here to make a piece of work, I will not have it"—she gave a terrible oath, and said, "I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for you"—I went down stairs—I heard "Murder!" cried out before I got to the landing—I saw the prosecutrix after that—I did not see the blow struck at the prosecutrix—she did not appear at all excited, but very deter<lb/>mined—she wad quite sober, I believe—it was about 1 o'clock in the day, I believe—I do not know that she had been drinking—we had had no previous disagreement.</p>

I know the prisoner—on Monday, 1st June, I was at the door of the house—the prisoner was there, and a man was sitting with her—the prosecutrix came up, and asked to pass—the prisoner would not let her—on that the prosecu<lb/>trix said, "You do not pay the rent of the whole house"—the prisoner got up, and knocked her down into the road—all she said was that one word—the landlord came up, and took her into the back parlour—on Tuesday I was standing at the back parlour, the prisoner came up stairs, and pulled off her boots, and went up stairs, and broke open the door, and took up a quart pot, but I did not see the blow struck—I saw <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi>; she held her head out of the window, and called out, "Murder!"—the police<lb/>man came up, and took the scissors away from the prisoner—I came down stairs—the prisoner attempted to catch hold of her legs to throw her out of the window—she had a piece of rag, or something in her hand, which she tore off the sheet, and she tried to put it up in front of <hi rend="italic">Betsy's</hi> head, so that the persons opposite should not see the blood flowing—she did not pull her back from the window, she tried to throw her out—I had not been in the back parlour all day; that is where the prosecutrix lives—there might have been something going on in the parlour, but I did not see anything—she came in with her forehead bleeding.</p>

Barton")—the prisoner Hardy brought the cheque to me—Mr. Barton used to deal with me—when Hardy brought the cheque, I said that I thought it was very strange, as I had been conversing with him about an hour previous—I asked him who had sent him—he said, Mr. Barton—I asked him what he had to put the wine in, and he said a horse and cart, which belonged to Mrs. Clark, I think—I asked him if he had any baskets—he said, "No"—I did not order the wine to be delivered to him—I ordered him to take the horse and cart up the yard—I saw it afterwards in the yard—there was no one with it—Hardy did not come back for it—I sent the wine to Mr. Bar<lb/>ton's—Mr. Barton said that he knew nothing at all about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Messer, of Woodford Bridge. On 7th May, after 8 o'clock, Allen came for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling; I told him so, and he said that I was no judge of money—I gave it back to him, and he pulled out some more money, and said that if he gave me a half crown I should say that it was bad, so he would not give it to me—he went away, and about twenty minutes afterwards Brooks came for a half quartern loaf, and tendered me a half crown; I took it up, and said that it was not good; it was very light—she said that she thought it was a good one as it <hi rend="italic">linked</hi> on the counter, and that she would take it back to the shop where she took it—she went towards Mr. Dixon's.</p>

On Wednesday, 13th May, about half past 10 o'clock, I went with Goodson to these premises, and met Grant, who I have known five or six years—I had got my light turned on; he dropped this piece of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under his arm as soon as he saw me coming up—he ran past me, but I could not stop him because he shot by me too fast—I saw M'Quade and Ward coming with another por<lb/>tion of lead, about fifteen yards behind Grant; I took M'Quade into custody, and picked up some more lead—I took the two pieces of lead to Mr. Cail<lb/>lard's premises, and they covered the hole, and corresponded; one was the piece which Grant dropped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of Richard Street, Woolwich; my predecessor was Mr. Hughes; I succeeded him last April. I knew he was in the habit of occasionally employing the prisoner—the prisoner was also leading hand of the labourers in the dockyard—he was employed by Mr. Hughes, and afterwards by me, at the butter scale, on the Friday and Saturday night in each week, for which he was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I made a communication to a policeman, and on the evening of 23rd May I marked five sovereigns and seven half sovereigns—I sent the prisoner into the back room to get a glass of wine—I then cleared the till of all the gold that was in it, and placed five sovereigns and seven half sovereigns in it—I am quite certain there was no other gold there—the prisoner returned to his business—I did not watch him myself—I afterwards received a communication from Miss Hook—I went and cleared the till again of the gold—I found in it six sovereigns, and five half sovereigns; that was one sovereign more than</p>

               <p>I had put in, and two half sovereigns less—I examined the sovereigns, and found there were five marked, and one not marked—I called the prisoner into the parlour, and accused him of robbing the till—he said that he had not—I then asked him what his wife gave him—his answer was, "A sove<lb/>reign"—I asked him where it was—he said that he put it into the till—I said, "How can that be? here is only the same amount that there was without that; if she gave you a sovereign where is it?"—he then said it was a bad job, it could not be helped—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you count the silver? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—there was a good deal of silver in the till—several more persona served in the shop, but the prisoner was the only one who had access to that till—it was near the window—I employed the prisoner only to stand at that till, and serve nothing but butter—no one else would go to that till except myself—I have never seen others go to it—I had two tills then, I have now three—I had four men serving besides the prisoner—I, and my wife, and the prisoner were behind the counter—the other men were on the other side of the counter—I and my wife received money—I put the money I received into my pocket, and my wife would put her's into the other till—I was present when the prisoner's wife was served, but I did not see her—there was a butter slab between me and her, about 3 feet wide, and 2 1/2 feet high—I was within a yard of the prisoner—there might have been three or four more customers at the scale at the time he was serving his wife—the counter may be about 12 feet long.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner say, "If there is any mistake about it, I am very sorry for it?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that it must be a mistake; he did not say in my presence that he was very sorry for it—there were several persons present when I put the gold into the till—my wife and one of my young men saw me mark it—I made a notch in the edge with a file—I counted seven half sovereigns, and five sovereigns, and put 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the piece of paper I put them in—that was about 4 o'clock, and kept them in a drawer in my bureau, in my parlour—about half past 8 o'clock I took them out, and put them into a small pocket under my apron, and transferred them to the till—I did not count the silver either time—the prisoner has been with me since I took the business, on 1st April—he was recommended to me by my predecessor; he had been with him about six years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

In consequence of some<lb/>thing said to me by Mr. Knight, I watched his shop—on the evening of 23rd May I watched the prisoner's wife—I saw her go from her house, in St. Mary's Street, to Mr. Knight's shop—I was in plain clothes—she went in, and the prisoner weighed her some butter—I was in the shop at the corner—the prisoner then opened the till, and gave her two half crowns, four shillings, and one half sovereign; he pulled the drawer out a little further, and took out the half sovereign—his wife did not give him any money—I was in a position in which I could see all that passed—I can positively swear she gave him no money—she came out, and I followed her—I saw Gibson, pointed her out to him, and asked him to watch her while I went into the shop to tell Mr. Knight to take the money out of his till—I then went to the prisoner's wife, and told her to give up the money which she had got in her hand—she was rather reluctant—I said, "I am an officer; if you won't give it to me, give it to this person"—I saw her give Gibson some money—I went back to the shop, and Mr. Knight called the prisoner into the parlour—I told him he must take his apron off, and go with me, as I was a policeman, and he was charged with giving his wife 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she gave him no money—he said, "Yes, she did"—Mr. Knight said, "No, she did not; there was only the amount of money which I put into the till."</p>

               <p>voice—when I came there was only the two in the room, her mother and herself—I said, "Is that Mrs. Perrin there?" and they said, "Yes"—this woman speaks quite different to what the old woman does, and there was nobody else there—I did not go into the room to see—I knew it was her voice, and I saw her as late as between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—I saw her sitting at her master's door at 10 o'clock at night—I will swear it was 10 o'clock, and at 7 in the evening she gave me my child—after I had given my children their supper, she was sitting on the step of the door—that was 8 o'clock, and she never moved away from the door from 8 till 10—I have known her to sit for hours at the door—I cannot say that she did not move, but I saw her sitting there at 8 o'clock and at 10—I am a dealer in all manner of things; poultry, and fruit, and everything I can get—I hawk them from place to place.</p>

I remember Saturday, 2nd May, when my daughter's husband was taken to Guildhall—I sell wash leathers in Leather Lane, and my daughter came down there to me two or three times that evening—I stopped out till very nearly 11 o'clock, and when I got home I believe she was in bed with</p>

On Saturday night, 30th May, I was in my back parlour at past 10 o'clock—I heard a scuffling noise; I went to the door, and saw a mob collected, and saw Mr. Kendall and Hudson quarrelling—Hudson was intoxicated—I heard high words between them, and they said they would fight—I persuaded them not to fight—they were both sparring together—I tried to separate them, but all at once they rushed together—I saw the prisoner's mother there, and she tried to part them—they fought together, and then Hudson fell—I heard the sound of the fall on the back of his head; you might have heard it some distance—the mob rushed in, and I was so agitated and frightened I ran in doors—Hudson fell direct on the pavement with the blow.</p>

On the night of 30th May I was in Agar Street, and saw the prisoner and deceased standing and talking to each other—as I passed up the street, I heard a slap in the face; I turned round, and saw them both in the attitude of fighting, but it seemed to me at if Mr. Hudson was commencing it, and Mr. Kendall was on the defensive—I did not observe any blows particularly struck at that time—Mrs. Kendall parted them—after a few minutes Hudson rushed at Mr. Kendall, and hit him over his mother's shoulder, which caused Mrs. Kendall to get out of the way; he then closed, and clutched Kendall round the waist, and tried to throw him, and they both wrestled together and fell together—one of the bystanders picked up Hudson, and found him insensible and incapable, and placed him on the step of a door—when they fell, I heard Hudson's head go against the pavement, and make a great report.</p>

My. sister gave me a bad shilling, and in consequence of what she said, I saw a good shilling marked, and placed it on a shelf at the back of the bar, on Monday, 1st June, on which day the prisoners came, and Reeves asked for a quartern of gin and a pot of porter; after I had drawn the porter, she begged my pardon, and wanted a pint—they brought a bottle and a mug—Reeves tendered me a good half crown, and I gave her two old sixpences, the marked shilling, which my sister brought from the other side of the bar on purpose, and a halfpenny—I purposely turned round, and on turning round again, I saw a counterfeit shilling of George IV. lying on the counter—Reeves</p>
