When I came home on Wednesday the 14th of August I found the stable-doors broke open, and a window which led into the clerk's office, and which had been fastened with an iron bar, had been broke open with great violence. In the clerk's office I had a bureau, which appeared to have been broke open with some instrument; and all the drawers were broke open in my parlour. There was a mahogany cloaths-press, which contained several suits of cloaths, linen, silk stockings, handkerchiefs, and other matters which I cannot perfectly recollect; the contents were all taken away, except one pair of silk stockings, a white handkerchief, and an old suit of mourning. I was on my return from Norfolk the day after my house had been broke open; my clerk was sent to Mr. Hornby's, near Hounslow, to give me information of it, but I did not get to Mr. Hornby's till about nine or ten o'clock that evening, to the best of my remembrance; I returned to town the next day, and then I found my rooms in the situation I have described: I likewise lost some plate, as I was informed by my servants; three table-spoons, three tea-spoons, and a tea-strainer.

               <p>Were all these things left in your house when you went out of town? - Yes: they produced to me likewise a slip of paper, which I conceive to contain a list of houses intended to be broke open, and of some which had been broke open; amongst which my house, I believe, is described, it is, Holborn-row, No 2. straight on from the public; meaning, I suppose, two doors from the public house; my house answers the description, for my stable door, which is the back part of the Row, is No 2. and is the second from the public house; the house having been robbed, as it appears, they have taken a pen and struck through it; that is all I know about it.</p>

I observed the sash of the window, which I had fastened over-night, was put up; I examined it, and found they had wrenched off the bar: the pin that fastened it hung in the bar. Mr. Horsefall likewise lay in the house; I called him up, and told him the house was broke open, and then I went backwards, and found both the door that goes into the yard and the stable-door were open; I went into the stable, and found they had broke the outer stable-door open; they had made use of a great deal of force, for the lock was bent entirely back out of the staple, and the door shattered almost to pieces: the lock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110005"/> scarcely hung to the door, it fell off afterwards; they had taken the lock off the inner stable-door, and the door off the hinges, to get it open; I went into the parlour and found every thing broke open that they could get open; there were some locks they could not break open; they had taken a great many of Mr. Fell's cloaths; what they did not take they had thrown about the floor; there were two swords and a hanger belonging to Mr. Fell left upon the chairs; I went down into the kitchen and found they had broke open every lock there; and the butler's pantry was broke open; the maid told me there were some silver table-spoons and tea-spoons gone out of the kitchen. Mr. Fell being out of town, I could not tell what he had lost till he came home.</p>

               <p>CLARKE. There was ink that had been fresh laid on one of the shirts all over the name; I washed it with soap, which took the ink out, and left Mr. Fell's name very plain.</p>

               <p>What sort of a purse was it? - A green silk purse; there were seventeen guineas and a half guinea in it, two pieces of foreign coin, which were very remarkable, and eight shillings or eight shillings and six pence in silver.</p>
               <p>How long before you went into the house had you felt it in your pocket? - I went in a carriage with some gentlemen; I felt it before I got out of the carriage, and buttoned up my pocket; I am sure it was there when I got out of the coach; after I missed it, Mr. Green, who is, I believe, the box-keeper, called me to the front box, and asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I missed a purse; he asked me if I had lost any thing else? I then missed my watch; I had not missed that before; he said there was a watch and purse found upon a man who was taken into custody: I found him in custody of

               <p>On Wednesday the 24th of July, the box-keeper belonging to Mr. Foote's theatre gave me charge of the prisoner: I took him into the box lobby and searched him; as I was searching his pockets, a woman that sells fruit told me he had something in his hand; I looked, and saw a green purse in his hand; I went to take it, and he threw it along the lobby: one of the box-keepers picked it up.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pick it up? - It was so dark I could not; he threw it as far as he could; I saw the motion of throwing it away.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you saw him throw it away, before the box-keeper delivered it to you? - I believe it might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was it so dark that you could not see? - No; the lamps were light; about that time the king was going into the house, and there was a great deal of hurry; the box-keeper brought Mr. Harmanson out of the Pit, and we took the prisoner to Sir

            's, and there we opened the purse.</p>
               <p>Did Green go with you? - No; Mr. Harmanson said, if the purse was his, there were two pieces of foreign gold coin; the purse was opened, and it contained seventeen guineas, a half guinea, eight shillings in silver, and the two foreign pieces.</p>
               <p>[The purse with its contents were produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Mr. HARMANSON. I am confident this is my purse; these are the two pieces I brought from America; I shewed them to several persons in town.</p>
               <p>What coin are they? - I am not certain; some gentlemen I enquired of, said they were Spanish; I brought them with me from Virginia: I had taken twenty guineas the day before I was robbed; I had only spent a guinea or two.</p>

               <p>There was a great croud in the lobby? - Not so great a croud but we could distinguish persons.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man's name that brought the purse to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>JURY. Could you distinguish what was in his hand? - I saw it was a green purse; he had a hat in his hand which had been knocked off a boy's head; he said, somebody put the hat and purse into his hand as he was going in; when I took him on the stairs, he said the hat was given him; and when he had thrown away the purse in the lobby, he said they were both given him together.</p>

               <p>I am box-keeper at Mr. Foote's theatre: on the 24th of July in the evening, his majesty was coming into the house, and it was very much crouded; I was looking through one of the air-holes from the box lobby that overlooks the pit passage, there is a hatch in the passage to prevent the people coming in too fast; it was shut so as to admit only one person at a time; I looked through, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor both stick fast between the door-way and the wall; the prisoner's face was to the prosecutor's back, both their right sides were towards me; I saw the prisoner put his arm under the prosecutor's arm, and lift up his waistcoat, and put his hand in his breeches pocket up to his wrist; I could see his hand go down into his pocket; I was three feet above him; I had an opportunity of seeing him, he could not see me, at least he did not; I saw him take something out, and then draw back, the gentleman pushed forward, and went under my feet into the pit; as soon as the prosecutor pushed forward into the pit, the prisoner attempted to get out, but it was impossible; then he put what he had taken out of the prosecutor's pocket into his right hand breeches pocket; there was not a person between them and me; as he could not get out, he was standing till I went and informed the constable that there was a pickpocket, and we immediately took him into the pit lobby; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110009"/> left him in care of the constable, and went and told the prosecutor I had seen a man rob him; when I returned, the purse had been thrown away.</p>
               <p>JURY. As you was looking through the air-hole, could you distinguish the prisoner's face? - Yes; it was quite light; I believe the sun shone; the prisoner had on a brown coat; the prosecutor a very light one.</p>
               <p>JURY. Could you see any thing in his hand as he drew it out of the prisoner's pocket? - I could perceive something, it appeared to be black.</p>
               <p>'The prisoner in his defence called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.'</p>

I then mentioned the coarse wrapper; she said she had none, but that she had had some cotton, some irish, and some pocketing, but that the prisoner had taken them away again; I desired her to take the coat to the prisoner, which she did; I then asked the prisoner how she could deceive me, in saying she never robbed me of any thing; that I had found a coat, and that it would have been better for her if she had told me of it. Her sister begged of her to tell the whole, of what was become of all the property that had been taken away; telling her, that if they could be redeemed for five guineas she would assist her with the money; and asked her, what was become of the cotton that she had taken away from me, together with the irish, and the pocketing? she said she had sold the pocketing and the cotton, and she took me to the house of one of the witnesses, who lives in Turner's-court, Bedfordbury, where I found the cotton and the pocketing: she declared that was the whole she had taken. The magistrates advised me to have her brought up on a future day, as they thought I might find some more of my property; she was brought up on a future day, and then I charged a woman who used to wash in my house with being a party concerned, and told her I would punish her, if she did not discover what she knew of the things; she took me to a pawnbroker's in Long-acre, where I found a suit of cloaths, which the pawnbroker had lent her two guineas upon; they were taken out of the warehouse, and three pair of corderoy breeches; some of these things are not in the indictment; I found the Russia sheeting at the house of an acquaintance of the prisoner's, the breeches I found at a pawnbroker's in Burton-street, they were taken from the coat and waistcoat which were in the warehouse; the coat I had from the prisoner's sister; she has absconded.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say when her sister brought the coat? - She said she was very sorry, she must confess she was guilty, and begged I would be favourable to her; I told her I would if she would tell me where the rest of my property was.</p>

I went into the fore-shop again, and returned again, to see if I could see the silk still hanging down under her petticoat, but I could not; I then went and sat down in the compting-house in the back-shop; they looked at many pieces, but bid nothing. The young man was very pressing for them to bid something, and look at some more; I came up and said, perhaps we might have something to suit them another time; they seemed glad at that, and came into the fore shop, then I went backwards and found the piece of silk was missing. As they were going out, I told the young man I thought they had a piece of silk; he bid them come back into the back-shop, the back-shop is long and divided into two parts; as they were going along, I put my hand to Gillam's petticoat and felt the silk under it; I put my hand under her petticoat and took it from her; it is worth five pounds and upwards.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of Mr. Penleaze, who lives in the road going to Hackney; our house is the corner of a field leading up to Hackney, almost opposite the Nag's-head in the <placeName id="t17760911-23-crimeloc120">Hackney road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17760911-23-crimeloc120" type="placeName" value="Hackney road"/>

                        targets="t17760911-23-off117 t17760911-23-crimeloc120"/>: our house was broke open on the 21st of April, between two and three o'clock in the morning. I examine every night that the doors and windows are fast before I go to bed; every window had its proper fastening, and all was secured that night: between two and three in the morning, I heard the door upon the left hand of mine, the first bed-chamber-door, open, and then shut again; I thought at hearing that door open, that the servant was come to fetch my son's shirt and stockings, which always lie there ready for him; I had hardly thought so, before I heard an attempt at the door where I lay: as I did not suppose any body belonging to me would attempt to open my door without speaking, I waked Mr. Penleaze, and said, For God's sake, for God's sake, here are rogues; Mr. Penleaze jumped up in his bed and asked fiercely, who is there? no answer was made; but before an answer could be made, the door, with a part of the wainscot, came down, and some men came in; four I saw very clear, for when I found they were rogues, I had no thoughts of losing my life, till they all came upon the bed and presented their pistols and cutlasses; I thought the first thing should be to take notice of their faces, and therefore I looked stedfastly at them all; two came upon the foot of the bed, one on Mr. Penleaze's side and one on mine; two pistols were presented at my head, and two at Mr. Penleaze's, by the people that came up the foot of the bed; a third man went up to Mr. Penleaze's head, and the other to the head on my side of the bed. We never lie with our curtains drawn, as Mr. Penleaze is asthmatical; I saw a very great light in the room, which I knew it was not possible for a dark lanthorn to give, for one of them had a dark lanthorn; the light<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110017"/> seemed to me to come from the landing place at the door, from whence I judged somebody held a candle there to direct them into the room; the window shutters were shut, but there are large holes at the top of the middle window shutter, small holes at the others.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to have discerned the face of a man? - No; by the light of the window I could not have discerned them; the clock struck three presently after. The prisoner I really believe to be one, for I saw his face, he was at the head of the bed on Mr. Penleaze's side.</p>
               <p>Was there no crape or mask upon the prisoner? - Not upon him, I don't know that there was; I did not see any thing of that sort when I saw his face upon the bed, for I believe he was the man that put his hand over Mr. Penleaze's side and tucked the cloaths between Mr. Penleaze and me.</p>
               <p>You believe he is the man? - I have no doubt of it; I remembered his face when I saw him again, that he was endeavouring to help the others to cover us up in the bed.</p>
               <p>He had no disguise or mask upon his face? - I did not see any thing upon it, the look of his whole face I remember; now I see it at the bar again, it brings it fresh to my mind, I remember it perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner you saw in that particular situation? - I have no doubt of it, we were covered up not more than half a minute, before I put my hand and disengaged the cloaths from my face for a little air, and as I looked about with part of my face uncovered, I missed the man that stood at the head of the bed on Mr. Penleaze's side, and I saw but three in the room; I do suppose he went out as soon as we were covered, and with him took a tankard that was at the head of Mr. Penleaze's bed with balm tea; he emptied the balm tea into a wash-hands bason that stood next to that, for there we found the balm tea in the morning. They were each armed with a pistol , there were six pistols at a time on my bed, one in the hand of each man at the head of the bed, and two in the hands of the men that came upon the foot of the bed and lay upon us and helped to cover us down: before they began to cover us up, when they rushed into the room, they said, Your money, your money; when they came upon the bed they said, Tell us where your money is; we came for your money, we will not meddle with any thing else, tell us where your money is. I screamed very much, being terrified with the pistols and cutlasses which shone much; I kept up in the bed, begging for God's sake they would not hurt us, and they should have what money we had; they said, We will not hurt you, lie down in your bed: I lay down a little, I put the cloaths off me again, and begged for God's sake that they would hear what I was going to say; they asked what it was, I said, there was but little money in the house, Mr. Penleaze too said so, and begged they would use us well; they said they would, but as I did not lie down immediately, one of them struck at me with a cutlass, which missed my head and cut in at the head of the bed; I was frightened at the appearance of the cutlass; when I saw it come with great vehemence and a very loud voice, I said, I will lie down, I will lie down immediately, and drew the cloaths over my own head immediately.</p>
               <p>Was this blow from the person on your side the bed, or him on Mr. Penleaze's side? - I cannot be certain, it seemed to me to come from one of the men that came up at the foot of the bed when we were both covered up; they asked Mr. Penleaze again where the money was, and he directed them into the room where it lay, and the other things of value that we had in the house; I was astonished to hear Mr. Penleaze direct them to the room where almost every thing was kept that we had that was valuable; I immediately directed them to another room; I put the cloaths off my head that they might hear me speak the clearer, and that I might have a little breath. Mr. Penleaze said to them first, there is but a little money in the house indeed, a little silver you will find upon the marble slab in the next room; the plate and other things of value were in a closet in that same room; I said to Mr. Penleaze, there is a little more money in the house, there is some gold, I believe, if you will please to go into the next room, gentlemen, and open the drawers in the chest of drawers, and look about the middle drawer, perhaps you may find it there; this I did to gain time, for then the clock had struck three, for I was in hopes, it being cowslip time, that people going out early in the morning might see them, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110018"/> they might be prevented from doing any kind of mischief; then two of them left the room, and there only remained one standing on my side at the head of the bed; they came back again, after looking in the drawers as I suppose, and said, There was no money there, and I did not give them an immediate answer, still hoping to gain a little time; they said, Whereabouts is the money? said I, Don't you find it there? they said No, there was none there; then said I, I really cannot tell you where it is; I really could not, for I did not know where Mr. Penleaze kept his money; they asked Mr. Penleaze, Where did you say the money lay? did not you say upon a little slab in the other room; what slab do you mean? said he, in the room upon the right hand, but my son lies up another pair of stairs, and he has the money he received yesterday, I have not accounted with him for it; they said, what room is he in? Mr. Penleaze said, in the room fronting the stairs, and he will give you the money. I was frightened for my son's life, though I seemed to have but little fear for my own; he is fond of shooting, he always lies with a couple of guns in his room; I begged of them for God's sake not to hurt my son; they said they would not.</p>
               <p>What did you lose? - [Repeats the things mentioned in the indictment.]</p>
               <p>What might be the amount of your loss? - I am no judge; Mr. Penleaze says, he thinks about 500 l.</p>
               <p>Did you lose all the things mentioned in the indictment? - Yes, and a great many other things that we have forgot.</p>
               <p>Now, are you certain as to the identity of the prisoner at the bar? - I have no doubt of it, but I have still some farther proof to give; another circumstance, which makes me think this is the man: when he was taken up, a coat was produced, which he had said was upon the back of one of the men in our house; I was at Mr. Wilmot's office when he was examined there, and this came out upon his examination; he was present and owned the coat to be his, he was ordered to put the coat on; he had given it to Bates's brother for Bates.</p>
               <p>Who is Bates, for whom the coat was? - One of the prisoners that was tried and convicted for this fact; when he was first taken, he was carried to Wilmot's office, the coat was then produced, and he put it on; he was ordered again upon the public examination day to put the coat on; he spoke very sharp and rude to the justice, and said, I shall not put it on, I have put it on once already, have I not? he spoke in such a tone of voice as when I heard, I said, that is the man that said in our chamber, D - n you, why don't you keep her covered? which he said just in the same manner.</p>
               <p>So that from the sound of the voice it confirmed you in your opinion that that person was at the head of the bed on Mr. Penleaze's side? - Yes; three had great coats on close like watchmen's coats; they were of a drab colour all of them; I never saw the prisoner's face, but at that one time when he was covering us up.</p>
               <p>Please, to describe how the house was broke open? - A pane of glass was broke in the back parlour window next the fields; the back steps which lead into the garden are high; the upper part of them are wide, and almost even with the back parlour window at which they entered; they broke a pane next the steps; then they turned the screw that fastens the window, then opened the window bar and split the wood in which the bar was fastened; the bar fell down with the wood with it, and then the window shutters opened.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that window was fastened over night? - I am sure; for I never go to bed without seeing it; I never trust to any body to fasten the windows, but I examine them myself.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was this that this burglary happened? - The Sunday morning between the hours of two and three.</p>
               <p>Between the Saturday and Sunday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of the person of the prisoners before this time? - No, not of any of them before that night.</p>
               <p>I apprehend when the four men first broke into your bed-room that you was very much terrified? - I was, but I had no fear of death; I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>But you was very much terrified? - I was terrified.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110019"/>Very much? - Not so much as many people would have been; I did not think about death till the cutlass was struck at me.</p>
               <p>You said on a former occasion that you was very much terrified? - With the cutlass and pistol.</p>
               <p>Which had the dark lantern? - I saw a great light in the passage; I cannot say, I cannot tell who had the dark lantern in their hand.</p>
               <p>You know when a person holds a dark lantern in his hand, the light is projected from the person that has the lantern? - I saw the room very light, as light as if a candle had been in the passage.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt you saw a light which appeared a great light to you who were in bed, but the dark lantern being before the prisoners, and the other lights behind the prisoners, both of these lights darting their rays upon you, and from the persons of the men, it would be impossible for you to discern their persons? - What become of the dark lantern I cannot tell when they were upon the bed.</p>
               <p>Then there was no other light than what was in the passage; therefore it was impossible for you to see the faces of the persons? - It gave a strong light that I could discover their faces very clear, for their faces were even with mine, as near as my hand is to my face, for I believe the space of two minutes; I saw their faces clear, and a strong light came into the room; it is a small one; the door opens at the foot of the bed, at which they came in; there is a good light comes in through the holes of the window shutters, at that time at three o'clock, but not strong enough to see their persons; the landing place is at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>The light came in at the foot you say, could you distinguish a person on the right hand and the left by that? - Yes; very clear.</p>
               <p>COURT. At what period of time can you exactly say that you had an opportunity of looking at and observing the prisoner's face? - I do not suppose I had more than half a minute; it was only during the time of pushing the cloaths down and drawing them over us; it was such a countenance as I knew the moment I saw him, and the more I see him, the more clear I am that he is the person.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You never saw him before in your life? - No, but should know every face I saw in the room.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, when he was examined at justice Wilmot's office, he was directed to put a coat on? - He was.</p>
               <p>You took notice in your evidence that they had great coats on? - Three of them had, what they had under their great coats I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>This is a close-bodied coat; then why did you desire him to have a close-bodied coat put on? - Not for my satisfaction; that will come out by-and-by; that was for the justice's, satisfaction, for some other witness which will be enquired into by-and-by.</p>
               <p>You had no recollection of his voice at the first time? - No; there was too great a confusion; at first they all said, your money, your money: but that sharp rough manner of speaking immediately brought it to my mind, that is the same voice that said, D - n you, why don't you cover her up?</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was examined the first time at justice Wilmot's office, not with standing the coat was put upon him, I believe you did not swear to him at that time? - I could not swear to his coat.</p>
               <p>Nor to his face? - The answer I gave to Mr. Wilmot was, that I knew the man, but I would say nothing to him till next examination day; he was examined in the little room, but not in the public office; I think one cannot be too cautious when a life is in the case, and therefore I don't love to hurry.</p>
               <p>At that examination did not you make a declaration of this nature, that you believed he did not rob you, but you apprehended he knew who did? - If you had that information, you are very much misinformed.</p>
               <p>In some such words? - In no such words; for I really believe he did rob us.</p>
               <p>Did you ask any persons whether the prisoner was in that robbery or not? - When I first gave an account to Mr. Wilmot's men, and described their persons, they said, Grant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110020"/> and such a one, and such a one were the four that were in the room: they endeavoured to take this Grant from the description I gave of him.</p>
               <p>Did not you express a doubt whether he was one of the persons? - I did not, because I was quite certain in myself, therefore I could have no doubt.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Penleaze: I lived with him at this time; three men came out of my mistress's room; I was on the stairs, about the middle of the stairs; the first man I saw had a candle in his hand, about half the length of a kitchen candle, without a candlestick; they came up stairs towards me; I went back to my own room, which was a pair of stairs higher, and shut the door, but did not fasten it; they came up to the top of the stairs; they did not stop; they turned about, and went down again.</p>
               <p>How many were there of them? - Two men came up stairs then.</p>
               <p>Did they not go into any of the rooms? - No; they went back into my mistress's room, and enquired of her where the money was; I came down upon the stairs again, and heard them say, It was money they wanted, and money they must have: the same two persons came up stairs after that, and went into the young gentleman's room.</p>
               <p>Was your young master's room the next room to the stair-case? - No; fronting the stairs.</p>
               <p>Where was your room? - The first door on the stairs, just at the edge on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Did you go back again into your room? - Yes; and shut my door too, but not fastened; one held the candle, while the other picked the young gentleman's pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see out of your room into his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your young master awake at this time? - They had taken the young gentleman into my mistress's room.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I did not see him; he was not in his bed or his room; they searched his pockets that lay upon his bed; he was out of his own room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. PENLEAZE. My son slept very sound; there was a good deal of searching from room to room passed before he heard any noise; he first heard me beg of them not to hurt us; he heard my voice; and between sleeping and waking, thought I was in fits, and that they had sent for a surgeon and apothecary to me; he came down stairs to see what was the matter with me; two men met him on the stairs; one clapped his hands upon his eyes, the other led him into my room; as soon as I saw them seize my son on the stairs, I screamed out to a violent degree; I thought they were going to hurt him, but they did not; they only led him into my room.</p>

            . What did they do in his room? - Opened a little cabinet and a chest; they went out of the room into a room adjoining mine; I did not see them open the chest; but they did, by the noise I heard; they came out of that room to a chest facing my door; which they opened; one said to the other, Come along, there is nothing there; they went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did you escape? - Yes; I was in my own room, the door of which was upon a-jar.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner one of those two? - I cannot take upon me to say that; it was much such a sized man I saw in the house; a person like the prisoner, who had a dark blue coat on.</p>
               <p>Had he a great coat on? - No; one at the study door had a great coat on; neither of the men that came up stairs had great coats on; but one that stood at the study door after that had.</p>
               <p>What sort of a great coat was it, a drab colour? - Yes; there was one with a very gruff voice, that stood at the bottom of the stairs, called out Jem, Jem, Jem.</p>

               <p>But you saw them come up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You saw but three? - Yes.</p>

               <p>But with all this view you cannot be certain to the person of the prisoner? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Upon a former occasion you mentioned the space of twenty minutes? - Undoubtedly I might formerly, but it was not mentioned now.</p>
               <p>I believe you said so before? - Yes; but it was not mentioned now.</p>

            , who is under sentence of death, is my brother-in-law: I met the prisoner on the 29th of June in Red Lion Square; I should have seen him if he had not called; he found that, and turned round; the first word he said, was, how does the prisoner Bates do? I told him he was had enough; he said it was a sad thing, he was sorry for them, for he knew them both to be innocent men; he meant Green as well as Bates, they were both cast at the same time: I told him I thought he was one of them; he said, He was not, but he knew them that were; I asked him the men's names; he told me the names of four of them; I had got a petition in my hand; I was going to the Recorder's house; I was within 150 yards of the Recorder's house; the petition was in the behalf of Bates, signed by the overseers and churchwardens, and a vast number of the principal in habitants of St. Leonard, Shoreditch: I told him, not being used to such things as that, I was rather ashamed, and asked him to carry the petition for me; he said he would with all his heart; he gave me his bundle, and went with the petition; he had given me half a crown just before to give to Bates: while he was gone with the petition, we consulted whether we should take him or not; there were two of Bates's own brothers with me; we agreed not to take him then, but to get great with him, to try if we could learn any thing of the other men that he had mentioned: when he came back, I asked him if he would take us to any alehouse and give us something to drink; he said he would: he took us to the Black Lion going into Red Lion Square; we staid there near an hour; all the while I was there, I was continually talking about Mr. Penleaze's robbery; I told him Mrs. Penleaze said she saw four in the room; he said, Did she say she saw four? I said, yes; he said, I know she saw but three in her room: I told him there must be more than three; that there must be somebody about the house to keep sentry; for I told him I had heard his brother say that there were seven of them, and that they shared thirty-eight guineas a man; but I thought there must be more than that number; he said, No, there was not; I asked him what sort of men those four men were: after he had mentioned their names, he said, O they have been taken up, but were acquitted; that one of them was very much of a gentleman, and a man of worth, that had three or four hundred pounds worth of plate in his house: I asked him about the others; he said, one was a tall raw-boned powerful man, and he used to be out at times in Grub-street; he said, that tall powerful man rescued him away from one Mr. Church, where Grant used to live; for he was taken three months ago for this, and this man rescued him. It came up in discourse, that the prisoner Bates was almost naked; he said, if this coat I have upon my back will be of any service to him, I will give it him; I thanked him: he said, if I would go a little farther with him to another house, he would give it me; he paid the reckoning, and we came away; then he took us into Spread-eagle Court, Gray's Inn Lane, to the King's Road.</p>

               <p>From the Prisoner. Why did you not take me up sooner? - It was about three weeks after I had the coat before he was apprehended; the reason was we went three or four times after him, but we knew we dare not touch him in Wood's house; we wanted to get him out of the house, at last we caught him at the end of the alley: Mr. Wilmot's men had been three times after him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was you intimately acquainted with the prisoner? - I saw him before I met him in Red Lion Square, at the time of the hard frost; I knew him very well some time ago, when he used to follow his business.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Why he did not take me in Holborn when he met me there with his brothers in company with him, the last execution day but one? - There were three of them together; we were afraid to attack them, the Jew was with him: Mr. Sherwood's men were after him.</p>
               <p>Did you give information to them that you had seen him that day? - I told Mrs. Penleaze we had seen him; she said she wanted him taken; we were no thief catchers; I was somewhat afraid.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>If you had chose to have taken him on an execution day, there was plenty of assistance at hand? - It was almost night; it was about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>If this man should be convicted, whether you don't think that your brother will receive a pardon? - I could not conceive that; but if this man had turned evidence it might, for this man could have told the men that did commit the burglary.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not say to me in Red Lion Square, that he was glad I was not taken at first, for Mrs. Penleaze would have sworn to me on account of my black hair? - I told him very possibly she might have sworn to him if he had been taken, on account of his hair.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not swear at Justice Wilmot's that I used to wear my hair down to my nose almost, which I never did? - I said his hair was in quite a different form; that he used to wear it hung over his forehead; but when I met him in Red Lion Square, his hair was almost cropt, he looked like quite another man.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Should you ever have thought of making any complaint against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110023"/> the Prisoner if he had not declared in the conversation to you that your brother was innocent? - I had a notion at first that this man was concerned in it, for I know he had not followed his employment.</p>
               <p>Was it not for the sake of your brother that you concerned yourself in it? - I had a notion at first that he was one; but when he spoke about the coat, what I mentioned then, I thought he was one of them.</p>
               <p>You had a consultation among yourselves in behalf of your brother? - We wanted to find out the man who did commit the robbery; for I believe it will be found that my brother is innocent.</p>

               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not ask me to give him something towards burying his brother? - I did not ask him for a farthing; I said it was very hard, for I could not afford to bury him.</p>

            , and brother in-law to Batteaux.</p>
               <p>Do you remember meeting the prisoner in Red Lion Square. - Yes; I was going with a petition to the Recorder for my brother: we told Grant that our brother was very poorly, he said,</p>
               <p>'He was very sorry for it, he was innocent;' and he mentioned four people by name that did commit the burglary: he took the petition in for us, after that we went to the public house and had a deal of talk, in order to get out of him what sort of men they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110024"/> were who were concerned in it. He gave us half a crown for my brother, afterwards he said he would give my brother the coat he had on, if we would go a little way with him; he took us to a house and gave us a dram a-piece, and took no notice about the coat. Batteaux said, it does not signify pulling it off now, we will come another time; he said, we should have it come when we would: we came there eight days after, he came in out of a side room to us, he asked us how we did, and drank with us, out of the pint of beer we had called for; he took us to the side room, my brother-in-law and I went into the private room, we sat there an hour or more; Batteaux asked him there about the names he had mentioned, he mentioned the four names over and over: Batteaux mentioned what was taken away, he said, what is it? they shared but 38 guineas a man; they, he did not say we, he always said that he was not in it. After that Batteaux asked him for the coat, he said, there it is; it hung across a chair back by me; I was going to tie it up, a Jew that was with him said, put it on, it will sit you; they perswaded me, and I put it on under this great coat, I had only a waistcoat on then. As we were coming home he said,</p>
               <p>'Now, that coat</p>
               <p>'was in Mr. Penleaze's house; one of the men</p>
               <p>'that did the robbery, had that coat upon his</p>
               <p>'back that night:' Batteaux looked at him then very hard and said, Sure, what an odd thing this is? now you say this coat was on the man's back that committed the robbery; now we are going to give it to a poor fellow that is cast, though he is innocent; he said,</p>
               <p>'it is odd, but by G - d it is true;' after that he said,</p>
               <p>'it was given to him, and now</p>
               <p>'he gave it away again.'</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>At this time you was going to the Recorder, with your brother Bates and Batteaux, in order to obtain mercy for your brother if you could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you thought yourself much obliged to the prisoner for expressing kindness towards your brother? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He gave a half crown for him and promised the coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And told you the names of all the people he had heard were concerned in this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Declaring at the same time that he himself was perfectly innocent? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you had no reason to apprehend that he had been guilty of any offence at Mr. Penleaze's but this conversation? - That was all.</p>
               <p>As he told you he was innocent, and mentioned to you the names of four men which he apprehended had been guilty of this robbery, why were they not taken up? - We gave information of them all to Mr. Wilmot's runners, but they were not taken up.</p>
               <p>Do not you apprehend if the prisoner should be convicted, it will be of use to your brother? - I don't know that it will, and I will not say any thing he did not say to me.</p>
               <p>Did not you think, after you had had a consultation about this business, that going to Justice Wilmot's office would be of use to your brother? - I thought, if we took one of the right people up, we might get an evidence, and the truth might come out.</p>
               <p>And that would be an advantage to your brother? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the prisoner lying at your house any time? - Yes; upon the Saturday night the prisoner and two or three more young men were drinking at my house; when the time came that we should go to bed, the prisoner asked me if I could let him sleep there that night, I told him I did not know as my husband was a-bed: a gentlewoman that lodged at my house at that time said, she had some knowledge of him, and I had no occasion to be afraid of letting him sleep there, for he used her house when she kept a public house herself: this person saying that she knew him, I let him sleep there that night,; about three days after, I believe it was on the Wednesday following, the prisoner came to my house again, and asked me,</p>
               <p>'if I did not recollect his lying</p>
               <p>'there on the Saturday night?' I told him I did; I asked him why he asked me that? he said,</p>
               <p>'the reason was known to himself,' he then said,</p>
               <p>'the reason he had for asking me</p>
               <p>'was, that he would be glad if I would let</p>
               <p>'him make a memorandum of the day of the</p>
               <p>'month he slept at my house;' I told him he might, but I wanted to know why he did it; he said,</p>
               <p>'an affair had happened that he did</p>
               <p>'expect to be brought into trouble for, and</p>
               <p>'if he was, that he should subpoena me to</p>
               <p>'come and speak the truth;' I had a subpoena, and that is the reason I came here; I saw him make the memorandum upon the wainscot in my kitchen in chalk, I stood by while it was done; the memorandum was nothing, but</p>
               <p>'the 20th of April.'</p>
               <p>Was this memorandum put in such a place as it was not likely to be rubbed out? - It was put very high, where it was not likely to be rubbed out.</p>
               <p>JURY. Who wrote that memorandum, the prisoner? - No; a young man that was with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Though the memorandum you say is</p>
               <p>'the 20th of April,' will you swear that he lay in your house upon Saturday the 20th of April? - Yes; he really lay in my house that night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you see him go to bed? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see him get up? - He could not get up without my knowing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What hour did he go to bed? - As near as I can recollect about twelve; he lay at the very top of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you put him to bed? - No, I saw him go up stairs; I was the next person that went up stairs and a gentlewoman that lodged in my house: I fastened the street door and went up directly after; we fasten the street door and take the key up to bed with us every night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could he have got out of this house at any other place but the door? - No; we have another pair of stairs that come down by my room door where I sleep, and at the bottom of that stairs we have another door that we always bolt of a night, the last thing we do; it would be impossible for any body to come down stairs when the door was bolted of my side; nobody can come down stairs till we are up in the morning. My husband generally rises at five or six, and he generally unbolts the door before he goes out; I bolted the door that night after the prisoner went up stairs, because my husband was a-bed before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who opened the street door in the morning? - My husband.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the prisoner the next morning? - He went out before I was up; I never get up myself till eight o'clock or half after; my husband did not know of his sleeping there.</p>
               <p>JURY. At what time are the stair foot and street doors opened? - Never before five or six o'clock at the outside.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is your husband here? - No; he did not see the man go to bed and knows nothing of it, but what I told him myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. He did not let him out in the morning? - No, he did not see him go out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110026"/>JURY. Did any body else see him go to bed? - He goes through the room where this gentlewoman lives to go up stairs; I don't know whether she is here.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many stories does your house consist of? - Four stories.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he pay you for his lodging? - He paid me six-pence before he went to bed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your husband must know of his going out? - We have two men and their wives that lodge in the house at this time, when the door is open they can go in and out; if he had known any thing of it he would have come.</p>


               <p>JURY. Could the prisoner come down stairs without going through this woman's room that you speak of? - There was a bed room next to that where she slept of a night, she went to bed in another room; she has two rooms; he must go through the room she lived in in the day time; she had another room she slept in; every body must go through that room that goes up or down, either night or day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Is there not a possibility of his getting out at the windows? - It is four stories high, I don't know how.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for you to let strangers have free access and passage into your house that you have so little acquaintance with? - We very seldom have any strangers lie in our house, but it happened to be so that night from the recommendation of the gentlewoman that lodged in my house.</p>
               <p>Had she been in company with him that evening? - She saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. If that woman had not known him, you would not have suffered him to lie at your house? - No.</p>
               <p>And you are sure that the stair-foot door was not open till five? - Not before, probably not till six.</p>

               <p>They might touch it with a broom? - No, they never did.</p>
               <p>What did this man stand upon to write this? - Upon a chair.</p>
               <p>And it was wrote the 20th? - The 20th of April.</p>
               <p>Did it not surprize you, that this man should come and desire you to take notice of this 20th of April? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were the words he made use of? - He said,</p>
               <p>'There was an affair had happened,</p>
               <p>'that he did expect he likely might be troubled</p>
               <p>'for.'</p>
               <p>What did you understand by that? - I did not know, nor did he inform me.</p>
               <p>You did not understand what the little affair might be, nor what being in trouble might be? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you never hear him say that before the justice? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you examined before the justice? - Never.</p>
               <p>What did you never give this account before a magistrate? - No, I never was sent for;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110027"/> I never was before the justice about it; I heard of it since he has been in trouble; but within this two or three days I had this subpoena.</p>
               <p>Where do you lie in this house? - In the first floor.</p>
               <p>Does any other person lie in the first floor? - Only myself and my sister; my servants lie up two pair of stairs.</p>

               <p>And you always lock all your lodgers up? - Yes, when we go to bed we always do; they come up one pair of stairs, and go through a room on the other side; that stair foot door as we call it, comes down close to my room door; the door is upon the first floor, that is bolted.</p>

               <p>He might then open the dining room window? - No, he could not; when we go up one pair of stairs, there is a door opens, behind that door, as close as possible to the stair-foot door that goes up to the rest of the rooms; when that door is bolted, they cannot get down to the dining room landing place.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I saw him at the Boot in Grub-street on the 20th of last April; he was going up to bed; I knew the prisoner before by his coming to my house for a pint of beer; he bid me good night, that was all that passed; he called me mother Norton, I said, Jem, how do you do? and so we parted; I took Mrs. Rosaman's club room and bed chamber, while a house was preparing for me in Golden-lane; I keep a cloaths shop there.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular acquaintance with him? - No; Mrs. Rosaman asked me if I knew him? I said I did, and I thought she might let him lie there for his honesty.</p>
               <p>Did you see him in the morning? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What was it o'clock when he went to bed at night? - It had struck twelve, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Were you and he pretty intimate? - No.</p>
               <p>He said how do you do, mother Norton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he sleep alone that night? - I did not go up to see his bed.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether all the beds were full or not? - I did not go to see.</p>
               <p>Who went to bed first, you or Mrs. Rosaman? - She went to bed before me; I saw her fasten the door.</p>
               <p>Which do you mean, the street door? - All the doors were fastened; there is a staircase door that fastens; there is only a space between where the club pot is put, and if Mr. Rosaman has any occasion to let his lodgers out, he puts his hand out of his own door, and lets them out; my husband has laid out several times, because I could not let him in, and did not care to disturb Mr. Rosaman.</p>
               <p>So you have more tenderness for Mr. Rosaman than your husband? - I did not care to disturb him as I was a lodger.</p>
               <p>You was not present when the day was chalked up in the kitchen? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it chalked? - Upon the wainscot in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How was it wrote? - In big letters in chalk; there was 20 in figures, but I cannot read; I can figure, but I cannot read writing; it was like a name.</p>

               <p>You could not go down without applying to Mr. Rosaman? - I could go down into the kitchen, but I could not get out; they who lodged above me could not come down.</p>

               <p>Why could not the prisoner do the same? - There is another staircase goes into the garret, and there is a staircase door to that; that is the door that is fastened.</p>

               <p>I have several horses at grass in a little field I rent of Mr. Scott; two of my horses were used to get over the bank and places into other people's grounds; I got up between three and four o'clock on the 4th of August, and went to see after my horses; as I was going down the lane that leads to my field, about half way I saw a short man in a light coloured coat, standing at the gate by a shed of the prisoner's, where he kills horses and boils the meat; being a stranger I went up to him; there were three or four dogs by the gate, who came flying at me, but as I work near the premises they knew me, and did not hurt me; I went into the yard; the man went in to the prisoner, and came out again; I went to the shed and saw a fine black gelding on his back, just knocked down; the flesh was quite alive; they had just began to rip it up the legs; they always begin to rip the skin at the legs.</p>
               <p>Who was by this horse? - The prisoner and his boy; they had each of them a knife;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110030"/> seeing such a fine gelding, and there appearing to be nothing the matter with it, I thought much of it, and stood looking at it, and took great notice of it; it had three white foot-locks, the near foot before, and the two hind feet; he lay on his back with his tail toward me; I admired the tail, it was a fine black tail which had been lately cut, and had two swishes, one on each side; I walked round the horse, his off eye seemed to be out; he had a white spot on his nose, which came down between his nostrils, that is very remarkable: I went to seek my horses; when I returned, the four hoofs were cut off, and I could see nothing of them, that gave me a suspicion that the horse was stolen; I went out, and came in again, and saw them cutting the legs; they had then cut all the particular marks off, and thrown them among some bone, and almost spoiled the skin; while I stood there,

             came in and seemed to be surprized to se the horse, and said to me, what can be the meaning of this horse being killed, is he glandered? the prisoner said he was; upon which I laughed; Murray said it was a stolen horse, and asked me to go and have a glass of gin; we went to a public house, and they were not up; from thence we went to another public house, where we had two pints of beer, instead of the gin; while we were there, we saw the prisoner and the strange man go by; Murray said all the way it was a stolen horse; I told him he should not say such a thing unless he knew it; I did not say any thing of my suspicion, but thought I would know whether it was a stolen horse or not; I desired a friend to look in the papers, and see if any horse was advertised, with particular marks, as stolen, as I had got possession of the pieces.</p>
               <p>When did you get possession of the pieces? - When they went by the public house I went and got the pieces together, and put them under the bones: on the 8th of August, Mr. Plumridge came to me and told me he had heard that I had seen his horse killed; he described his horse; that his tail was cut, and there were two swishes on it, that it had been rubbed against the cart, and was sore at the end, that it had three white feet, and but one eye; which exactly corresponded with what I saw; I told him I believed I could fetch him all the pieces of it, and went and fetched them in my apron out of the prisoner's yard from under the bones where I had hid them: Mr. Plumridge knew them as soon as he saw them, and said they belonged to his horse; Mr. Plumridge has had them ever since.</p>

               <p>I worked with the last witness five or six years for Mr. Scott; I hired a stable of the prisoner, by the shed where the horse was killed; I was at the stable on the 4th of August about a quarter after four in the morning, as near as I can guess: I came to the shed, there were a man there that was tried last session for horse stealing, the prisoner and his boy, who is his nephew, and the last witness; the prisoner and his boy were skinning a horse; the boy was about the head, and the prisoner about the body; I observed the horse was a black one; I did not observe any of the marks, it was a sat horse; I said to the prisoner, what is the reason such a horse as this is killed? I think it is a great pity; what is the matter with him, Mr. Benfield, is he glandered? he said, yes, he is.</p>
               <p>To PLUMRIDGE. Was your horse glandered? - No, he was as clear as a sucking foal.</p>
               <p>MURRAY. Blinkford upon that turned his head and laughed, and gave me the wink; I walked near the horse, but could see no sort of running he had about the nose; I came out of the yard with Blinkford, and told him I had a great suspicion they had stole the horse; the man that was along with him made me suspect it.</p>

             told me, they had taken a man that had stole some plate: they had secured Knowland, Knowland threw his bundle away from him, and he ran away; that then Swiney immediately seized him, and Stevens and Lisson came to his assistance; in the interim Knowland defended himself with a pint mug, which he cut Swiney the watchman over the forehead with; upon this, when they told me that there was another that threw away the bundle, and having this pint mug, I desired Stevens and Swiney and Lisson to do their endeavour to take Gray; I told them not to take so great regard of the bundle, but particularly first to try to get the man, expecting that the man would come to that bundle himself, which was the case: he was coming to that bundle again, and then they took him to the watch-house. While they were taking Gray I searched Knowland; in his pocket I found the plate which was first produced, excepting the pint mug, that was not in his pocket; he had a knife, and a tobacco box with tinder in it, afterwards a bag was brought in, in which there were other quantities of plate, and a dark lantern found by the watchman; then the bag was brought and I likewise examined this Gray; they were sealed up before the justice and they have never been unsealed since; this dark lantern, (producing it) was found by the watchman in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110039"/> street; this tobacco box (producing it) which has tinder in it, was found in Knowland's pocket; Knowland had that plate in his pocket; this was in the bag which I was told Gray threw from him; I was not present.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of August, going through Gray's Inn Lane at near four in the morning, I had the watchman belonging to that beat along with me, I am one of the patrole; very near Tash Street we met the prisoner Gray; we looked at him, and he looked at us, the watchman said, that was the man that had the bundle or bag under his arm, that went away when he apprehended Knowland; I said, if he was sure of that, we would take him in custody; I asked him where he lodged? he said, in Bloomsbury; when we took him to the watch-house, the constable examined him, and asked him where he lodged in Bloomsbury? he said, he would tell that when he came before the Justice; when he came before the Justice, he told the place where he lodged, and the constable and I went; I think he said it was Gilbert Court, he mentioned the man's name, I think it was Jones, and described particularly the house; the constable and I went there, and the constable made all the enquiry he could, we found no such person lodged there; he was taken about half an hour after Swiney had taken Knowland.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. It was about two hundred yards further up the street from where Knowland was taken that we took Gray; and in two or three yards of that spot we found the cutlass, salt, and dark lantern.</p>

I said, I was tollman, that night, How many are there of you? said they; Pierson replied, what is that to you, we have nothing to do with you, go about your business? they passed on through the turnpike, and then they gave three loud whistles or halloos.</p>
               <p>Did they halloo or whistle? - What they call the war-hoop, I believe it is, and they halloo'd; then we went the road that leads towards Blackheath, expecting to meet the party coming down with the goods, a man followed us when he came up to the top of the road, one part of which leads to Lewesham, the other to Deptford; he turned to the right, and there gave two or three whistles more, that was the Lewesham road; he waited there for two or three minutes, and then returned and went up towards Blackheath; Burr, Bacon, Pierson, and I turned to the right, which leads to Lewesham, and from thence we turned round to Blackheath, and came back to the same place again; then we turned to the left to go to Deptford Lower Town; after which we came all the way up the road that leads from Greenwich to the turnpike; we waited there a little while and two men came up to the turnpike; they stood talking there about ten minutes, saying, Who are you, and how many are there of you? and such like; we told them it did not signify to them how many there were of us, we wanted nothing of them, they might go about their business; they said some rough words, I cannot recollect particularly what, and then went the space of forty or fifty yards from us; we followed and went down to <placeName id="t17760911-42-crimeloc214">Deptford Broadway</placeName>

               <p>How soon after? - When I heard him cry out O dear; I lost sight of him when he cried out, that was as he turned round the corner; he was then in the same part as I was; he went in between the posts and the houses, I was in the middle of the green on the other side of the rail, I was speaking to him at that time; he was then about twenty yards from me, I believe; I made the best of my way towards the green; they followed me, I ran under the chain; when I came to the corner two of them came and said, B - t them, here they are, just turned the corner, let's follow them: I got away, I did not see Pierson again till about two hours after; he was then going into a boat; he had many cuts in his head, his left arm was broke, and his legs much bruised; his left ear was cut in two, and he was all over blood.</p>

I first heard them hallooing out; making a terrible noise, then I heard a man cry terribly, Oh! oh! oh! they went past my door, and came down towards my door again; I ran naked into the street; I came up to the people as they were beating the man; I cried out, You villains, are you going to murder the man? they ran away immediately and left him; I came up within about 10 or 12 yards of him before they quitted him, but it was so dark I could not see how many there were of them; I saw the man lying upon the ground; I asked him what he was, he said he was an officer; I asked him how he could venture in the town by himself where there were such a set of people that would murder him, or any body else they could come athwart; he said, there were three more besides himself, and he was afraid they had all shared the same fate. I passed him and went on to see if I could discover any body, but I could not; he was afterwards brought into my house; he was most terribly beat and bruised.</p>

He was so extremely ill, that I desired the governors to let his wife remain with him the whole time he was at the hospital; he died in about a month after he came in.</p>

               <p>I am a baker.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the night that this misfortune happened? - I remember such a thing transpired; I had been spending the evening at Deptford; coming home about twelve o'clock, as I was coming out of Church-street, upon the bridge I heard a man following me, I turned round and said, what do you want? he came up to me and looked very hard at me; I said, Are you going to Greenwich? he said, Is that Mr. Powis, I am not looking for you? and passed me: I thought the man had an intention to stop me, I had 14 or 15 pounds about me; as I found the man knew me, tho' I did not know him, I was determined to go back again; I heard some people talking, who were the people I had left; I went back; when I came into the Broadway, I saw four or five men stand that knew me; I said, I have met with a man I do not very well like upon the bridge, and I will give one of you a shilling if you will walk home with me.</p>
               <p>Do you know who they were? - No; they said they would go with me for nothing; two men came along with me within 300 yards of my own house, and then wished me a good night.</p>
               <p>Who were the two men? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>JURY. What hour at night was it you met those men at the Broadway? - About twelve; it was after twelve when I got home.</p>

             the removal here last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Whiting has been in custody ever since? -</p>
               <p>WHITING. I have been in custody four months.</p>
               <p>CORNE. It was the night I came in or the night after, July the 10th, that they went down to Portsmouth to take the two prisoners; Whiting declared to me, that the two prisoners never struck the man; he said that more that six times or ten times.</p>
               <p>JURY. Had you frequent discourses upon this unhappy matter? - Almost every night; strangers are brought in there of a night, and people come in and are inquisitive of what they are charged with.</p>
               <p>WHITING. I never told him any such thing, he has been bribed by George's mother; his mother came to me and offered me a guinea, and promised me 50 l. if I would say he was not concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination to Corne.</p>
               <p>What led you to Bridewell? - I was committed upon suspicion of stealing a silver tankard; the person is found out that took it; there will be no bill preferred against me.</p>
               <p>So you being a bed-fellow of this man, he used to tell you that the two prisoners were not guilty; how long ago was the first time that he told you that? - Three or four or five days after I was in there, as soon as he came back from Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>What had he been at Portsmouth for? - To apprehend or to look at these men, or something of that purpose.</p>
               <p>In order for their being apprehended? - I believe they were apprehended, in order for their being sent up here.</p>
               <p>So he told you he went down to fix upon these two men, and he did fix upon these two men, and as soon as he returned he told you that they were not guilty? - He did, that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110049"/> were not guilty of the murder; that they had not struck the man; the men were known by being advertised; he said, they were the men that were advertised.</p>
               <p>You understood that he had been down to Portsmouth, in order to give some satisfaction about these men for the purpose of their being brought up; and then after his return from Portsmouth, these men being brought up to take their trial, he told you in Clerkenwell Bridewell, that these two men were not guilty of the murder? - He has told me so three or four times in a week.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what share the two men had taken in it? - He said they were not guilty of it, and he wished they might be acquitted.</p>
               <p>May-be that was all he told you, he did not tell you the particulars? - He said, that one Gipsy George was the material man.</p>
               <p>But did he tell you that these two men were of the partie? - He said they were there.</p>
               <p>What did they do there, did he tell you? - They never struck him.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you Harley and George did there? - He said they were not guilty of the murder.</p>
               <p>But curiosity leads one to ask: if you talked of this no less than four times in a week, as you said just now, the conversation therefore must last longer than merely telling you those two men were not guilty of the murder; did not he tell you the particulars how these two men came to be there? - No; I did not expect to be called upon; he said something before Justice Sherwood, that if they were acquitted, he should be in perpetual imprisonment.</p>
               <p>So he did not descend to particulars, what these men did in the business? - That they did not strike him.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you that they did? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Then he never mentioned their being there at all when the man was beat? - I cannot recollect every particular.</p>
               <p>What share did he say they had in this business? - He said they were there during the time the man was killed, but they did not strike him at all.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what he had been down to Portsmouth for, or what he had said there? - He had been down to look at two men, and that they were the two men that were advertised.</p>
               <p>WHITING. I never told him any such thing; I always told him, they were the two men that were guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>To CORNE. Did not you understand in July, that he had been here at the sessions, and had sworn, as he swears now, that

            's people; the first house we went to was Mr. Wollaston's, a distiller, there we were informed that the prisoner had changed a note; we found her at last at dinner at Stepney; when I first saw her there, she said she did not know me; as soon as she was taken into another room, she acknowledged that all the money and notes about her were mine; I found in notes to the amount of 320 l. 25 guineas in gold, and twelve half crowns, and a note of hand for 29 l. that she had taken up of some other persons.</p>
               <p>It is needless to ask you whether you had ever given her these notes? - No, I never had taken my pocket-book out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What day of the month was this? - Sunday the 25th of August, that I met with her; but I suppose it was the 26th in the morning when I went with her.</p>
               <p>Had you known her before? - Yes; but I had not seen her for four or five years; I have known her by sight these ten or a dozen years.</p>
               <p>And had occasionally been in her company before? - Not three times in my life.</p>
               <p>You had been with her? - In the publick room; the room I met with her in, there were fourteen or fifteen people in it.</p>
               <p>What was the place you met her in? - It is the Newcastle coffee-house, Saint Ann's, Soho.</p>
               <p>That is a coffee-house I suppose where both gentlemen and ladies resort? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Were you there before her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In what company were you? - In none, I was sitting by myself.</p>
               <p>How might you be amusing yourself, was you drinking? - I had called for a pint of wine and water, I was drinking that.</p>
               <p>About what time did she come in? - About ten, I believe; I came in about half after nine.</p>
               <p>Was there any other company in the room besides? - About fourteen or fifteen.</p>
               <p>How long did you sit together in that house before you went away? - We did not sit together at first.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you scraped acquaintance? - I believe about three quarters of an hour; she was drinking with another man, and then came and sat by me.</p>
               <p>I presume you was polite enough to ask her to drink with you? - She might ask herself, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>The fact was, I suppose, that you did sit and drink together for some time? - She and two men that were there and I drank three pints of wine and some water.</p>
               <p>At what time in the morning was it you quitted this coffee-house? - Past two.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to? - Haddock's bagnio.</p>
               <p>Where is that? - In the Piazzas, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Then it was between two and three when you got there? - Almost three.</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening it is probable you asked her where she lived, and her circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110057"/> and situation in life? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Nor did you know where she lived, and with whom she lived? - I heard her say that she lived with a counsellor named Leonard.</p>
               <p>She told you in the course of the evening that she lived with counsellor Leonard? - She did.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where counsellor Leonard lived? - I found out next morning.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you she lived with him entirely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In short, that she was in keeping by counsellor Leonard? - I imagine so.</p>
               <p>Did not your conscience smite you at all in this invasion of counsellor Leonard's property in the course of your walk? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>But when you knew this lady to be the sole property of counsellor Leonard, the fact was, you and she went together to Haddock's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you not at all in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Sitting so many hours drinking had not affected you? - We had three pints of wine and water; I had half a pint at first coming in, and I believe I had some cold beef for supper; it was half after nine when I came in, and I sat there till two in the morning, and there were four pints of wine; the last pint was between her and me, I believe.</p>
               <p>It was quite day-light when you awoke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And had been day-light two or three hours; she had opened the windows to let in the light upon you that you might discover your situation? - She had done that I suppose to discover the breeches.</p>
               <p>She let the sun shine upon you; when you awoke, perhaps you went in search of this lady at counsellor Leonard's that morning? - I called at the lodging where she lodged, and saw the man; I understand his name is Leonard.</p>
               <p>What time did you call there? - I believe before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you find Mr. Leonard at home? - He was a bed, I suppose, for he opened the door, and had not got his cloaths on.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you and he had some conversation together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was the first place you had been at in the morning? - The first place I went to, was to a man that was in company to know where she lived; it was her lodging, as the man supposed, but it proved to be this man's.</p>
               <p>You and Mr. Leonard had some conversation about the matter? - O yes, I told him the whole affair as I have told you.</p>
               <p>Who were in company with her at Stepney? - Some people that I do not know.</p>
               <p>Then there were some people that heard what passed upon your coming in and charging her with this? - There might be five or six there; they were all at dinner.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did any thing particular pass there? - She was sitting at dinner; the constable went in; I said, that was his prisoner; he took her and found these things upon her.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Have not you known her eleven years? - I may have known her so long ago.</p>

               <p>So a 50 l. note was changed at Mr. Wollaston's, and a 20 l. at Mr. Smith's? - Yes, Mr. Smith gave her sixteen guineas, and I lent her 3 s. because she would not change any more gold; then I said I would come home; she insisted that I should take a ride with her somewhere; I said our two-penny brewer lived at Stepney, I should like to go there: at Aldgate pump we bought two fowls; when we came to Mr. Harding's, we ordered the fowls to be got ready; we rode in the coach to near justice Sherwood's, there we had a bottle of wine; my husband paid for it, and while we were at dinner she was taken up: I never saw her without plenty of money, and had no reason to suspect her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You was the person that proposed going to Stepney? - She used to take out bank notes at other times as plenty as she did then; she has had two and three thousand pounds at a time of money in her care of captain Percival's; she has often taken cash to Mr. Child's the banker, and often drawn cash from there; I never saw any thing amiss of her; if she had offered me twenty gowns, I should have taken them, and been much obliged to her.</p>
               <p>She had such friends as furnished her with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110059"/> plenty of money; she was not what you call a woman of the town? - No, I should not have walked with her if I had thought that; I never saw her with but one gentleman besides captain Percival.</p>
               <p>She never lay at your house? - No, I have no place for ladies.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see counsellor Leonard at your house? - Yes, sometimes; he has not been there since last winter; my husband struck him, and he has not been there since.</p>

               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I solemnly protest, before God and you, that I am perfectly innocent of this charge, this being the first time in my life that I have been at a bar or in prison, charged with either crimes or misdemeanors, not even for debt: my lord, on Monday the 25th of August, Mr. Leonard, a gentleman I have lived with two years, went out, I went to many places to enquire for him; at last, on returning home, I went into Mr. Hall's, where I had never been before; it is a place I had heard Mr. Leonard mentioned once he had been at; the woman I enquired of did not know him, but said, there was company in the parlour, I might go in and see; I went in, Mr. Wynter said to me, where the devil have you been all this time, and pulled me on the seat near him, to drink with him: my lord, I had known him eleven or twelve years, in the course of which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110060"/> time, whenever opportunity offered, he continually solicited me for favours, but without success, the reason of which was, a servant of mine some years ago cautioned me against him as a bad man; and though he often came to my lodgings, he was continually denied admittance, nor in the whole time could he court me to his bed: my lord, our conversation turned on the very servant who had so often warned me against him as a man of bad character; as I lived very near, and had the key in my pocket, I staid till past twelve, when every body being gone, except the prosecutor and me, I thought it time to go home to Mr. Leonard's; upon going out, I said, good night; he answered, you shall not go, you shall go with me; I told him I must go home, No, by G - d, you shall not, there is something for you, giving me a case, you shall sleep with me at Haddock's; I felt in the case, which was of leather, without string, lock, or clasp, and felt bank papers in it; I put it into my left pocket, he having my right hand under his arm; I suffered him to take me where he pleased; we went to bed, I awakened in the morning, I got up, opened the curtains of the bed and the windows, I saw it was light; I got up, dressed myself, opened the door, called the waiter, and went out: I went up James's-street to Cockran's in St. Giles's, to enquire for captain Percival; that was a house I knew he frequently went to; it cannot be conceived, were I guilty of such an act as I am charged with, that I should have gone to the very spot I was so well known in; I pulled out the case and examined it, and upon Mrs. Cockran's asking me whether I had that from the captain, I told her, No, but I had slept with a gentleman in the Garden, who had given it me; I made no secret of the money I had received; I had many sums of money from captain Percival; I mentioned his being indebted to them 29 l. I have lived with him near eight years, and have almost always paid his bills; I was seldom without bank notes; I told them I would pay his bill if they could give me cash for a bank note; they could not, but proposed going to the distiller's; they afterwards proposed dining at Stepney, where I had never been; I complied, upon condition that they would return with me to Covent-garden; so conscious was I of my innocence, that I did not want to avoid the place: before dinner was half over, two men came into the room, and said, they wanted me; Mr. Wynter came in, and said, that was the lady; they desired me to go into the next room, I did; they searched me, and took from me the case containing what I thought my property; I told them I was made a present of it, that some I had in my pocket was mine before he gave me the case; they took all from me, and took me in a coach to Bow-street; and I was sent that night to Bridewell: on Wednesday I was brought up again; Sir

             asked me if the property was Mr. Wynter's? I said, none of it; my reason for leaving the prosecutor when I saw it was day, was, that I had been told by many women, particularly that servant, that in order to seduce a woman, he would give any thing, when in the morning he would always take it away again, alledging that he could not be so great a fool as to give so much for a night, though that perhaps might ruin the woman for ever: I took the case without knowing the contents; had there been 1000 l. in it, I should have taken it for my own; I went away because he should not have an opportunity of forcing it from me when he awoke; and therefore he was resolved to swear I robbed him.</p>

I should have known them all in six months; I said, she seldom went out, and I always forbid her to mention where she lived, for I disliked visitors: I asked where he met her, he said, at Hall's in King-street, and then we went to Haddock's; d - n me, yes, I believe she had the book before we left King-street; he asked me if she could read and write?

               <p>I was in the house at Golden-lane; I went up into the room which the other witnesses had before been in, I found all the things which are produced in a room in the upper story; after finding the instruments which are produced, and likewise a tub with sand and some flasks in; I found in a great coat pocket a quantity of counterfeit-money (The witness produced several shillings and half-crown pieces, which appeared to be finished, and two good half-crowns, from which the moulds were made.) I suppose the shillings to be worth about four pence half penny or five pence a-piece; the half-crowns, 13 or 14 d. a-piece. I found these counterfeit shillings which are finished, and these which have not been whitened since cast (producing them) they were in a bag up the chimney; I found a number of good shillings, which I suppose were kept for patterns; I found the good ones in one place and the bad ones in another; there were some counterfeits up the chimney also in a piece of cloth; they are cast, but they have not been finished: I found likewise a piece of get, which is what runs in the channel between one part of the mould and the other; I also found files, aqua-fortis, and a quantity of faceing, that is of a stronger body than the sand, and is put over it to close the pores of the sand and make it smoother; I found a quantity of copper and a quantity of silver in it; I found some shirts marked R W which I take to be the initials of the prisoner's name. Suspecting who it was, we went in search of the prisoner, and between Red Lion-market and Golden-lane, we saw him at a door; he went into a yard and I followed him, and found him in the necessary-house; I took him into custody, and carried him to the house. The things produced are a complete apparatus for the coining of silver coin; no other business was carried on in the house, and there was no one tool in the room but what was applicable to that purpose.</p>

Sam took the lodging of me; he used to come mostly by himself; I never saw him and the short thick man together; the prisoner used to come by chance by himself, and did not stay long; I have seen him there within the last three months four or five times.</p>

               <p>I am to understand you then, upon your oath, you do not know whether this man lodged in your house? - Upon my oath, I do not know that ever he did; but I have heard two people talk in the morning, but who they were I don't know.</p>

               <p>Perhaps you might know that this man lodged somewhere else? - No; I cannot say that.</p>

You was to have appeared the last sessions; the trial was put off because you was not here? - I was at the sign of the Three Sugar Loaves at Putney; a person came for me; I was washing; I had a message, that some reputable gentlemen wanted to speak to me at the Pitt's-Head in Old-street road; I said, my husband was not at home, and I did not chuse to come; a man came up, and liquor was called for in plenty; I not being used to liquor, drank too much; they carried me to Putney, and there I was from the Tuesday night till the Monday following; I had not a halfpenny to pay for a boat or a coach to come home in.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. Then these reputable people, whoever they wree, kept you from the Tuesday in one week to the Monday in the next, at the Three Sugar Loaves at Putney.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the husband of the last witness, I live in Golden Lane: on the 24th of June, Clarke and the other people came to search my house; they searched the two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Now, I ask you upon your oath, who lodged in that two pair of stairs room? - There were two men; one was called Walker, and the other's name was Sam; they both used to be in the room; what their occupation was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether that is the Walker you mean? - To the best of my knowledge that is the man.</p>
               <p>Did they use to be in the room together in the day-time? - They did.</p>
               <p>Did they ever lie there together? - That I cannot justly say; Walker was but very seldom there, but Sam was there almost every day.</p>
               <p>Who used to pay you the rent? - Sometimes Walker and sometimes Sam; one paid it one time, another another time.</p>
               <p>I think Walker was apprehended on the Monday? - Yes; on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Who paid the rent the Sunday the day before? - Walker did.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in your house? - Between two and three months, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This short thick man used to lie and live in this room? - He was constantly in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation between this man and Walker before you received your money on Sunday? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether he paid the money for the short man? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110066"/>You say they were recommended by one Voiture; was Voiture present with both when he recommended them? - I cannot say; I was not at home; I was at work.</p>
               <p>The short man was always there? - Most an end, Walker was seldom there.</p>
               <p>You did not look upon Walker to have his lodging there? - I cannot pretend to say it was his lodging, because the other man paid the rent as well as he.</p>
               <p>You looked upon the man that was mostly there to be the lodger? - Certainly, by all means.</p>

               <p>Did you every night, or only frequently? - Every night.</p>
               <p>That was shewing him great attention; perhaps he did not know the way to bed? - I used to fetch the candle down every night.</p>

               <p>Do you know Mr. Holt has left London? - I left his house before he left London.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>You and Walker had but one room between you at this Hoop and Adze? - No more.</p>
               <p>He had not lodged there so long as you? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you used to come home pretty early in the evening? - I most commonly left work between eight and nine at night in summer, and worked as long as I could see in winter.</p>
               <p>Did you use to carry the candle up to bed yourself, or any body light you? - One time in particular, we were both drunk, a woman lit us up.</p>
               <p>Did not the woman use to light you both up? - Not very often.</p>
               <p>You used in general to be sober enough to carry the candle to go up to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And sober enough to put it out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was not used to be waited upon, to have a maid carry the candle up and fetch it down again? - No.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I suppose Walker would be in bed before you, and sometimes you before Walker? - That was but seldom, we commonly went together.</p>
               <p>When you went together, which used to carry the candle, you or Walker?  - Sometimes the one, sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>And you were both quiet sober men, there was no danger of setting the house on fire; you used to put the candle out regularly? - I was always thought so.</p>

               <p>On the 4th of June I went to see the landlady I lodged with when I first came to London in Dyot-street; I came to the house about ten o'clock, and staid above an hour; the prisoner ran after a young lad to lick him; the lad came into the house, and the prisoner after him; I knew the prisoner when I first came to London, we lodged in the same house four years ago, I was glad to see him; I sent for a pot of beer to treat him, we sat awhile; when that pot of beer was out, he sent for another; I got up and insisted on going home, he said, he would see me safe home.</p>
               <p>Where did you live? - I lodged in Bedfordbury; instead of bringing me up Monmouth-street, he brought me up Drury-lane; my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110068"/> friends were at the Three Tuns in Monmouth-street waiting for me, I told him so; he said, he would see me safe home, which I was glad of, for I thought he was very honest; when we were in Drury-lane, he insisted upon keeping me out all night; I told him he had much better take my life than offer to keep me out, or to use me ill; when he found he could not get his ends, he wanted to use me ill in the street; I took him to a public house, and treated him with two pints of beer, he seemed to be good-natured then, and would not offer to use me ill; I treated him with the beer thinking to get rid of him; when I came out of the public house, just at the corner facing <placeName id="t17760911-58-crimeloc292">Brownlow-street</placeName>

               <p>What time do you suppose it might be when you came out of the house? - The watchman was just crying half after eleven o'clock; he swore a great oath, that as he could not have his ends of me, he would have my things.</p>
               <p>What did he knock you down with? - His fist; I fell upon my left side; he took my hat, a sattin cloak, a striped lawn apron, and two handkerchiefs, one was about my head, and the other about my neck; when I recovered myself, he was gone.</p>
               <p>Did the blow take away your senses? - Yes; I was not sensible for a few minutes, he carried my things off, I never saw any more of them.</p>
               <p>Did he take away any money from you? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any money? - Yes; about eighteen pence in silver and three pence halfpenny in my pocket at the time, which he did not take.</p>
               <p>Did he demand any money of you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>When you treated him with the two pints of beer, did not he see that you had money? - I took out some halfpence to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Did you take out your silver with your halfpence? - I cannot justly say; I went home.</p>
               <p>Did you know where the prisoner lodged? - No; this happened on the 4th of June, which was a Tuesday, and I did not know till the Sunday following; I went to the justices on Monday, when I found where to get him.</p>
               <p>Where did he lodge? - Some where about St. Giles's; I went up Tottenham-court Road and found where he worked, and brought an officer with me to take him; I found out where he resorted on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>When was he taken up? - On the 28th of July.</p>
               <p>Have you ever recovered your things since? - No, none of them; he sent me a letter that he would pay me so much a week for them, since he has been in hold.</p>

               <p>How was he dressed? - In a soldier's old coat with blue cuffs, a flapped hat; he had his own hair as he wears it now; his coat was lapelled with blue.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of his face? - Very plain.</p>
               <p>Do you swear to his face? - I do, and do it very safely.</p>
               <p>How long after was it that he was taken? - Not till the Tuesday, it was the Saturday I was robbed; I saw him upon the Tuesday, I recollected him as soon as ever I saw him.</p>

               <p>I apprehend you was greatly frightened? - I cannot say I was, I was more frightened afterwards.</p>
               <p>I believe, madam, your eyes are not extraordinary good, as you are a very elderly lady? - If a person is near me I can see very well.</p>
               <p>You say he had a flapped hat on, that must prevent your seeing some of his face? - He pushed up his hat when he stooped to pick up the guineas.</p>
               <p>This was a lamp? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You don't speak with exactness I suppose to the time? - It was between one and two, nearer two than one; I went into my daughter's room after he was gone out of the window, and my servant was gone to alarm the neighbourhood, and then the clock struck two; that was not above a quarter of an hour after he was gone.</p>

               <p>What was the description? - The description Mrs. Watson's maid gave me of the man was, that he was tall, dressed in a soldier's coat rather shabby, with either blue or green cuffs, and a blue collar, with blue lapels; her mistress could not say whether it was blue or green, but she believed it was blue.</p>
               <p>What did she say as to his hair? - I remember she said he was a tall man, and of a pale face.</p>
               <p>What part of this description did you think applicable to him? - This day fortnight I had seen the prisoner near a house of my master's; I thought the description of the person and the cloaths agreed very much; I had seen him in a neighbour's house very near my master's, this day fortnight; he was dressed in a dirtyish red coat, a blue collar, and cuffs upon his sleeves.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of the blue cuffs? - I am; as to the lapels of his coat, I will not positively say that he had lapels, though I verily think he had, but the buttons of the coat were quite plain, and of a largish size.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are speaking of this day fortnight, the Monday before this house was broke open? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. She told you where she lodged without any hesitation? - Certainly, I then desired Mr. Clarke to go with her and search that lodging; in the interim I searched Harris's house myself very narrowly, and in his room I found this roller.</p>
               <p>Did Brockley give any account of it? - No; I did not ask her, I asked Harris about it; the shopman Vines was with me.</p>

I searched Wilson, in her hand I found a key, I asked what that belonged to, she said her lodging; I took her to her lodging, and in one of the drawers I found a shop-bill, in which there was three little pieces of silk; I asked her where she got those, she said she found them in the street as she was wheeling her barrow with fruit.</p>
