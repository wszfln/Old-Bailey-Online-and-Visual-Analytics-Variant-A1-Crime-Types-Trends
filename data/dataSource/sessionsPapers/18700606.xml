                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Kent, accountant, of 55, Basing-hall Street—I have been acting as accountant for the bankrupt—I prepared various accounts for him at the request of the Court of Bankruptcy—I made out an account of his dealings with Mr. Burton; I have the original draft of it; it shows from whom he bought the goods, when, at what price, when they were sent to Mr. Burton for sale, and what the goods realized—that account was made out in pursuance of an order of the Court of 16th February, 1869—I saw the bankrupt about it two or three times, while I was preparing it—I made it out from invoices, generally—I got from the invoices the particulars of the goods supplied, and I got from the books the dates, and the amount of money received from Burton, and in that way I made up the account—I did not see the bankrupt after the account was complete; the last time I saw him about it, I had about a couple of hours more work to do to it—he dictated this memorandum to me to write upon it—(<hi rend="italic">Reads:</hi> "Memorandum. I kept no account of the goods which I sent to the said William Burton for sale; I have applied to him for the particulars thereof, and he informs me that he has no account of the same; I have therefore made out this account to the best of my knowledge")—A copy of that account and memorandum was filed by me in the Court of Bankruptcy—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">stated that the account extended from February,</hi> 1868, <hi rend="italic">to August the time of the bankruptcy, and showed a loss, during that period, of</hi> 316<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—The goods sold to Mr. Burton were bought of the Chinese Tea Company, Thorns, Williams &amp; Co., Roper Brothers, Nash, and Arnold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187006060005"/>
               <p>I did not see it—the prisoner told me they had estimated his stock at the time of the bankruptcy at 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at cost, and that Mr. Baggs afterwards estimated it at 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he had given up possession in August, and they had carried on the business, and that there were no returns of the takings during that time—he said he thought the stock was worth more than they had put it down at—I can't remember whether he said it was worth 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found no return of the takings during the six weeks they carried on the business—the amount of ready money sales was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—the amount of sales from 1st February, 1868, to August, was 6916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in<lb/>cluding ready money sales—all that money was brought into the concern and paid away to creditors or expended in the business—the ready money sales in that period only amounted to 2100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the rest was book custom—about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid by the prisoner to <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> trade creditors in the course of the last month, August—during the last three months he paid to Williams &amp; Co. 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to Nash 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the Chinese Tea Company 292<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Thomas &amp; Co., the petitioning creditor, 229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Arnold 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that makes somewhere about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find upon investigation that the money which came from the sales to Burton went also into the business; it is in<lb/>cluded in the 6916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no examination of the bankrupt on the proceedings—the last examination, 21st January, 1870, was a formal meeting without any examination—the order for this prosecution was ob<lb/>tained on 11th March without his being heard—in making up Burton's account I have entered some of the goods as mixed; that means mixed in stock after they came from the vendor—the prices were given me by the bankrupt at the time as nearly as he could estimate them—I have no means of saying what the mixture consisted of.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Norland Place, Notting Hill—in April last, the prisoner came to me and represented himself as coming from a friend of mine at St. Leonard's, Dr. Blundell—he produced several articles from newspapers, on scientific subjects, and asked if I would revise them for him, as he was a foreigner—he entered very largely into various points connected with science and medicine—as I was pressed for time, I asked him to let me know precisely what he wanted—he then produced a telegram purporting to come from the Marquis de Beaufort, of France, and said he had no money, and requested me to give him some; he also represented that he was a connexion of Sir Robert Anstruther, who I knew personally, and the Rev. Canon Melville, who I knew by reputation, and on the strength of that I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he promised to return on the Monday—I did not see him again until he was in custody—he also represented that he was a freemason, and from that I should probably have been induced to give him some portion of the money, though not the whole amount—I should not have given him the whole of the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but for the statement that he was a connexion of Sir Robert Anstruther and Canon Melville.</p>

Q.</hi> How long did our conversation last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About an hour—it was at the latter part of it that I gave you the money—I don't recollect asking whether you had any relatives in England—I said it was a singular thing that you should come to a stranger for money, if you had any acquaintances in London, and you said you had none—you said you wanted it to pay your lodging at Hampton Court—I should probably not have given you more than a shilling, from your being a mason—you said you were a medical student, who was desirous of qualifying for a member<lb/>ship of the College of Surgeons, in London—you asked me to advance you a little money until you received the money which the telegram represented would be given to you on the Monday—I lent you the money, not because of the telegram, but because I thought you were a literary man in distress, and because you represented yourself to be a relative of Sir Robert Anstruther and Canon Melville—I had no other reason—I had never seen you before—you said you were connected with Sir Robert Anstruther, and you stated something about a Baron Anstrude, in the North of France, who was a connexion of his—you made no statement as to what was your con<lb/>nexion with Canon Melville—I gave you the money on the strength of your being a personal friend and connexion of a friend of mine, Sir Robert Anstruther.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Foster, of Grosvenor Lodge, Junction Road, Holloway—the prisoner and his wife were in our service last year—the prisoner was a general servant, and had access to all parts of the house—last June I went to Brighton for a fortnight—I had four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in the drawer of a table, which was locked, and my husband had the key—on my return from Brighton a com<lb/>munication was made to me by the prisoner's second wife, and I found the drawers were all open a little way, not forced, but unlocked with a key—</p>

               <p>the prisoner came in shortly after and said that thieves had got into the house—I said "No practised thief"—he said that he did not see them, because they ran away; but they got in at the window, and went out at the door, and that it was about 1 o'clock in the morning, two or three days before my return—he had my address at Brighton—I said "Whoever the thief was, was let into the house"—I ultimately missed five sovereigns—nothing further was done then—about three months afterwards I went to York; when I came back I unpacked a bracelet, and it was on the corner of my dressing table, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—my breakfast room is <hi rend="italic">vis-a-vis</hi> with my bedroom, and as I sat there, facing the door, the prisoner came up stairs in a peculiar manner, and seemed to go sideways round the door, and went into my bedroom—he had no boots on—I could see him, but I could not see into my bedroom—while he was in the room I said "What do you do there, Joseph?"—he said "I am going to draw down the blinds, Ma'am"—I said "You know very well the blinds are all down"—he then said "I thought perhaps you would want the gas lighted"—I told him he knew it was not his place, and he had no right to be in my bedroom, it was his wife's place to come up—he went down, and I went into the room, and missed the bracelet—I did not charge him with stealing it till my husband came home, as we had before that missed some diamond studs—I made a fuss about it, and they were put back into a box with some nails, and I thought probably the bracelet would be put back—I complained in his hearing, and forbade his leaving the house; but he would go out—I have never seen the bracelet since—I afterwards charged him with stealing it, and discharged him; after that he came to the area gate, and I spoke to him—he said "I did not take the bracelet"—I said "You know you pretended to break into the house, and you took the money"—he said "Yes, Ma'am, I know; I hope you and master will forgive me for that"—some spoons have been shown me which are like some I missed.</p>

I was married to the prisoner in June, 1868; he had a wife living then, who is outside—I was in Mr. Foster's service with the prisoner—I remember Mrs. Foster being at Brighton about the middle of last year, and while she was there someone broke into the house at a little study window on the ground floor—I was disturbed—Joseph woke me up about 1 o'clock; he went down stairs first and called me to bring a light—I went down, but did not see or hear anybody—I looked at the little window; it was broken, the blind had been let down, but it was pulled up again crooked; several of the drawers were open and the papers were all on the</p>

               <p>flow; a match had been lighted, which I found on the carpet, and there was little gravel on the carpet; the room door was open, and four little pictures were taken down, ready to take away—Joseph went to the front door—I undid the bolt and the lock, and he went down the garden to see if be could see anyone—he asked a gentleman who was going along the road if he would stop with me while he went for a policeman—he ran down the road, found two policemen and brought them back—I do not know who they were—I have never seen them since—they came in and looked found, and the next day Sergeant Crooke came, and the following evening Mrs. Foster came home.</p>

On 4th August, some information reached the station, and I was directed by the inspector to go to the prose<lb/>cutor's house—I looked about and noticed a small window on the ground floor, which was broken at the catch, and the greater part of the glass was outside—it is a sash window—a geranium near the window had been pulled up and trodden down—some portraits of sporting men were taken down and put round the room—there were valuable pictures which were not taken down—there was a quantity of plate in the adjoining room—the window was large enough for a person to get in—it struck me as very strange that this gold coin should have been selected, which was English, and the Napoleons and half-Napoleons left, which were in the same drawer—there were very slight footmarks outside—the ground was very soft.</p>

On 21st April I went to 130, Drury Lane, with another officer—it is a second-hand tool shop, kept by the prisoner Treasure—I saw him there, and told him we were police officers, and had information that he had some opera glasses—he said "I have no opera glasses in the place except one"—he produced that from the window—I said "You have some more, some better ones than this"—he said "No, I have no other opera glasses in the place"—I asked him if he had any tickets relating to any—he said he did not know, he would see—he opened a desk, and produced three pawn tickets, relating to opera glasses—I said I believed he had others in the place, and I should search—he moved a carpet bag from the shop into the parlour—I said "What is in that bag?—he said "A lot of things"—the bag was taken in the back parlour, and I opened it, with Sergeant Cole—we found five opera glasses in the bag, a watch, and toilet bottles—these two opera glasses were given up to me by the pawnbroker, when I presented the tickets—we found forty-four toilet bottles in the carpet bag—thirty-eight have been identified—when the prisoner produced the opera glass from the window he said that was the only thing he had received from Carter, meaning McCarthy—I had not mentioned Carter's name at all—I also found two dishes, eight match boxes, and a tobacco jar in the carpet bag—they have been shown to the Prosecu<lb/>tion—I found a letter dated April 5th in the bag; a second letter on that mantelpiece, and a third in a bureau in the back parlour—I took Treasure in custody for the unlawful possession of the opera glasses and other things—on the way to the station he said the china and the opera glasses were got wrong; but the watches were his own property.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the wound, externally, did not seem dangerous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not appear serious—it was not thought seriously of, or we should have admitted him at first—he was in a very weak state of health generally—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and opened the body—I believe the blow to have been the cause of death—there was not sufficient disease of any of the internal organs to cause death so soon.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Wellington Road, Bethnal Green, and am a blacksmith—on 22nd January I sold the prisoner a public-house for 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave me a bill for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment—I let it run for fourteen days, and when I went there were no effects—he called one evening and said he would withdraw that, and he gave me a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Shires was with him when he came on 22nd January—he was represented to be the broker—Shires asked me to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till the day of change, when he would return it—I had only got a sovereign and I gave that to him, thinking that Mr. Thompson was going to take the house, and I should receive the money on the day of change—I should not have lent him the sovereign unless I had thought that the bill was genuine.</p>

               <p>policeman came to my house, and I went down to the station—I looked an ten or twelve men—I saw McKan amongst them and recognized his face—I asked them to right about; I knew his back as well—he had a pilot coat on—I picked him out—he said "It was not me that took the watch, but I know who did; you were drunk and know nothing at all about it"—I was afterwards sent for a second time, but did not recognize anyone—the third time I was sent for, I recognized Courtney—he was among a number of men—I recognized him directly; he did not make any remark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a spice merchant, in partnership with John Clarke Foster, at 23, Eastcheap, and 3, St. Mary-at-Hill—about June last year the defendant applied to us for an engagement as traveller—certain negotiations were entered into—he was to take orders in the Birmingham district and receive money, which was to be remitted to us immediately—at the time of the engagement we mentioned Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, Cheltenham, and Gloucester—if he went to those towns we were to pay his expenses on his sending an account—and I think after going twice he sent an account for the joint journeys, twelve guineas, which was paid—during the whole time he was in our service he did not make any claim against us for any other journeys outside the Birmingham dis<lb/>trict, nor for the Birmingham district—his salary was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; and he had an engagement with another house which was rather more than ours—if he received a cheque payable to order, it was his duty to send it to us at once—he had no authority from anyone to endorse a cheque, and in no other case did he do so, except that which is the subject of this indictment—in consequence of information we wrote him this letter on 15th December: "We have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th, enclosing bank note value 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. We are much surprised at your request, as one of our fixed rules is that our representative should remit all sums collected on account <hi rend="italic">at once.</hi> We enclose your journey account to date, and must request that the balance be remitted without delay. We trust you will not give us cause to complain of this again, as we never allow this rule to be broken through; if so, it may lead to a termination of our engagement"—About the end of December we communicated with some of our customers as to a settlement of their accounts, and in consequence of the answers we received we discharged the prisoner—we had a customer named Henry Chandler, grocer, 73, High Street, Birmingham—on 6th October, 1869, we received the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—it was included in the prisoner's account—this is one of the prisoner's accounts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we did not receive 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him on 22nd November—we have also a customer named Henry Thomas, of 27, Smallbrook Street, Birmingham—the prisoner did not send us a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., received from him on 27th November—this is a detailed account, made up subsequent to his dismissal.</p>

I am one of the partners in the firm of Fer<lb/>gusson &amp; Foster—I saw the prisoner when he came up on each occasion—I was present at the arrangement made with him—it was as Mr. Fergusson has told us—he was to travel for six months in the Birmingham district, and to receive a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was to have no expenses in that district—we never received any claim for or suggestion about expenses until the writ came—on two occasions he was required to travel in the Man-Chester district, and he sent in a claim for those expenses, which was paid—we had occasion to write to him complaining of some omissions—on 24th December, we wrote: "We herewith hand you list of accounts, which you have received and not advised us of"—before we wrote that letter we had communicated with some of our customers—he did not subsequently to that letter send us a remittance for those accounts—we had not then discovered Dawes, of Birmingham, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor Bennett, of Stockpool, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor that he had not paid sufficient on the account of Thomas, of Wolverhampton—the prisoner sent us this letter of 27th December, containing this list—"Dawes, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," is mentioned in that—I do not see Thomas, of Wol-verhampton—the sum received is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as we have not received the further sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making up the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not find Bennett, of Stockpool, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have never received any advice from him that that sum has been paid—he did not come to our office to settle up after our letter of 24th December; neither did he pay any money after that date—I was not aware from him that he had 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of ours in hand—I did not know lie was keeping a book which I saw just now.</p>

Thomas, Wolverhampton, in his letter to us this morning, informs us that he paid Mr. Dunkley on 25th November. He only advised us 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. This will make the debt 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more.

               <p>in January, advising us of the receipt of that—to the best of my belief, I bare not seen such a letter—I was examined at the Mansion House—I believe Mr. Fergusson admitted there that the prisoner had given an account of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that there was a similar amount of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid by Andrews about the same time—I knew of this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Bennett some time after we dismissed Dunkley, I cannot fix the date—I did not require the prisoner to make a declaration as to the accuracy of his account—I am not aware of any communication with the Guarantee Society in reference to that.</p>

I borrowed the money upon the shares at the very full market value, in 1864. Those shares, with twenty-five others, went into the hands of the gentleman to whom I have referred, who is a large merchant in London, and whom I can call; but I decline to give his name. I have only been a nominee. Since then they were renewed in my name at the bank. At that time the banks were failing almost every day, and the value of the shares, upon which 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid, had gene down, the market value being 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. They were 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares, and he did not like to incur the probable loss of 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each of them. They have remained in my hands ever since, and the only object I had in disposing of them was for the benefit of the party for whom I held them."</p>

I live at 9, Sparrow Corner, Minories, and am traveller to a provision merchant—the prisoner and I had been living together as man and wife about seven years—she has borne two children, a boy named John and a girl named Jane—the boy is about six months old—I had separated from the prisoner about six weeks before this, but I had seen her every day at her own place—I went to see her for the sake of seeing the children—on 5th June, between 5 o'clock and 5.30, I was on the Blackwall pier, about my ordinary business—I saw the prisoner there—I had the eldest child, I had taken her out for a walk, and the prisoner had the boy in her arms when I joined her—she was talking to two foreign gentlemen on the pier-head, and she turned round and saw me—the only thing she said to me was that she would drown the children or poison them—I told her if she did she would be hung for it—I let go of the girl and let it play about on the pier-head, and the prisoner ran to the child, got hold of it, and made in attempt as if she was going to jump into the water, only she bethought herself and came back again—directly after that she took hold of the child again by the arm, and she bad the other child in the other arm, and she jumped right off the pier-head into the water—there was an alarm given—there were lots of people on the pier-head, and everybody tried to save her—I saw her taken out, and the two children—she was in a very bad state after coming out of the water—she was insensible—the children seemed to be all right—they were taken to the house where she lived, which was close handy—I took the children there, and she was taken by some of the dock people—afterwards, in the house, she tried to take the boy out of a lady's arms, and put her arms round its neck, and if she had her own way she would no doubt have strangled it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lockman at the West India Docks—on the evening of 5th June I was on Blackwall Pier, and saw the prisoner there with her two children—she and Chapman had been wrangling together—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am lodging at 11, Preston Street, Poplar—on this afternoon I was returning from the pier, and hearing a scream. I went back, and saw the prisoner in the water, with her two children—I did not see her throw herself in—I saw them taken out—I took the little girl home—the father asked me if I would go with him, and take the child to the house—I did so, and the prisoner was brought there afterwards, and a doctor was sent for—by his orders I put the little boy into a bath, and when I took it out to wipe it, the prisoner tried to wrench the child from me—she took hold of it round the neck, and had H by the legs—she said she would die with her children, and she said so before that, as soon as she came into the room—she appeared in a very excited state—I don't think she was sober, her breath smelt very strongly of spirits.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On 14th March, seven years ago, I left my home with the intention of marrying this name in three weeks. Since that we have lived together; he did not marry me; I had children by him, and did not like to leave him. He behaved very well to me at first. We were in great poverty, and I shared it with him. The last twelve months he has turned out a real vagabond, and since that he has been calling me all the names he could. I bore it all in silence, as I did not like to bring disgrace upon my children. He began to stay out night after night, and when I questioned him the only answer I got was "What odds is it to you, you are not my wife; I can do as I like." One night, about six weeks ago, he told me he was a married man, that his wife was alive, and had found him out. It preyed on my mind a good deal, and since then I have certainly neglected my home and myself, and felt that I was going to destruction. I said "I would sooner be dead than continue to lead such a life "He said "The sooner the better. "I bore it till I was almost distracted. On this day he came and took my girl out. I went with the boy on to the pier. There were two foreigners that knew him, and he came up and said something about the b—Irish. I got angry, and we quarrelled on the pier<lb/>heid. I said "I would sooner be dead than lead this life," and he kept saying "Do it, do it," and dared me to it, and I went to the pier-head and almost</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for five years paymaster of the London and South Western Railway Company, and since 5th January this year I have been paymaster of the men employed on the permanent way—the labourers are employed once a fortnight, and are separated into gangs—over every gang there is a ganger, and over a certain number of gangers to inspector—it is the ganger's duty to know the names of the men in a parti<lb/>cular gang, and to report the time which the men severally worked to the inspector, who, from time to time, in the discharge of his duties, would have to go down and see the men at work and communicate with the ganger—the inspector made a report in writing to the superintendent of the permanent way—from the inspector's report, pay-sheets are issued and sent to me for the purpose of payment—the prisoner Steele was the ganger of a travelling gang stationed at Hounslow, which was one of the gangs under the charge and direction of Inspector Henry Wood—from the 21st April something had attracted my attention in respect to the pay-sheets of Steele's gang, in consequence of which on 21st April I went down to Brent<lb/>ford, where Steele's gang was at work, and took with me this copy of a pay-sheet of the fortnight previously, dated 13th April—I saw nine men there, including Steele, and from the paper I had I called over the names of the gang—I made this copy, but the original is in Court—several of the men answered to their names—I called out the name of Simmouds, which is not on this sheet: there was a pause, and Steele then said, pointing to a man who I afterwards ascertained was Hatton, "This is Simmonds"—I proceeded to call the rest of the names in the list, and then proceeded to Hounslow—on my return I counted the gang again, and found only eight men—I said to Steele "There is one man missing, where is hat"—he made no answer—I said "I am sure there is something wrong with this gang, and I will not leave till I find it out, if it takes me a twelvemonth"—I called over the men's names, as before, and all who were there answered, but no one answered to the name of Simmonds—I said "Where is Simmonds?"—Steele said "He has gone for a lever," that is an instrument to lift the rails with—I said, "Are you quite sure the man's name is Simmonds, is not it Hatton?—he said "I knows him as Simmonds"—I had during my previous inquiries received information—I then went away from the gang and met Hatton carrying a lever on his shoulder—I had a conversation with him—nothing passed between me and Steele after that, I went away—on 23th April, which was the neit fortnightly payment, I went to Nine Elms with this pay-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), from which I called over the names of the gang and paid them their wages—on my calling the name of Simmonds the prisoner Simmonds stepped forward, in Steele's presence, and said "I was at Acton on that day with my brother, drinking—I said to Simmonds "Then your ganger told me an untnith, for he pointed out to me another man, Simmonds; I shall not pay you till I am sure of your identity"—the pay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it on the 21st that you had the first conversa<lb/>tion with Steele? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, And he continued working on the railway down to the time he was taken in custody—he could bear everything at the interview at Nine Elms—Potter was not present then—I am not aware that there has been a good deal of worry and annoyance in the traffic manager's office about this—Superintendent Bond has been discharged from the secre<lb/>tary's office—he is superintendent of the district of which Steele is one of the gangers—under him would be Inspector Woods, who would on a rough estimate have to superintend fifty gangs, and it may be considerably more—his duties would extend over a large district—Claxton would be under Mr. Bond, erne of his clerks; Bond comes first and in his office Claxton next, then Inspector Woods, and next to him the ganger—before money was paid in London all those persons would have to handle the account—Claxton would not have to pay money to the men—he would manipulate the accounts and documents sent to him—he has been suspended, and is I believe awaiting the result of this inquiry—at the end of every other fort-night it was the clerk's duty to go down and pay the men—that is not part of my regular duty in that district—I am aware now that the pay<lb/>clerks were in the habit of going down and banding the money, and not paying the men individually; I was not aware of it at the time—in some instances they handed it out of a railway carriage window—I am a chief pay<lb/>clerk, and when I discovered it I complained of one of my subordinates having been lax and not paying the men by the sheets individually—it has come to my knowledge since that that was also done in the district in which</p>

               <p>Steele was—as to hiring men, the inspector should submit any appointing he wishes to make to his superintendent—I have been told that Inspector Wood was in the habit of hiring and discharging men himself—as a role there is a fixed number of men in a gang, but Steele's was a travelling gang, and men were taken on a a they were required, some from one gang and some from another in the vicinity; it was a scratch lot—they might be called in for a day, from different gangs—they would travel about to all parts of the line within that particular district—if they are lent to another gang, some would be in one spot and some two or three miles away; but that is not the rule, it is a very rare case indeed—when I first went down and called over the names, I found men working two miles off, Gregory and Smith, who did not belong to the gang, and who ought not to have been entered—whether they belonged to the gang or not they were working for the Company—they were with Steele's gang on the pay-sheet—the ganger was the person who would give the times of the men to the inspector—I should have the pay-sheet after the superintendent, and on that pay-sheeet the money would ultimately be paid—they make mistakes on the London and South Western Railway, as they do in every other quarter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the London and South Western Railway police—on Friday, 29th April, I was at Mr. Scott's, the traffic manager's office, with Mr. Patten—Mr. Scott asked Simmonds his name, he said "John Simmonds, and gave his address at some beer-hop a Battersea—he was then asked how long he had been at work for the com<lb/>pany with Steele's gang, he said "Seven or eight weeks"—he was asked if he knew the names of the men he had been employed with, he said that he did not; but he knew their faces—he was asked if he had been working with any other gang but Steele's, he said that he had not—Hatton was then called in and asked if he knew Simmonds, he said that he never saw him in his life till the day after Mr. Patten came—after that I went to the embankment, near Clapham Junction, with Mr. Patten, and there saw Steele at work, with his gang—I beckoned to him and said "Steele, I want some information respecting the time of Simmonds; he said "All I know about it is that he was at work with me seven or eight weeks"—I said "Are you sure he was at work a month with you?"he said "Yes, longer than that"—I said "Will you be positive that he was at work three weeks under you?" he said "Oh yes, a great deal longer than that," and turned away and laughed, and walked away—nothing more passed at that time—on the following Monday, May 2nd, I went again to the embankment—the gang was working near the same place—I found Simmonds at dinner, and asked him where Steele was—he said "Gone to dinner"—we then well down the embankment, and I asked Simmonds to go on to Clapham Junction with Mr. Patten, which he did, and I remained on the embank-ment till 12.50, when I saw Steele—I took out a warrant and said "Steele, you must consider yourself in custody, for conspiring with Simmonds to defraud the South Western Railway Company; you will be charged on this warrant"—he said "Simmonds, d—Simmonds; I know nothing about Simmonds"—I said "You had better go with me quietly to Waterloo Station"—he said "I will see you b—first"—I advised him again to go quietly—he said "I will see you at hell first," and rushed towards a large iron sledge hammer, which he took up—one of my private inquiry officers stepped up, caught hold of him, and advised him to put it down—he then went quietly to Waterloo Station, and he and Simmonds were charged at Tower Street Station.</p>
