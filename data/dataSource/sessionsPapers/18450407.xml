Growcock's account in folio 8—on the credit side is entered, "May 5th, goods, 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; May 7th, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" making together 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the other side I find, "4th June, bill at three months, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and, "cash, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," balancing these two transactions—on the credit side, "4th June, 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" 6th June, 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has been scratched out, and 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. inserted—since I examined this book there has been written, in blue ink, on the credit side, "By bill, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that is a bill not paid—when I examined the book at first the 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in pencil—it is now in blue ink—the entries were in a correct and business-like manner, except being in pencil—I examined his books very roughly that Saturday, but made out that he owed 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have gone over them since, and examined them with his balance sheet—his debts are upwards of 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., besides 2128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. liabilities for old partnership debts—within seven or eight weeks of the 6th of July I can swear that upwards of 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods have been obtained, but believe it to be considerably more, and within three months 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the whole—I found about 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods on the premises—there is about 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to him—I saw him after he returned from Madeira, I think in August, and asked him to give me the particulars of the goods he had sent to Oxenham's, the auctioneer's, for sale—he said he had no record of them in his books, but he sent a list with the first quantity, and I could get it from Oxenham's, which I did—I asked what loss there was on them—he told me what he afterwards de<lb/>posed to in his balance sheet, which states that the goods sent to Oxenham on the 5th of June cost 720<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and realised 391<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., being a loss of 328<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the cost price—the goods sent to Bullock, an auctioneer, are put down as having cost 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sold for 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., loss 157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they are also entered under the date of the 5th of June—the ex<lb/>amination states that he commenced business at Portsea on the 9th of March, and ended on the 8th of July—the stock left on the premises fetched between 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have gone through all his books, and can say he was insolvent on the 11th of April, on the 9th of April and on the 1st of May—he was not solvent, when he began, putting the 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of ques<lb/>tion—he was insolvent, assuming that he did not owe that—when I was at Portsea I discovered that he had sent an immense quantity of goods away, about five tons—his books were silent on that subject—I discovered it by going to different wagon offices—there is an entry in his balance sheet of goods sold to Moses and Son for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which cost 540<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being a loss of 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Jay, my clerk, was sent to Madeira—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Grace Darling</hi>, elow Gravesend, in August, or the latter end of July, and saw the prisoner on board—I had had a conversation with Mr. Jay the previous evening, and spoke to the prisoner about nearly 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had given up to Mr. Jay at Madeira—he said he had given up to Jay at Madeira all the money he had; he did not know how much it was; he hoped I should find it all—I said I believed he had not given it all up—I got 2850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, brought from Madeira by Mr. Jay—the prisoner said he was afraid it might have been played some tricks with at the Custom-house</p>

               <p>at Madeira, and some taken, but he hoped I should find it all out—the halves of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes were given to me, which were found behind a looking-glass in the prisoner's cabin—he said he thought there would be about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was after I heard him examined and make a statement, that I went to the vessel and found these half notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not find that any goods were sent to the bankrupt after the 6th of June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never said that, for goods were sent after he ran away, and when he came back—he bought goods before he ran away a second time—in his books is an entry of 213<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth bought on the 20th of June—60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the 22nd of June, and 462<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 9th of June—I believe nearly every page of the book will show pur<lb/>chases subsequent to the 6th of June—I cannot tell where they were delivered—Mr. Jay has become my partner since the 1st of Jan.—he went to Ma<lb/>deira about the 12th of July, and returned, I think, early in August—he was gone about five weeks—when I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Grace Darling</hi> I said, "Mr. Bannister, you have not got those trowsers on which you bought at Orleans in France"—he said, "Who are you?"—I told him, and that I had been to Orleans after him, and traced that he had been there—he said he hoped I should do all I possibly could for him with the assignees or cre<lb/>ditors, as he had given up all his property—Mr. Jay had left the vessel at Margate on the previous day, and came to me at eight o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—I went down to Gravesend at twelve that night—I asked him over and over again what money he had given Jay—he said he did not know how much he had taken out himself, he had gone away in such a state of confusion—he said he was nearly pulled to pieces at Madeira by one person and another, that the custom-house officers told him he would be a great fool if he gave up the property; that one man offered, if he would give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to take him up the country, but he thought he bad better come to this country than be shot by the Portuguese; that the sovereigns had been a great trouble to him; he had no ease since be left England, for he was watched and it was suspected by everybody that he had run away from England the moment he landed; he regretted he had done wrong; he had acted very imprudently, but domestic ties had been the cause of his leaving the country, and that he had given up every farthing—he said Mr. Jay had promised to induce his creditors to give him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consideration of his giving up the property—he did not state to me that a person had offered for a sum of money to make away with Jay and the messenger—he had a pistol on board the ship—I think the estate has paid 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—I should think the expenses of the flat are about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that arises from the heavy expense of going to Madeira.</p>

I was coming down Fashion-street, and saw the prisoner running—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "Nothing"—she continued to run, and had her cloak tucked under her arm—I did not exactly see her stopped by Harris, but hearing the children crying "Stop thief" I ran up, and as she was coming back I saw her drop the key—I picked it up and gave it to Harris, and he gave it to the policeman.</p>

I have my register of that day with me—I remember Mr. Plant bringing a letter to me that evening—I regis<lb/>tered it—I have entered "a registered letter for Mrs. Ludlam, Charmouth"—after the letter was so registered it would, according to the course of business, be inclosed in a green cover, which is prepared for the express purpose of inclosing registered letters—each registered letter has a green cover, and is addressed to the post-master of the town to which it is to go—the post-master's name is printed on the cover, and we have only to add the name of the town, and the name of the party to whom it is addressed—that was written by Mr. Plant in my presence—after it was inclosed in the green cover I and Mr. Plant took it over to Mr. Liffen, the clerk of the Oval division, or road—I took my register with me, and he affixed his initials to the entry in the register, at an acknowledgment of having re<lb/>ceived that letter.</p>

On the 10th of Feb., between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was at the Globe and Friends, in Morgan-street, Com<lb/>mercial-road—I was sober—as I was coming out, Wilmot struck me with his fist—I did not know him before—I had seen him in the tap-room pre<lb/>viously—he came in about a little before twelve—we had had no dispute—I never exchanged a word with him—I was not knocked down by that blow—the landlord ordered the prisoners to be turned out for using bad language, after striking me—Hind, the potman, was turning them out, and as soon as they were outside they struck him—I did not see that—he came in and told me—about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after, I went to go outside to the watering-place, and I saw the prisoners standing at the door—I went up to Wilmot to ask him the reason why he struck me—I had not got the words quite out of my mouth before White struck me on the forehead with some weapon, but I cannot say what it was exactly—it was not his fist—I fell to the ground—I got up again, and laid hold of White, to try to see for the weapon—I was looking round to see if any assistance</p>

I was in the tap-room of the Globe and Friends, on the 10th of Feb. and heard a disturbance between Bridges and White—I passed some remark on the females that were there—the young men heard it, and White made use of most awful language to me—I went to the bar and complained of it to the landlord—the pot-boy was desired to turn them out, and he turned out the two prisoners and the two females—I heard a scuffling in the tap-room while I was at the bar, but I did not see it—after they were turned out there was a fight outside the door, (so the pot-boy said who came in with his mouth bleeding) about half an hour after I went out to go home, and saw the two prisoners standing at the door where they live, and two women behind them—I had to pass their door to go home, and as I was going towards it, I saw Bridges going towards them, and I saw White stab or hit him in the head with some in<lb/>strument which shined in the light—he staggered, and I saw him bleed<lb/>ing very much—I screamed "Police," till I was so exhausted I could not scream any longer—I then saw the two girls try to drag the prisoners in—(I saw no more of Bridges, he was taken away and I was so flurried)—the policeman put his foot against the door and kept it open, and the pri<lb/>soners were taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. Bridges wae brought to the hospital a little before two o'clock on the Monday morning—he was bleeding profusely from a wound above the left brow, about an inch in extent—at the bottom of the wound in the scalp, a portion of the bone was depressed to about the extent of one-sixth of an inch—there was a fracture of the bone—a portion of it was driven in—there was another wound superficial at the top of the forehead—it was not a cut, merely a bruise; he was perfectly sensible, with the exception of being apparently slightly drowsy—he did not appear to me in liquor—it is difficult in these cases to judge accurately, but he answered rationally to every question that was put to him—he has not quite recovered yet—there is a slight portion of the bone to come away—none has yet come away—I did not consider him in danger, or suppose it would terminate fatally, but in the progress of these cases there always may be danger—this was rather an extraordinary case, there was hardly any symptom indicative of injury to the bone, which generally characterises such injuries—he was in the hospital I think about four or five weeks.</p>

The Globe and Friends is a corner house in both streets—I never use it, and have no connection with either of the parties—between one and two o'clock I was in bed, and heard a noise, which caused me to open my window and look out—I saw Lyons, the policeman, and the pot-boy, having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> together—the pot-boy said that either White or Wilmot had struck him in the mouth with a stone in a handkerchief—Lyons said, "I saw nothing of it, I will have nothing to do with it"—Hinds said directly, "I will make you, I will force you"—they got nearly to high words—the policeman then left—all was quiet for three quarters of an hour after that—I laid down again—I heard a noise down the streets, "Here the b—s are! here the b—s are!"—I heard Hinds whistling, and Bridges was singing, "<hi rend="italic">Tol de rol lol</hi>," and with them about twelve or fourteen wh—, or more—I saw them run right down the street—Hinds had a poker in his hand, and Bridges was on the right side of him—Wilmot and White at that time were at the door of Mr. Whitfield's house, I believe—I do not know whe<lb/>ther they live there—they were all strangers to me—I saw Bridges rush up against the door as if to burst it open—it was nearly closed—he got in between the door as it was closing—the pot-boy came up with the poker, and struck three or four heavy blows at the door, and I heard Bridges halloo out, "I am cut"—with that the pot-boy ran away with the poker to the Globe and Friends—Bridges came staggering out into the road, and one of the girls caught him in her arms, and dragged him opposite my house—he cried, "I am faint, go fetch a doctor"—they then took him round the corner, leaving four or five girls in the road—the prisoners tried to escape into the house—they got as far as the passage, and the mob rushed up together into the house—it appeared to me as if the prisoners were trying to close the door against the people outside—the pot-boy was near to Bridges when he made the blows at the door with the poker, and I am sure some of the blows hit Bridges, for the blood was on the outside of the door, which shows it was done from the outside—a person named Lazarus, who lives next door to me, put his foot to the door to try to stop it from being closed—he cried, "Police," and sprung a rattle, which caused the policeman to come.</p>

I am in Mr. Mills's employ—I remember, about Christmas, the prisoner showing me a remnant of white quilting at a public-house—he said he got it from hit brother, who he told me previously lived in Basinghall-street—he said a tailor could make two waistcoats of it, would I buy half of it of him, which I agreed to—he took it to the tailor's—I did not accompany him—these waiscoats are made of the same quilting—this one, I know by the quality, was made of the material I purchased—I tried it on—it did not fit me—I sent it back to the tailor to hate it altered, and did not have it again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 304.) I was on duty Friday, the 21st of Feb., near Hampstead—I saw Mr. Hilton about ten minutes or a quarter past seven o'clock—in consequence of what he told me, I proceeded up Haverstock-terrace to the field at the end of it—I went across the field to the first point of the wall—I did not proceed further that way then—I saw and heard nothing—I then went down the narrow passage, which brought me into Bellsize-lane, and then turning to the right, I got into the Hampstead-road again, opposite the George—near the George I met Sergeant Fletcher—he and I went together up Haverstock-terrace again, and into the same field—we went across the field, then to the end of the wall, and then came down the wall, and in the bottom corner of the wall found a dead body—I looked at no watch—I think about half an hour elapsed, from the time Hilton made the communication to me, till I got to the place where the dead body was found—the body was afterwards removed to the Yorkshire Grey—that was the body on which the inquest was held—when I first found the deceased he laid flat on his back—he had on a great coat as well as a close coat, and they were both wide open—his right-hand glove was off, and was lying to<lb/>wards his feet, with some blood on it—I also found a hat, lying at some little distance, with a pocket handkerchief in it—the body was warm when I got up, but quite dead—the injuries appeared to be on the head—there was a pool of blood at his feet and one at his head—I did not search the body before it was removed, I did afterwards—the bosom of his shirt was covered with blood, and his two coats unbuttoned—with that exception, his dress was as persons ordinarily wear it—there</p>

               <p>was no watch on his person when I saw him in the fields, nor when I searched him afterwards, or any money—I found a letter in his coat pocket—I handed it over to the inspector, Mr. Gray—after the discovery of the body, Fletcher went away to get assistance, leaving me there alone—he went away about three or four minutes after we got up to the body as soon as we had ascertained it was the dead body of a man—he was gone about half an hour—about a quarter of an hour after he was gone, a person joined me—he came in a direction from Primrose-hill—he came in a direction from the Avenue-road—there are footpaths across these fields in many directions about there, by which persons can go into the Avenue-road, or come out of it—my attention was called to him before he came up to me, by his whistling and singing—when he came up, I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "Halloo, Sir"—he said, "Halloo, policeman"—I said, "I have a serioua case here before me"—he said, "What is it?"—I said, "A dead man, who I think has cut his throat"—he said, "Are you sure he is quite dead?"—I said he was quite dead, for I had felt his pulse, and it did not beat at all—he stooped down and felt the pulse of the dead man—he did not kneel, he merely stooped down—he said, "You have a nasty job here alone, policeman"—I said they were gone for the stretcher, and I dare say they would soon be back—he then said he bad been in the habit of travelling that way for the last two years, from town, that he transacted business in town, and he generally had a great deal of property about him when he came that way of a night, such as a watch and a gold ring, which he said he generally wore on his ringer—he said he never saw any danger in coming that way, but that he had been cautioned by his parents not to come that way home of a night—he then asked me if I would have some brandy—I said I would rather not—he said, "You have a cold job here, and I am sure you will want something to drink after it"—he then took a shilling from his pocket, and offered me it to get something to drink after I had done—I refused it two or three times, but being pressed, I took it—soon after that, persons came with the stretcher—I had no light with me while I was waiting there—one was brought with the stretcher—it was an ordinary lantern, carried by a policeman—it was turned on the body, and on the face of the deceased—the man I have been speaking of was standing by at that time—the body was then placed on the stretcher, and taken away to Hampstead—we went down the passage, and into Bellsize-lane—the person of whom I have spoken, followed as far as that—I then lost sight of him—he had on a cloak or macintosh, I could not say which—I cannot say who that man was—he was muffled up a great deal, and it was very dark, and I could not identify him again—he was a young man, about five feet eight in height, or thereabout.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Hampstead, I handed this letter to Gray, the officer—it was taken from the great-coat pocket of the deceased—I was called to see the deceased about a quarter to nine o'clock on Friday evening, the 21st of Feb.—I found him lying at the dead-house attached to the Yorkshire Grey, Hampstead—I found a large wound, about four inches long, on the upper and back part of the head, on the left side there was a smaller one, immediately in front of it; a bruise on the left temple; and a wound on the right eye-brow, from which blood had been oozing—that was all I discovered at that time—I after<lb/>wards examined the body, by the Coroner's order—after the head was shaved I discovered two or three more wounds—they were all scalp woonds—the skull was not fractured—on examining the under surface of the scalp, there was a good deal of blood effused, corresponding to the wound I dis<lb/>sovered on the outside—the chief wound was, I should think, about row inches and a half in extent, so that I could introduce three or four fingers—I attribute the death to concussion of the brain, as the consequence of the violence externally to the head—I should imagine, from my exanima<lb/>tion of the wounds after the head was haved, that they were inflicted by some heavy instrument, such as a large stick, or a life-preserver, or any</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other surgeon here to speak as to the result of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I passed my examination as a surgeon four years since—I have been practising at Hampstead—I attribute the death to concussion of the brain—the brain itself did not present any diseased or unhealthy ap<lb/>pearances, but that is by no means uncommon—I saw quite sufficient symptoms to account for the concussion, by the repeated blows on the scalp—there was no fracture of the skull—there was no appearanoe in the brain itself denoting concussion—concussion of the brain, as far as the brain is concerned, very often leaves no appearance of concussion on examination—that was the case here—apart from the injuries on the head, there was no appearance of any disease or derangement of the brain—there was no congestion of the vessels, or anything of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I right in drawing this conclusion as yours, that finding there were injuries on the head, and that the brain presented a healthy appearance, you concluded that the concussion must have followed from those injuries on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the repeated injuries on the head un<lb/>doubtedly—it is very frequently the case that there are no appearances on the brain to warrant that conclusion—it is very commonly the case—the wounds on the head denoted blows from a heavy instrument, used with very considerable violence undoubtedly—any heavy instrument might do so—I do not think a hammer is a likely weapon to do it—a poker might do it—a heavy club would do it undoubtedly, or a heavy knotted stick—the appearances presented led me to conclude there must have been a great many blows—it need not have taken some time—they might have been repeated very quickly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But did not the body present appearances from whence you would draw the deduction, that great struggling and resistance had taken place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should say not—there did not appear that appearance, of strug<lb/>gling—the clothes were not much disordered, or anything of that kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you think the blows had been inflicted with some instru<lb/>ment? if, hard, of no violent character, or, if soft, repeated, inasmuch as there was no fracture of the skull, or anything to denote any injury to the skull itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that did not follow by any means—I did not find my<lb/>self very much puzzled to account for the death—I concluded at once on a careful examination of the scalp, seeing the repeated wounds that had been inflicted, quite sufficient to account for death—I should attribute the con<lb/>cussion to no individual wound, but to the whole wounds taken collectively—I gather concussion must have followed, from the evidence of numeyom blows that had been given, and finding the man was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known concussion follow from the self-struggling and re<lb/>sistance of a man who was engaged in a fight, either with a stick, or any<lb/>thing else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, without either a fall or a blow—con<lb/>sussion is not likely to follow from any cause but direct violence that I am aware of—I do not believe it would follow from shakes—I have seen three sticks—the largest stick that was shown me might have produced the wounds—it is a large yellow stick—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this now produced is it—this is a stick likely to have caused it—it is a heavy stick—when asked my opinion, I said it was a very likely weapon to have caused it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070046"/>
               <p>I have not seen any other likely to have done it—the skull was not beaten in—it was perfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that repeated blows, violently inflicted on the bare skull of a man with such a stick as that, could have been so inflicted without fracturing the skull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do think so, because it was just on the ridge of the skull—had it been immediately on the top. I think the skull must have been fractured—the blows seemed to have been given in a slant<lb/>ing direction—I think such blows might have been inflicted with such a stick, and produce the appearances I found, without fracturing the skull—I consulted a gentleman of more experience than myself on the subject, a Mr. Davis—he is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That part of the human skull that you have described as the ridge, is, I believe, of great strength? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is—the deceased appeared to be about twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any appearance at all about the body not consistent with health, except those appearances about the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only examined the brain—there was a slight mark on the finger, but nothing at all to account for death.</p>

I had some business in the neighbour<lb/>hood of St. John's wood—I returned home down Titchbourne-road—that is the road that joins the Avenue-road near the Swiss Cottage—I did not come up the Avenue-road—I came up the same road—I remember meeting a person in the Avenue-road—I had come up the Titchbourne-road, and then turned down the Avenue-road—I was going towards Portland-town, down the Avenue-road—that was in a direction that would lead me to Re<lb/>gent's-park—I was going towards London—I should say I might be 100 yards nearer to London than the Swiss Cottage when I saw the person—to the best of my recollection I should say it was about seven o'clock—I can<lb/>not say exactly—before I met the person I heard the cry of "Murder"—I did not hear it more than once, to the best of my recollection—it appeared to proceed from across the field—I afterwards went to the place where the body was found—the cry appeared to me to proceed from that quarter—when I heard the cry I stopped—I may have stopped ten minutes listening—I stood still, and while I was standing still the man came from the hedge side near the field, on the footpath where I was standing—I was standing on the footpath in the main road—he was not on the side from which the cry had proceeded, he was in the main road on the footpath, on the same side that I was—he was going towards Portland-town, the same way that I was—I had not noticed him at all until I saw him close to me—I cannot say whether he came along the road or from the field—there is a little hedge along there—I had seen that person before—it was the prisoner—he was running when I saw him—I asked him whether he heard the cries of "Murder"—he made no answer—he stopped for a moment when I spoke to him—I looked straight at him and he went past and went on—he did not walk and he did not run—it appeared to me like a dog-trot—I did not notice what he had on—it was dark clothes I know, but I could not tell what—I afterwards went to the place where the murder was committed—I should say it was about 200 yards across the fields from where I saw the prisoner, not more—it is about three fields from the spot where I stood—there is no difficulty whatever in a person going from the road across the fields to that spot—there are foot paths.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother. On the 21st of Feb. I lived with my father, who is a ladies' shoemaker, at No. 17, Charles-street, Portland-town—at that time I used to sleep at No. 11, Victoria-terrace, Portland-town, with the prisoner—he was at my father's house on the 21st of Feb., and went out about a quarter-past seven in the evening—Charles-street is about twenty minutes' walk from Haverstock-terrace—in the course of that afternoon my brother bad told me he was going in the evening to Bath-place, to receive ten or twelve sovereigns which he had ex<lb/>pected for about five weeks before, from Mrs. Edwards—it was to be lent him—he returned to No. 11, Victoria-terrace, to sleep about one in the morning—I had been in bed some time, and imagine it was about that time—his coming into the room awoke me—he showed me twelve sovereigns, and said be bad got rather more than he expected, and then he showed me the right arm of his shirt, the wristband of which was torn, off—he told me, without my asking a question, that he had been at Sarah Cox's, and in company with her brother had got it torn off in romping—I never saw Sarah Cox—I knew he corresponded with her, from what be told me, and seeing letters lying about addressed to her—after mentioning this he came into bed—nothing occurred in the night—I got up next morning to my work as usual—I got to my father's, which is only across the road, within a hundred yards, about half-past seven or eight, and in about two hours the prisoner came over to my father's to breakfast, according to his usual habit—he produced the money, and gave my father a sovereign, my mother a sovereign, and paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, which he had owed me four or five months—I expected he would pay me as soon as he got a situation—he was out of employ then—the last regular situation he had was about seven months previous to that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect, on the Saturday night, being with your brother at Watson's, your father's landlord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mr. Watson alluded to the mur<lb/>der at Hampstead, and said it was a very awful thing—I had been out to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070051"/>
               <p>purchase a small quantity of spirits—I came in, and said I had heard several people talking about it—when Mr. Watson alluded to it, my brother said it was rather a dreary subject to talk of, as we had met to enjoy our<lb/>selves, and I very readily joined in the <hi rend="italic">assertion</hi>, and the conversation dropped—on the Sunday I went to chapel, and returned to my father's—I was in the habit of going away directly after dinner—the prisoner desired me to stay a little while with him, and drink a little porter, which had been purchased at dinner—he sent for something else—I read an account of the murder in the newspaper that afternoon at a friend's house, and saw that a letter was found in the deceased's pocket addressed to James Cooper, Esq.—I knew before that, from the prisoner, that he knew De la Rue in the name of Cooper—I have seen him address letters to him by the name of Junes Cooper—I forget the name of the street, but it was in Hampstead-road—I went home at ten o'clock on Sunday evening to supper at my father's—the prisoner had not returned home then—he came home to our sleeping-place about eleven—I said nothing to him about Cooper or De la Rue that night, for fear it should disturb him—about half-past seven next morning I awoke him, and asked if he knew who was murdered at Hamp<lb/>stead—he said he did not—I told him it was poor De la Rue—he seemed very agitated, and exclaimed, "Poor De la Rue I"—he seemed very much affected by the news—he sent me over to his father's for his boots, and when I returned, I had reason to believe, from his eyes, he had been cry<lb/>ing—I said nothing, but gave him bis boots, and went away—he came to breakfast at my father's in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—my father said to him, "It is a sad thing about De la Rue; I consider it is your duty to go and own him, as you were so intimate with him"—he said he would go and own him, but while he was putting on his out-door things to go, my mother returned from an errand, and said the body was already owned—he expressed his joy at its being owned, and said it would very much have hurt his feelings at going to own the body, so much that he thought he should almost have fainted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the Saturday night after you left Charles-street, and went to your sleeping-place, did your brother show you anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He showed me a silver watch that night, after we left Charles-street—about four months before that he had a watch to sell for Mr. De la Rue, which I saw—I knew he pledged it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which be told me was the money Mr. De la Rue wanted for it—when he showed me the watch on the Saturday night he gave me to understand that he had redeemed the watch he had pledged before, the watch he spoke of, and I took it to be the watch—he said he had been himself to redeem it—the watch was going at the time he showed it to me—he made a remark on that—I knew the other one would not go, as it was out of repair—he said, "I have got the watch, and it is going."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the watch now produced, resemble the one he showed you that Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should most positively say that is the watch, by the seconds' hands being broken off—he broke them off on the Monday, I believe, by accident—on the Wednesday morning, about one o'clock, Scot<lb/>ney, the officer, came to our room in Victoria-terrace—my brother went down and let him in—on Scotney coming up, he first asked me if I had a watch—I said I had not—he turned to my brother, and said, "You have"—my brother showed that he was confused I thought—he attempted to make a reply, but stammered—I said, "Well, don't deceive the police<lb/>man,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, tell him all about it"—meaning, tell him it is the watch you have redeemed—I thought he did not like to tell him, because of the exposure—I thought he was too proud—he took the watch from under his pillow, and gave it to the policeman—he then went to the sideboard, and took from it a morocco case, intended to keep a watch in, which contained three duplicates, the one for the watch, which really was in pledge, one for a ring, and one for a silver chain—I expressed my surprize at seeing the duplicate of the watch, expecting the pawnbroker had got it—I said, "I thought you had got this watch out of pledge?"—he said, "No, it is still in pledge, and this watch De la Rue gave me on Friday morning"—I had seen the prisoner on Friday morning, before he went out—he breakfasted at my father's, and went out about eleven in the morning—I did not see him with any watch then, nor in the evening—the one he pledged was the last I know of his having—I am quite sure of that—I imagine that my brother and De la Rue were on intimate terms, from my brother going out, some<lb/>times perhaps twice a day, four days in a week on an average, in summer time, intending to meet him, and walk with him in the fields, my brother's time being unoccupied—from conversations I have had with my brother, I believe they were on very intimate terms—I recollect last summer my brother bringing home some money—I think I said on a former statement, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I think it was not quite so much—I might more properly have said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—he said Mr. De la Rue had proved a friend to him by giving that to him—my brother had no regular situation—he has been a schoolmaster—he was brought up to that—he can write very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this letter, does it appear to be his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him forge a female hand—I take it to be a female's hand—I never saw him write like this—he used to write a bold hand, but I do not consider it impossible for him to write like this—I know he can write two or three hands—he had no situation in the City on the 21st of Feb.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the house in Charles-street, where the prisoner's father lives. On Saturday night, the 22nd of Feb., I was in conversation with the prisoner and his father in the house—I said it was a shocking job, a murder had been committed at Hampstead on a gentleman, and nobody knew who he was—the father said in his presence, "A murder at Hampstead! I wonder who has done it"—the father said, had I heard how it had been committed, or something to that effect—I said there were three soldiers seen coming from the neighbourhood of Hampstead that night, and suspicion fell on them; they generally carried heavy sticks, and it was supposed to be done with a stick; that the head was smashed, and the brain coming though the skull—the father said, "Oh, cold-blooded rascals! I wonder who has done it"—the prisoner made a sort of emphasis, and laid, "Do not let us talk any more about that, let us talk about some<lb/>thing else"—while we were talking, his brother came in, and said everybody had got talking out of doors about the murder, and the gentleman had a love-letter in his pocket.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I wish to read to your lordship two statements, which I pre<lb/>pared for my counsel—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—"I have very carefully perused and con<lb/>sidered the depositions against me, and I find nothing in them of a serious or weighty nature, to the truth of which I object. I wish to communicate to you all I have to say as calmly and dispassionately as it is possible, and to that and I shall not attempt the least apology or defence.—I will state to you every circumstance connected with the depositions, leaving it to you whether they be consequential or otherwise. The two grand questions are—how came my clothes to be so saturated with blood? and, how did I come into possession of the property of the deceased? The former I can answer satisfactorily to my own conscience; but nothing on earth shall cause me to divulge it, at least on this side of my trial. It were an easy matter for me to fabricate—to make a lie; but I will not do it; and to prove to you that I am so far con<lb/>scientious, I have, amongst some private letters, which I have had con<lb/>veyed to me since I came hither, a letter in which a desire is expressed to account for the manner in which my clothes were so besmeared; and the person in his devotedness to me, offers to forswear himself; but I would rather have this mysterious part of the affair remain as it is, by leaving it in the hands of my counsel. I know while doing so I endanger my own safety, but I have urgent reasons for doing so. If this gloomy affair ter<lb/>minate adversely, I die a martyr; if otherwise, by my taking a defensive coarse, I live a traitor. This sounds paradoxical, probably, to your ears, hut such is the fact, of which I excuse and pardon your disbelief until it be further evidenced to you. I will therefore quit this part of the subject with this remark—After such a painful and ignominious exposure of every<lb/>thing connected with my present and former circumstances, together with every vile and contumelious insult and misrepresentation, I can have no desire to survive the issue, be it ever so favourable to my innocence. I am ruined inevitably and irrevocably, and I am too much the Englishman to fear death, whatever form it may assume. But more to the matter. The deceased De la Rue had frequently offered his services to me in the way of pecuniary assistance. (I ought, perhaps, to have told you that I had known the deceased for nearly two years.)—It was about six months after our acquaintance that he made the first friendly overture of the kind, and it was something like two months following that I accepted it; he at that time gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was the whole of the contents of his purse, accompanied hy the words, 'Hocker, never see me again if you once ven<lb/>ture</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070060"/>
               <p>to return me this trifle; I am no friend of yours in your estimation if you view it as a loan merely.' Last August I kept away from him for a month or five weeks, on account of the shabhy condition of my apparel; he took it unconfidingly on my part, that I did not acquaint him with my embarrassed circumstances, and then goodheartedly insisted on my turning to the best advantage 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he threw at me, wishing he could 'punish me' in the same way right on for a whole day; such was the nature of our intimacy; I have had property belonging to deceased of con<lb/>siderable value; a large telescope—I should say worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., also a smaller one, and an opera-glass, microscope, &amp;c.; all of which he lent me at different times, and which I believe are to be found at his apartments now; my parents, and several others, remember to have seen them. The deceased also intrusted me with a silver watch, a silver watch-guard, and part of a diamond ring; the part which contained the diamond only re<lb/>mained. I had to dispose of them for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The deceased was anxious to make up a certain sum of money by a given time, and I un<lb/>derstood the request as a delicate wish for me to pledge the articles for him. I got them pawned at a Mr. Richardson's, Henry-street, Portland-town, for the required amount; the deceased gave me the duplicates, which I handed over to the officers when they searched my apartment. How I came with the watch and ring, which the brother of deceased identified, was in the following way:—In our engage<lb/>ments of late deceased had often been half an hour behindhand; his watch, for some time past, had performed irregularly; he frequently struck it with his walking-cane, in a momentary ill humour, which ac<lb/>counts for the seconds-pointer being gone; he gave it to me to be cleaned and repaired for him; at the same time producing his ring, which had always been too large for his little finger, to be loosened, and for the brilliant to be reset, which it needed, in consequence of an attempt to prove its genuineness, which he effected by removing the brilliant from its setting, and striking it with a hammer, having first placed it on a stone for that purpose. He had used all his influence towards putting me into a comfortable situation, but had failed until the morning of the day on which he was murdered. I forgot to state that it was on this morning that the deceased gave the watch and ring to me. On that morning he saluted me in a pleasant air, and said he brought me good news, he hoped; he then led me to think I should be a little better to do in a few days, but that he would acquaint me with more anon; he provided me at the same time with (what indeed I had for some time expected) 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold. The deceased had so often lent me money that I was ashamed to mention his name again to my parents; I therefore forged a falsehood, and repre<lb/>sented Mrs. Edwards as the donor. I was in possession of the money in the morning, and that accounts for my positively assuring my parents that I might have it by calling on Mrs. Edwards in the evening. At seven o'clock in the evening of the Friday in question I went to the Swiss Tavern, and called for rum and water. I staid there nearly three quarters of an hoar; There was another man, apparently a gentleman, in the room during the whole of the time, to whom I read portions of the day's newspaper; a candle was on the table close by me while I was reading; it was a bitterly cold night, and the fire was burning cheerfully. I stood in the front of it for some time. Had my clothes at that time been disordered and bloody, the gentleman or the waiter must hare seen it. The waiter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070061"/>
               <p>remarked at the inquest, after failing to identify me, that the person who ordered the rum and water had white hands; he meant at least that they were not bloody. If I went anywhere to wash them, why suffer my clothes to remain as they were, and have the temerity to enter a lighted public-house so near the spot? But it is not my place to write in this manner. I will proceed further. After I left the tavern I directed my path across the fields, in a line with the spot where the deed was com<lb/>mitted, for it lay in my way to the Hampstead-road, whither I was going. As I approached the Haverstock-field, singing a merry tune, a policeman ran out from the hedge, and accosted me with the words, 'Young gentle<lb/>man, sad work here, here's a dead man.' I immediately scaled the fence with him, and asked him if he was sure the man was dead? The police<lb/>man (Baldock) said there was no doubt of it. I felt the pulse of the de<lb/>ceased. It was still. He remarked that the deceased was a young man. It was an awful spectacle, and we both wept. I felt quite sick and chilly, and told the policeman I should shortly take some brandy. I proposed to him to do the same. I continued with him and the deceased, without offering to withdraw, for twenty minutes. I told Baldock that some months back I had been in the habit of crossing the adjacent field from Hampstead several times in a week at a late hour in the evening, and that I usually carried a pocket stiletto as a life-preserver, which I showed him, asking him whether the possession of such an instrument was illegal or not. He said he thought not. He remarked that the blade was bright. Bal<lb/>dock asked the time of the night. I looked at the watch which has since been produced, and told him. Sergeant Fletcher, and some four or five other policemen, then arrived with a stretcher. Almost all of them addressed me on seeing me on the spot with Baldock. I accompanied the policemen, four of whom carried the eoxpse. I asked one of them if it was necessary for me still to attend them; he said if I could give no information it would be useless. I had made an appointment to be at Portland-place that evening. I found that I had already exceeded my time through remaining so long with Baldock. I left them with the corpse when I had got as far as Church-row, Hampatead, and hastened towards my destination."</p>
               <p>I subsequently made another statement, which I will read:—</p>
               <p>"I wish to explain to you, as nearly as my feelings will suffer me, the nature of my present trial, and to show you, that to attempt an extrication out of my misery, by a full disclosure of everything connected with this sad affair, would be futile and fiendish. About a year ago I courted a young lady at Hampstead, whose parents were highly genteel and respectable. I felt a great attachment to her; we met and loved in secret. I introduced myself to her parents shortly after my acquaintance with her. She was a beautiful girl, and I felt that I should be proud to introduce her to the man whom I looked upon as my very best friend. At length I found an oppor<lb/>tunity of doing so. The parents of the girl, hearing that I had such a friend as De la Rue, invited us both to see them. I had represented De la Rue as a man of property, and in every sense of the word a gentleman. We fre<lb/>quently afterwards visited the family together. What he lacked in manner and address was compensated for by his condition in life, which was so much more favourable than mine. De la Rue betrayed me, and at length, after a long interview with the father, he refused me as a suitor to his daughter. Henceforth De la Rue was the acknowledged lover, though discouraged by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070062"/>
               <p>the girl's indifference towards him. But time and assiduity accomplish everything; he won her affections at last, and proved the genuineness of his heart to me and the girl by seducing her! Yes, such a villain was the man who, though dead, I abhor; and now comes the catastrophe. A short period elapsed, and the parents suspected, by the girl's tears and De la Rue's rude withdrawal, that all was not right, and subsequently the secret was divulged. Oh, picture to yourself the distraction of the parents of an only daughter in such a condition, and the thirst tor revenge of an only brother who had been married honourably but five weeks. Revenge was the only thing that had any charms for him, and we all determined to have it, for I was dishonoured with the rest. They knew I could forge a lady's hand<lb/>writing. I penned the note which was found on deceased's person, and sent it by a young woman whom De la Rue knew. He attended to the as<lb/>signation, and was on the spot where he had effected the ruin of an innocent creature, and where he met his fate. I and the brother accompanied each other till we came to Haverstock-field, when we separated, he to the fatal spot and I to the Swiss Tavern, which we appointed our rendezvous, but not until I had waited for some time. I myself distinctly heard the cry of'Murder.' I then knew the scene had commenced, but neither the brother nor I had any presage or thought of the issue. After waiting some time for him at the tavern, I hastened to Haverstock-field. This is the explanation of my anxiety to feel the pulse of the deceased, and my shedding tears when I witnessed the result of that revenge which had not death for its object, but serious mutilation. I hurried to the house of the perpetrator, who had flown there for refuge. I then took the whole upon myself, as I had been the principal cause of the tragedy. I immediately rushed from the house and sought a slaughter-house in Hampstead, and disfigured my clothes in a pool of blood which I found handy. You see, sir, I cannot account for the bloody state of my clothes without giving a reason for making them so—here is the difficulty. O God! I could pass through the impending ordeal in unison with my wishes. I have mentioned no names to you; and oh, did you but see the state of my mind! I cannot prove that I was not on the spot at the time of action, unless I, to save myself who am innocent, bring to justice those who, as far as intention was concerned, are equally so. Am I sure that by such a course I should be free from imputation! And if they should turn their backs upon me—which it is in their power to do—what then would become of me? See how I am surrounded by dif<lb/>ficulties! I will not say anything more to acquit myself—that is at the best only dubious, and calculated to involve others in addition to myself—I can<lb/>not say more—my mind is almost bewildered."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in a mercantile house, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. On the 28th of Feb., about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going home from the City—I had been drinking somewhat freely. I remember reaching Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury—I went into the Blue Boar there, and called for a glass of gin and water—whilst I was standing at the bar, Darby came in, and asked me if I wanted a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I declined it—he still wanted me to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and was very importunate with me to have one—I do not remember his having any of my gin and water, or his bringing in any other person—I cannot recollect how long I was in the house—I remember coming out of the Blue Boar, and going to the Blue Posts, at the corner of Hanway-street and Tottenham Court-road—I was followed by Darby, who still wished me to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I do not remember seeing any second man before I got to the Blue Posts—I left the Blue Posts, and went straight along in the direction of Crown-street—I there turned up a court, for a natural purpose—after I left the Blue Potts, Darby still wanted me to have a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and he was joined by another man—I observed that before I turned up the court—whilst I was up the court I remember receiving a blow on the head—I then lost my senses entirely, until I found myself in a chemist's shop—I was taken home that night—next morning Stack was brought to my bedside in order that I might look at him—Sergeant Wells asked me if I could identify him as the man who was drinking with me on the previous night; and whilst I was looking at him very earnestly, he said, "I did not strike the blow."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you quite sure Wells did not ask whether you could identify him as the man who struck the blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not say that—he said, "Can you identify this man as the man who drank with you in the Blue Posts;" and before I answered, while looking at him, he said, "I never struck the blow, I never saw the gentleman before I met him at the Blue Boar"—I said, "You vagabond, you are one of them, you have com<lb/>mitted yourself"—he made no answer to that—I cannot recognise Stack as being either of the men—I have no doubt about Darby—they were per<lb/>fect strangers to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The first time the second man appeared was after you had left the Blue Posts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was about half-past ten o'clock when I first entered the Blue Boar—I had been drinking freely before that—I had a glass of gin and water at the Blue Posts, as Darby asked me to treat him—I cannot recollect whether we had one each—I have no recollection of stopping and speaking with any party when I came out of the Blue Posts—I did not stop, talking to Darby, or any one, for ten minutes, or five minutes, or for any time—I do not recollect stopping—I can take on myself to say I did not stop—after leaving the Blue Posts I went immediately over to Crown-street—I did not go to another public-house opposite, to my recollection—I cannot undertake to say I did not—I had been drinking freely, and might not recollect it—this court in Crown-street was not in my way home, but I had been accustomed to go that way formerly, and it was very natural for me to go that way, to avoid High-street, St. Giles, which is not a respect<lb/>able neighbourhood—that was when I lived in the same place—it was my intention to turn down Sutton-street, but I went into George-yard, which is, I suppose, not more than a dozen yards beyond Sutton-street—I never remember seeing George-yard before—I have seen it since—it is a broad</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070065"/>
               <p>entrance from Crown-street, not very broad—it is not quite so broad as Crown-street—I turned on the right side of the entrance—I went down, I should say, about three, four, or five yards—there is a stable door on that side, and some wagons at the extremity of the yard, but not near the entrance—I examined it about a week ago, in the middle of the day—at the opposite corner to where I was there is a gin palace—I cannot recol<lb/>lect whether it extends considerably below where I laid—I do not know whether there is a fire-station at the lower part of the yard—I only examined it in a casual way—I observed a projection on the side where I was supposed to have laid—it is a round pipe—I observed's grating before I came to the pipe, a little below the surface—the surface of the yard is all even, quite as even as Oxford-street, I should say, except this small grating, which is an interruption to it—to the best of my recollection, the grating is about half-a-dozen yards from the entrance of the yard—I cannot say positively whether I observed a sharp ring round the pipe, about two feet from the ground—I had no ap<lb/>pointment to go to Hendon, or anywhere, next day—I do not recollect speaking to Darby about meeting me next morning with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I will not swear I did not speak to him about a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> nor that I did not treat him to a glass of rum and water at a public-house, after leaving the Blue Posts—there is a public-house at the opposite corner, just as you turn down Crown-street—I think it was with half-a-crown that I paid for the glass of gin and water at the Blue Boar.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you a distinct recollection of having received a blow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I cannot say whether at the time I received it I was standing or not—I cannot recollect whether I unbuttoned my clothes when I turned up the gateway—the only recollection I have is of receiving a violent blow while I was up there—I have no recollection in what position I was at the moment it was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Cannot you recollect whether you were looking down the gateway or towards the wall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only recollection I have was the sense of very acute pain on the head from the blow—I do not recollect going up there—I suppose I went up there for a natural purpose—I have no dis<lb/>tinct recollection of any thing after I left the Blue Posts till I was at the surgeon's shop, except having received the blow—I remember the fact of the blow on my head—I do not remember how I fell, whether I fell or not, or whether I was struck after I fell.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Blue Boar in Great Russell-street—Mr. Green came into my house on the 28th Feb., about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—he called for some gin and water—whilst serving him I heard the noise as of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopping at the door—it came up not more than a minute after Mr. Green came in—on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopping Darby the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man came into the house—I did not then perceive that Mr. Green was labouring under the effects of liquor—Darby looked in Mr. Green's face and laughed rudely—he persevered in laughing—at last he touched his</p>

               <p>hand to his hat, and said something to Mr. Green which I did not hear—in consequence of this conduct I paid rather particular attention to him—I thought it looked rather strange—Mr. Greeen offered him his glass to drink—he then asked if he might not let his mate drink, and he called Stack from the other door which opens into Caroline-street—he called him by some Christian name, but I cannot recollect what—upon that Stack came in and drank—the glass was then given back to Mr. Green, he put it to his lips, gave it back to Darby, and went out of the house—Darby then said to Stack, "Here, catch hold," he gave him the glass, and followed Mr. Green quickly—Stack emptied the glass, and followed quickly after Darby—I recollect their persons—Mr. Green paid me for bis liquor with a half-crown, and I gave him change—I cannot say whether either of the prisoners were present at the time he pulled out the money—it was paid for just as I gave it to him—I think I was giving Mr. Green the change when Darby came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pot-boy at the Blue Posts public-house, in Tottenham Court-road. On the 28th of Feb., about half-past eleven o'clock at night, Mr. Green came there in front of the bar—there is a tap-room which lies backwards towards Hanway-street—about the time Mr. Green was at the bar, Stack was in the tap-room—Darby was with Mr. Green at the bar, drinking gin and water—I knew the prisoners before by their using the house—they are <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> men—they generally came into the tap-room together, and were acquainted with each other—on that day Darby had been driving Stack's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—they were at our house together about twelve o'clock in the day—Stack said he would go out to the bar, to see if his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was on the rank, and get his money—I do not know who was driving the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the day, but Darby drove it at night—whilst Mr. Green and Darby were drinking at the bar, Stack came out of the tap-room to the bar, and said he would go out for a cigar—he asked Darby for his money, Darby would not give it to him, but said, "Will you have a drop of gin and water with us? "which he did—I was shutting up the house, and Mr. Green called for another fourpennyworth of gin and water—they had two fourpennyworths altogether—Stack had some of it, and Darby also—I shut up the house, and about five minutes after twelve, I let Mr. Green out—I opened the door for him—he was sensible enough to know where he was, and what he was about—I could see that he had been drinking—there are two doors to our house—Mr. Green went out at the Hanway-street door—Darby</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070067"/>
               <p>went out directly after—Stack remained at the bar—in about ten minutes somebody came in for some gin, and I saw Mr. Green and Darby standing on the opposite side of Hanway-street, talking—it is a very narrow-street—Stack was in the bar at that time—about five minutes after that, Stack went out—when Mr. Green paid for the last fourpennyworth of gin and water he pulled out some money—I did not see how much he had, but if I am not mistaken, I saw a sovereign in his hand among the silver—the prisoners were there then, and had an opportunity of seeing that—he had more than enough to pay for the gin and water—I saw him put it into his pocket after paying.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Stack was in the tap-room when Darby and Mr. Green came into the bar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he came into the tap-room about eleven o'clock and stopped there—I should say he had been in about half an hour before Darby and Mr. Green came in—I did not serve him with anything to drink, but I saw him in the tap-room—when I let Stack out, Darby and Mr. Green were gone from the other side of the way—I let about three other persons out with Stack, and closed the house—Mr. Green gave the barmaid a shilling for the first glass of gin and water—she is not here—I am sure I saw gold in his hand, and I believe it was a sovereign.</p>

I was on duty on the 28th of Feb., in Crown-st., St. Giles, about half-past twelve, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> standing at the end of George-yard, in Crown-street—George-yard is about ten yards wide—it is a carriage-way, and there is a foot-pavement on both sides—it is no thoroughfare—it leads to stables and buildings of that sort—there is a gin-shop at the left-hand corner, as you go down the court, and stables, and a fire-engine house on the right side—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was standing right opposite George-yard, about the centre, with the horse's head towards me—I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070068"/>
               <p>coming up towards Oxford-street—Darby was sitting on the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I came in sight of him, I heard him call out, very quick and sharp, "Here, here, here's the <hi rend="italic">Bobby!</hi>"—they call the police <hi rend="italic">Bobbies</hi>—I had my uniform on—he turned his head towards George-yard, as if speak<lb/>ing to some person up the yard, and I immediately saw Stack run out of George-yard, and spring on to the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, with a whip in his hand—I could not say exactly what kind of whip it was—he had it in his right hand—the thong part was before him, and the butt-end behind him—he was holding it near the middle—he took the reins from Darby, (I did not know Darby at that time,) and attempted to drive away—he started the horse, turned it round, and was driving it furiously away, whipping his horse, during the time I was after him, down Crown-street, towards Tottenham Court-road—I followed and overtook the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, at the end of Sutton-street, which is about fifty yards from George-yard—I there stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and found the two prisoners on it—I am quite sure they are the men—Stack was driving—I asked Stack what was the matter, as he was driving away in such a furious manner—he said, "Nothing at all"—I asked him again, and he made no answer—I then asked him to show me his badge—he took it out from underneath his coat, and showed it to me, without making any difficulty—I saw his number, and took the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and seeing no one inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I told him he might go—he said, "You b----and so can you"—he then drove on towards Tottenham Court-road—I immediately returned to George-yard, and there found Mr. Green, lying down on his side, with his hat off, and a pool of blood under his head—I noticed a wound in his head, from which the blood was proceeding very fast—he was very insensible—I procured some assistance, and had him taken to Mr. Kenny's, a surgeon, in the neighbourhood, where his wound was examined—he was nearly ten minutes, after he got to Mr. Kenny's, before he came to his senses, sufficiently to tell me where he lived—I then went home with him—he had one sovereign, four shil<lb/>lings, sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and one penny in his pocket—I noticed blood three yards before I came to the pool under his head—he was lying with his head towards the buildings down the court, and his feet outwards to<lb/>wards the carriage-road—I noticed blood about three yards from his feet, towards Crown-street—I suppose he must have gone or staggered those three yards, whilst he was bleeding—on the right-hand side of the court is a plain brick-wall—his head was about a foot and a half from the wall—I noticed no blood whatever near or on the wall, nor any pipe handy—there is a rain-water pipe near the top, but that is ten yards from where Mr. Green was found, ten yards further up the court from the street—it is a round pipe, that comes down by the engine-house—I did not notice any projection of any kind from the wall near where Mr. Green was found, or in any part of the line marked by the blood—there ia no projection on the ground at that part—his head was on a flat paving-stone, two feet square, as plane as a deal board—there is not the least unerenness in the surface.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant C</hi> 1.) In consequence of information I received, I looked after the prisoners—Stack lives at No. 3, Petty's-place, or court—I went and found him there in bed, about half-past nine on Saturday morning, the 1st of March—I asked his name, which he told me, and also the number of his badge—I had seen him driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> be<lb/>fore, but I did not know him by name—I asked whether he was at Crown-street last night with his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said he was, he had followed a gentle<lb/>man down Crown-street to know what time he was to fetch him in the morning, and that there he had lost sight of him, and had not seen him since—I told him he must dress himself and go with me—I took him into custody, and conveyed him to Mr. Green's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bachelor of medicine, and a general practi<lb/>tioner, and live in High-street, St. Giles's. Mr. Green was brought to my house early in the morning of the 1st of March by the two policemen—he was bleeding profusely, and completely insensible)—I immediately per<lb/>ceived a wound on the side of the head—I examined it and probed it—the bone was denuded, but did not appear to me to be injured—it was not fractured—it seemed to have been caused by some blunt inttrtmeot having struck it—it was partially contused, but was completely divided in the centre—the edges were partially jagged—it was a contused and lacerated wound, such as might be caused by a hard blow from a blunt instrument—it was a very severe blow—the butt end of a whip might have produced it—the wound was perpendicular—I eould not positively say in what way the instrument struck the head—I think a similar wound might have been received by a fall, if he had fallen against a sharp projection—I do not think a fall on a smooth paving-stone could have caused it—I have not seen the spot where this occurred—I attended Mr. Green for about a week afterwards.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070072"/>
               <p>on the same side the wound would have been in a different position—I think such a blow could be produced by a man striking him while standing, and I should say the man stood in front of him, and then struck him directly downwards—I do not think a fall against an ordinary water-pipe would have produced such a wound.</p>

I saw a grey mare at Miss Savage's stable, in August, 1843—I had made an offer for it—on the Friday before the prisoner went away he came to me, at four or five o'clock in the afternoon, on the mare, and said he had taken the mare to Tattersall's, and the would not take her in—next morning (Saturday) he came, about ten o'clock, or soon after—he did not bring the mare then, but said she was to be sold without reserve, and asked me the most I would give for her—I said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I could have her for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I would not give any more I said I should want a warranty—he went away, came back in three quarters of an hour, and said he would go to Mr. Beavan's office, and see if I could have the mare or not—he came back with a paper in his hand, and said I was to have it at the price, and he had brought a receipt for the money—I was busy at the time, and told him I would come over to Miss Savage's yard about it in the afternoon, when I was more at leisure—he went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a livery-stable keeper, in Gray's Inn-lane. On Friday, the 1st of Sept., 1843, about the middle of the day, or a little later, the prisoner came to my yard with a grey mare—he proposed to sell her to me—he asked 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him that was more than could give, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was as much as I could give—he said 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been offered—I told him to take it, and let the parties have it—he came again next day, about two or three o'clock, with the mare, and asked what I would give him if he got me the mare for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I agreed to give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for himself—he told me she would be warranted sound, and quiet in harness—he left me to get it—he returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, with this receipt written, all but the warranty—I objected to take it without the warranty being inserted in the receipt—he was gone about twenty minutes again, and brought it back with the warranty in it, as it is now, signed, "Clark"—he said Clark was Mr. Beavan's confidential clerk, and that Mr. Beavan was either ill or out of town—I paid him 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he staid there while I put the mare in harness, and then left—on the following Monday the police broke open my stable door, and took the mare away—the mare was seen by Mr. Beavan while the police were there.</p>

On Friday night, the 28th of March, about eight o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the door, and gave me a note to take to my mas<lb/>ter, and I was to bring him an answer—I took it to my master, and he told me to send the boy up—I saw no more of him until about twenty minutes after, when he knocked at the door again—(I had not seen him go out)—he asked me for liberty to stop in the passage until his master came—I told him I would go up and ask my master, which I did, and he told me to let him stop for a while—he stopped for about half an hour—as I was going up stairs with a tray and some tea things, the prisoner said to me, "I don't suppose my master will come to-night, it is getting rather late"—I said, "I dare say not, it is getting on for ten o'clock"—he stood np, and as I went out of the passage I heard him open the street door and bang it, as I thought, after him, but whether he went out or not I cannot tell—about ten minutes before six o'clock in the morning, as I was in my bed-room, I thought I heard footsteps on the stairs—I went out, and thought I heard the chain drop from the street door—I hurried down stairs at quick as I could, and saw the prisoner on the step at the door, putting on my master's boots—he had a bundle, in which I had seen a coat of my master's—another coat laid by it—I took it up, and said to the prisoner, "What brought you here at this early hour in the morning?"—he said he came about his master's business—I said, "No, I think you are about my master's business"—with that he took the bundle and ran into the street—I ran after him, and hallooed, "Thief, thief!" as quick as I could, till I lost sight of him—he let the bundle drop in the street—I afterwards picked it up—it contained the spoons, handkerchief, boots, and ladles, stated, which are my master's.</p>

The desk I only received on Sunday morning the 2nd of March; I had never opened it while it was in my possession; I received it from a person named Har<lb/>rington, with whom I have been acquainted about six years; she told me it belonged to her brother, who was at Yarmouth, and asked me if I would take charge of it for a few days till her brother's return, which I contented to do, not knowing it was stolen; the articles produced by the pawn<lb/>broker, Alton, were pledged by me for the same person; had I known they were stolen property, I should not have taken them to a place where I have been in the habit of going for at least twelve months past, and given my own name and address at the time I pledged them; the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes sworn to by Mrs. Brown were brought to me by Louisa Harrington; she told me they were her own property, and that she lived at Lambeth; she asked me to change them for her on the 6th of Feb. which not being convenient for me at the time, I told her I could give her eight pounds in money, which I had by me at that time of my own; she accepted that, and I gave her the other two pounds after I changed the notes; the twenty pound notes were my own property, most part of which was left me by a relation some time since; the remainder was my own savings; I took it out of a savings' bank at Chelmsford in Essex, about nine months ago; the five pound notes, also the money which I gave up at the station-house, I received in change of one of my own notes; the head of the diamond ring was given to me by the person Louisa Harrington; I had no knowledge of the value of it, or that it had been stolen, or I should not have had it in my possession upwards of a month after the stated time of the robbery taking place. I wish to state that I only lived in Mrs. Brown's service six weeks, and that is nearly four years since; and during that time I never saw any of the things I pledged for Louisa Harrington. I hope you will take in consideration the extreme improbability of my keeping stolen pro<lb/>perty in my possession upwards of a month, and continuing in the same lodgings, and going about the neighbourhood at all times of the day, bad I been aware the same was the proceeds of a robbery committed at a house where I had formerly lived, and was so well known.

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in George-street, Stepney.

                  </hi>. I have been for fifteen or sixteen years an officer in her Majesty's Customs; I was formerly a tide-waiter, and am now a gauger, which is a higher situation; I live in Greenwood-street, Mile-end-road; I know the prisoner. On Saturday, the 15th of March, he called at my lodgings between four and five o'clock—I was not then at home—I saw him between seven and eight—he said he was employed as a private watchman by the London Dock Company, to glean what information he could for them, and if I would not give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would prefer a charge against me, and he said, "Sure, you are not going to lose 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him what charge he could prefer against me—he said, "Ri<lb/>ley, the Dock Company's watchman, has heard that I gave you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give Birch for employing me in the dock"—I said, "And have you done so?"—he said, "No, I have not, but they are anxious to prefer a charge against you; they want me to support it, but I will not if you will give me what I ask you; but if you don't, I will"—in consequence of this I subse<lb/>quently communicated with Mr. Grayson, a friend of mine, and on the 17th of March I gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

               <p>prisoner to my lodgings—I met him at Fleming's beershop—I sent for him, hearing he had called twice at my place on Wednesday, the 12th—Fleming keeps a beer-shop in the New-road, and also works in the docks—I called on him the same evening, and asked him if he knew the prisoner—he said yes—I said, "He has been in the habit of calling at my place, I should like to see him, for I want to know what be wants there; I shall feel obliged if you will tell him to meet me here to-morrow, for I should like to know what brings him to my lodgings so often"—the prisoner met me at Fle<lb/>ming's in consequence of that message—I sent no other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before this, had you not received a charge from the Custom-house of receiving bribes or money to get people employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that I had—there was a charge made against Birch, and the papers were referred to me, and I reported on them—I am not aware that there is a charge hanging over me at the present moment—I have never received a charge from the Custom-house, nothing more than having to report on Birch—that is all I have heard of it since, and that is more than a month ago—I am not aware that I have any charge to answer—I do not know that there is a charge hanging over me of receiving money to get labourers employment—I am not required to give any explanation to the Custom-house—the explanation that was required I gave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that is all the explanation required of you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is better known to the Board of Customs; I do not know their intention—I swear that is all the explanation that has been required of me—on my oath, I did not send to Lee by Fleming to help me to get out of the transaction with Birch—I swear nothing of the sort passed—I simply sent to him to know what brought him to my place so often—Fleming works in the docks—I never had any money from him—I do not know that Birch had—I will swear that—I have not received half-a-crawn a week, or any money, from Mahoney and Johnson, as labourers for the London Dock—I went to Boulogne last year—I did not leave directions with Mrs. Foster to receive half-a-crown a week from labourers that came—I swear that, and that I never received any money from Mrs. Foster on account of labourers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you not told Mrs. Harms, your landlady, a night or two previous to this, that if Lee came, he was to wait for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Such a thing might occur, but I have no recollection of it—if I did, it was with the same view that I sent Fleming to inquire what brought him so often—I never had any conversation with Rafferty about what Lee could state either to the Dock Company or the Customs, or about his not coming forward to make any statement against me—I have no recollection of it—I did not know that Lee had been discharged from the London Dock—I have heard it from Mr. Chandler—I did not know he had been discharged some days before this Saturday—I swear I did not know it before that Saturday—I know Michael Riley, a watchman in the London Dock—I met him one day in the Strand, with Lee and Fitz<lb/>gerald—I did not go with them or after them to Mr. Fitzgerald's, No. 35, Arundel-street, that I swear—I met them standing at the corner of Arundel-street, and we had a few words there—on my oath I did not know that Lee and Riley were going to Arundel-street about this inquiry—I met them quite by accident—I did not know before that Lee had stated to Mr. Chandler that he had not given me any money—I swear solemnly that Lee never gave me any money.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not walk along the Strand together? As I was coming back to duty—Riley and Lee were coming down towards the Dock, and we walked part of the way together, by mere accident—I be<lb/>lieve Birch's taking money to get the labourers employment was the sub<lb/>ject of conversation—I believe we did speak of it—Riley never said a syllable to me about Lee's being discharged for not telling the truth about me, nor did he ever say I might be forgiven everything but arresting Lee in the vile way I had done—I swear that—I will tell you what he did say, I chanced to meet him at the Dock-gate, and he said, "That Lee is a complete scoundrel; and if you summon me I will prove it; he told me he never gave you any money; I blame you very much for arresting him, for I would kick his----"—I did not say to Riley, "God knows, the money I got I never put into my own pocket."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not know, before you gave the prisoner into custody, that he had talked about going to speak to Mr. Chandler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was one of the threats he made use of in order to get the money—since he first asked me for the money that was the mainspring on which he founded his demand—I never said anything about making compensation to Lee for losing his place, on account of his telling a falsehood for me—that I swear, and for the best of all reasons, for I never knew that he did lose his place—he said on one occasion, that if he got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would get a licence as a hawker—he said he could not afford to lose a guinea a-week—I do not know that he was accused of not telling the truth with regard to myself—I swear I never had any communication with him as to what he was to state to Mr. Chandler with regard to me—I treated him to nothing on the Monday night, when I gave him into custody, but a cup of tea—when he came on Saturday, I asked him to come over with me to the Borough, which he did—that was for the purpose of seeing Mr. Grayson—I swear I did not call him my counsellor—I had no friend nearer that I could have spoken to about this—we went to a public-house—Grayson is a merchant in Mint-street, Borough—he retails potatoes and coals—he is not a chandler or green-grocer—he has a wholesale business besides at the water-side, under the firm of Harvey and Grayson—his wife is a relation of mine—I know he was discharged from the Customs—he was not exchequered that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not give the prisoner into custody at that time, for trying to extort money from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought he would be intimidated by the fact of calling in a policeman, and that it would deter him from ever asking me for money again, but he came again—I did not send for Mrs. Murphy to come and meet the prisoner—Mrs. Murphy and her daughter or son called at my house on the Monday—I am not aware that Mrs. Murphy talked to the prisoner about not giving any evidence against me—on my oath she was not sent for for that very purpose—I was not really afraid that I should lose my situation, if he made any statement against me—I have no fear of it now—I gave him the money to catch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever sent Grayson to Mrs. Foster since this indictment has been pending? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard that Mrs. Foster had made a very false state<lb/>ment about me; and not being on terms with her, on account of refusing to lend her money, I commissioned him to go and see if she did state what I had heard she did—I did not send him to tell her not to come here, or not to give evidence before the Customs—I have never asked Lee, since the disturbance with the Dock Company and Birch, whe<lb/>ther</p>

               <p>he could write a good hand, nor said that I could give him some work to do as a grocer in his own line—I never said, in the presence of other parties, "Lee, if you can write well, I will get you employment as a grocer; it will be better for you than labouring work"—I have no recollection of anything of the kind; nor do I know a grocer in London; nor did I add, "Come to my lodging to-morrow (Thursday)—I have something very particular to say to you"—since these charges have been made by the Dock Company, I have never talked to Lee about getting him employment, as something better than a labouring man—a Thomas Fitzgerald is my security, but not the Fitzgerald alluded to here.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say that the mode in which you should have treated Lee would be by kicking him in a certain part? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, nothing of the sort—I never said a word about kicking him, nor that he was a great scoundrel or great rogue—I never said he was a great liar, no<lb/>thing of the kind, nor that he had told a lie—since then I have said so—several persons had said that O'Connor had got money from them—I went up to a man named Fitzgerald in Arundel-street—he is a very slight acquain<lb/>tance of mine—I visited him at the time of inquiring into these matters—I have not given him my evidence in the case—he knew principally what I had to say—I never told him anything that I was going to say here to-day, but the was in possession of everything I knew—I was subpoenaed by that party—he and I did not talk of what I was to say here—Fitzgerald was listening to the admissions that O'Connor made—he was present when this conversation was going on—Fitzgerald brought me the subpoena—I have known him, I suppose, between nine and twelve months—I have not seen him here to-day or about the Court—I did not see him here yesterday—I have not seen him for these two days—I was subpoenaed, I think on Friday, in the London Dock, not by Fitzgerald but by the prisoner's brother—I did not go and see Fitzgerald afterwards—I have not seen Fitzgerald be<lb/>tween Friday and to-day—I have not seen him within these six days I believe—I last saw him at his own house in Arundel-street—I called on him to make a little inquiry about this business, to see how things were going on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had you to do with how things were going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I was employed to inquire into the matter altogether, by my superiors, not about this charge, but about the money matters—I was employed by Mr. Clements, and I went to Fitzgerald to make inquiries into that point—I do not know much about his character—I was sent to Fitzgerald by Cle<lb/>ments—I swear that, not on that day—I went that day on my own business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was your own business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, the fact of the matter is this, I considered that the prisoner was badly treated and I went to Fitz<lb/>gerald to see what I could do for him—I did not swear just now that I called on him about the money business that day—I have been there different days—the last day I called I called on my own account—I called on the Dock' business previously—if I said I called that day about it I made a mistake—I do not say that I did—the way that you and the other coun<lb/>cilor put questions to me is not consistent—I am sometimes called in the Docks "The fox"—I have never been on visiting terms with Fitzgerald—I have never dined or drank with him—I never drink anything—I have</p>

               <p>been in his company when he has been drinking, more than once or twice—the first time I know Fitzgerald he was working in the Docks, and I have seen him scores of times with Mr. O'Connor—I do not know whether it was O'Connor that introduced me—I have not known Lee very long—I have seen Cavanagh and Fitzgerald together—I know where Fitzgerald lives well.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There was an inquiry going on about certain persons taking money from labourers to get them employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was with others making inquiries about that—I did so under the sanction of my superiors—among other persons, I went to Fitzgerald—that was for the purpose of following out the inquiry—I was particularly desired to in<lb/>quire what money had been paid to these parties, and by whom—I found that out by Fitzgerald—Lee was discharged for telling lies about O'Connor, for not telling the truth about him—he was examined in consequence of what I learned from Fitzgerald.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 24th of March, I was at the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoners leave his premises about half-past eleven o'clock, with a wagon drawn by three horses, and two loads of barley straw—they proceeded along the road—I stopped them, and asked Whatmore what he had got—he said, "Two loads of barley straw"—I said, "What else?"—he said, "My truss of hay and my swinger"—I said, "Have you anything else?"—he said, "No"—I saw a quantity of clover-hay pushed under the load, and asked what that was—he said, "I took it for my horses"—I asked what he had got in this basket, which I saw there on the side of his wagon—he said, "I have got my <hi rend="italic">tommy</hi>" meaning his victuals—I found in it about a peck of mixed oats and barley—I asked how he came to have that—he said, "I took it for my horses"—I told him he was not allowed to bring corn away from Mr. Tilyer's premises—he said, "I took it for my horses"—I said, "I shall take you for stealing it"—he said, "You won't hurt me any more than you can help"—I said any statement he made I should make use of again—he then said, "I stole the corn out of the bin"—Dutton was close by him, and said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harefield, in Middlesex. On the 21st of March, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming from my gate with some clover hay on his back—he deals in hay, I believe—he chucked the truss up on his father's cart—I was going up in the field, and sent my wife after the prisoner, and she ordered Wright to throw the hay down—I have seen it since, and there is a sample of it here—I have no doubt that it is mine—he had no right to take it from my premises—I had not sold him any clover hay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Matthew Wood, a grocer and tea-dealer, at No. 78, Old Broad-street, in the parish of St. Benet Fink; it is his dwelling-house; he resides there. On the 11th of March, about half-past two o'clock, or twenty minutes to three, I was going up from the ground floor to the second floor—there is a door which is three or four steps from the second flight of stairs—it is always kept shut—it fastens with a latch-lock, and cannot be opened on the outside except by a key or a piece of string, which we can open it with, but no stranger could do it—the first floor is let out to Messrs. Bowers and Co.—as I was going up I found that door open—it is a public staircase to the first floor—anybody could have walked up to where the door was—it could not have been opened by me without pulling the string, nor by anybody else without a latch-key—I found this door open, to my surprise, and on going up I met the prisoner Todd coming down the stairs which lead to Mr. Wood's pri<lb/>vate apartments—there is no other way to get in or out of those apart<lb/>ments but by that door—I asked Todd what he wanted—he looked con<lb/>fused, and said, "I want a gentleman there," pointing to Mr. Bowers's office—I said, "Very well"—I took hold of his collar, and came down with him—I said, "That is Mr. Bowers's office"—he then tried to get away from me, but I kept him till Mr. Bowers and another gentleman came out and took him—I then went up, and met King at the same place—before</p>

I have been making a truss of hay"—we went on to the Bell, and he told me to give him the truss down off the wagon, which I did, and he put it into the stable at the Bell—we only stopped there while we gave the horses a mouthful of hay out of another truss—we went on to Chelsea, and there fed the horses out of the other truss, then took a load of dung, and came back—we called at the Bell again, had some drink, and fed the horses out of the other truss, the truss that was allowed for them—they never had any out of the <hi rend="italic">young one.</hi>

Early in March some goods bad been brought from a fire in Gutter-lane, to Mr. Toplis's warehouses in Water-lane—there were some woollen and cotton cloths, and some merino—I do not know Parisian lustre by the name—some of the cloths were wound on pieces of wood—on the 25th of March, between three and four o'clock, I was on my master's premises, and from what one of the servants told me I went into the loft where some of these goods were—I found the prisoner Matham there, putting them paper parcels into a sack—I asked him if he had come from Mr. Mots—he said, "Yes"—I saw him put ten parcels into the sack—after putting them in he took up some rug*—I asked him what he was going to do with them—he said he was going to take away three pieces of carpet—I told him they were dry, and were not to go—he said he would go and fetch an order for them, or something of the some sort—he then tied up the sack in which the ten parcels were—he then took six pieces of merino which were folded on boards—he put them by the side of the sack—he also took six pieces of check, which I put down as muslins—he threw the sack, the three rugs, and the other things, all down from the loft into the warehouse below—(he did not take the rugs away)—he went down; I followed, and saw him put the things into my master's truck—before he took them I desired to have a receipt—I wrote it, and be signed it—this is it: "Received, 10 brown paper parcel", 6 pieces of muslin, 6 pieces of black merino. 25th March, 1845. <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN WILLIAMS"</hi>—I saw him assume and sign this name.</p>

He came to my place and made the mould, and assisted in making the coin; he left me, promising to return in two hours, but instead of his returning some officers in disguise burst open my door, and secured me. Dunnett had not been in the room more than ten minutes; I was about having my dinner and asked him to partake with me."</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arthur-street, Chelsea—my husband keeps a tobacconist's shop about five minutes' walk from Mr. Gibbs's—on the evening of the 3rd of April Hemming came for half an ounce of the best tobacco—it came to three farthings—he put down a shilling—I took it over</p>

On the 12th of March I was at the Bridge-road leading to Mill-wall, near the West India Dock, and saw a wagon coming from Garford-street—Anderson was driving it—it was loaded with hemp—Mullinger was on the top of the load—when it came to the Bridge-road the horses were stopped, and I saw a caravan with two horses driven up by the prisoner White—when White came up, he and Mullinger had a little conversation, and then he delivered part of the load of hemp to White, in thp caravan—they then drove away—Anderson drove the wagon, and White the caravan—I followed the caravan to the Poplar toll-bar, where I saw White pay the toll—I went to the toll-man, and found to whom the caravan belonged—I then went to the premises of Curling and Co.—I knew the wagon was employed for them—I met the officer—we went to Curling's premises, and took the prisoner Mullinger.</p>

The prisoner was in our employ in Feb. last—in consequence of some<lb/>thing that occurred, the young men in our employ suggested that their boxes should be searched—I was not present when this, piece of velvet was found in the prisoner's box, but the prisoner showed it me the follow<lb/>ing morning—I asked brra if he got it at Mr. Smith's, and he decidedly said not—I took it to Mr. Smith, and saw him find the large pitce of velvet to correspond.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Swan. We lodge in Play-house-yard, in the parish of St. Luke—my husband is a brush-maker—on the 15th of Feb, I went to the Spotted Dog, in Tottenham-court-road—I had my child with me, which is now in my arms—his name is John Swan—I sat down in front of the bar—in a few minutes the prisoner cane in and sat down by the side of me—I had then drank about half of my ale—the prisoner said, "You have a baby"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "How old might it be?"—I said, "It will be three months old on Monday week"—she looked at it—I told her it was a boy—she said,'" Pretty little fellow, he don't look so old"—she then said she had a sister who lived at No. 15, London-street, who had got a very hard place, and that she was going to leave that night, that the mistress she lived under was a very severe, cross old lady, and she said would I be so kind as to call and tell her sister she was waiting for her—I told her I did not mind—we then came out of ttte Spotted Dog and walked down to London-street—she then asked me if I would have part of half a quartern of rum—I said I did not mind—we went to the Globe and called for the run, which she paid for—she poured me out a glass which I drank—she refused drinking her part, and said sfee would let it be till I came back—I then said, "I will go to your sister and deliver the message"—she said, "I will hold the baby till you come btck,"—I said, "No, I will take the baby with me, as it is such a little distance," but she put out her bands and took the child out of my arms—I went to the house to which she directed me, and inquired for the name she told me to ask for—when the gentleman came he told me I was wrong, that there was no servant going to leave that night—I came back to die public-house, and the prisoner was gone and my baby—I went directly to the station, and told the inspector—I described the prisoner and the clothes she had on, and also my baby—I saw no more of the prisoner till the 19th of March, when I was crossing from Soho to come into Crown-street, about nine o'clock at night—the prisoner was crossing to meet me—we met face to face—she stood and looked at me—I stood, I could not speak, I was so flurried—she looked at me again and then she ran—I chased her through several streets—she was exhausted with running, and I caught hold of her by her shoulder—she said, "What do you want with me?"—I said, "You are the woman that robbed me of my baby"—she straggled to get from me and said, "You wretch, you are wrong, I have got no baby"—there was a little boy standing by, about twelve years of age—I said, "My good boy, will you look for a policeman?—there were three women standing there—I said, "Women, women, for God's sake help me to hold this woman, she is the woman that robbed me of my baby a few weeks ago"—they never offered to assist me, and the prisoner struggled and got from me—she ran up a court and I saw no more of her that night—I went to the station and gave information that I had seen her—on the 21st of March I went again to the station—an officer went with me up and down the streets, and at last we went to a house in Crown-street, which I think is No. 28—I went up two pair of stairs, knocked at the room door, and asked for the name they had told me to ask for—the prisoner opened the door—she said, "There is no such person lives here; get out," and shut the door in my face—I called up the constable—he went into the room, and I went behind him—the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184504070156"/>
               <p>said to me, "You wretch, what do you want?"—I said, "My baby; you are the woman that stole it"—she said, "I have got no baby but my own"—the constable asked her if she had got a baby—she said, "Yes, on the bed"—he said, "I must look at it"—he looked at it and said to me, "Mrs. Swan, come and look if this is your baby"—I looked and knew my baby directly—I said, "My God, that is my baby! O you hussey, for robbing me of my baby"—it was this baby which I have now in my arms—the prisoner offered to strike me, but the officer stood before me—she insisted on my leaving the room—I did so, leaving the constable in the room and the baby—I saw the prisoner was such a desperate woman that I thought she would either kill me or my baby if I offered to touch it—the constable called to me and said, "Mrs. Swan, you must go down to the station and fetch another constable," which I did—they then told me to go to the station and they would bring the woman—when I got there the prisoner came and brought my baby with her—the inspector asked her where she had lain in—she told the day of the month that she left her home, and that she had lain in at Mrs. Sullivan's—they made every inquiry and found it was wrong—this was on Good Friday, and on next day my child was given up to me—I only know the child by its features—on the day I found the prisoner out, I found the bed-gown, the little shirt, and two rollers which my child had on when the prisoner took it from me—I can swear to the clothes—these are them—they have been washed since I lost them—this is the gown the prisoner had on at the time she stole the child—this gown was hanging be<lb/>hind the door in her room when she was taken—it was about half-past nine at night, on the 15th Feb., when I lost my child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of the Repository, in Barbican. On the morning of the 20th of March, I purchased four loads of meadow hay in Whitechapel market—it was to come home to Barbican—Angle was in my employ at that time—it was his duty to take the whole of the corn, hay, and straw into the granary, to count it, to measure it, and take the tickets into the counting-house—he was to count and weigh the hay—he was paid for doing so—it was his duty with respect to this hay, to see that he had thirty-six trusses in each load, and that each of those trusses was the proper weight—I have a clerk named Seers—this ticket (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) it a form we keep printed to acknowledge the receipt of articles of this kind—this A. S. on it are Seers' initials—he would issue this on the representation of Angle that Ue quantity of hay received was right, not without.</p>

                  </hi>, jun. I am the son of William Cooper, a piano-forte maker, No. 24, William-street, Hampstead-road, in the parish of St. Pan<lb/>cras—it is his dwelling-house—I reside with him—the prisoner used to come as a charwoman, and was discharged last July—after she left I missed the key of our street door—on the night of the 7th April, about a quarter past nine o'clock, my brother Thomas went out—I saw him leave the house, and am confident he shut the street door after him—I did not see him do so, but I was on the stairs and distinctly heard the door shut—it has a peculiar sound when it shuts—there is no getting in at the window, the area is wide—the windows were all down, and I believe fastened—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I was in the kitchen and distinctly heard a key put in the street door, the door opened, and then shut to—after that I heard a noise in the parlour like a person tumbling over the chain—I came up from the kitchen and went into the passage with a light—I listened for a minute, then went to open the door, and it was put to directly—in half a minute it opened and the prisoner came out with the tea-chest on her arm—I pushed her back into the parlonr, locked the door, and locked her in—I fetched a constable and she was taken—when I went in, the tea-chest was in its usual place on the sideboard—when I returned from the station in about twenty minutes, I examined and found the books and papers and ink-stand thrown on the sofa, and the ink spilled on the sofa, and the table-cover all bundled up in a heap on the table—under the sofa I saw the policeman find this key—it is the key of the street door which we had lost—I know it by its being bro<lb/>ken—this tea-chest and sugar-basin are mine, the tongs are my father's.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Enfield, and am in the habit of sending hay to Whitechapel-market—Taylor, Morrell, and Shepherd were carmen of mine. On the 20th of March I sent by them several carts to London loaded with hay—they started about two o'clock in the morning—Taylor took a load of clover hay—Morrell had a load of cinqfoil—Shep<lb/>herd and James Ovenall had each a load of clover bay—I went up to Whitechapel-market, and got there a little before nine o'clock—I found the carts all there, and apparently all rightly loaded, with thirty-six trusses in</p>

               <p>each load—this ticket was given me when I got there—it is a ticket of Mr. Sweeting's, my hay salesman, and indicates that Mr. Dixon, of Bar<lb/>bican, had bought three loads of clover and one of cinqfoil—I gave this ticket to Taylor to take there, and it was his duty to bring me back a counter ticket, acknowledging the receipt of the hay at Mr. Dixon's—I then sent off the four loads referred to in this ticket to go to Mr. Dixon's, and they went out of the market together—I think Taylor's cart went first, but I am not quite certain—it was their duty to go directly to Mr. Dixon's—Brick-lane would be their way to go if they went by Spitalfields church—Banks's shop is in Brick-lane, but it is some distance beyond where they ought to have turned to go by Spitalfields church—his shop is out of their way—some information reached me, and I went to Banks's shop, about ten o'clock or a few minutes after—I found one of my carts which had the load of cinqfoil, which Morrell had the charge of, standing at Banks's side door, and Banks was standing by the tide, of it—directly Banks saw me he made away into his shop—I went up to Morrell, and asked him what he wanted with his cart there—he looked down on the ground, and said they had been leaving a truss of hay a-piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Forest-gate, in Essex. I had a grey mare on the forest on the 5th of April—I saw her last at two o'clock that day—she is a very quiet mare—I went to look for her in the evening, finding she did not come home at her usual time, and at half-past ten I found her at the station—she was dose against Forest-gate, in West Ham parish, on the Wanstead-flats.</p>

I live at Walworth, a quarter of a mile from Mr. Harris—on Saturday night, the 8th of March, from a quarter to half-past eight, I saw both the prisoners together, nearly opposite Harris's house—Power went up against the door and came away from it again—I stopped for ten minutes watching them, and they came by me, just before I got to them, Power said to Abbott, "It is no use stopping here any longest is too late now, they won't come yet awhile"—I went into the Rose pub<lb/>lic-house, and spoke to a young man, then came out, and went up George-street to see for a policeman—I saw the prisoners standing under the win<lb/>dow of the Rose—I could not find a policeman—I came back, went into the Rose, and they were over by a shop window—they came acoss again, and stood under the Rose window—I met Davis, a policeman, and told him what I had seen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live at No. 12, Nelson's<lb/>place, Locksfields. The prisoner is married to my niece—he is a shoe<lb/>maker, and lodged with me up to Thursday, the 27th of March—hs came home about a quarter to two o'clock that day—I think he was in liquor—I went down to his room and asked if he had any rent for me—he owed me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. rent—he said he had none for me—I said it was not likely that he would have any, for he had been out three days previous, and had not been at work, he had been losing his time so, idling about—I told him I would forgive him the rent be owed me if he would go out of my place—he said I could not afford to lose it, and he should not go until he had paid me—I said I thought I was authorised to put his things outside the door—he said he knew the law as well as me, I must not put them out, if I did I should find him a different man to what he was (he had been a very quiet well conducted man before) my wife was there, and portion of his furniture and put it out at the door—I think it was a child's chair, and another chair—when she came in again he went over towards her—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, do not strike my wife"—he had not lifted his hand to strike her at that moment, but I thought he was about to do so—I cannot say whether I pushed a table up against him, or whether I did not, or whether he thought I intended to strike him, but he took up a hammer</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Girling. I remember the prisoner coming home on Thursday—he has two children—the eldest little girl was in my room when he came home—he spoke from one room to the other to the child, and asked her what business she had with me—I said I took her in out of good nature, as he had left her with a fire in the room—I afterwards went into the room when my husband was there—I began to remove a chair or two from the room—when I came back, I laid my hand on a tea-board—I did not see the prisoner come towards me, but I heard my husband say, "Don't strike my wife!"—I saw my husband standing still—the prisoner took up a hammer, and struck him one blow—I screamed and threw my arms round my husband's neck—he seemed to reel, and put his hand to his head—he did not fall—the prisoner stood still—I took up a little chair, and tried to strike him with it—he threw up the window, and told the people outside what rent he owed—he remained abont the place a little while, and then went away—he said he would not strike me—I could not see whether my husband's head bled, for my sight seemed to leave me, I was so frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. Girling came to me about two o'clock in the afternoon—he had two incised wounds in the head, over the left eye—the sharp edge of this hammer might have inflicted them—a branch of the temporal artery was severed by it, and a considerable quantity of blood lost—he has been under my care ever since, and is not well yet—I think he will do well—it is impossible to say whether he may not suffer permanently from it—the wound is of that character that weeks and months might elapse before any symptom might present itself—I do not think him out of danger—when before the Magistrate, I called it a dangerous wound—it must have been inflicted by two blows, for the upper wound is longitudinal, and the other transverse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Grand Surrey Canal Company. On the 6th of March my attention was called to the deals—there ought to have been forty-six—I found by the book there were forty<lb/>three deficient—I did not make the entry in the book, but I saw the deals after they were entered, and I had sold several parcels from that pile—there was a pile of 147, and fifty-five and forty-fix had been delivered—the rest, which had been sold to Mr. Scarf, remained—I saw them safe on the 4th of March, and missed forty-three of them on the 6th—I then went to look at sixteen which I had sold to Mr. Hinton, and out of tkem I missed four<lb/>teen—I missed in all fifty-seven planks and forty-three deals, eighty-four pieces in all—I went to Archer's Wharf, and saw a punt lying there, which I had seen the day before four or five ships dowa, and the eighty-three pieces of wood were on the brick-wall—they were the pieces I had seen safe on the premises of the Canal Company on the Tuesday before—I saw the prisoner shortly after, on Mr. Archer's wharf in custody—I said I was sorry to see him there—he said, "I only hired the punt for Johnson"—I knew the prisoner—I cannot tell whether he was employed on the water.</p>
