               <p>Whit Monday about 11.30 I went to bed, and, after I had been there some little time, I heard someone come out next door. My window was up about three or four inches. I heard them come out next door and call out "Police!" and "Murder!" I did not get out of bed then, but when she said "Is there no kind neighbour will get up and fetch a policeman," I got out of bed and lifted the window up and saw the woman in a stooping position, but I did not see her bleeding. As I opened the window she said, "I am streaming with blood"—after people began to run in all directions I slid down the window, and with that I heard her call out most fearfully against her husband for ill-using her and injuring her, and after that she turned on to the landlord, and she said "He has only got one lung, and I will tear that out of him," and after that I sat in my room till past 1 o'clock and she went on most dreadfully, which my witnesses will prove. Mr. Paget gave me in charge and this woman, for stating what we did, and I have got five witnesses to come to-day, and they will confirm everything we said, and the woman she was with after 12 o'clock got a tremendous black eye that ever you saw in your life; and as for Nodding he was not there at all, he went into work. I have applied for summonses to indict him for perjury; he knows that.</p>

Sir,—I omitted last night to give you another extract from the last edition of 'Every Man his own Lawyer,' under the head of Landlord and Tenant. My year's tenancy of your rooms dates, therefore, from the date of the expiry of your notice to quit, viz., from the 24th April, 1874, and from that date I can if I choose, (and I do choose, in consequence solely of the reputed Mrs. Micklethwaite's</p>

What your reputed wife is I was told on Sunday night, and the person who informed me declared it to be his intention to set a watch upon her and in time prove her to be what he alleged she had long been and was at present. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT MILLAR</hi>, M.D., Surgeon-Major.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The dispute between us was that I gave him notice to quit and he would not leave—he said he was a yearly tenant—he never said he would quit for the sake of peace—he did not say "I will quit if I am a weekly tenant, and will pay for the last week I am there," and I did not say "You are a yearly tenant, and shall pay me for the whole year"—I gave him notice to quit on 16th April'—on 27th April there was an action in the County Court for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for gas fixings and breach of contract—Dr. Millar was the complainant—it was dismissed by the judge with 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs for me—he has entered another action since, and I believe that is now pending in the Court of Common Pleas—I don't know that there is one to be tried in the County Court on the 24th of this month—I have not received any notice—I believe it was on the 16th May there was a summons for an assault—that was when he was bound over to keep the peace—the date of the libel is the 14th of May—I believe the assault was before the libel—on the 22nd May I levied on the defendant's goods—he never proved to me he was a yearly tenant—the judge did not tell me I was wrong—he was non<lb/>suited—I summoned him for an assault on the 3rd June—he took out a cross summons against me, and they were both heard on 11th June, and were both dismissed by the magistrate—I don't know that he summoned my wife last week for an assault—I was abroad—I have been absent three weeks—this letter is in my handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 13th April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and addressed to Mr. R. Millar</hi>).

(<hi rend="italic">The Court ruled that evidence could not he given of what took place after the libel</hi>.) I know Dr. Millar's brother—I saw him after the libel—I don't know Mr. Maynard—there was a person came and brought some article of furniture for Dr. Millar—I can't swear whether that was before the libel—I won't swear it was not—part of this letter of the 13th May is in my wife's writing—the bottom part is not; it strikes me that is Dr. Millar's—I did not see my wife write that, and I know nothing of it—I did not tell my wife to write, and I knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 40, Chancery Lane—on 1st July, 1868, a bill of complaint was filed by me on behalf of England—this is a copy of the bill under seal of the Record Office—I conducted the suit up to the decree—property was recovered under it—in September, 1871, I took proceedings against England for my bill of costs—he verbally agreed with me upon terms of payment—a judge's order was drawn up in pursuance—this is the order—it is an order for the payment of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>: 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid down, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next day, and the balance in ten days—he gave consent to that—he only performed his promise as to part, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was left—in consequence I proceeded to obtain a charging order from the Court of Chancery—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 16th January</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">and ordered a sale of premises in Unicorn Yard, Ossulton Street, and the payment of the proceeds into Court</hi>). My costs were afterwards taxed, and this is the certifi<lb/>cate of the Taxing Master for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the property was put up for sale on 11th April—I was present at the sale—Mr. Levy was there acting for England—on 10th April this notice was served, it is signed by the defendant—it is a protest against the sale—at the sale I saw some documents produced by Mr. Levy—I did not actually read them—there were three documents—Mr. Levy described them to the auctioneer—I am not quite certain whether England was there, I believe he was—I think it was three agreements that Mr. Levy produced—I cannot identify them, because I did not actually see them—I saw them held up in his hands, and he said they were documents relating to tenancies of these premises—Mr. Levy told the auctioneer that he could not sell, that was the substance of it, because there were agreements affecting them—the pro<lb/>perty was sold for 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a Mr. Carter—I think 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on deposit—that was paid into Court under the order of the Vice-Chancellor—in the protest of the 10th April England complains of the order being made in his absence—he did not appeal against the order after the notice, he did before—the order had been previously made by the Chief Clerk, then there was an appeal to the Vice-Chancellor, who confirmed it—at the time he made the protest of the 10th April he had gone through an appeal to the Vice-Chan<lb/>cellor—a notice was afterwards served in the name of Barnes, this is it—I think this came either the day of the sale or the day after—I cannot recollect now—it was no doubt received on the 10th—it is marked by one of my</p>

               <p>clerks as received on the 10th—I may not have received it till the 11th, it purports to be signed by William Barnes—there were no other notices at that time from any other supposed tenant besides Barnes—after the sale I received from Mr. Carter's solicitor a requisition of title, the ordinary requisition, as to what the tenancies were, what agreements there were, and so forth—it is here—I could not answer that requisition without having information as to the nature of Barnes agree<lb/>ment—and in consequence of that, I obtained an order on 14th June for affidavits of documents—I caused a copy of that to be served on England—this is it, and this is the original order—by the terms of this order he was to file his affidavits within four days—he did not do so, not for months after<lb/>wards. (<hi rend="italic">The affidavit of 17th October, stated that he had not in his possession or power any documents, except two leases of premises in Unicorn Yard.</hi>). Those were leases prior to the decree—they were handed to me for the purpose of instituting the suit—there was an assignment to England of those two leases—on 4th November, I obtained a second order from the Court, upon an affidavit of myself and Mr. Reed—this is an office copy of the affidavit, alleging that the defendant's first affidavit was not sufficient; and it is recited in the order of 4th November—it refers amongst others to Barnes agree<lb/>ment—this is the order of 4th November, directing that within fourteen days he should file a full and sufficient affidavit, setting forth whether he had or had had in his possession any such documents—on 6th December he filed the affidavit upon which the first perjury is assigned—this is his signature—the sale was still uncompleted at that time—I was waiting for compliance with the requisition—it was necessary to obtain information as to the tenancies and tenants—on 16th December, this third order was made, and upon that the defendant filed this affidavit of 11th January, upon which there is a second assignment of perjury; this is his signature. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had granted certain assignments in reference to the property in question to Barnes, Partridge, Clark, Smith, and Ladd, and that he had no drafts or copies of either of them, and never had in his possession or power any docu<lb/>ments relating to them.</hi>). After that I took out a further summons before the Chief Clerk for a further affidavit—I am not certain whether England attended or his solicitor—Mr. Lind was his solicitor at that time, repre<lb/>sented by Mr. Edward Lawrence Levy—I was not there; but I know he was represented by Mr. Levy, because I met him on many occasions in the matter—I had ultimately to return the 120/. to Mr. Carter, it was paid out of Court by order—no sale was effected, and I have never received any portion of the monies that I am entitled to—I first discovered a week or two before I took out the summons at Bow Street, that during the whole time of these affidavits being sworn, there were documents under his con<lb/>trol, or in his possession—I was endeavouring in the meantime to find out where they were; upon discovering it, I proceeded to Bow Street, and took out a summons, I had no knowledge of what Mr. Edward Lawrence Levy would state when I summoned him to the Police Court, except that he had some documents in his possession—I was not aware of the evidence he would give until he actually gave it.</p>

I really mean that—I took out the summons knowing that he had some of these documents in his possession—I did not know what he had, I knew he had some—I went to Mr. Levy, I cannot fix the date, except that it was two or three weeks before I took out the summons—I cannot tell you now what day that was; it was a long</p>

               <p>while after the affidavits, not two years; it was in this year—the last affidavit upon which we charge perjury is 11th January, 1873, the date of the summons is 4th June, 1874—I went to Mr. Levy, I should think two or three weeks before that—I did not know that Mr. Levy had quarrelled with Mr. England—Mr. Lind was concerned in an action in which he was concerned for the plaintiff, and I for the defendant, and we began talking about these matters—I did not know at that time that there was any dis<lb/>agreement between him and Mr. Lind—I have heard it since—what I wanted to get was the agreements or incumbrances in respect of this property—at the sale some papers were produced, which were asserted to be agreements for tenancies—I think Barnes' name was mentioned, but there was such a hubbub—I don't think Partridge's name was mentioned—I did not hear it, or Smith's; the only name I can remember hearing was that of Barnes—I don't know that other names were mentioned—I saw three documents, and I heard that the name of one was Barnes—if other names were mentioned, I don't remember hearing them—I can't recollect whether Barnes was pointed out; I won't swear he was not—I can't recol<lb/>lect now—some other person spoke, but I don't know his name, he spoke from the middle of the room, and said he knew there were some agreements for a tenancy in existence—I am familiar with the practice in Chancery—I could not have got a summons against Barnes to produce his lease; there was no bill filed in this instance, it was an interest to me to sell this pro<lb/>perty free from incumbrances—I had not been to counsel about it—I did not file any bill against these persons to substantiate their claims, or summon them to produce the documents they held—I did not go to Mr. Levy to ascertain what the claims were—I rested on the affidavits—that is the usual course—I have taken the proper steps—I have not summoned Barnes, that would not be a proper step—I never heard of Barnes till long after the charging order—I asked for an affidavit of the defendant—I never went to Lind or Levy—I could not have got an' order to cross-examine England upon his affidavit, there being no bill—there was a bill originally, but that suit had terminated—the order was made on a summons, not on a bill filed—I took the usual course, to get an affidavit of documents; that is the first thing done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is not possible to get an order to cross-examine on a summons—I could have done so if I had filed a fresh bill—I could not get a charging order unless the Vice-Chancellor was satisfied I had recovered property under the original order—I never heard of Barnes till after the order was made.</p>

                  </hi>, I am managing clerk to Mr. Lind, who carries on bis profession at 6, Beaufort Buildings, Strand—at the time of this charg<lb/>ing order being obtained by Mr. Stokes, England was a client of Mr. Lind's—I attended as managing clerk to some of his business—when he brought me the order of 14th June I explained to him what was required in his affidavit—this is the copy order that he brought to me—when this was first brought to me I went across to Mr. Hope, because there was a change of solicitor's then, and there was not time to get a change, and the affidavit had to be filed in Mr. Hope's name without his consent, because Mr. Hope had attended to the case when the order was got—I can't say that I had acted for England previous to the sale; it arose in this way; I met him and Mr. Cooper, and he introduced a Mr. Partridge to go down with regard to a sale that was going to take place of some property which Partridge claimed to have some right to; that was either the day of the sale or the day before—England said that they were selling the property, and Mr. Partridge had some claim as well as other persons to the property, and if I would go down and attend the sale for Partridge I would be there to ask how they were selling the property while there were certain rights to it—he said that Partridge had got some agreement, or some interest attached to it—there was some agreement pro<lb/>duced—this is the one England gave to me—I was to explain to Mr. Furber that there was this claim with regard to the property—I was not to stop the sale, but to explain that there were certain claims—there were some other agreements shown in the room, I think by Mr. Clark and others—Mr. England had got some more papers when he brought Partridge to me—he said there were other claimants to the property—I had the agreements—there, was one to Clark, one to a man named Smith, and one to Mr. Barnes—this is the one to Mr. Barnes, I think—I won't be certain—there was one to Barnes—whether that is the one I don't know—there was also one to a Mr. Ladd—England said that other persons besides Partridge were going down to assert their rights to the property that belonged to them, and on that occasion I saw the papers in his possession—he did not hand them over to me then, he took them away with him—I think three or four persons got up at the sale—Clark got up and produced his, and several persons were making statements, saying "I hold this" and "I hold that"—England drove us down to the sale—persons said "I have got an agreement for so and so," and they pulled them out of their pockets, and said "I have got a claim for so and so"—I can't distinctly remember how many of the persons I have named were there—I think Clark was there; I won't be certain—I did not prepare this notice signed by England—I know nothing about it—after the sale I saw the agreements again on 17th or 18th April—Batson</p>

               <p>brought me some papers and on the following day England came with the others—I then had in my possession a copy of Barnes' agreement, and the originals of Smith's, Clark's and Partridge's—Ladd kept his own, I did not see that then—I kept possession of them for a short time—an opinion was taken with regard to what could be done—Mr. York at first took an opinion—England was not satisfied with it, and we were to see Mr. Townsend as to whether a bill could be filed—I had an interview with Mr. Barnes before that, and I then got the original of Barnes' agreement, I think from Barnes—I don't know whether it was from England or Barnes, they were both there—I don't know which handed' it to me, I think it was-Barnes, but I won't be certain—I had not got them in my possession on 14th June, the time of the order for the affidavit to be filed—they had gone back to England—there was some question, I think, some sheriff or something was coming in, and they wanted the agreements for something', and he asked me for them back again—I returned them before the first affidavit was sworn—this affidavit of the 17th October was prepared in my office—there is a schedule of documents; that was prepared by Mr. Lind—there is no reference made to either of these agreements, because he said he had not got them—I had conversation with England with reference to his affidavit and these docu<lb/>ments—I said "You must discover every document you have got, or any copies, where are the original agreements?"—he said "I have returned them back to those to whom they belong"—I said "Have you any copies?"—he said "No, I have not, they were prepared off hand, I have got no copies"—I said, "You must set out everything you have got"—he said' "All I have got are those which were put in the schedule afterwards; two leases—I no doubt had the order of 4th November, I have not got the copy, I produced it at the police court I think—before the swearing of the affidavit of 6th December I had heard the copy affidavit of Stokes and Reed read before the Chief Clerk—that affidavit was prepared in the office; part of it is my writing—the affidavit itself is mine—before it was sworn I told England that an affidavit had been made by Stokes and Reed that some of these' documents were in existence, that that had been brought before the Chief Clerk's notice, and said they must be put forward, he must get them—he said he could not got them, they did not belong to him and he had nothing to do with them—I don't know whether I alluded particularly to Barnes' agreement, I alluded to them all; I said "Cannot copies be got and set' out?"—this affidavit of 11th January is a copy of the other, With the exception of the last paragraph, which was not in the previous one, and therefore the Chief Clerk held it to be insufficient—I put in that last paragraph from a book of forms—the Chief Clerk said it must be put in—I told England that some conversation had taken place before the Chief Clerk, and it would be better, as he had the opportunity of amending the affidavit, to put' in the documents if he could get them, because other proceedings would be adopted—he said he could not get them, and he had no copies and could' not get copies—I was with him when he was sworn to the affidavits before Mr. Smith on 6th December and 11th January—he had previously read them, they were done while he waited in the office, he had them to himself to read—the draft was read over to him before we engrossed' it—I had pre<lb/>viously, on both occasions, explained to him the necessity of an affidavit with regard to the agreements with these different persons—I think he was' present on one occasion before the Chief Clerk—I think it was on the occa<lb/>sion when the affidavit of Stokes and Reed was received, the second</p>

               <p>occasion, I won't be certain—he was present with me when the subject was under discussion in the Chief Clerk's office—I subsequently saw some of those agreements with Partridge and others some days after the last affidavit had been sworn, they were brought to me by England—there was a copy of, I don't know whether it was an equitable deposit or a mortgage from him to a Mr. Gearer, and these agreements were brought at the same time—I have produced them all, they all come from me—I produced at the police court the original of Barnes' and a copy of Barnes', I produced Partridge's and Smith's—I could not produce Clark's, because he took it away from me, there is a copy of Clark's, the original he took away, he came in as I was having it copied, and when it was being copied and being examined he took up the original, and said "I shall keep my own document," and walked out of the office with it—England was there at the time—by reference to my diary it was on 22nd January that England brought me the documents—when he gave them to me I said "Where have you got these from"—he said "I have got them back again, what do you want with them?"—I said "I never asked you for these, I only asked you for Gearer's"—he said "Cannot these be put in as well, Gearer claims all the property, and he will claim these under the mortgage as well"—I told him I did not want them, he had better speak to his son upon it, because the copy I had got was only a mortgage on the three properties that Mr. Gearer was claiming against the Building Society—Gearer is a son-in-law of England's—that was the matter upon which I wanted Gearer's mortgage—we were filing a bill—I said "As you have got them, you recollect the affidavit you made; you had better let Mr. Stokes know you have got them and I will apply for leave to file a minute affidavit"—he said he would see him d----d or b----y well in hell first before he should have them, or some such expression—I retained the documents from that time until I pro<lb/>duced them at the police court—there was some dispute with Clark and England at one time, Clark having received some rent of a house in Union Street, and Clark gave me notice not to part with his agreement—I told England of it and he said "That don't belong to him, it is mine, as well as the others are mine"—I was not to give it up to Clark—that was how Clark got it, by snatching it away—I can't fix the date of this—it was after the last affidavit—I ceased to act for England somewhere in February or March, 1873—I never produced the agreements until I was compelled to produce them at the police court—I attended there upon a subpoena when England was charged—all the papers described in this receipt of England's came to<lb/>gether with the agreements—they were all fastened up together—I don't know whether I had a copy affidavit of Stokes and Reed—I had the opinion of Mr. Ince, that is it, and also the copy agreement of Barnes', minutes of order, and the bill of costs, and the bill in Chancery of England <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Grant—these papers mentioned in the receipt were only in my possession a few days.</p>

There is an agreement of Barnes, Partridge, Smith, and Clark, and a copy of Barnes'—I don't know how many are charged in the indictment—I got the original of Barnes some days prior to the 30th April, 1872—I don't think I saw Barnes at the sale on the 11th—I do not recollect—I did not know him at that time, and I don't know whether I should know him if he stood before me again—I don't recollect whether Barnes' name was mentioned as a person claiming, there were so many persons talking—I don't think Smith was claiming at the</p>

               <p>sale; there were some persons claiming—Partridge, was the only one I knew before the sale, I am sure of that—I got them about the 19th or 20th April, a few days before the 30th—Smith did not bring his to me—I think Barnes came with Mr. England, and whether he or England gave it to me, I could not tell—I got Clark's at the same time I got Smith's, about the 23rd—there was a bill in Chancery being filed, and I got them for the instruction of Mr. Townsend, and here is the draft bill that Mr. Townsend drew—Clark gave me notice not to part with his, I think in February or March, 1873—if was about the middle of February, or perhaps the end that he took it away—Smith did not take his away—I never saw him about it or Part<lb/>ridge—I never saw Barnes after we found that the bill in Chancery would not be successful—I gave these up about a fortnight or three weeks after receiving them, there was some question about the property, some execu<lb/>tion or something coming on—about the middle of May, I gave them all to England; whether Mr. Ladd was with him or not, I don't know, he gene<lb/>rally came with Mr. Ladd—I gave them all to England—I can tell you for why they were given—England gave me Partridge's agreement—he brought Partridge down—I gave that up to England also without consulting Partridge, because it was brought to me by England—they were brought to me again on 22nd January, 1873—I did not see them between May and June, 1873, not any of them—I did not give up the case and the opinion, that was Mr. Yorks—I held it for him—I had that all the time, not Barnes' copy agreement, I gave that back to England—I returned the agreements to him all together, Barnes' copy as well—I never saw any of them till 22nd January—I have not my diary of that date here—I have had no notice to produce it—the subpoena was left at the office in my absence—I did not read it—I have not seen Mr. Lind here to-day—I am his managing clerk—I have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and any business I introduce, I have a third of the profit—the business is not chiefly provided by me—I am an attorney—I was admitted in 1848—I practised up to 1866—I then ceased—it was not then suggested that I had taken a liberty with somebody's name—I got into difficulties through speculations at the opera, and other places, and I left England, and after that a charge was made—I did not before I left England sign the name of somebody else to a bill; I swear I did not—I was not charged with doing so, not before I left England, I was telling you, but you stopped me; I got into difficulties, I did not wish to be made bankrupt or insolvent, and I went away, and while I was away a charge of forgery was brought against me, and I was brought back, and tried before his lordship, and acquitted—I was charged with the forgery of the name of Mr. Lazarus for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were not other names besides, not that of Mr. E. T. Smith, I swear that—I was not charged with writing his" name—I had a very fair practice up to 1866—it was in 1866 I took myself off to the Continent—the charge was made against me after I left England that I had committed forgery before I left—I did not hear of it for some time afterwards, three or four months, I think it was, I was lying ill at Switzerland at the time; I did not come back directly, I came to Liverpool in 1868 or 1869, I forget which, not two years after<lb/>wards—I did not go to Mr. Lazarus—I passed by the name of Lindon at Liverpool, I remained there a short time, five or six months—I endeavoured to get into the employ of a Mr. Turner, an auctioneer there—he did not charge me with getting into his employ by false pretences—he never made any charge of the sort against me—he made an affidavit against</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170024"/>
               <p>me, which was sent up to the Law Institution, that I had gone by another name, and not my own—but he made no charge that I had been guilty of anything—I set out in my affidavit what I had done since I left England, and to every one of those the Law Institution sent round to get affidavits to see if it was true or not—Mr. Turner did not dismiss me—I did not remain there—I left him—in 1870 or 1871 I applied to be re-ad<lb/>mitted as an attorney—I was refused—I applied again—my first application was made through Mr. Huddleston, it was opposed by Mr. Garth, on be<lb/>half of the Law Institution, and refused—the next application was four or five months afterwards by Mr. Huddleston—that was not refused—the Lord Chief Justice was not on the bench, and the Court said as he was not there they thought it was too early to renew the application, but I was not put under any time at which I was to make it—I was at liberty to come up at any time to make it—I made it again in a few months after, in the fol<lb/>lowing January, 1873—that application was made by Sir John Karslake—it was not' refused—it was referred to the Master on my own application—it is before him now, and I believe I shall succeed—the Master has admitted, that the charges brought against me are not proved:—he has said that—before the Master other matters were inquired into, about Mr. Prentis as to the alteration of a fee in a brief—that was the ground on which I was opposed—those were the affidavits, and I answered them—those are not new charges, they are the old charges—the assertion, was that Mr. Prentis' fee had been received and not paid, and that it had been altered from 12 to 15 guineas—the matter about Mr. Turner was not inquired into, because the Court had adjudicated upon that, and that had passed—the matter about the forgery was not inquired into, the Court had had the whole of the evi<lb/>dence printed before them when I made my first application, and if you read the remarks of the Lord Chief Justice you will find what he said—it was in 1870 that I was tried for the forgery in the other Court before his Lordship and acquitted—that was not Mr. Lazarus' charge it was the bank a charge—it was in respect of Mr. Lazarus case—the money had not been paid, not a farthing, either at that time or, to my knowledge, since—there was possibly an action of Ladd <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Cooper entrusted to me by Mr. England—there were a lot of actions—he did not pay me upon that action 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. To be paid into Court, or to Mr. Lind—he did not make any charge against me that the money bad not been paid into Court, but into my own bankers—nothing of the kind—he did' not charge me with receiving money from him for a specific purpose and putting it into my own pocket.—I will explain to you what it-was, if you will allow me—the trustees of a building society sued Mr. England for something like 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I got it referred—they, then brought an action of ejectment against the tenants to recover, the property. I went before Baron Martin, and he referred the matter to the Master—we went into the matter, and consented to an award of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10 guineas costs—the money was to be paid at a certain day; in the meantime I got hold of one of the society's books and found that something like 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more was charged than ought to have been charged against him, and I said if he had let me have these documents we might have saved more money; he said. "What is to be done," I said "You can do nothing;" he said "Oh, suppose I have got a mortgage of the property, can't I get out of it that way;" I said "Who is your mortgagee?" he said "My son-in-law, Gearer;" I said "Have you got an agreement?" he said "I will get it." His son is a solicitor, and I said to him "Why not do this Chancery suit?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170025"/>
               <p>he said "No; I don't wish to be mixed up with it. I don't want to be seen in my father's affairs"—then I advised that a bill should be filed on behalf of Gearer—when, the matter was about being settled, Mr. Philip England, the son, came to me and said "We have got to pay 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; now about the 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd." I said "What do you mean, who is to pay all the costs," he said "Oh, you must trust my father, he will, pay you."—I said "Certainly not." The 149<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was kept by me to pay the costs. England said "Let me have the money, and I will pay your bill afterwards." He did find fault when he got it all settled, and when I had saved him 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It was prior to that that I left off work for him—there was a case of Smith against the London Omnibus Company tried at the end of Hilary term last—you conducted the case for Mr. Huddleston—I was not in Court—I did not conduct the case—I may have written a letter at the commencement of the case—I was not near the Court—I swear that—the day prior to the trial I was in the Lord Mayor's Court office, and I" left there and never went into the Court—Mr. Lind was there conducting the case—an affidavit was made by Mr. England for a new trial in that case—affidavits have not been made that I suborned witnesses to commit perjury—the case now stands for argument in the Common. Pleas—I have had a copy of the affidavits, and have read them—I am willing to explain what was in them—an affidavit was made by Mr. Philip England, who told me that I should rue it one day for not being a witness in the case for him, that he had been told that I had agreed to give 40 to a "person to be a witness, and that affidavit has been, answered—I believe there are two other affidavits—there was not an affidavit, by the principal witness re<lb/>pudiating what he had said, and stating that I induced him to swear it—I was asked that at the Police Courts and. I told you the same, and they said they would search and find it, and they have not—there, is no such affidavit on the file, and I challenge them to produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The matter of Smith and the Omnibus Company was before I was a witness at Bow Street—my attendance there had nothing to do with that case—I believe Ladd is Mr. England's man—he has witnessed' bills of sale—he is always willing to serve process; and actions are brought in his name—he is the same person who was one of the supposed tenants—I think he lodges in the Caledonian Road—I have had nothing whatever to do with bringing this charge of perjury against England—the allegation about Mr. Prentis' fee was that twelve guineas was altered to fifteen by the clerk, and the clerk said it was done by my knowledge, and that the fee had not been paid—the Master said with regard to that that he was satisfied there was no charge against me—I produced the receipt—with regard to Mr. Turner I gave a statement of what I had done, since I left off practice; I mentioned everybody's name where I had been, and they' went round to every one—Mr. Turner made an affidavit; it came before the Court and; was adjudicated upon—he never made any charge, against me, he only made the affidavit for the Law Institution—I was acquitted of the charge with regard to Mr. Lazarus—I have been summoned for an assault that it was said I had committed since this business of Mr: Eng<lb/>land's—Mr. England was there, and the whole of my conduct has been sifted upon my application to the Court, and nothing has been brought against me during the whole time I have practised—this is the agreement of Richard Smith that I spoke of—I can't tell you who Smith is—I', have seen him with England, he goes about with him—Clark has signed that</p>

I was with Barber, and a young woman, who I have since found out to be the prisoner's sister, called out across the read "Halloa, Jesse," and came across and spoke to me. I knew her by sight—it was after that that the prisoner came up and said "Jesse, what the b----y hell are you talking about me for?"—I knew him—I said that I had not been talking about him—he put up his fist and attempted to strike me in the face, but I pushed him away—another man struck me on the side of my head and ran down St. Catherine's Road—I ran after him, and Barber followed—the man went into a house—I did not go in, but I heard Barber say, "Come on, Jesse, I am stabbed"—I found him on his back in the road and the prisoner on top of him with his knees on Barber's chest and his left hand on his shoulder and his right hand up as if he was going to strike him—blood was streaming from Barber's face—I pulled the prisoner off him with another constable's assistance—there were, I should think 1,000 people there—I did not see any knife, it was impossible from the crowd.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers at the South Western District office—the prisoner was a sorter in that office—he had been there about eighteen months—on Saturday evening, the 25th July, he was on duty there—in the early part of the evening he was stamping letters and packets and sorting, and the latter part he was making up the Southampton bag—about 7 o'clock my attention was called to him, and I saw that he was handling his letters in a manner which excited my sus<lb/>picions—after he had finished sorting and had made up his bag he was about leaving the office—he had left his road some eight or ten yards and I saw that he was carrying his left arm close to his side, so that he could not use his arm—he could not take it away from his side—I went to him and asked him what was the matter with his arm, if he had got anything underneath, and as I was approaching him be turned his right side towards me and dropped these two packets on the floor—I picked them up and took him into my private room, and asked him if he had anything else about him that did not belong to him—he turned his pockets out and there was nothing else found—he said "Pray, let me go this time for my poor mother's sake"—I asked him if he was in want—he said no, he had got a good home and did not know what possessed him to take the packets—one of the packets is ad<lb/>dressed "Mrs. A. P. Howell, Sisewell Gap, near Leiston, Suffolk"—there is no post-mark on it; the stamp has not been obliterated—it was the prisoner's duty that evening to obliterate the stamp—he should have done that between 5 and 5.30—in the usual course that letter would have been dispatched from our office to the Western Central at 5.20—the packet con<lb/>tains a brooch, a pair of earrings, and a small box—at the time I stopped him he had finished his duty and was leaving the office—he had his coat on his arm and his hat on—he had no other duties that night—he had nothing to do with the trollies—I was present when he was before the magistrate, and heard him make a statement there on the second occasion—he was re<lb/>manded from the Monday till the Friday—he said that he found the two packets under the road where he was at work after he had made up and sealed the bag—he might have found them there—it would not naturally have been there—according to the routine of the office it should have been dispatched at the other end of the office two hours before—if he had found a mis-sort it was his duty to put that on a table behind him which is there for the purpose, without leaving his seat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I don't think he made use of the words "What possessed me?"—it was in answer to a question that I put to him, "What possessed you to take them?"—he did not say "What should possess me to take them, as I wanted for nothing?"-if ho had found a letter for Southampton after he had sealed his bag he would have to open the bag again—there is a porter there who goes to the station with the railway bags—he does not sometimes carry letters when they are left out of the bags—I should never ask him to take one or sanction his taking one—I did not see the prisoner put his bag on the trolly—the letters did not fall from him as he was putting the bag on the trolly because he had no bag.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Lemon, a joiner; we did live at 10, Albert Road, Kilburn—the prisoner and his family came to lodge in that house about three months before he "was taken into custody—about a week after they had been in the house the eldest daughter brought the deceased child down, for me to look at, and I afterwards spoke to the prisoner about it—about a fortnight before Whitsuntide I said I did not think the girls were capable of taking care of the child, they were in and out and racing about so much—he made use of very bad language, to me, and said what was he to do, he was out at work all day, and they must do the best they could, and he went out and came home drunk—when I saw the child in the girl's arms it looked very whining—I did not see it undressed—I only saw it's face then—it's flesh hung very loose—it was not the face of an ordi<lb/>nary child, it appeared as if it wanted nourishment—I did not speak to the prisoner again about it after he was so abusive—he mostly came home about 6 o'clock in the evening—I don't think he ever came in without he was intoxi<lb/>cated, he was in and out of the public house all the evening, except in Whitsun week, and then he was at home all the week, and never went out—I believe that was the week he was out of work, and that week he was sober—the child seemed to be getting smaller every time I saw it—I think I saw it about once a fortnight, for after I spoke to the prisoner I was out at work—I never saw him leave any money or provisions—I saw some Sisters of Mercy once at the house after the child was christened—I can't tell the date—I believe it was before Whitsuntide—on one occasion, about a week before he was taken, I heard him make use of bad' language, and tell the girls to give him the brandy, for he wanted it as much as the child did—on two occa<lb/>sions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170040"/>
               <p>I provided the child with some milk and sugar—the last time was about a fortnight before it's death—I told the prisoner when I spoke to him about the child that I considered it was grossly neglected, and I did not consider it had proper nourishment—he made use of bad language, and said he could not help it, he left what he could—I saw the child twice with it's bottle about three weeks before it's death—it took it as if it had a sore throat—it did not draw from the bottle as it ought—it was corn flour, I believe—it seemed as if it could not get it fast enough, it was ravenous; but it could not swallow it sufficiently, it was too weak, as if it had not strength to draw it—on the Friday week before it died, the 26th of June, I went to Mr. Judd, the relieving officer—at that time the prisoner did not come home till past 9 o'clock, and sometimes 12 o'clock, and then he was so drunk he could not open the street door, and the daughter had to do it for him—on the Friday before the child died on the Sunday, I told him that the child was starved—he made use of very bad language, and said I was a liar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I told the girl that the child looked to mo as if it did not have enough nourishment, and I asked what she gave it—she said she gave it what she could get, that she had some from the Sisters of Merey, but before that the father had not given her sufficient for the child—I asked if she had taken it to the doctor's—she said "No, she gave it a little castor oil when it wanted it, but the father would not allow her to take it to the doctor's"—when I was out at work I asked her to do me a little bit of cleaning—she said she should be very glad, as they had had nothing to eat,—that the father only gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time to procure things—I gave them a few halfpence for doing that on a Saturday—at one time they left the child four hours, and during that time the prisoner came home, and the child was screaming "dreadfully—he went upstairs and came down again, and said "I can't do anything, the girls are gone away, and the child is locked in"—that was about a month before it died—there were five children altogether when they came, but one went away—one was three years old.</p>

I am Relieving Officer to the Hendon Union—in consequence of Mrs. Lemon's complaint, on 26th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to 10, Albert Road, Kilburn, to the room occu<lb/>pied by the prisoner and his family—I found the deceased child lying on the bed—it was in a very weak, low state, very much emaciated, it did not look more than two months old from its size, it had a feeding'bottle by its side with a little milk in it, and its face was covered with' a veil—I called the eldest girl out of the next room—the child's face was drawn up very much, its hand was contracted, and one eye was blind or deformed—in consequence of what I saw I directed Dr. Mullar, the Medical Officer, to go there—I saw</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a registered medical practitioner—on an order from Mr. Judd I went to see the child on the 26th June—its state was scarcely describable, it was a perfect skeleton, shrivelled up to almost a mummy, the left eye was thoroughly destroyed and sunk into the head—I examined it all over, it was nothing but skin and bone—it was suffering from starvation, and from the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion I should say of long continuance—I mean by starvation not that the food did not nourish it, but from want of food—I saw the prisoner nest morning, between 11 and 12 o'clock, in his own room—I told him I thought the child was sadly neglected and he ought to have had a wet nurse to it—he made no remark—upon, application the child would have been taken into the workhouse or provided with a wet nurse—if I had seen it at an earlier stage I should have prescribed for it—I did prescribe a little brandy and milk, but only as a sort of <hi rend="italic">placibo</hi>, it was too late to be of any use, the child was dying—I weighed it with its clothes on after death, and it weighed 4 lbs. 6 oz.—the average weight of a healthy child at birth is from 3 to 4 lbs. Up to 16 lbs.—I have repeatedly had 16 lb. children—the average weight at five months would be from 18 to 20 lbs.—when I opened the abdomen there was not a particle of food in the stomach or any fatal matter in the bowels, and not a particle of adipose tissue between the skin and bones—the organs were perfectly healthy—I did not examine the brain, it was too decomposed—the loss of the eye might be from carelessness or neglect, or it might have been injured—the penis was diseased, that indicated neglect, want of washing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. To the best of my belief, on 26th June, nothing could have saved the child—I did not notice that the place was very poverty stricken, I don't remember saying so before the magistrate, or that the child might have refused its food, and so sunk—when I saw it had not the power to suck, it was too weak—I said before the magistrate that if it got all the nourishment mentioned in the depositions it would not have died of starva<lb/>tion, to the best of my belief—in ray judgment it did die of starvation.</p>

Tottenham Court Road—I was plaintiff in the action of Woolhams <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Sparks, and on 1st July having obtained a judgment debtor summons, I went to Mr. Spark's office, 3, Craven Street, Strand, to serve it—he calls himself a broker, but it is a long firm of swindlers—I saw the prisoner there, who said that Mr. Sparks was not in, and he could not tell me when I could see him, or make an appointment—I then watched the house from the outside, taking care that the prisoner should not see me, end in about half an hour he went out with an envelope in his hand, as if he was going to the Post Office, but he did not cross over to the Post Office, he turned round the corner at" Charing Cross, and I followed him up Trinity Court or Place, where he met Mr. Sparks, and they walked up to the top of the Court by themselves—nobody else was in the Court—I followed them up the Court, and as they turned round, I confronted them, looked at Sparks, and said in the prisoner's hearing "You have given us a great deal of trouble over this judgment summons by keeping out of the way; it is no use now, here it is, and if you wish to see my authority for serving it, you can see it"—he stood motionless, and looked very angrily at me, but did not speak, nor did the prisoner—Sparks wore a waistcoat which was very open in the bosom, and I was about to put the summons into his bosom, but I offered it to him first, and he would not take it—the prisoner reached over my arm., snatched it oat of my hand, and began tearing it up, and threw the pieces into my face, his fingers touched my cheek the first time he threw them, and he continued tearing it and throwing the fragments for about a dozen yards—I said "You give me your name, will you?"—he said "I'll name you with the devil to you"—he appeared so fierce, that I thought he would strike me, and ran out of the Court to a policeman who was at the entrance of the Court who went down, and the prisoner gave his name and address.</p>

               <p>9, New Square, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I was present at the trial at the Whitechapel County Court, on the 24th June, in which the prosecutor was defendant and the prisoner plaintiff—I had the management of the caso for the prosecutor—I saw and heard the prisoner sworn, examined, and cross-examined as to two payments alleged to have been made by the prosecutor to him of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the date of payment was the 19th March—he was asked whether he had received payment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—he denied having received it—he was then asked whether he had not received the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th March—he denied it—he was then asked whether or not he had received any sum on account from the defendant—the answer was that the only money he received was a sum of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had received through our firm, and that he had not received any other sum from the defendant—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—when that was paid we were paying Mr. John Gray's debts, and ho made out a list of his liabilities—the date is the 15th April, 1873—I paid Mr. White 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I understood was the whole amount—nothing was said about any further liability—I said "You had better not discount any more bills for him"—he did not say anything else was due, on the contrary, if he had said there was anything more due to him I should have paid him at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. The cheque was for an overdue acceptance—I do not know the date of the acceptance—it was overdue some two or three months, I think—I said to the prisoner" We have paid you up down at Mile End two or three times, and you had better not give any more credit, because if you do it may not be paid again"—he made no reply, there was an end of the transaction.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. I will not pledge myself as to any particular dates of payment—it was the 21st February and 19th March so far as my recol<lb/>lection goes—I do not know whether the judge made notes at the trial, I dare say he did—they were not produced before Mr. Paget—the case was adjourned for the production of the certificate laying the foundation of the charge, without which the Magistrate had no jurisdiction—the County Court case we defended for the then defendant—Mr. Pocock appeared—I instructed him—Mr. Gray is a tobacconist—he has a freehold down in Essex, and he has leaseholds—in Mile End—our firm were solicitors for the trustees of his father's will—we had acted for him for some years—I do not know that there have been many monetary transactions between him and Mr. White—on the contrary, Mr. White said there was only one transaction between them, this particular transaction of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had paid—I do not know that that bill had been renewed from time to time—I advised Mr. White not to let Mr. Gray have any more money—that action was not brought for any bill transaction, but merely for goods Hold and delivered—White did not mention to me, after I gave him this cheque for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., anything about this bill for goods sold and delivered until I saw him about twelve months after<lb/>wards if he had mentioned it I should have added it to the debt and given him a cheque for the amount—I was then paying all Mr. Gray's liabilities—that was in April, 1873—the case in the County Court was adjourned on the 24th June for further evidence to show that Mr. Gray had paid White one or two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I then brought two witnesses to prove it—the County Court Judge did not hear them—on the first occasion the Deputy Judge was sitting and heard the main facts of the case—on the second occasion the Judge himself sat, who had not heard the case, and I brought two wit<lb/>nesses to prove that they had heard Mr. White acknowledge that ho had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187408170049"/>
               <p>received these sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Judge would not hear them, because, it seems that he had made a note in his book that Albert Gray was to be produced, who was a brother of the prosecutor—Albert Gray was in Lincoln<lb/>shire, and I considered it far better to bring independent witnesses of the payment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than the production of his brother, but the Judge refused to hear them—he asked Mr. White whether he would consent to Mr. Priest and Mrs. Gray being called to prove having received these 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Mr. White would not consent to their being called—the name of the Judge who refused to hear the witnesses was Sir Walter Riddell—judgment was given against Mr. Gray—I do not know that Mr. Bustle, the now Solicitor for the Prose<lb/>cution, has applied that execution should be stayed—I believe it has been talked about—ho may or may not have done so—I think he ought to have done so—I have no belief on the subject—we have no interest in the matter—Judgment was given on the 8th July for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether, with costs—I understood from Mr. Bustle that Mr. White had not appeared, and that a warrant had issued for his apprehension—I do not know of my own know<lb/>ledge that ho was arrested on the 23rd and locked up all night—Mr. Paget heard the two witnesses that Sir Walter Riddell refused to hear—they were not my witnesses—I am not identified with this prosecution—the witnesses for the prosecution were, all heard—Mr. Paget did not commit for trial, he declined to commit—he was called upon under the Vexatious Indictment Act to bind the prosecutor and his witnesses over to prefer a bill at these Sessions—my advice to Mr. Gray was to pay the money over again—that letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is signed by me on behalf of the firm—it is written under ray dictation—I was at the Police Court before Mr. Paget—I did not see Mr. Gray hand Mr. White my letter—I have a doubt, I cannot say—I certainly tried to get it back from Mr. White—I never asked him—I had no reason to get anything back from Mr. White—I did not see the prisoner hand that letter of mine to Mr. Pdget—I saw Mr. John Gray, under my advice, hand Mr. White a notice—it was sent to Mr. White at his address, and returned through the Dead Letter Office, and I told him to serve him personally—Mr. Gray filed his Liquidation in Bankruptcy on the the 27th July—he will pay 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—he has got an estate of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Against 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debts—I have no doubt he could pay 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I am not sure that Mr. Paget read the letter. (<hi rend="italic">The letter, being read, was a Notice of Liquidation</hi>). Mr. Paget did not dismiss the case directly he read that letter the letter was handed up to him by consent of Mr. Pocock, who said he had no objection to his reading it—it night have been an hour after that the case was dismissed—I will swear it was more than 20 minutes—I will swear to half an hour—I think there was another witness examined after he read that letter—I will not pledge my oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was responsible for the Judge's refusal to hear the two witnesses, in this way, I had no knowledge of the Judge's note, it was adjourned to produce further evidence confirmatory of John Gray's evidence that he had paid then two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his brother, a ward of Court, was in Lincolnshire, and he gave me his name as being prepared to prove it, but when I found I could get the same witnesses in London I thought it more advantageous to our client to produce independent witnesses than his brother, and Mr. White refused to give his consent to their being heard—Mrs. Gray is here—Mr. Priest, I believe, is ill—with reference to the pri<lb/>soner being given into custody on the 23rd July, I believe the first hearing before the Magistrate was the time when he did not appear—I do not know</p>

               <p>anything about the summons being issued—the prisoner handed up some letter to the Magistrate, and the Counsel wished to see it previously to its being handed up—no objection was offered to its being put in.</p>

The question before the County Court was whether the two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid, and I was prepared to show by the testimony of these witnesses that they had been paid—the allegation on the part of the plaintiff was that after the bill had been given, or during the time it was running, he had trusted Mr. John Gray for goods sold and money lent, and the issue was this, whether that money was lent before the renewed bill was given, or subsequently—the defendant's case was this "You had a bill for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; part of that was for goods supplied, and the other money lent at interest; that is all I owe you, therefore, this bill for goods sold and delivered is included in the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and has been paid you"—that was a separate transaction.</p>

I cannot say whether my father and Mr. White's father were very intimate, and did a good deal of business together—my father has been dead fifteen years, and I cannot remember what took place then—I have not had a good many monetary transactions with Mr. White—I re<lb/>member his lending me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and my giving him a bill for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in November, 1872—I paid it when it became due by another acceptance—I could not meet it at that time—the prisoner did not then advance me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and take a bill for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable in a month—my solicitor has the account of the goods supplied me for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the goods contained in this account, supplied up to the 14th December, were articles named in the acceptance—the acceptance for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given about the 16th December—I will not pledge myself to a date, but it was in December—to the best of my recol<lb/>lection it was payable in a month—if so it would be due about the 17th January—it was never presented—very likely I told the prisoner I could not pay until I got my Christmas rents in—he allowed the matter to stand over until April, 1873—I believe Mr. Todd then gave him a cheque—the prisoner did not buy any wine I liked after April—if he bought it I have not had it—he bought some wine in December, 1872, or thereabouts—he did not buy any after the acceptance was given, and charge it in his account—I positively swear that I had no transactions with him excepting the ac<lb/>ceptance for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed money—he supplied me with flour, pork, and potatoes—they are all in the account—he came to my shop in the early part of the present year drunk, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or pay him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. off a sovereign he said I owed him, and I, being in doubt as</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Saturday morning, 18th July, a little before 8 o'clock, I was with another officer named Roper, and saw Roberts, Shipgood, and Collins leaving Mr. Wiggins' premises in the Goswell Road they went to Messrs. Price and Co.'s premises in Upper Thames Street—I there saw Hasell—he had one of the Charity School boys in uniform minding a one-horse van—I saw him get out of the van and go into Messrs. Price's yard and speak to Roberts—Roberts looked up and down Thames Street, and then Shipgood came out and looked up and down, and he was joined by Collins—they had a conversation for about twenty minutes, and then Hasell got on his van and drove away—that was all I saw on. That day—on the morning of the 25th I saw the first three prisoners leaving Wiggins' yard—they had five horses between the three of them and three sacks of provender—they went to Price's yard in Upper Thames Street—it was about 7.45—a little after 8 o'clock I saw Hasell senior and Hasell junior, the prisoner, come in a van—they stopped just round the kerb from Messrs. Price's premises, out of sight of the premises—Hasell senior remained in the van and the prisoner Hasell got out—he went up to Roberts, Ship<lb/>good, and Collins—they took a portion of the provender out of each bag and put it in that larger one and gave it to Hasell, who took it outside and threw it in his van—Collins, Shipgood, and Hasell had some conversation, and Roberts remained against the wheel, then they went down the yard again and this other sack was given to Hasell from the van just as it had been brought out of Wiggins' yard, and Hasell put it in his van—I then followed the van away a little distance, and then Hasell called to Roberts and stopped his van—Roberts left Shipgood and Collins and went up to Hasell, and I saw him pass some money to Roberts—I could see it was silver, but what it was I could not tell—I followed the van as for as Bridge Street and got the assistance of officers and took the two Hasells into custody—the elder Hasell was discharged by the Lord Mayor—I told them I was a City detective officer, and I said "I shall take you in custody for</p>

Wiggins, and also with receiving the same"—the prisoner Hasell began to cry, and said "I am very sorry, I should not have done it only the others told me they bad got a little stuff and asked me to buy it"—I afterwards took Roberts and Shipgood into custody—they said they knew nothing about it and they had not seen Hasell that morning—there was no provender in Roberts' van at that time at all—he gave the whole of his as he brought it out of Price's yard—Roper took Collins—I searched the lodgings of all the men—I found four or five camphine cans and a gallon tin at Roberts' lodging—they were all empty.</p>

Price, on Friday morning"—he hesitated a little and then said "Well, yes, I had it"—he said that a man had left it at his place and that he had not paid anything for it—he said he had never seen the man before and did not know who he was—I said "Where is it," and he said" Down in the cellar"—we went into the cellar and I pointed to it and said "That is the one"—the chalk mark was on it then—Grey said "Well there are only three of us here, you need not take any notice of it unless you like; if a little feeing will do it I am your man, although only a little one"—when I got upstairs he said "Will you go and square it with your mate, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the stuff shall be taken away from here, and it shall never be seen by anyone again"—I called Roper up then and Grey stated the same in his presence—I took him to the station.</p>

I am a merchant commission agent, having offices at 19 and 20, Walbrook—on the 22nd May the prisoner came to me there, under the introduction of a gentleman with whom I have some business transactions, wishing to obtain an advance of money—a bill was produced, and having suffered from discounting bills in former years—I refused point blank to discount it—the point of the conversation was, that he wanted an advance of money, and the purport of my reply was, that I would not do it on that bill—he then urged his position as being the occupier or pos<lb/>sessor of these premises in 15, Crooked Lane, and that he only wanted a small advance on the bill, say 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then called my clerk, and said "Go down with this man, and if you are satisfied that what he says is cor<lb/>rect, then come back and let me know"—the prisoner went away with Mr. Martin, my clerk, who subsequently returned to my office, and stated that there was evidence of a large amount of stuff in his cellars, and I be<lb/>lieve the words were, that it was equal to ten times the amount that was</p>

I really don't know myself what a merchant commission agent is—I am so described in the lease of my premises—my business is making advances on real securities, and raising loans for those in want of them—what is vulgarly called a money lender—if a person offers good secu<lb/>rity, and good interest, we advance the amount required—the amount of security would not depend upon the interest at all—Mr. Martin is my clerk, and he writes letters for me—sometimes I see them and sometimes I do not—I wrote this letter on 22nd May—I was particular in having that written, because I wanted it placed beyond the possibility of doubt that I had not discounted the bill, that it was a loan—I ordered some wine from the prisoner, and he supplied it—it was a verbal order—I don't know whether the wine came from that office—I had no transactions with the prisoner till this advance—that was the first time I saw him to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Le Guay, at Walbrook—I saw the prisoner there on 22nd May, and Mr. Le Guay directed me to go down to his place at Crooked Lane—he said when could I go, and I said I would go at once, and I went with the prisoner—I was to go and look at the place, and see what it was like, and so forth—when we got to 13, Crooked Lane I went into a little office—the prisoner said it was not much of a place to ask people into, and he thought of moving to other offices, or if he stopped where he was he should have it boarded and painted over, to make it look a little smarter—I said "If you are doing any trade at all, you had better stop where you are, I think"—he said he was doing a nice, comfortable trade, and thank God all the stuff in the place was paid for—he asked me to have a glass of sherry, and I did—we walked to the end of the cellar—he turned the gas up, and showed me what was in the place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I walked with him from Mr. Le Guay's premises—he preceded me by a few seconds or half a minute down the stairs—I did not notice the name of Tilley over the door—I know it is there now—I did not notice it at first, because wine merchant's names are written small—I should think the name is two inches long—I have seen Mr. Tilley in those cellars several times, and I have had a glass of wine once or twice with him—I don't swear that he was not there on the first occasion that I went in with the prisoner—it might have been Mr. Tilley who brought me the glass of wine—I did not notice who it was—I will swear I did not go into the cellars before the defendant, and have the wine before he came—it was on a subsequent occasion that I saw Mr. Tilley, and had a glass of wine with him—I have been in the cellar three times—I gave a little order myself, but that was on 13th July, long after—I wanted some old Irish whiskey—the order was not sent to the cellar—it would have been sent in five minutes, but the prisoner happened to come into the office, and I said "You have just come in time to save me a penny," and I gave him the letter I had written—I have written one other letter to the defendant, and</p>

               <p>I took that to the cellar myself—if the bill had been paid, these proceedings would not have been taken, because we should have had to give him a balance—we have been anxious to get the bill paid—I wrote to the de<lb/>fendant on the very day it was due, because he had promised he would bring the money himself the day before—he was not threatened with criminal proceedings before the bill was due—I told him there would be a row, and I also said there would be fireworks let off on Monday—I presented the bill as a matter of course.</p>

I live at 20, St. Dunstan's Road,—on 27th May, 1873, about 2.25. in the morning I saw the prisoner come over a wall—I asked him what his little game was, and he said he was waiting for his mates to go to work—I get my living by calling people up who want to be up early regularly</p>

               <p>—I turned round to tap at some one's window and the prisoner struck me on the breast and knocked me down—he had a carpet bag in his hand and it was full, the lid would not come over—I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw—he had a cheese cutter cap on, a square peeked cap.</p>

I am a surgeon, at 177, New North Road—on Monday, 20th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was called to see the deceased—she was lying on the bed in the front room of her own house—she was suffering from severe pains in the head and symptoms of fractured skull—there was a bruise behind the right ear and a slight graze on one of the arms—I discovered the fracture afterwards by the result of the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the skin was contused, and by taking away the skin behind the ear I found a fracture about an inch long through the temporal bone corresponding with the bruise, and then it extended two inches through the base of the skull—the fracture was the cause of death—she died on the 28th.</p>

I live at 42, Richmond Place, Plumstead, and am an engine driver—I have known the prisoner about fourteen years—I heard of his child, Joseph, being ill—I was called in to visit the child about 24th June; it seemed very ill—I don't know exactly what the nature of the dis<lb/>ease was—it seemed as though it was convulsed, or something after that nature—I was called in to pray for it as a rule of our faith—I laid my hands on it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and prayed over it, and I believe I anointed it with oil in the name of the Lord Jesus—I believe it was with salad oil—I did no more than that, and get on my knees and pray for it—I suppose I saw it from that time every other day until it died—it remained ill all that time—it seemed to be gradually declining—for the last four days I saw it every day; it was continually declining—I left it on the Sunday night about 10 o'clock and it died on the Monday—during that time no doctor was called in or any medicine given to the child—a little weak brandy and water was given to it, a little weak wine and water, and there was arrow root and, I believe, a little mutton broth occasionally—every care was taken of it—I sat up one whole night with it, and there were several nurs<lb/>ing mothers engaged in the case—the prisoner is a labourer—he was in work at this time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich, and am an M.D. and surgeon—on 8th July I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased' child—it was apparently about two years of age, well developed, and well nourished—there were no external marks of any importance about the body—on opening the head the vessels of the membranes of the brain were much distended and generally congested—there was a quantity of serum in each ventricle—on opening the chest I found extensive adhesions of the pleura on both sides, and a quantity of pus in each cavity—the pericardium was entirely dis<lb/>tended with turbid serum, and the head itself was covered with a fibri<lb/>nous deposit, indicating acute inflammation of the pericardium, and acute pleurisy—all that may arise from various causes, the original cause in the majority of cases is cold—all the other organs of the abdomen were healthy—the cause of death was inflammation of the pericardium—it is difficult to fix an exact limit to its existence, it must have taken some time, some ten days I should say must have elapsed since the commencement of the peri<lb/>carditis—the stomach contained a "little semi-fluid matter, mixed apparently with a small quantity of tea leaves—the cause of death was clearly indi<lb/>cated—if I had been called in ten days before I could have ascertained the nature of the disease—there was no obscurity, about it whatever, the symp<lb/>toms would be very well marked, it was a disease amenable to treatment—I mean in contradistinction to other diseases—fortunately there are few that are unamenable to treatment, which must run on to death—if I had been called in ten days or so before its death, I believe I could have applied re<lb/>medies that would have been beneficial to health, which would have in<lb/>creased the chances of recovery—I cannot presume to say more than that—a child may die of the slightest disorder, as well as of a more serious one—I have heard the term "conculsions" mentioned, but that is a term used in such a very loose way by that class, of persons that I do not attach any im<lb/>portance to it—I do not believe that real conculsions existed—the child must have been in great pain, and unable to lie down—with such a chest as I found the breathing would be much oppressed—there were symptoms of fever, of course.</p>

               <p>and weak wine and water would be desirable—there are differences of opinion in the profession as to the use of calomel, some approving and others disapproving of it—no doubt leeches would be very strongly objected to by homceopathists, they would think it very injudicious—probably they might think the same of calomel in the doses in which I should administer it—I should administer larger doses than a homoeopath—if I am to give an opinion I should certainly say it would be almost useless to apply homoeopathic medicines in a case like this.</p>

He may altogether have mistaken what his duty was; still I believe it was an honest mistake. It may be an ignorant mistake, in all probability it is the result of igno<lb/>rance and superstition, but certainly there is not, a trace" of anything like an intentional omission of duty or a culpable omission of duty within the meaning of that expression as used in the Criminal Law., I am therefore clearly of opinion that it is not a case for an indictment, nor a case for a judge to deal with in a Criminal court; if the Legislature (as they have done in dealing with the case of the prevention of small pox), are minded to pass a law on the subject, that, is a different matter, and it would be quite right then that persons should be cornpelled to conform to it although they themselves may personally object to it, because it is the law of the society in which they live, and they are bound by that law if society chooses to enact it. But I am clearly of opinion that no judge sitting in a Criminal court, without any direction or enactment of the Legislature, would be justified in saying that a parent who exercised his best judgment though a perverted one, in dealing with his child by nursing and care instead of calling in a doctor to apply blisters, leeches, and calomel, was guilty of criminal negligence.

                  </hi>. I am an analytical chemist, living at 93, South Street—on the 7th August last, I was going home after taking a lady friend of my wife's home, and on my return from Blackheath Hill to my residence in South Street, I called in at the Guildford Arms, and had a small glass of brandy and water. It was as near as possible about 10.15 at night—I took out my purse to pay for what. I had, and I left by one door, and those two women (<hi rend="italic">the prisoners</hi>) left by the other—I do not know whether they saw my purse—they left at the same time I did—I went out of the door and went down by the wall, and one of the prisoner's came on one side of me, and the other on the other—Crew deliberately hit me on the left side a violent blow, which I felt for some days, and do at the present time—the other prisoner also did the same—in fact for some moments I scarcely knew whether I was in my senses or not—the blow was just above the hip, on the lower rib—immediately I found I had been robbed—I put my hand to my watch, and found that safe—I put my hand in my pocket and found my purse was gone, and Green said "What have you lost?"—I said "My purse," and she at once picked it off the ground empty, and I said "You must go with me to the station"—the other prisoner remained at a short distance—I attempted to take both of them, but finding that useless, I secured Crew, took her to the station, and gave her in charge—I returned in search of the other, and found her at the Guildford Arms in company with a man—I also attempted to take her to the station, but fearing that I might be molested by this man, desired the landlord of the house to send for a constable, and with some hesitation he did so—the constable came and took her to the station, and she was charged with the other prisoner—I had a pain in this side—it laid me up for two or three days completely—there is no truth in the prisoner's Crew assertion that I gave the other prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to watch, while I remained with Crew for an immoral purpose.</p>

I am in partnership with my father in London Street, Greenwich, as butchers—Street was there for six weeks before he was taken, and Rudderwood was in the habit of coming to cut chaff in our loft with his machine—on 17th July, at 4.30, I examined the contents of the loft, and found twenty-four trusses of clover, and half a bushel of oats in a bin in which we only have one sack at a time an empty sack was lying in the other bin—it was a strange sack, but I had seen it before—the police showed me a sack containing two and a half bushels of oats, that was the same sack which I had seen in the loft—I had employed the police in consequence of suspicion—I had arranged that. Gallehawk was to send his man—I was not present at the mingling of the seeds—after the police had taken Rudderwood I went to the premises, the Back was gone, and there was about a bushel and a half in the bin—that was about 5.30 p.m.—none had been used in the course of the day, the oats had not long been in.</p>

I lived at 146, Evelyn Street, Deptford—in May last I was foreman to my brother, a wood dealer—I have known the prisoner eight or nine years, and last November she threatened that she would blind me with vitriol and that my brother should keep me all the days of my life—on 24th February I complained of her at the police court for an assault—Mr. Henry Pook was my solicitor there and the threat in November was mentioned—the prisoner was bound over in 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to keep the peace towards me—I had ceased to visit her about Christmas last—during the nine years I knew her I never allowed her any agreed sum—I was not providing a home for her—only what I thought proper to give her—on 1st April there were other proceedings before the magistrate, in which I was defendant, and the prisoner complainant, and after several adjournments, that matter ended in April in my favour—the summons was on account of two children which I believe I had by her—on 23rd May, when I had not seen her or communi<lb/>cated with her since Easter Tuesday, April 7th, I was in Evelyn Street, just after midnight, and saw her and another woman; she said "You are the young man. I want to see"—I stopped and said "Indeed"—that was just outside Mr. Watts' shop—she said "I want to know what you intend doing"—I said "You have done all you can, and you will have to do the beat you can"—she then drew her arm from under her shawl and threw something in my face, saying "Take that"—I felt burning and said "Oh, I am blinded"—I have never seen anything since—I struggled towards the fence and heard something fall and break on the pavement—a young man who I knew led me home and I. have been under medical care ever since.</p>

I am a surgeon of Emblin Street, Deptford—on Sunday morning, 24th May, I was called and found Gilley suffering great pain in his eyes, and there was an appearance of whiteness in them—there were marks of vitriol on the under side of the brim of his hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was suffering from the throwing of some irritant fluid into his eyes such as vitriol—he has been to the senior surgeon of Guy's Hospital, but he has not recovered his sight, and I am afraid he never will.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I really think that—I have had a long experience of injuries from vitriol, being connected with the police force—my opinion is that his eyes will never be of service to him again—his vision is of no use to him; he fancies that it is, but it is not—I never knew anyone recover who was so bad as he is—the humours of the eye are thickened and opaque, so that the rays of light are not concentrated—that is caused by thickening through the burning—there was much vitriol on his coat and trousers.</p>
