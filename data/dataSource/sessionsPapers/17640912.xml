I observed his pocket heavy, and took him to an alehouse and searched him, and found five pounds and a half of sugar in his pocket; he said, other people had taken more than he had.</p>

            . On the 29th of July, I observed the prisoner, with others, and especially one Germain. who had an adze in his hand, pretending to be a cooper, but he was no cooper, I think the prisoner had an adze also, and they were busy about the tobacco hogshead on the key. I saw the prisoner pull out tobacco, and put it into his pocket; I went and charged him with it; he was very abusive, and shov'd me about, and swore he would take tobacco, pretending to have a right so to do. I, with a great deal of difficulty, searched him, and found a pound of tobacco upon him; he, with the others, threw some away, and his companion Germain threatened me, if I took the prisoner in custody. I know no business they had on the key, except that of pilfering, which I had before observed several times.</p>

The prisoners were taken on the 30th of July, and carried before Justice Berry: I was there; the woman said she found the hat in the path-way; but I should have mentioned before, as soon as I got home that night, I sent two people to look for the hat and wig; they returned, but could not find them. I have no knowledge of the prisoners, neither do I remember seeing them, before I saw them at the justice's: the woman owned she took a gold loop and button from off the hat; here is the cover to the button, which she owns to be the same; (Producing it.)

               <p>Smith. Sometimes she does, and sometimes not; sometimes at one place, and sometimes at another, just where she pleased: her father used to leave the door open for her to come in by night or day: when she came up into my room, she put on this hat and wig, and asked me, Whether she did not look like a captain? I said, she looked like a captain of a collier. Her mother and she fell out about the hat and wig, and she went to Bow. She said Robinson and she parted at the Green Dragon, which is within 300 yards of the place where the robbery was committed. Robinson keeps her company.</p>

On Monday morning, the 6th of August, I was telling my half-pence out of my till: I told ten shillings: I put five of them up in a brown paper, and the other lay loose. I was called to carry a pennyworth of two-penny over the way, and left my girl in the tap-room: I returned in about four or five minutes, and missed three shillings in halfpence, out of the loose parcel: the girl told me, a man and a boy had been in, and if any money was taken, it must be while she went down for their beer. A neighbour told me he saw them go out of the house; I pursued and overtook the prisoner in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and brought him back: he was taken before Justice Welch, and 2 s. and three-halfpence were found upon him. The boy ran away, as soon as he saw me coming.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker in Hounsditch: the prisoner at the bar brought this gold watch to me to pawn, on the 25th of July; (Producing it. Deposed to by Prosecutor.) it was in a shagreen case, and he asked ten guineas upon it. I asked him if it was his own? he said, it was. I looked into a book that I keep for advertised watches lost; there I saw it advertised, and the reward to be paid by Mr. Wytick, a watchmaker, at Charing cross. I asked the prisoner who he bought the watch of? he said, he bought it of a Jew, for twelve guineas. I said, that watch is lost, and I shall stop you and the watch too: then I took him to Mr. Wytick's, and Mr. Ferguson was sent for, who owned the watch, and Mr. Wytick said he made it for Mr. Ferguson.</p>

            . This is my watch which I used to wear; I am wife to the prosecutor: when it was missing, the prisoner told me nobody could have it, but another prisoner that was at our house, or his wife: he was very officious, and drew up the advertisement and the bill to go to Goldsmith's hall; the chain cost nine guineas, and he has owned he sold that in the street to a Jew, for about 38 s. I asked him, where he hid the watch, while he was at our house? he said, he had it in a pocket in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor knows very well, that this prosecution is at the sole expence of my wife's grandfather. It is some time since I married a young lady, against the inclination of her parents: soon after I was married, they took every method to get me separated from her: I was soon arrested, and put into custody: after they could not prevail upon her to leave me, they pretended friendship, I thought, with intention to be reconciled. They got her home, and then sent for part of her goods; she told me, it was their intention to part us; they have offered to send her to France; I well know the influence of her relations: I told my friends of it, and they advised me to decline and leave it: my being carried to the prosecutor's house, was owing to the cruelty of my wife's relations. She had learned music, and there was a harpsichord brought: after that, a bill was brought to me, by order of her friends, to pay for all, for which I was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When did the prisoner get released out of custody?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He went to the King's Bench, I believe, about a week or ten days after the watch was lost: he soon got released out of the King's Bench.</p>

They bid me go up the bank, or they would blow my brains out.

            . I was with Mr. Newman that night; we were walking by the side of each other over Stepney fields; a little fellow hail'd me, and said, yo ho; I said, yo ho; Mr. Newman said, You will not be robbed: I said, no. I had no sooner said it, than a little fellow came and ran his hand by my face, and flash'd a pistol in the pan. I was so frighted, I put my hand in my pocket and gave him about 11 or 12 s. he retreated from me, and then came back again, and swore, d - n your eyes, I have not half done with you yet: he rifted all my pockets; I thought I should receive some hurt: when he came to put his thumb and finger into my breeches to feel for my watch. I turn'd round and ran away, and he after me, threatening to blow my brains out if I did not stop; but I happened to have the heels of him, and I ran home. There were two men standing by Mr. Newman at the time he was rifling of me: one of them had a blue coat over his shoulders; he seemed to be a tall man, and the other much about the same size; but I can't tell how he was dress'd.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; on the 23d of May, in the forenoon, a man came in with a silver watch, and offered to pledge it; I asked him how he came by it; he said it was his own, and that he bought it; I asked him the name and number, and who he bought it of? he could not tell me: I said I should detain it; he said he could fetch a Person that could ascertain it to be his; he went out, and brought in a man, who said it was his watch, and that he had sent him with it to pledge, I asked them where they lived? they said in Whitechapel, opposite the Green Cannister; they said they could bring their landlady to prove it was their watch; they went out pretending to bring her; I sent my boy after them; he not returning, I went out as far as the London Hospital; coming back I met my boy by Whitechapel church; after that I saw them going towards Blue-coat-fields; I made all the haste I could after them: I had sent my boy to go another way; I met my boy again by Sun Tavern Fields; we went into the highway, expecting to meet them, but never saw them after: then I advertised the watch, and the prosecutor came and owned it.

            . My Lord, I am very sorry the prosecutor is not here; I had no knowledge of my being called upon till Mr. Godfrey mentioned my name. Considering the place I am in here, I should be glad was I never to be call'd upon to give evidence on such an affair as this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being tried here before?</p>
               <p>Gurney. I am not prepared with my book; but I well remember he was tried in this place in December sessions 1762. It was for stealing some goods in a dwelling house in or near Abchurch Lane; the prosecutor's name I cannot recollect. I remember it was on a Sabbath day, about the time people were at church. There was an evidence mentioned seeing the prisoner loitering about the place about that time. He was found guilty, and received sentence to be transported for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect him again, from once seeing him?</p>
               <p>Gurney. I have seen him more than once.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had any acquaintance with Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Gurney. That is true, I never was acquainted with him, but I have seen him four times before now.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Gurney. I saw him tried in this court three several times, and once I stood over him while he was searched for stealing a watch from a near neighbour of mine, near Christ-church, Surry, which was found upon him, and for which he was tried at Croydon; upon which account he severely threatened to do for me where-ever he met with me; which, if he had not, I should have petitioned the court to have been excused giving evidence on his trial. I once met him after that on Snow Hill, and made no doubt by his eye that he knew me. I was very sorry when I heard he was returned from transportation.</p>
               <p>Godfrey. I am one of my Lord Mayor's houshold; my business here is to keep the bench, to see that nobody incommodes the worthy Aldermen. I went out of the Mansion house on the 19th of June. I happened to turn my head, and saw the prisoner; he turned and ran down Walbrook; I pursued him; I saw he had a bag full of things: I said, Derbin, had I seen you without any thing about you. I should have taken no notice of you; but I fear you are got to your old trade again, and I think it my duty to stop you; I brought him and his bag to the Mansion-house, and delivered the bag to the care of Mr. White the Marshal's man, and he searched it. There was a watch and some clothes in it. I remember seeing him tried here when he was cast for transportation.</p>

            . Mr. Godfrey charged me with the prisoner. I searched him in the Mansion-house; there was in his bag a mettle watch with a tortoise shell case, two gold lac'd hats, and a plain one; two coats, a pair of breeches, and a jacket. Twelve pick-lock keys, a pair of pumps, and a gimblet, were in his coat pocket; the two lac'd hats, two coats, and watch, are own'd, and bills found here in order to prosecute him.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to my house, about eight o'clock that morning, the 7th of August, and told me he wanted to dispose of this mug; I asked him how he came by it, or whether it was his own? he said, it was his own, and the inscription on it, was his wife's father's, who had been dead some time, and left it to his wife, and their necessity obliged them to dispose of it.</p>

               <p>Salmon. I live in Barbican. I said, if you will stay till the inscription is taken out, you will make more of it: he said, he could not stay. I said it will be putting a crown into your pocket: he said he could not stay, but would call again. When he was gone, I went by the inscription, and found the house of Mr. Gardner; I called for a Pennyworth of porter, and asked the woman how long Mr. Gardner had been dead? she said, he is alive and well. Said I, have you heard any thing of your mug? she said, her husband was gone to Justice Fielding's about it; then I found it had been stolen. I ran home, and got there three of four minutes before the prisoner came; he asked if it was done? I said, stop, I have almost done it: he said, I wish you would give me half a guinea; I said, stay a little, and you shall have the value of your mug; I said, I'll give you half a guinea, and do you come by and by, and take the rest: he would not step into my shop. I went up stairs, and bid my wife go down, and put her hand in her pocket, and say, I am to give you half a guinea, and in the mean time, I'll step out at the back door, and come round and take him. She went, and did as I directed, and I slipped out and seized him: then I sent word to Sir

I said, I would not sell it; then he said, he would take me back to the man's house, and get me prosecuted for taking it: I was so frighted, I did not know what to do; I carried it to my own cellar, and buried it two feet deep; he came to me when I was at supper, and said, have you sold it? I said, no; then said he, I'll go to Mr. Gardner, and tell him you have got his mug; I said, let the man have his mug again: said he, how can you say you are innocent, you have received it, and he would go and tell Mr. Gardner; then I called after him, and said I would sell it, and I carried it to that gentleman's house; the gentleman weighed it: it weighed 14 ounces; he said, call again in half an hour, and you shall have the money for it. I seeing him go out of his house, the right way to Mr. Gardner's house, I was frightened, and as blind as a beetle; I could not see my way: then I thought I would go and see If I could find the man, and beg of him to let the mug go home again: I went and called for a dram in Mr. Gardner's house, and asked if the man was there that I had been with? they said yes, and the girl said her master was gone after him; then I went to the silversmith's house; he said, well, young man, I have got it done for you almost, it will be finished in a quarter of an hour: his wife came to pay me, and I made no resistance when I was taken.</p>

I had my watch at that time; when I returned in again, I called the boy to take the money for the pint of wine, and then I went out with the girl. As soon as I got out of the door, I began to vomit; she held my head with her hand; at that time I felt her take my watch from my fob: I put my hand down, and missed it: after that she went with me to the corner of the street where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you lose your handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Anceon I don't know how I lost that; but I took it off her neck at Mr. Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to the prisoner when you missed your watch?</p>
               <p>Anceon. No, I did not, I was sober, but taken very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you suffer the girl to go away without saying any thing to her?</p>
               <p>Anceon. I was so very sick that I could not say any thing to her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with her, or did you know where she lived?</p>
               <p>Anceon. No: I advertised her the next day, and in consequence of that the watch was found; I saw it at Justice Fielding's six or seven days after the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your handkerchief when you met with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Anceon. I had; it had a mark upon it; but now it is taken out; but I know it to be mine.</p>

They shewed me the watch; she said the watch is advertised, five guineas reward; and, if so, it must be worth more than the reward. At last, she gave me the watch in my hand: when we got to St. Mary Axe, I said, What do you ask for it? she said, ten guineas: I said, It is a pretty watch; how did you come by it? I must stop you and the watch too. I had them in custody about five minutes; then a mob gathered. I sent for a constable; none were to be found; then a young man came up and laid hold of the prisoner; we took them into a public house, and then before Sir

The prisoner said she happened to meet the old woman, and she asked her to go along with her, and she did not know for what; but she was going to see a Jew in Duke's Place: they were committed, one to the Gatehouse, the other to the Round-house.

               <p>Mr. Notley. On the 10th of August, the prisoner brought this silver stand to me to pledge: I asked her who she came from? she said, from Mrs. Dewberry, and that she was an acquaintance of hers. I asked where she lived? she said, at Charing Cross. I said I would go along with her, and if so, I would let her have the money. I went with her, and there was no such person; then the prisoner said she was to meet her there; we waited there some time; no body came; then she took me to St. Martin's Lane: there she said she would send for her. She sent, and there came an old mean looking person, that called herself Dewberry. I thought she could not have such a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176409120019"/> thing; then the prisoner said some body had lent a silk gown, and taken this in pledge: I said, she had better tell the truth; then she said she took it from Mrs. Dewberry, her mistress, in Westminster; then I took her to Mr. Welch's office; he was not at home; we went to Colonel Dean, who sent for her mistress, and committed the prisoner to the Gatehouse.</p>

When we got to the Wash, he turned quick upon me, got before me, and drew a knife, collared me, and demanded my money; he swore he would murder me, if I did not give him all my money. I said I had but two shillings, and that I would give him as soon as I could: I took two shillings out of my pocket and gave him: then he said, You have more. I said, I have no more, but a few halfpence; and took them out, which were four; he would not take them; then he swore he would cut my throat, if I did not give him my watch. I told him I never travelled with one; then he swore he would murder me, if I did not go back; and shortened his arm, in which he held his knife, as if he was going to stab me. I said, Why should you make me go back? let me go on my journey; I have given you all my money. He said, Go back, that I may go by. I understood by that, that he might go, and I not see him: so I turned my back, and he went away: then I went on to a little ale-house at the farther end of the Wash, and called for a pennyworth of beer. While I was standing at the door, the prisoner came by; he looked me in the face, and said, Come along, come along; as if we had been acquainted: I did not know but he might be before me, till I saw him; I was more frighted then, by seeing him so audacious; and was afraid to take notice that I had been robbed there, because I saw only a little slight man and an old woman: I then waited till there came a post chaise, and people in it: I ran down the road, and desired they would let me go in it to near the turnpike: when I got in the chaise, I told them I had been robbed, and described the person: they said they were certain they should know him by my description; they put me down short of the turnpike, and went on a little farther in the town, and there took him, and sent for me: as soon as I heard his voice, I knew him; I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am the driver of the post-chaise, and took Mr. King up at the farther end of Mims-wash; he said he had been robbed by a person, in a grey coat, black waistcoat, a clean pair of breeches, a soldier's hat cocked up, a tall young fellow in his own hair, pitted with the small-pox: I set Mr. King down by the turnpike, and found the prisoner at the Green Dragon door. He was in the house, hanging over the hatch; I said to the person in the chaise, this is the man: I went to him, and asked how far he was going? he said to Hatfield: I said, that is not the way. He said, will you drink? and gave me the mug in my hand: I got a constable, and he came and took the prisoner. He was searched, and 2 s. and this knife found in his pocket, (Producing a clasp knife.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe this is the knife the prisoner held to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gidens. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner, and found 2 s. and this knife upon him: when Mr. King came, and said the prisoner was the man that robbed him, the prisoner did not deny it.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Kates, a pawnbroker, in Chandois-street: the prisoner brought this ring on Saturday last, and offered to pledge it with me: she having no hat on, I imagined she was some servant in the neighbourhood: she first said it was her own; after that, she said it was sent by one Mrs. Brown, at the Bull's-head, the corner of St. Martin's lane. I said I would go with her there: going along, she went into a chandler's shop, and did not seem willing to go; after that, she went into another, and staid some time; I called her out; she said, what do you think I am going to run away I then she went to the Bull-head: I asked the mistress of the house if she knew the prisoner? she said, she did not. Then I took her back to the shop again; she would not tell where she lived: after that, she said she was sent by one Mrs. Hall: we took directions where she said Mrs. Hall lived, and let her go, with intent of watching her; we let her go out; my master went out at one door, and I at the other. Going along, we looked up a court, and saw her cleaning a window: we asked her what she did there? she said she was speaking to a gentlewoman. We went into the house, and asked Mr. Feild if he knew that girl? he said, she was his servant: then we shewed him the ring, and he owned it. Before the justice, she said she found the ring upon the carpet in the room.</p>

               <p>Lazarus Levi. I live in Carter-street, by Wool-pack-alley. At first, there came a shoe-black, and asked me, if I buy silver? I said, yes: he said, there was a man and woman had got so me silver to sell. I went with him to the two prisoners, in Hounsditch; they were standing in the street: I asked what they had to sell? the man said, do you live hereabouts? I said, just by: he said, will you go home with me? I went home with him, and he gave me this silver candlestick into my hand; he asked 5 s. an ounce for it, and said, the girl had a relation died, and left it her. I stopped it, and went and advertised it, by which means I came at the owner. (Produced, and deposed to by Pickford, as the property of the prosecutor.)</p>

On the 6th of this instant September, I was informed he was in the bank-yard; I went into the bank, and told some of our clerks I would take my pocket-book and go out, and see whether he would attempt to pick my pocket of it: I went out, and pulled my pocket-case out in the yard, as he might see it, and put it in again: I went out, and he followed me into Castle-alley; there was nobody with him then: I stopped at the lottery-office-window, in Castle-alley, and he came and stood by me, on that side the book was: then I came through the alley into Cornhill, and stood at Mr. Kentish's toy shop; he came and stood there by me; then I turned into Pope's-head-alley, and stood at Mr. Shepherd's toy-shop; he followed me there likewise: then I passed him a little way, and stood to make water; then I went on, into Lombard-street, into the shop of Messrs. Breffey Ive, and Co. bankers; he followed me to their door, and staid there, and took notice of what I was doing in the shop; after I came out there, I turned into Lombard-street, and put my hand down by the side of my pocket, with my little finger by the side of it, that I might be able to feel it, if he took my book out of my pocket: I had not gone out at the door above ten or a dozen yards, before I felt him at it; I could almost take my oath that I felt him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of your pocket-book?</p>
               <p>Hazard. I will not swear that he had hold of it, but I believe he had; I was in some sort of a confussion, and went into the shop of Sir

            , for I had between 2 and 300 l. of my own property, in another pocket, which I had forgot to put out, before I went on this affair; I depended on having the heels of him. He came and stood at Sir Charles's door, while I was there; after I came out, he followed me as before, and I imagine, made the same attempt; I went on, farther into Lombard-street, and he still followed me: I took my case out, when by the corner of Birchin-lane, and looked into it; he crossed the way, and looked into it also: then I turned up Birchin-lane, and went into the shop of Vere, Glynn, and Hallifax; he came and stood at the door the space of three minutes, while I was talking to the clerks; then I came out, and crossed the way, and went into 'Change-alley, and away to the bank; he followed me as far as the 'Change, before he dropped me: then I was convinced he was a thief: this was about ten o'clock in the forenoon. Then I told Mr. Carnaby I was very certain that he and I could take him; as he had attempted to pick my pocket once, he would do it again: so we told the gate-porter at the bank, if he saw him, to let us know; the porter knew him, and had told him to keep away before this. About one o'clock the same day, I was informed Clark was there again: I took another pocketbook, rather smaller than the other, that I thought would come out of my pocket easier, and only one note of hand, (the note mentioned in the indictment) and put it into my pocket, and desired Mr. Carnaby to come a little after me upon Change, and watch to see whether Clark saw me. I came out of the bank, and saw Clark and Smith, and another person, standing together, by the corner of Castle-alley.</p>

I took out my pocket-case; I had put some blank draughts in it: I just shewed them, that they might imagine they were papers of great consequence, and put my book very carelesly into my pocket, and turned up Castle-alley: I just looked behind me, and saw these three people following me: I went into a little passage, that leads to the Royal Exchange, there is a cane and Toy-shop there; I stood there, with an intent of letting Mr Carnaby come up: I saw him coming; these three men stood behind me: they seemed to decline coming on, and rather drew back. Mr. Carnaby came up, but took no notice of me; I went and stood very near the statue of Sir

In a little time after we had been there, that third person asked me some insignificant questions; I then put my hand into my bosom, that they might have an opportunity of picking my pocket; and thought, as soon as I found one of them move, I might conclude my book was gone.

I sent my daughter up to look for it; the hats mentioned in the indictment were all hanging upon a nail: I saw Delvin pointing up to them: I found there was no such thing as they came for; it was a fiction of theirs. I asked who brought the shirt? they mentioned a woman's name whom I knew nothing of: I bid them go and ask her about it: they went away, and between the hours of one and two, and in the same fictitious manner, demanded a silk handkerchief, which, they said, lay for two shillings. I had no such thing in my house. I had a jealousy they came for my hats: the moment I stept from off the compter, I missed them: I immediately seized Castle. In endeavouring to get away, he left part of his coat, waistcoat, and shirt, in my hands. He was on one side of the compter, and I on the other: he got from me: I stepped to the door, and cried, Stop thief: the next witness crossed the way upon him: I saw him drop a handkerchief; this is it; it is my property. (Producing a blue and white handkerchief.) Castle ran into a chandler's shop and Mr. Rushton took him. We carried him to the Justices at Hicks's Hall, and he was committed.

I saw Mrs. Yeoman lying on the floor; I asked what was the matter? they told me there had been a thief in her room that had knocked her down, and he was run down St. Martin's-le-Grand: I saw the prisoner's back, but soon lost fight of him; he might be upwards of an hundred yards from me, running as hard as he could. I went and turned up Angel-street; there I saw the people had hold of him: he dropt a bunch of keys; I saw them in the corner of his frock, and saw him drop them; I took them up; ( Fourteen keys produced in court.) those are like them, I delivered them out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What are your goods worth?</p>

               <p>Q. Is it now worth half the money?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is; the sattin waistcoat is worth a crown; the leather breeches cost me 25 s. and they are not a shilling the worse for wearing. I have no doubt but they are now worth 20 s. the stocking are worth above a shilling; the hat is worth 7 s.</p>

The next morning, I found he had torn the sheets to pieces, to make a rope to let himself down from the window; they were on the outside: I went and broke open the door, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment: the sash at which he got out, was left open, which was before fastened down within side: he was taken at Newington-butts the last of August.

I went, and he was then gone towards the Dog and Duck: I went and stopped him: Butler asked him where he had that jacket? he said, he bought it for half a crown.

            , came to exercise, they were both together, and desired I would put it by for him, till he had done exercise. I took and carried it to my room; after exercise, they did not come for it, which gave me a suspicion; I applied to Serjeant Shaw, belonging to the same company that he did, who desired I would carry it to his house, till farther enquiry could be made. I did, and delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Shaw. The last witness told me of the box on the Monday, and it was brought to me on the Saturday: he said, he suspected it was full of stolen linen, that he could see linen on the top of it, and desired he might leave it at my house, least he should be suspected of receiving stolen goods. I desired him to bring it to my house; (this is the box that is here produced); it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was some of the linen taken out of the box, and pawned, and Justice Welch sent for it.</p>

This young woman was ironing of cloaths; I went to bed, and my two brothers went out at the door; it was not two o'clock: they came in again a little after three, and brought in half a bag full of things, and brought them up stairs, and put them in a box, and set off for London in the morning, a little after three.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they bring in the bag?</p>

I went to my exercise, and bid him not break it open: he said, he would take care of it: I came home in the evening, and my father, mother, and brother were in bed.</p>

I never knew the prisoner before last Thursday was se'nnight; that day I was coming from Ratcliff-highway, and going towards Saltpetre-bank, in the night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, alone: the last house I was in, was the Boatswain and Call, in Ratcliff-highway. When I came on the Bank, at the corner of the house, by a post, there was the prisoner and three women; they asked me where I was going? I told them to the Black-boy, to get some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the Black Boy?</p>
               <p>Downs. It was about half a furlong, or not so far: they asked me if I would give them any beer? I said, yes, if they would go along with me: one of the women took me by the arm, and the prisoner walked after me. He stepped before me; I went to stop at the second door, facing the Glasshouse, but they would not let me: that woman and he pulled me down; I cried out, and the woman clapped her hand over my mouth, that I should not make a noise; he had hold on me at the time; I got up again, and we walked along till we came to the <placeName id="t17640912-46-crimeloc261">Black-Boy</placeName>

               <p>Q. How far is it from the enterance of the alley, to the necessary-house?</p>
               <p>Downs. It is about as far as this court-room is wide: they would have pulled my breeches off, but I would not let them. The prisoner put his hand into my right side pocket, and took out eleven guineas and some silver, three or four shillings.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176409120033"/>Q. How near the enterance of the alley is the door of the house?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive the door to be open?</p>
               <p>Downs. No; but I saw a light in the front of the house: I did not go by the window; the alley is before I came to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the eleven guineas last?</p>
               <p>Downs. I had them about nine o'clock the same night; I put them in a piece of paper, and put them into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by so much money?</p>
               <p>Downs. I was just come from a voyage, and had received 6 l. of it for wages that day, of

               <p>Q. How came you to be so passive while he was taking the money?</p>
               <p>Downs. The women got hold of me, and held me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you cry out, when you was by the side of the house?</p>
               <p>Downs. No, I did not. I did not think they were going to take my life then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out, when in the necessary-house?</p>

               <p>Downs. Then I went into a house facing the back part of the Black-boy, and pulled my breeches and stockings off, and the people took and washed them. I did not go in at the Black-boy, till I had been in bed, and got my things cleaned: that might be about ten hours after. The next day, I took the prisoner in White Lyon street, Rosemary-lane; there was another man along with him, and two women: I took hold of him, and said, he was my prisoner. He went to strike at me, and asked me what I wanted with him? I said, he had robbed me. I let him go, and bid a man take care of him, while I went and got a constable: the people cry'd, Hold him fast, for he is an old offender. I went and got

I put the key in the closet door, and said, if she found any things in the closet, to put them in their places again: I thought she was a very honest woman: she having found two or three things in cleaning some time before, and delivered them to me: after my husband told me he missed the money, I looked in the closet; there was no money there.</p>

               <p>Adam Cane. I am a victualler in the Fleet-market: about six or seven weeks ago, the prisoner came to my spouse with the prosecutor: she said, Mrs. Cane, let me have that dollar which you have for the four shillings: my spouse produced it: the prisoner said, that is the dollar which was in the purse.</p>

            , but could hear nothing of him: that day. The next day I heard there had been such a man enquiring for the first West-India-man going out; but that I found, upon farther enquiry, not to be him: I took horse, and went down to Gravesend, in order to search all outward bound ships; I could hear nothing of him; I went to bed; in about a quarter of an hour after, a man that I had sent to enquire about, came and told me there had been such a man that had bought slops, shirts, jackets, and things, and was gone down to Chatham. I went down to Chatham immediately. When I came there, the people at the Horn were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176409120036"/> in bed; I was obliged to inn at the Globe; I told the landlady the reason of my riding so late; she said, she believed she had two such men as I had described that came there and were in bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What other man besides the prisoner did you describe?</p>
               <p>Kennedy. I was told that Logan and he had been seen several times together, and I had enquired at Logan's lodgings, and he was gone. I desired of the landlady to see the men; then it was much about twelve at night. She said I was to lie in the room adjoining to where they lay: I went up; and there I saw the two prisoners in bed together; I seized Foster directly; he was for getting up; he took hold of the knee of his breeches, there tumbled out ten guineas in gold and silver from his pocket: the landlady went and called the hostler; and he called four soldiers that were quartered in the house: I asked Foster, Where was my watch and the rest of my money? he said, D - n you, don't you know your own watch. There was a watch hanging by the bed-side. When he took it there was no string to it, and then it had one, and a silver seal to it. I told the landlord, on the dial-plate was Clay, London; and in the inside was C. Clay, and I believed there was no number: when I looked upon it, it appeared to be my watch: he would not confess to any more money that night. I then applied myself to Logan, and desired to know what money he had got? he put his hand in his pocket and gave me a guinea and a half, and a five and threepenny piece: I said, is that all? he said, yes. We took them to the marine guard, and kept them there till morning. We went to their lodging again; there Foster took a key out and opened a chest, and in the till were eleven half crowns; in another corner of the chest was a bag of gold and silver, which with the other amounted to 86 l. and upwards. They acknowledged it to be my money: then we had them before a Justice at Chatham; the Justice took and sealed up the money, with the watch, and delivered them to the constable, to be brought with the prisoners to London. When we came back to the Globe, we ask'd them if there was any more money? they would not own to any more. The Gentleman searched them separately, and took out of the shirts of Logan's coat two thirty-six shilling-pieces, a guinea, and some silver, which amounted to 5 l. 3 s. I brought them to London, and the watch and money sealed up; and delivered it at the examination before Justice Berry to the constable; they acknowledged before the Justice that the money was mine; and Foster acknowledged there that he took it. I have the key here, that I found in his breeches that he had on when he went off, in his chest that we brought from Chatham; his clothes were in the chest: that key he owned he made use of to open the Lock; I have tried it, and it will lock and unlock my desk.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Lamb: I know these pieces to be my master's property by the stamps: I heard the prisoner confess before several people in Bridewell, that he had cut them, and sold them to Ingram the taylor: part of them are stamped.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he meant these pieces?</p>
               <p>Wood. He had seen these pieces when before the Justice: he had owned before that, that he had cut two pieces of brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he own that?</p>
               <p>Wood. That was in my master's house, before he was taken up.</p>
