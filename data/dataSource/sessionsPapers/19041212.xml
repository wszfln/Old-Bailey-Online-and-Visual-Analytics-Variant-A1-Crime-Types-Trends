                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alfred del Rey, of 3, Vartry Road, Stamford Hill—last March we were living at 52, Bayston Road, Stoke Newington, which is close by—we had some furniture—in that month a receiving order in bankruptcy was made against my husband, who is a clerk—he knew the prisoner—I do not know what the prisoner is—he told my husband he would lend him £20 for the expenses of the bankruptcy, but he must take the furniture as security—he removed the fur<lb/>niture on March 23rd—he did not lend my husband any money; the furniture was removed to Mr. Gibson's, 37, Leswin Road, which is close by—he is a warehouseman—there was some furniture left in the house, which came into the possession of the Official Receiver, who was desirous of selling it—he was ready to accept a private offer to save the expense of advertising, and so he gave me the option of buying it in, and I bought it in for £2; that is the re-mainder of the things—I gave the money to my husband to pay; he conducted the purchase—I put the furniture at Gibson's in the prisoner's name, as the first was in his name, and I thought it would be safe—I knew him as Sims Wood—he receipt was in his name—I made a list of the goods purchased from the Official Receiver; this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a copy of it made by the Official Receiver—after it was taken to Gibson's I saw no more of the prisoner; my husband did; ho was more intimate with him than I was—the prisoner had no conversation with me after the furniture was removed—I had an accident, and was ill all the time—I saw him when he came on July 7th, and said Gibson had been to his house and made a dis<lb/>turbance there, and therefore the things must be removed, as Gibson wanted the room, and did not want my furniture any longer, and he would require £2 to pay for them—I gave him £2 for his trouble and to pay for the furniture, and he was going to take it to Thomas Connolly's, a great friend of his, to warehouse it—I asked him for a receipt, but he would never give me or my husband one—he said he would see to the business—the £2 which I gave the prisoner on July 7th was for the warehousing and to remove the fur<lb/>niture—on August 4th I took three unfurnished rooms at Drayton Park at Us. (id. a week—I wanted some furniture, and I went to see the prisoner in the City—I asked for my furniture; he said he would let me have it when I was ready—I showed him the receipt for the rooms, to show that I had them and should require my furniture—I next saw him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190412120005"/>
               <p>on August 11th, when my husband asked him if he would see to the rooms; he said he would go and get the things from Connolly—I asked him what it would cost; he wanted 10s. 6d. for Mr. Hibbard, who called over the goods, and about £1 to pay up the expenses—he had £2 13s. 6d. in all; that was to remove the goods and return them to me—I gave him the money myself; he gave me no receipt—the furniture did not arrive, but a telegram came—on August 12th I received another telegram, and I went to the prisoner's house that evening; he said he could not get the things, and was rather rude—I asked him why he had not sent the furniture; he said it belonged to him, and he was going to have it—I said, "You give me my £2 13s. 6d. back to me. please"—he asked me if I took him for a thief, or what; I said I had been all day looking for Connolly, and could find no such person—he said I had not been right in the address—I asked him to give me the address; he said it was 5, Causer Street, Islington, and I wrote it down on this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he said he would send me my things home next day—we ended very friendly—when Saturday came I had another telegram—I went all over Islington, but could not find Connolly—the goods did not come; but on the Monday morning a friend of the prisoner's, Mr. Weatherall, called and said if I waited I should receive my goods—I waited patiently until next day, and then I consulted-my solicitor—I took proceedings at Lambeth Police Court to recover my furniture—the first hearing was on September 5th, and was adjourned—the prisoner said his solicitor was away and he had no papers, and wished it to be adjourned—it was adjourned several times—the prisoner gave no other reason for wanting an adjournment—I continued to make inquiries—I saw Gibson; I was with a detective the first time I saw him—in consequence of what I heard. I took other proceedings in the North London Police Court, and subse<lb/>quently commenced these proceedings—on September 27th I went to the prisoner's house, where I saw a black cabinet, some vases, and a palm stand—on September 30th I went to Mr. Slingsby's, at 39, Mayflower Road, Clapham—I saw several of my things there—I value the goods which I claim from the prisoner at about £3; I bought them in for £2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know that before March 23rd the prisoner had rendered my husband considerable services—I know my husband did not owe him a considerable amount of money—I do not know that the prisoner was put down as a creditor in my husband's bankruptcy for £20—I was not present when my husband gave evidence before the Official Receiver—on the day on which the first lot of furniture was removed I arranged with the Official Receiver to purchase a further amount—he agreed to accept my private offer of £2—I gave it to my husband, and he passed it into the hands of the prisoner, who passed it to the Official Receiver—I do not know that the receipt in the hands of the Official Receiver is in the prisoner's name—the arrangement was not that we should have the things back if we paid the prisoner—this list represents the goods which were purchased on my behalf for £2—all these goods are mine—the curtains went away in the first lot; that is a mistake—the hearth-rug is mine, and the couch in American cloth—</p>

               <p>not make a list of the furniture taken on March 21st; I loft it to my husband—everything was taken to Gibson's and warehoused in the prisoner's name—lie was told to put them in my name by the official receiver—he had nothing to do with the second jot: he merely paid the money for my husband—I do not know what he paid Gibson—I have never seen the receipts—I have only seen Gibson when I went to him with the detective—the prisoner never told me that he had taken the furniture to Connolly's—he only said he was going to—the day he came and took my £2 he said he was having them called over and was going to have them removed—he came for the money to bring them buck—he did not say he owed £2 13s. 6d.—I gave him that in a public-house in the City to go and get the things and pay for them—he suggested that he wanted £2 13s. 6d. to pay Connolly—he wanted 10s. 6d. for Hibbard—I said, "You will require a few shillings to give the men some beer; there is £1 for your expenses and trouble"—I said, if he did not want it all, he could keep it—I do not know what the charges were—on August 12th I went to his house and asked for my furniture, and he said it belonged to him—it did not belong to him—I was not asking for the first lot, but the second lot—I asked for the £2 13s. 6d. back—I should not have been satisfied with that; I wanted my money and my things—we got friendly when I left; he was a bit sharp and rough at first—I never made inquiries of Gibson as to where the furniture was—I had an idea that it had gone there. but I trusted to the prisoner—I know now that the furniture was moved from Gibson's on August 4th—I took proceedings at Lambeth Police Court for detaining the furniture—I did not regard it then as a criminal offence—I wanted my furniture as I want it now—I produced a list at Lambeth Police Court—my solicitor withdrew the summons—I did rot make out a list at Lambeth Police Court—my solicitor had all the lists—on September 15th a small quantity of goods was sent to me at my house—not a large quantity, a washstand and a few chairs, in a very dirty and dilapidated state, some of the things in this list—there was a coal scuttle and shovel, bath, mortar and pestle, towel stand, pictures, kitchen "hairs, and bookcase—if you have some fireirons in the list I had them also I want the remainder—I did not receive any more on October 8th-a four-wheeler came to the North London Police Court, but I have not got anything—there were some things on the cab—on October 8th all my goods had not been returned—I value the remainder at £3—I want nine brass gas brackets—they were all new—I bought all these things from the Official Receiver for £2—I want some copper frying pans and 32 brass stair rods and some oilcloth—three-quarters of the goods were not returned to me by October 8th, only about one-quarter—I have not got a list of the things which I want now—there are some cooking utensils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On September 13th nothing was said about the return of any other goods—I do not know if the goods which came to the Police Court were sent by Mr. Slingsby—they wore not delivered to me—when I went to Mr. Slingsby's with the detective I saw some goods of mine—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190412120007"/>
               <p>some mats, and a fender, hath and screen belonged to me—they were never delivered to me by the prisoner—at the prisoner's bouse I saw some other goods of mine—I never arranged with the prisoner that I was to return the goods to him if I paid him £2—I was never indebted to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City clerk, and reside at Stamford Hill—I know the prisoner's writing—he wrote the writing on the back of this telegram—I knew him at the commencement of this year—I was unsuccessful in an action—I could not pay, and a receiving order was made against me—the prisoner promised me £20 to put me straight—I gave him a bill for £23, £5 being for commission, and he said he must take the furniture for security—he had the furniture, but I never got a penny—on March 22 he came to the house and took what furniture he liked—he took it away on the 23rd—it went to Gibson's—some furniture was left in the house—the Official Receiver made a valuation, and we heard we could buy it—I gave the prisoner £3 to buy it for my wife—he came back and gave me £1, as he had bought it for £2—he bought it in his own name—I had to give him the £1 for his services, and I had to give him 10s. or 12s. afterwards for his trouble—he said he would see his solicitor, Mr. Swift, and have a proper receipt for it, and that the inventory of the furniture must be stamped—I waited a few days; then he said he wanted 10s. for the stamping of the invoice—two or three days afterwards he said he went to Swift to stamp the invoice, but they would only stamp documents for 10s., then he went to Somerset House, but they shut the door in his face—I saw the furniture before it was taken to Gibson's—the prisoner said Gibson had been in a trap to his house and annoyed his wife, and the furniture would have to be removed at once, as Mr. Gibson did not want to give it room at his premises—that was on July 7—I saw the prisoner again and proposed that as my wife was getting better from the accident she had had I should like to take the things to some repository in Holloway Road—he said a great friend of his, named Connolly, who lived in Islington, had a repository and was going to take the things and keep them for a time—I was. present when my wife paid the prisoner £2 to pay Gibson for housing the goods—the next thing was that we took some unfurnished rooms in Drayton Park—we saw the prisoner and told, him we had taken the rooms and required the furniture; how much money did he want?—that was on August 11th—he said he required £1 to pay Connolly for warehousing the furniture, 10s. for a man to check the furniture, then he wanted £1 for himself; that is £2, 10s., and 3s. 6d. for drink for the men. making £2, 13s. 6d.—my wife gave it to him in front of me—we did not seethe goods that night—we were in the unfurnished rooms waiting for it—we got this telegram instead—I went to the City to try</p>

               <p>Newgate Street: Mark Davis followed, and then the others followed him—Bario and Mark looked into No. 7, Newgate Street, and into No. 5—Mark stopped and looked back at the others, and waved his hat—three of them walked past Mark and joined Bario, and they walked to Giltspur Street—they all joined together again opposite No. 7, Newgate Street—and walked nearly as far as the Tube Railway Station, then returned to No.7—Sacker. Leman and Blackcowsky stood in a line, with their backs to the door of No. 7, which is an empty shop—Bario and Mark went into the doorway; both stooped, and appeared to be examining the lock of the door—they came away and spoke to the others—they all walked to the end of Warwick Lane—I went to the police station for assistance—I was away for about three minutes—when I came back Bario was standing in front of No. 5; the other four were walking in couples on the other side of the road till about G.30—Mark, Blackcowsky, Leman and Sacker then walked up and stood in front of No. 7—Bario was about two yards off—he then walked quickly behind them and opened the door of No. 7—the other four men were standing in front of him—Blackcowsky and Leman stepped quickly inside; the door was closed and fastened by Bario—from the way he kept his hand he seemed as if turning a key—Sacker and Mark walked towards Giltspur Street; Bario followed and joined them at the corner—the other police officers stopped them and took them to the station—Bario was searched, and on him was found this master key and this small key—I went back to Newgate Street—Leman and Blackcowsky were afterwards brought to the station—the prisoners were charged with breaking and entering No. 7, Newgate Street and No. 4, Warwick Lane—Sacker gave his address as 158, Cannon Street Road—that is near Commercial Road and about two miles from Newgate Street.</p>

On November 26th I was keeping observation in Newgate Street, independently of Bligh—about 6.15 p.m. I saw the rive prisoners together—Mark, Sacker and Leman left Bario and Blackcowsky, and went to 7, Newgate Street—Sacker stood with his back to the door, an I Mark and Leman in front of him—Bario went up under the building towards the other three—Blackcowsky was on the kerb and went towards the others—Sacker raised his hat three times; Bario went to the door, and apparently opened, it with a key—Leman and Blackcowsky at once entered—Bario closed the door behind them, and put something in his pocket—he then walked across to the north side of the street—Mark and Sacker went off, walking about a yard apart. towards Holborn Viaduct—Bario followed them; at the corner of Giltspur Street Mark and Sacker had joined together, and Bario was a yard behind them—on the Viaduct the whole three joined, and Butcher and Hiyward went with me and arrested them—I said they would be charged with breaking and entering 7, Newgate Street; they made no reply—while I was keeping observation I saw Bligh in Newgate Street—I was with Crouch when Leman and Blackcowsky were arrested on the roof of 4, Warwick Lane—these tools (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) were found on the top floor of No. 7, Newgate Street.</p>

I am a police constable in the employ of the Central London Railway—my duties take me often to Tottenham Court Road Tube Station—I have cautioned the prisoner two or three times there that if she did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> behave she would not be allowed to come into the station; she acted in a disorderly manner—I was on duty there on November 11th when I saw her soon after 5 p.m., and also four or five times after that in the station—I had to eject a well-known disorderly character of the name of "Irish Girl" from the lavatory for being drunk—the prisoner was in her company—at 8.55 p.m. they rushed into the station with their clothes raised in a disorderly manner followed by a crowd—I heard "Irish Girl "say to the prisoner "I <hi rend="italic">sloshed</hi> him one," and they were going into the ladies' lavatory, which is outside the barrier, when I called "Keep out there. You are not wanted in there"—as they went in I followed them—just as I entered the door I saw Irish Girl" and said "We have had enough of you." and she went off without saying any more—I saw her out of the <hi rend="italic">station</hi>—I then returned to the lavatory for the prisoner, whom I found hiding behind another girl—she <hi rend="italic">tried to</hi> throw herself down, but I succeeded in getting her outside into the booking hall—she struggled, and threw her hand bag down—I released her hands, and she apparently ceased struggling—she then put her hands to her hat, which was a large one, as if to arrange her hair—she then stabbed me with two hat pins, one striking me here (<hi rend="italic">Indicating his stomach, a few inches from the centre line</hi>) and here (<hi rend="italic">Indicat<lb/>ing his belt</hi>)—I was wearing my tunic, a thick waistcoat, and two flannel shirts—I got her to the door—she said she had dropped her purse with a half sovereign in it, and I think I called to the clerk to give it to her—I saw a Metropolitan constable outside, I called him, and he followed me into the booking hall—when we got to the prisoner, she had this hat pin (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) in her right hand—I called to the constable to take the pin from her, which he did—she struggled again—this pin, (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) which is bent from having been stuck in my belt, was picked, up afterwards—she was then taken to the station, being very violent all the time—I said to the constable as we were going along "I am bleeding"—I could feel myself bleeding, and when I got to the station, before I charged her, I felt very sick and faint—I was examined by the divisional surgeon, and afterwards by Dr. Hallen, who dressed my wound and sent for the police inspector—I was then attended to by my own doctor—I was on the sick list for three weeks.</p>

I am the medical officer to the Central London Railway—at 4.30 p.m., on November 12th, I examined Allen, who was in bed—I found a small punctured wound on the left side, about an inch off the middle line just over the stomach—he was suffering from shock and was vomiting—I should say the wound was about two inches deep, and was such as could be caused by a hat pin—if it had been two inches higher, it would have been over the heart—if the pin had been dirty, it might have set up blood poisoning, and there was also a risk of peritonitis—he was in bed two weeks, and went to the seaside for a week—he is all right now, but for a little nervousness—I saw his belt, upon which was a mark as if it had been caused by a sharp pin-considerable force must have been used to have penetrated a tunic, a waistcoat, and two flannel shirts.</p>

Egyptian £1000 bearer bond, No. 158,487 was mining, which I had seen last on April 15th, when the dividend was payable, and the coupons had been detached—on the Saturday I missed the stamp album from another safe—there was also £14 6s. missing from petty cash.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a financial agent, of 58, Rue Defacqz, Brussels—I first met Brown in February last, in Brussels—I saw him very frequently—on May 30th telephoned me saying he had an Egyptian bond for £1,000, and could I let him have 3,000 francs on it that afternoon—I said I thought there would be no difficulty, and he said "I am <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to a banker whom I know, and if I do not do it there, can I come to you," I said "Yes, but not later than 3.30"—he came round at 3.30<hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>, and produced an Egyptian bearer 4 percent, bond for £1,000, saying that he had been trying to negotiate it all the morning, but that the Credit Lyonnais asked fifteen days to do it in, and other bankers wanted various times, from four days upwards—I suggested sending the bond to London, and getting the money wired over in the morning, but he said "No, I could do that myself"—I then asked him where the bond came from, and he said "From Mr. Harris, in Odessa"—Mr. Harris is a well-known engineer in the employ of the Russian Government—he also said that it had come through the Credit Lyonnais—I asked him if he had had a letter with the bond, and he said "No, but Mr. Harris wrote to me a few days ago stating that he was sending on some stuff"—we then went to Cook's, the tourist people, and the cashier there lent me 5,000 francs on it, which I gave to Brown—they sent the bond to their head office in London, with instructions to sell it, and I was to call for the balance in two or three days—I went there on the Thursday, and the cashier informed me that the head office had declined to deal with it, and the bond was returned on the Friday, on which day, at my suggestion, it was sent to Messrs. Bendon, a firm of stockbrokers in London, with instructions to sell it—£201 was remitted by them to <hi rend="italic">Cook's</hi>, through Nathan, Hardy and Company, to repay the advance of 5,000 francs—I made enquiries at the Credit Lyonnais.</p>

Bendon at the end of June mentioning the circumstances, and suggesting them seeing Brown and going to the bottom of the thing—I received a letter from them saying that as I introduced the business, they considered it quite good enough, and they declined to interfere in the matter.</p>

I am the wife of Horace Seymour Mortimer, who has pleaded guilty to certain charges of stealing from his employers—on September 29th I was living with him at 127, Calabria Road, Highbury—on the afternoon of that day I was called out of the Marlborough Theatre, where I was witnessing the performance, by Brown, whom I had known previously—he said "I want you to be brave, and I will help you all I can. Your husband has gone away, and I want you to let me go up to your house for letters and papers which arc in your husband's</p>

Ashley Tee and Co. communicated with me with reference to the loss of some bonds, and I went to Mortimer's house with his father. where I found him, gone—I saw Mrs. Mortimer and a servant there—on October 5th I saw Brown in the Globe public house in Bow Street, and I told him that I was a police officer and that I was going to make enquiries respecting Horace Seymour Mortimer for stealing Argentine and Egyptian bonds from his employers. (<hi rend="italic">With a view to seeing whether Browns statement on that occasion was admissible</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that Brown was virtually in custody, and therefore his statement was inadmissible, but the</hi> Court <hi rend="italic">over-ruled the objection</hi>)—I went on to-say, "I understand you have been doing business with him; will you tell me what the business was?" he said, "Yes, I have only had one transaction with him, and that I was shot over"—I said, '"What do you mean?" he said, "My friends and I were shot over it—then I asked him what business it was, and he said, "Mr. Mortimer came to me in Brussels with a letter of introduction from a Mr. Ashworth, who was a friend of Mortimer. He told me he had a £l,000 Egyptian bond, which he asked me to negotiate, which I did. I took the bond to the Credit Lyonnais in Brussels when I was there, but the Credit Lyonnais said before they would advance money on it, it would take several days to make enquiries. I told this to Mortimer, and he said it would not do. I then took it to Mr. Brydone, and after three days I obtained a £450 loan on it. Mortimer at this time had returned to London, and I sent the money to him"—I asked him what he received, and he said, "I received £5 for the transaction"—he did not say when he got it, but that it was sent to him by cheque—I asked him how long the loan was for, and he said six months—I said, "So that six months has not run out," and he said, "No, the time has not expired"—I asked him if he had had any other transaction with Mortimer, and he said, "No "-if he had refused to go to the police office with me I should not have forced him to go—we went in a cab, and on the way to the station I produced this police notice (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), and pointed to a description of the Argentine bonds and said, "Do you know anything about these?" and he said, "No"—he then pointed to the</p>

               <p>description of the Egyptian bond and said, "That would be the one I negotiated"—we then went to the Commissioner's office, where I sent for Mr. Herbert Tee, to which he did not object in the slightest—he made a statement, which was taken down in writing by Mr. Tee—there was no threat or inducement of any kind held out to him before he made the statement—half an hour after, at the Cloak Lane police station, he was then given into custody by Mr. Tee, and charged with being concerned <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">did not press for the statement in writing that Brown made on this occasion to be put in evidence</hi>)—in reply to the charge he said, "I did not know the bonds were stolen"—I then searched him and found two receipts for the four Argentine bonds from Marshall &amp;Co.—before he was charged he voluntarily gave up these coupons which had been attached to the bonds (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he also gave us Mortimer's address in Paris on a piece of paper—I then went to 23, Broad Court Flats, where Brown lived, where I found a pocket book containing the following entries: "158487 general debit. Daira Sanieh 4 per cent., 25,000 fr." "Mortimer, co Echos, London"; that is the telegraphic address of Ashley, Tee &amp;Co.; and "127, Calabria Road, Highbury." "A. A.

Box 24, Leeds—I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at Bow Street—I never sent the letter produced offering 450 francs with a rise to 700 francs per month—I never made any appointment with the prisoner at Derby nor saw him in Leeds—ours is a private firm and we have no board of directors.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>), Up to July last I was residing at 1, Rue de Vitry, Choisy le Roi—I am a French subject—I was employed at Choisy le Roi in some glass works at 150 francs a month—in July I saw this advertisement in <hi rend="italic">Le Journal</hi>, from J. Pearson &amp;Co., 6, Mason's Avenue, Coleman Street. London. E.C., and in consequence of communi<lb/>cations with the advertisers I came to England—I arrived on August 18th—on August 20th I went to their premises and was introduced by Mr. Pearson to the prisoner as the clerk who could speak to me in French—the prisoner said he would immediately put himself in communication with a firm in Leeds, and I was to come back the following Saturday for the reply—on my calling on Saturday, August 27th, he said he must go to Leeds on my behalf, and he asked me for £1 for his expenses—he said he must see Mr. Josephy—he gave me the receipt produced for the £1 which I gave him—he wrote it in my presence—on Tuesday, August 30th, he came to my lodgings at 32, South Molton Street, and said he wanted another £1 to go to Leeds to take my testimonials and my photograph to show Messrs. Cohen, Josephy &amp;Co.—I gave him another £1 and the documents—he showed me a letter and stated that that firm were asking for a clerk at 450 francs a month—the letter was in English, and I did not understand it, but I saw the figures 450 francs, and I paid him the £1 which he asked for, believing the representations which he made to me—he took the letter away (<hi rend="italic">This letter was called for and not produced</hi>)—I believe I next saw him the following Saturday at my place—he showed me, I think on that day, an address card which he said he bad received from Messrs. Cohen &amp; Josephy to go to Derby to see the principal partner there—he said he was to be received by Mr. Josephy the following Sunday at Derby between twelve and one—I paid him 10s., believing his representations, but I was beginning to have my doubts, so I asked him whether it mattered if I went to Derby with him—he hesitated, and then said that as he had not informed the gentleman at Derby that I was coming the gentleman would probably think it strange, and it would look as if he was throwing me in his face, and in order to show that he was zealous for my interest, he said it would be throwing away money needlessly for me to go—the following day I received this post card dated 4.9.04: "I have just returned, been well received, my impression is very good. He did not say anything at the end to me except that the directors would decide first, but I have great confidence in the result"—the following week I saw the prisoner at Messrs. Pearson's, when he asked me for 5s. to make up the amount he had spent, so as to compete the receipt for 55s. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) which he then gave me—I fully believed the representations which he made, and so parted with my money—this receipt was already prepared (<hi rend="italic">Tin's was signed J. Wauters</hi>)—I afterwards received post cards from him—on the first occasion that I saw him, on Saturday. August 27th, when I advanced him the first £1. he said the</p>

               <p>money was to be advanced for travelling expenses, and that it would be returned to me if I did not succeed in getting the situation—I asked him several times for its return, and he always assured me that it would be returned to me, but I never had it back, or any part of it—I afterwards communicated with Messrs. Cohen and Josephy. and with the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by he prisoner.</hi> I never had any communications with you before I saw you at Pearson's office—I was employed for three years at a glass works at Choisy le Roi—my salary was 150 francs a month—I came to England as a warehouseman—I left my employment a few days before I came to London—I gave a week's notice—I was paid fortnightly by a previous arrangement with the firm—I should not have left my situation but for the letters I received from Pearson's—the two last letters which I received in Paris made me come here—one is dated July 5th—that is a mistake for August, which is about the time I received it—I do not remember if this is the envelope—I received two letters, but I did not keep everything, a? I did not know then that I was being deceived—I have looked for that letter, but have been unable to find it—the letter came in an envelope with a receipt—there were two letters and one receipt in the envelope—the letter stated, "We cannot get you the situa<lb/>tion unless you are over here to be introduced to the firm"—as the result of that I swear that I gave up my situation—the letter produced, stating that I complained of the brutality of my late firm, is false; I have never seen it before—I told my late firm that a situation was going to be obtained for me in London, and nothing else—I first called at Pearson's in the afternoon, about four—I said I had come to London with 1,000 francs, and that I could wait for the situation—you followed me out of the office when I went out for refreshment at a public house—you did not send me to Bellamy's warehouse in Great Tower Street—you asked me whether I would mind going into the country, and I said, "No, that would suit me very well"—you asked me if I could advance travelling expenses, and I said "Yes, everything that was necessary provided that I succeeded"—you did not mention on August 27th the name, you simply said it was a firm at Leeds—I do not remember your mentioning a vacancy at the Aylestone Laundry, near Leicester—I gave up all my papers to the police—I brought my photograph and my testimonials to you without being asked—I took you to dinner at 5, Windmill Street, W.—I do not remember meeting a loose woman about 9 p.m.—I have never entrusted my affairs to a woman—I have never had any relations with a woman in London—I did not pay you 10s. on September 3rd, at 12, Charlotte Street; we had two drinks, and I did not understand English money, so I handed you a sovereign to pay for the drinks, and you gave me the change; it had nothing to do with the money I gave you for expenses—I did not say to you, "Now, you have got more money than I have"—on September 10th I waited for you in Pearson's office, you accompanied me to the door—you wrote the name of Cohen on a piece of paper at my place—I no longer have it—I did not get your receipt for £2 15s. on that day—you gave me that the last time I went to Pearson's, when you</p>

               <p>asked me for an extra 5s.: and when you accompanied mo as far as the door—it was at the door on that day that you handed me the receipt and asked me for the extra 5s. I sware it—I do not know where Basinghall Street is—we went out of Mason's Avenue together, and into a restaurant in a basement, the last time I went to Pearson's—you sad. "Wait for me until I have finished my work at 2 o'clock, and we will go and have something to eat." and I waited for you—I do not remember going to 47, London Wall, but we did go to a restaurant——I saw a young Frenchman there—you had a cup of coffee—the dinner was not for you because I had had my dinner—I did invite you—I paid 5s. in the restaurant—I gave you a pound out of which to pay, as I did not understand English money—in my information to the police I said what I have said here—I sware I never lent you 5s.—I asked you to refund my money every time I paid you anything, and that is the reason I asked you for receipts—I cannot speak to dates because after two months I cannot remember them—I have said: "On the 10th of September I asked Mr. Wauters several times to return me the 50s., and he said it would be returned by Messrs. Pearson in the event of want of success"—Mr. Pearson referred me to you because I could not speak English, and it was to you I had to address myself—on the very first day I arrived, Mr. Pearson referred me to you as being the person with whom I should have to deal—I did not write for the return of my money because I had too much confidence in you—on September 3rd I had my doubts—I said that I did not understand how it was possible to spend some hundreds of francs in so few days—I had no relations with other persons, therefore I could not bring accusations against them—I had disputes in connection with food, but not in connection with money—some persons charged me £1 for food and travelling for three persons for everyday—I gave them what they asked for—I remained with them three days—in Windmill Street you had a bottle of champagne—you did not oppose it and say, "You are throwing away your money"—I do not remember whether I saw you after September 10th—on September 16th I went to Pearson's office with another person—I have sworn I did not see you after September 10th, but I did not say I had not been to Pearson's—I went there on September 16th. but it was the person who was with me who asked if Mr. Pearson or you were in, and Mr. Pearson replied to my interpreter that you were away on your holiday—I went to ask for a reply which I had been patiently waiting for for three weeks, and to say I had been to Whiteley's for a situation and had not got it—Whiteley's said they did not want anybody, and that, as I could not speak English, I was no use to them—my interpreter told this to Pearson—I saw a young girl who does type-writing—I do not remember seeing you on September 16th—I had asked you to send me all letters in reference to the Leeds or Derby affairs—the police prohibited me about that time from having any interview with Pearson's or their clerk—I went to the police on the 15th—I am certain I did not go back to Pearson's afterwards—I received no blue envelope containing a private card and a letter—I first went to the police at</p>

               <p>Scotland Yard, and an officer directed me in French to Old Jewry—my statement was taken down, but it was not on the first day—at Scotland Yard I showed all Pearson's letters—three hours after I saw Collinson, an officer at Old Jewry—you wrote the paper you gave me with the name of Cohen on, I think before you went to Derby—on September 12th the proprietor of a public house telephoned for me to Cohen's—I asked Cohen's to put me in communication with Mr. Josephy or some one who could speak French—they replied, "We will talk any language you like"—the following day I wrote to them—I wrote to a friend to say I expected a situation at 450 francs a month—I did not say I should be satisfied with 250 francs a month—I wrote to my late employer at Choisy to reply quickly to any letters he might receive—you told me you were going to Leeds, and that you would send me a reply on the following Monday—I have not said that you would refund my mosey in the event of want of success, but that your firm would refund it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired traveller of 2, Bank's Villas, Weston-super-Mare—during September and October, 1903 I was negotiating with Messrs. Wansbrough &amp;Co., of 10, Upper Baker Street—I got into communication with them through an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi> about a public house for sale—I was thinking of buying a public house—this one was the White Swan, at Salisbury Court, Fleet Street—Mr. Gibson was the licensee at the time—November 11th, 1903 was the date fixed for taking possession—the purchase price was, I think. £7,500—as deposit, I paid £50 on September 25th and £150 on the 26th, to Wansbrough &amp;Co., this is their receipt—I paid altogether £607 14s.—I did not get possession on November 11th, I have not the slightest idea why—all the information I had was that the vendor would not give up possession, and the matter fell through—I was dealing with the prisoner as Wansbrough &amp;Co., and I met him in connection with them—I do not know what he had got to do with them—I wrote to Wansbrough &amp;Co. and got some letters signed by them—I got this one. dated November 28th, 1903: <hi rend="italic">"He</hi> White Swan, Salisbury" Court. Our Mr. Leech, who has this matter in hand, has been away for over a week ill. On his return to office, he will give the matter his attention. With compliments, we are. yours faithfully, Wansbrough &amp;Co. W.G."—I also got this one, dated December—4th: "Dear Sir,—Re White Swan. In reply to your favour of yesterday's date, we are pleased to inform you that our Mr. Leech is much better, and on his return to the office next week, your matter shall receive his best attention. Yours faithfully. Wansbrough &amp;Co."—I did not get any money from them until I instructed my solicitors, who were Messrs Wansbrough of Bristol and Wcston-Super-Mare—after a time I got £349 19s. repaid—an action was brought for the balance—I never got any more money—I got judgment but unsatisfied.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I paid some cheques besides those for £50 and £150 deposit—the others were not deposit, they were for purchase—I handed the money to the prisoner—I did not see Leech; he was not there at the time—I have seen him several times at the office, and he went with me to Mr. Gibson's—I handed Wausbrough &amp;Co. four cheques, and asked them to pass them through their bank: they were payable to me—the amount was altogether £607, made up of two distinct sums—I do not know whose fault it was that I did not get the house—I know that Mr. Gibson would not carry out the contract—Leech came down to me twice at Weston—he and the prisoner suggested that I should advance £10 to get Gibson to carry out his contract, and I am aware that a solicitor was employed to do something in it—I think a writ was issued against Gibson—I believe £500 was tendered to him in a cheque on the prisoner's firm, and he refused to take it—I had a letter saying that my money had been tendered that morning by Leech and a solicitor's clerk—it was after that that I put the affairs in the hands of Wansbrouch, Dickinson, Robinson &amp; Taylor of Bristol—the second time anybody came to me I said everything must come through them—I know nothing about buying public houses—I had confidence in the</p>

               <p>people I was dealing with—a few days previous to my taking possession I had the four cheques in my possession for goods I had sold, and I did not want to keep them about any longer, and I asked the prisoner if he would give me a receipt for them and pay the money through a solicitor to Gibson—I knew they were going through the prisoner's bank, and it was done with my authority—I found out from the Bristol firm that a writ had been issued against Gibson—I think it was for the recovery of the money—I do not think it was to compel Gibson—the Bristol firm advised me to drop the action—I instructed my solicitors to try and get the money back from Wansbrough &amp;Co.—I made no stipulation as to getting the whole sum at once—I do not know that the solicitors claimed £400 odd first, leaving out the £200, because I left it entirely in their hands—I agreed to pay the prisoner the percentage commission on the total price if the thing went through, but not if it did not go through—I expected to get the house or damages—I signed for £500—I had a claim against the prisoner for £200 after the £349, 10s. was paid—I do not suggest the prisoner did me out of any money besides the £200.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I parted with £607 14s.—this is the writ my solicitors issued against the prisoner, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "The plaintiff's claim is against the defendants for the sum of £247 5s. for balance of monies payable by the defendants to the plaintiff for money received by the defendants for the use of the plaintiff.

               <p>Wansbrouuh &amp;Co., solicitors, of Bristol—I believe they do a large amount of licencing business—the prisoner is not connected with that firm—about December 23rd, 1903, we took up a matter on behalf of Messrs. Wansbrough of a claim by Mr. Thomas of £607 14s. from Wansbrough &amp;Co., of 10, Upper Baker Street—I went there about six times—on the first occasion, December 23rd, I did not see anybody, the place was shut up, I think it was late—next day I went with the managing clerk of Wansbrough &amp;Co., of Bristol, and saw the prisoner, I never saw Leech at the office; he was the other partner—the managing clerk of the Bristol firm demanded the return of the £607 from the prisoner, who said he could do nothing in the matter as it was in the hands of his solicitors—I called on January 6th with Mr. Dickinson, a member of the Bristol firm, and he demanded the money from the prisoner, who then said his partner, Mr. Leech, was attending to the matter—Mr. Dickinson, in my presence, said he did not care who was attending to the matter, but he wanted the money on behalf of Mr. Thomas—the prisoner said, "You had better call and see Mr. Leech; he will be in this afternoon"—we called at about 3 p.m. that day and saw a clerk who showed us this cheque, which was to be sent through Lumleys—a letter was also produced covering the cheque—the cheque is for £349 19s.—Mr. Dickinson declined to receive the cheque through Lumley's, and it came to the office next morning by post—Mr. Cecil Lumley was retained by the prisoner, to act for Thomas—we also got this letter, dated January 6th: '"Dear Sirs,—Herewith we beg to enclose your account against Mr. J. E. Thomas concerning the monies lodged in our hands, viz. £40714., by him on October 23rd last. The balance due to Mr. Thomas, viz., £342 19s., we are prepared to hand over, at any time, through our solicitors. Messrs. Lumley and Co., in discharge of this account; it must be strictly without prejndice to any claim of demand that we may have against Mr. Thomas, re the £200 still in our possession, which was paid to us on account of the purchase of the 'White Swan,' Salisbury Court, E.C., on behalf of the vendor, Mr. Thomas Gibson.—Yours faithfully, pp. Wansbrough &amp;Co., W.G."—enclosed with it was Exhibit 21, which gives credit for £407 14s. only, that is irrespective of the £200 deposit—then "To disbursements £10 10s.; extra services rendered £26 5s.; paid Messrs. Lumley &amp;Co., £21 = £57 14s. "—that added to £349 19s. makes £407 14s.—I presume the cheque was met; I sent it down to the country; we issued a writ for the balance—I got judgment for £122 10s., which was ordered to be paid within a certain number of days, and a further sum of £26 5s. was ordered to be paid into Court, with leave to defend as to the balance—I got the £122 10s., and I took the balance of £26 5s. out of Court after the trial, and I got judgment for the remainder, but of course that has not been paid—it did not come to trial; a few days before the trial I received a letter from the solicitors for the defendants saying they would not contest it, and consented to judgment—it came before the Judge, and judgment was signed on <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 1st for £124 15s., less £26 5s., which is £98 10s.—I served a bank<lb/>ruptcy notice on both parties.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was clear that the £607 was divided into two parts, the £200 and the balance—the cheque for £349 simply dealt with the £407—the cheque for £349 19s. was accepted; the amount endorsed on the writ for which I sued was £247 5s.—I saw some of the papers after the Bristol firm came up to see us—the action was commenced against Gibson—I suppose there were a good many interviews by Leech or some member of the firm—I have heard that Leech went down to Weston twice, but he was not asked to go—at the time the judgment was sinned the prisoner's firm told me that they had nothing left—we got nothing on our judgment, perhaps that proves that they had nothing.</p>

I am a cashier at the London and County Bank, Edgware Road—on December loth, 1903, Elrick had an account there, and on that day he drew out notes and gold for £100; the notes were for £10 each. Nos. 42,349 and 42,350 and 8,101 to 8,108—on January 6th, 1904. he drew out twenty £10 notes, Nos., 51,385-51,400 and 4,801-4,804.</p>

                  </hi>. I am accountant at the National Provincial Bank, Baker Street—Wansbrough &amp;Co., of 10, Upper Baker Street, had an account there; it was opened on January 19th, 1903, with a deposit of £35, and either Walter Leech or Thomas Charrington had the right to draw—this is a certified copy of the account—on January 5th, 1904, I find £50 was paid in in bank notes—on January 7th, £180 was was paid in in notes—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I am very sorry for the man. I had an accident at the beginning of February, and have not been able to do anything since"—I went to 104, George Street, where I found some books and papers of Wansbrough &amp;Co's.—the prisoner had recently taken on another business as an hotel valuer, and was carrying it on there as Magge &amp;Co.—I found the bank pass book, paying-in book, cheque books, the duplicate agreement as to the sale of the Blue Lion, a brief for the prisoner in the action of Mr. Thomas, an agree<lb/>ment with Mr. Gibson, a bankruptcy notice from Ford &amp; Ford, some County Court summonses, a letter from Messrs. Knapp &amp; Fisher, solicitors, demanding repayment of £20 deposit, and a number of other letters to the same effect—I also found at his house in Edgware Road certain letters like the one of July 5th, and worded in exactly the same way—one is to Mr. Crisp, and others are not addressed; they all contain the word "unwarrantable" written in in the prisoner's writing—there is also a list of creditors in his writing.</p>

Dorinda Street, Finsbury—between 8 and 9 a.m. on November 4th I saw two pigs on a truck outside Eastman's, in Charter-house Street—I was going over to the meat market with some beef when I saw the prisoner making his way towards Aldersgate Street with two pigs on his back—on going back to Eastman's, I found that the pigs had gone, but the truck was still there.</p>

Barrett—I cannot say whether he received more letters; this is the only one I saw in the case, with a glass door to it, which is locked, and where the letters are in the ordinary course put—I asked him if he had had it, and he said he had—he did not say anything about the contents of the parcel—he did not sign the visitors' book.</p>

I have had 20 years' experience of examining handwritings—I have compared the signature on the cheque marked "B" for £1 8s. 7d. of Barrett and Sons with the signatures on the cheque for £384 16s. 3d. marked "A" and the order form for a cheque book marked "C," and I believe the signatures on "A "and "C "were both modeled from the signature on "B"—my reasons for saying that are that the entire measurements of the signatures are practically identical, so much so that a tracing of the signature on "B" practically corresponds with the tracing of the signatures on "A" and "C"—the undulation of the letters corresponds exactly in the three signatures and the distance between each letter is practically identical—the resemblance is too close, showing they are traced, and that is borne out by the fact that on examining the sig<lb/>nature on "A" there are still to be found traces of bluish pencil, showing that it has been traced—you never find two signatures exactly alike as these are—over the top arch of the "A" there is a blue pencil line and again over the top arch of the "B"—it was rubbed out as far as it could be; the tail of the "B "has been painted, and the "B" is not a clean stroke all the way through on the forgery, whereas it is a clean line in the original—I have had the letter marked "N" produced by Brown, and also the torn-up letter found by Drew, and I have compared the writings on these documents with something written after the prisoner was in custody—I cannot profess an opinion as to their being the same, but there are resemblances—I should not have taken the letter "N "and the document "P" to be written by the same person; the writing on "P" seems to be distorted—"N" is better handwriting than "P."</p>

"Yes"—I told him I did not believe his story, and I had information that it was not correct—he said, "No, I am ordering it for another man who is over the road"—he then conducted me to a hansom in the Maryle<lb/>bone Road, where Critchley was sitting—I asked him to get out. and told him I was a police officer, and added, "This man says you directed him to order the lead"'—Critchley said, "No, I did not, he ordered it"—Seagrave made no reply—I then asked Critchley if he represented Mears. Free &amp; Sons, of Maidenhead; he said, '"Yes"—I asked him what position he occupied there, and he said he was a clerk—I asked him if he was still in the employment, and he said "Yes"—I told him I was not satisfied with his statement, and he would be taken to the Nation—I took them both it to custody, and they were subsequently charged—they made no reply—they both gave a false address—on Seagrave I found £9 in gold.</p>

               <p>I had arrested the prisoner in Brushfield Street at midnight before I saw the prosecutor—I arrested him, on the description I had received—I was patrolling outside the station and saw the prisoner—He is pretty well" known in the neighbourhood from doing tricks with bottles—I arrested him about fifty yards from the Horn of Plenty—I told him I was going to take him into custody on a description for assaulting a man outside the Horn of Plenty about 10.30 that evening—he said, "What, me! You have made the biggest mistake in your life; a million to one on it; I was never in is he Horn of Plenty; I was in the Rose and Crown and the Red Lion that night; I do not do that for a living; I am the champion bottle and wheel carrier"—each public house is within fifty yards of each other—I took the prisoner to the station, and the prosecutor was brought there from the London Hospital 'next morning—the prisoner was placed with ten others in a row—the prosecutor saw the prisoner's back first—I told the prosecutor-we had the bottle carrier detained—he picked the prisoner out—the men were as like the prisoner as we could get from the street—I believe two had soft felt hats, but not so large as the prisoner's—most of them had caps on—the prosecutor picked him out and said, "That is the man that seized me by the neck"—the prisoner said, "I have never seen the man before; you have made a <hi rend="italic">bloomer</hi> this time. What public house do you say it was? I was in the Rose and Crown last night, nowhere else; I can prove it; yes, I remember you; I had a drink with you in the Horn of Plenty; I can prove I was in the Rose and Crown when this happened; I will make you sit up for this; the boys will make you sit up for this"—the prosecutor had said this had happened between 10 and 11—I searched the prisoner and found a mouth organ and some things he does his tricks with on him—I "did not find a watch and chain on him, and only 10d. in bronze.</p>

About 1.20 a.m. on this morning I was on duty with another officer and was called to this house in Queen Street—I saw the prosecutrix sitting on a chair bleeding-from wounds on the neck—Robert Heath spoke to me, in consequence of which I went with the other officer to 9. May's Buildings—I told the prisoner I was going to arrest him for causing grievous bodily harm to his mother—I took him to 5, Queen Street, and said to the prosecutrin, "Is this your son who stabbed you?" she replied, "Yes, I do not wish to harm the boy"—I took him to the station—this black handled knife was handed me by Robert Heath—the white handled knife was brought to the station by the son-in-law—the prisoner had been drinking—he seemed cool and collected.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Wrottesley Road, Plumstead—the deceased was my mother—she was about 77 years old—for some years her health had been very bad—I have known the prisoner all my life—she was in my mother's service all my life—she acted as nurse to my mother for about 20 years—my mother had been a chronic invalid for about that time—in January or February last she had a paralvtic stroke—since then the-prisoner was in constant attendance day and night upon her—I last saw my mother alive on November 23rd, the day before her death, about 9.45 to 9.30 p.m.—next morning I left the house about 8.10—the prisoner gave me my breakfast as usual—I asked her about my mother—she said, very much the same"—the prisoner usually dressed in the morning in a print dress—there was nobody in the house usually but my mother and the prisoner—I returned home about 11 a.m. in consequence of a telephone message—mv sister opened the door—I saw the prisoner in the dining</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My mother's illness was of a very painful character and at times she endured exeraciating pain—I had noticed that a day or two before the murder, the prisoner seemed very much distressed and troubled by witnessing my mother's pain and suffering—she repeatedly remarked how terrible it was to see—the prisoner was devotedly attached to her and the whole family—she had been with my mother since a little girl of 13, that would be 47 years—during my lifetime she had given faithful and loving service and had shown no sign at any time of malice or hostility to any one—I always heard the family speak to her devotion throughout—since I can remember she has been regarded as a friend of the family—when I returned on the 24th at 11, she was not crying, but she hardly seemed to realise the horror of the thing she had done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William John Lawson, of 19, Isler Road. Plumstead—my husband was a son of the deceased—I went to see my mother-in-law every day—on November 23rd, she was very weak—I went on November 24th about 9 a.m.—I let myself in—I was taking off my things in the dining room when the prisoner came in saying, "Oh, I have killed your mother"—I said, "No, Mary, you could not"—she said, "I have, I don't know why I did it, but I have cut her throat with a razor"—I noticed that she was wearing her afternoon black dress—she was wringing her hands and seemed very distressed—I ran upstairs into mother's room—I only got to the foot of the bed when I saw she was dead or I thought she was—I ran out of the room and went for Dr. Bryson—she was lying in her bed in exactly the name position as I saw her the night previous.</p>
