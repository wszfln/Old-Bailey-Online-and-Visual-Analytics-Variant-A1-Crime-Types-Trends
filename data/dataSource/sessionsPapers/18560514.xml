                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, residing at No. 4, Victoria-street, Holborn. I am in the habit of attending races, and betting occa<lb/>sionally on races—I knew the deceased, John Parsons Cook—I had known him, I should think, about two years—I was at the Shrewsbury races in Nov., 1855—I remember the race for the Shrewsbury Handicap—a mare, called "Polestar," the property of Mr. Cook, won that race—it was on Tuesday, 13th Nov.—I saw Mr. Cook on that day on the course—he then appeared quite as well as he had been for any time that I had known him—I had been in the habit of seeing him at different races—while I was at Shrewsbury I was stopping at the Raven Hotel—I know Palmer the prisoner, very well—I have known him, I should think, about the same time I have known Cook, or perhaps a little more—Cook and Palmer were also stopping at the Raven Hotel—they occupied the adjoining room to mine—there was only a wooden partition between my room and their's—they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140006"/>
               <p>occupied a sitting room jointly—I saw them there together—between 11 and 12 o'clock, on the Wednesday night, I went into their sitting room—I thete found Mr. Cook, Mr. Palmer, and Mr. Myatt; I believe ne is a saddler, at Kugeley—he is a friend of Palmer's—they each appeared to have some grog before them—I observed that Cook had a glass of brandy and water before him—he asked me to sit down, and I did so—Cook asked Palmer to have some more brandy and water—Palmer said, "I shall not have any more till you have drunk yours"—Cook on that said, "Oh, I will drink mine"—he then took Up his glass and drank it at a draught, or nearly so; he might have made two draughts of it—he drank it off immediately—after he had drunk it, he said there was something in it—he said that within a minute after he had drunk it—he said, "It burns my throat dreadfully," or some such words—on his saying that, Palmer got up, and took up the glass—he sipped up what was left in the glass, and said, "There is nothing in it"—I should think there was certainly not more than a teaspoonful left in the glass—Cook had apparently emptied the glass—in the mean time a Mr. Read, whom I knew, came in—he is a wine merchant—he attends races—Palmer handed the glass to him, and asked him if he thought there was anything in it—it was handed to me also—Mr. Read and I each said, the glass being so empty, we could not recognize anything—I said I thought there was rather a strong scent on it—I did not make any other remark, only that I could not detect anything besides brandy—I could not say there was anything besides brandy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you taste it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no chance of tasting it—I did not put it to my lips—the glass was completely drained at the time—I gave my opinion about it from the smell.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">submitted that no such statement was receivable.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD CAMPBELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion, that anything stated as to the effect produced upon him by what he had taken was admissible</hi>)—he said he had been very sick—he thought that d—d Palmer had <hi rend="italic">dosed</hi> him—he handed me over some money on that occasion—it was over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot remember exactly; between 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was all in bank notes—he gave it me to take care of it—he did not say until when I was to take care of it—Palmer and Cook did not sleep in the same room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After he had given you this money, did you see him again suffering that night from sickness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes; he was seized immediately again, in my sitting room, with vomiting—that was after he had given me the money—he retired to some place of retirement, and came back to me again—he again explained to me from what he had been suffering, and asked me to go to his bedroom—he repeated what he had said before, that he had been again very sick—I went Up to Ms bedroom with him; and a Mr. Jones, a stationer, who was there, went with me to his bedroom—while I was there he vomited again violently—foe was so ill, that I thought it right to send for a doctor, Mr. Gibson—Mr. Gibson came and attended him—we remained with him till 2 o'clock, or a little after—I went for Mr. Gibson a second time—I should think it must have been about half past 12, or a quarter to 1 o'clock, that Mr. Gibson was sent for first, and about twenty minutes afterwards we sent for him again, or sent for some second medicine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that Palmer left Shrewsbury immediately after the races? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a report of that kind—I do not know it—I did not see him any more after the races that day—I saw Cook and Palmer too at the Unicorn on the Wednesday night, before I saw them at the Kaven—I think that was about 9 o'clock, or between 9 and 10 o'clock—I cannot say whether he was drinking there—I merely looked into the room and stepped back again—I saw Mr. Saunders, the trainer, in the room, with Mr. Palmer, Mr. Cook, and a lady—I do not know whether they had glasses and drink before them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether it happened to a good many persona to be ill at Shrewsbury on the Tuesday or Wednesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not know that it did, I did not hear of it, I had a friend who was rather poorly there, but a different kind of illness to Mr. Cook's, not at all serious—I do not know that many people connected with the races felt ill, and complained of illness—I think the Wednesday was rather a dull day; it was damp under foot, but I do not know that it rained, I forget—I saw Cook about the race course several times on the Wednesday—I remember that the weather was rather cold and damp on the Thursday, but whether it rained or not I would not swear—I think we had some rain on the Thursday, but I would not swear—I do not know whether Cook and Palmer breakfasted together on the Thursday morning, but I believe they did—I cannot say that I saw them together on the course on the Thursday—I do not know whether they left Shrewsbury together—on 17th Nov. I received a letter from Cook—the solicitor has it—this is it—it is dated Rugeley, 16th Nov., 1855—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Dear Usher,—It is of very great importance to both Mr. Palmer and myself that a sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid to Mr. Pratt, of Queen-street, Mayfair, to-morrow, without fail; 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been sent up to<lb/>night, and if you will be kind enough to pay the other 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to<lb/>morrow, on receipt of this, you will greatly oblige me; I will settle it on Monday, at Tattersall's.

I am a law stationer, in Carey-street I was at Shrews<lb/>bury bury races last Nov.—I lodged at the Raven—I got there on the Monday night—on that night Cook supped there with me and Mr. Herring, Mr. Fisher, and a person of the name of Grabatt—he appeared well—I saw him on the Tuesday, and on the Wednesday again, and he appeared quite well on those days—I and Mr. Fisher went to the Raven between 11 and 12 o'clock on Wednesday night—Read was also with us there in the same room—Cook came into my room, and invited me into his; I went there and found, among others, Mr. Palmer there—I did not go into the room with Mr. Fisher and Mr. Read, I went up stairs first, and then went in and found Palmer and other persons—after the party broke up, Fisher came to me and told me something about Cook, in consequence of which I went up into his bedroom and found him complaining of a burning in his throat, and saw him vomiting—some medicine was brought, some pills and a draught—Cook refused to take the pills, and in consequence of that I went to the medical man, I do not know his name—I got some liquid medicine which I brought back, and gave a portion of it to Cook, about a teaspoon full, I think; I put a small quantity in a wine glass, and added some water in it—he was then in bed—after twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour he took the pills also—I saw him again next morning early, between 6 and 7 o'clock; he was still in bed, and told me he felt easier and better than on the pre<lb/>vious night—he looked pale being in bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Victoria-street, near Farringdon-market, and keep a house there frequented by sporting men. I was acquainted with Cook and with Palmer—I saw them at Shrewsbury races in Nov.—I was there on the Tuesday of the race, and saw them both on the course—I saw Cook more than once on the course, and had one bet with him—he appeared on that Tuesday in his usual health, as well as I have always seen him—I was on the course on the following day, Wednesday, and saw him there then in apparently the same state of health—I stopped at the Raven—on that Wednesday night I went into the room where Palmer and Cook were sit<lb/>ting, at the Raven, between the hours of 11 and 12 o'clock—there was another gentleman in the room, and I think there was more than one—one gentleman was sitting on the sofa, and I saw Mr. Cook standing up, and Mr. Palmer standing up—it was merely a practice to go into the room before we went to bed, we were in adjoining rooms, and we went to have a</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Heathcote, a surgeon, at Shrewsbury. On 14th Nov. I was sent for to the Raven Hotel, Shrews<lb/>bury—I got there I suppose between 12 and 1 o'clock at night—I saw Mr. Cook in his bedroom, he was not in bed—he complained of pain in his stomach, and heat in his throat, and he likewise told me that he thought he had been poisoned—I felt his pulse, it was about ninety—I looked at his tongue, and it was perfectly clean—he appeared very much distended about the abdomen—I recommended him an emetic, and he said he could make himself sick with warm water—I sent the waitress for some warm water, and three quarters of a pint was brought—I recommended him a feather, and he said that he could make himself sick with the handle of a tooth brush, which he did—he drank the whole of the water—I noticed what came from him, it was perfectly clean and clear—I told him I would send him some medicine—I sent him two pills and a draught by Read—the pills were compound rhubarb and about three grains of calomel—it is in the Pharmacopœia—I sent directions that the draught was to be taken about twenty minutes afterwards—that was composed of mistura sennacum, that is an infusion of senna, what we call black draught—I afterwards, that same night, saw Mr. Jones—that could not have been much more than half an hour after I had given the pills and draught to Bead—I gave Mr. Jones some medicine for him, an anodyne draught and anti-spasmodic draught; that was divided into two draughts—Mr. Heathcote saw him that evening, but I did not see him after the time I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chambermaid at the Talbot Arms, Rugeley, in Nov. last—I had been about two years in that service—I know the prisoner—I did not know that he was in practice, but he was considered a medical man—he was in the habit of coming to the Talbot Arms—I knew Mr. Cook who died there—he came there on Thursday, 15th Nov., between 0 and 10 o'clock at night—the prisoner, I believe, came with him—they came in a fly—he retired to rest that night between 10 and 11 o'clock, about half past 10, perhaps—he complained that he had been poorly at Shrewsbury, and of feeling poorly then—I do not remember seeing Palmer after he get out of the fly—on the following morning, Friday, I took Mr. Cook up seme hot water, about 12 o'clock, and I think it was about I when he went out—he then appeared poorly; he felt no worse, he said, but he was not well—he came home that night to the Talbot Arms about 10 o'clock, and went to bed about half an hour afterwards, about half past 10—I asked him if he felt any worse than what he did when we went out—he said he felt no worse, and that he had been dining at Mr. Palmer's—he was perfectly sober—he asked me for an extra piece of candle, as he was going to read—I saw no more of him that night—on Saturday morning Palmer came over—I do not know exactly at what time, it might be perhaps about 8 o'clock—he lives opposite the Talbot Arms—I do not know whether Cook had sent for him—Palmer ordered a cup of coffee for Mr. Cook—he did not order it in our kitchen, I believe he ordered it of me—I believe I gave it to Mr. Cook, Palmer was then in the room—I took it up to the bedroom—Palmer was in Cook's bedroom—I did not see Cook drink it, I left it there in Cook's hands, and went down stairs—it might be an hour, or it might be a couple of hours afterwards, that I went up and found that it had been vomited into the utensil—I observed it in the chamber utensil, which was on the little table by the side of the bed, which he had on purpose that he could put his arm and reach it himself—I cannot remember that I spoke to Palmer at all about this now, or he to me—I did not see the toast and water in the bedroom that morning, or during that day—I did not observe a jug there; a jug was sent down to me from Cook's room for some fresh toast and water, but it was net given to me—I first saw that jug on Saturday night, as late as 10 o'clock—the waitress, I believe, brought it down for me to make some fresh toast and water—her</p>

JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What effect had your nibbing upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not rub it so very long—as soon as he thought I had rubbed it sufficiently, he thanked me, and I did not rub it again—I did not perceive that the stiffness had gone—Palmer was in the room after I rubbed his hand—while the jerking of the body was going on, Cook was quite conscious, and I noticed him to twitch while I was rubbing his hand—his arms seemed to twitch, and the body also—he seemed to twitch altogether—while this was going on he seemed to know all that was going forward—when Palmer came in be recognised him—he was throwing himself about the bed, and he said, "Oh, doctor, I shall die!"—he addressed Palmer when he said that—Palmer's reply was, "Oh, my lad, you won't"—Palmer left, to fetch something—I do not know exactly what he said, or what he did, but he seemed just to look at him, and then he went and asked me to stay by the bed side with him—he returned very shortly, I should think, as quick as he could possibly go over, I should think two minutes—I did not continue rubbing his hands—I only stood by the bed side—when Palmer came back he brought some pills, and he gave him something else, but whether he brought it with him I do not know—he gave him a draught in a wine glass; first the pills, and then the draught—when he gave him the pills, Cook said that they stuck fast in his throat, and he could not swallow them, and Mr. Palmer desired me to give him a teaspoon full of toast and water—I did so, and he took it—when I gave it to him from the spoon, his body was still jumping and jerking—he snapped, in a sort of snapping way, at the spoon, with his head and neck, and the spoon was fast between his teeth—it was difficult to get it back—he seemed to bite it very hard—his head and neck moved forward when he snapped—it was as if this was the spoon; there (<hi rend="italic">Snapping with her teeth at a quill</hi>)—the water went down his throat, and washed the pills down—Mr. Palmer handed him a draught then from a wine glass, something liquid—it was about three parts full of a dark, thick, heavy looking nature—he drank that—he snapped at the glass in the same manner as he did at the spoon—it seemed an involuntary motion—he seemed as if he could not exactly control himself—he swallowed it, and it was vomited up immediately into the chamber utensil, which I held—it was placed on the bed, and I supported his head—it smelt like opium—Palmer said that he hoped the pills had stayed, or he hoped that the pills had not returned, and he searched for the pills with a quill off the dressing table, and said, "I cannot find the pills;" but he desired me to take it away, and to pour it carefully, and see whether I could see the pills—I did so, but could not see the pills at all—I emptied the contents of the utensil, and brought it back—he seemed to be more easy then—that attack lasted, I should think, half an hour, or it might be more, from the time I went into the room when he was beating the bedclothes to the time that he got more easy—he then got more com<lb/>posed—during the whole of that time he appeared to be quite conscious—he appeared to know all that was going forward—I recollect his asking Palmer</p>

               <p>to feel his heart—that wag after he got more composed—he was lying down more quiet, and desired Palmer to come and feel how his heart beat, or something of that sort—Palmer went to his bed side, and I do not know whether he pressed his hand to his heart, or the side of his face—he said that it was all right, or something of that sort, quite a slight remark—left him that morning about 3 o'clock—he was not asleep when I left him—I left Palmer in the room with him—Mr. Cook was dozing when I left him, but I learned next morning that he was not, for he told me that he heard me go out—I left Palmer in the easy chair, asleep, I believe, and I retired to the next room, close to his door—I saw Cook again about 6 o'clock on the Tuesday morning—I said to him, "Is Mr. Palmer gone?"—he said, "Yes, he left at a quarter before 5 o'clock"—I asked him how he felt, or whether he had been any worse—he said, no, he had been no worse since I had left him in the morning—I said, "You were asleep when I went out"—he said, "No; I heard you go"—he asked me if I had ever seen any one suffer or in such agony as he was last night—I said, "No, I never have"—he said he should think I should not wish ever to see any one like that again—I said, "What do you think was the cause of all that illness, Mr. Cook?"—he said, "Some pills Palmer gave me at half past 10 o'clock"—I do not think any<lb/>thing more was said then—I think I left him—I asked him, would he have a cup of coffee, or if he would take anything; and he said, no, not then—I do not remember seeing Palmer on Tuesday morning, until he was sent for—I met him on the stairs that morning, I did not see him in the room—I did not observe any jerkings or convulsions about Cook when I saw him on the Tuesday morning—he seemed quite composed and quiet—I noticed that his eyes looked very wild—I observed none of the beating or convulsion—his body seemed to be quite quiet—there was no mgving about the body, but the eyes looked very wild; he appeared as if he wished to settle down and be quiet—about 12 o'clock he rang his bell, and desired me to send <hi rend="italic">Boots</hi> over to ask Mr. Palmer if he might have a cup of coffee—the <hi rend="italic">Boots</hi> returned, and said he might have a cup of coffee, and Mr. Palmer would be over immediately—I took the coffee up—that was a little after 12 o'clock—Palmer was then in Cook's room—I gave the coffee to Palmer—I gave it into his hands—he tasted the coffee, to see if it would be too strong for Mr. Cook—I left it in his hands, and left the room—I do not know whether the coffee was vomited then, or whether it was after 4 o'clock—I cannot now remember whether I went into the room again—Mr. Jones arrived that afternoon, I believe, by the 3 o'clock train, from Lutterworth—when first I saw Mr. Jones I found him in to. Cook's room—after that I took him up some more coffee—that might be about 4 o'clock, or between 4 and 5—it was another cup of coffee.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After you had taken up the coffee at 4 o'clock, did you see Palmer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; after I had taken it up, he opened the door and asked me to empty that, he had vomited the coffee—ho told me that Cook had vomited the coffee; he opened the bedroom door, I was outside on the landing, I suppose he heard me—he gave me the chamber utensil at the door—I did not go into the room at all, it was as I was passing the door—I cannot remember how long afterwards it was, I do not think it could be an hour—I cannot remember whether Palmer was there when I took the coffee up and left it in the room—the utensil had coffee in it—during</p>

               <p>that evening I saw Cook several times before I retired to rest—he appeared to be in very good spirits, and was talking about getting up the next morning, and said he would have the barber sent for and be shaved—I believe I gave him some arrowroot that evening—the last time I saw him that evening was not later than half past 10 o'clock—Palmer was with him when I left him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was in his bedroom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I gave him a jug of toast and water at the door for Cook—Mr. Palmer said to Mr. Cook, "Can this good girl do anything more for you to-night"—Mr. Cook said, "No, I shall want nothing more, good night."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that said by Mr. Cook in a composed and comfort<lb/>able manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was—I did not go to bed that night; I remained in the kitchen, I was anxious to see how Mr. Cook went on—while I was in the kitchen, the bell of Mr. Cook's room rang violently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you asleep at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was sitting up in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. About what time was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A little before 12 o'clock, per<lb/>haps 10 minutes before 12—it was as near as possible at the same time as on the previous night—Mr. Jones was sleeping in his bedroom, it was a double bedded room, a bed was made up for Mr. Jones—I went up to Mr. Cook's room on hearing the bell—I found Mr. Cook, I believe, sitting up in bed, Mr. Jones appeared to be supporting him; I think he had his arm round his shoulders—Mr. Cook said, "Oh, Mary! fetch Mr. Palmer directly"—he was conscious then, and spoke to me—I went over to Mr. Palmer and rang the bell, the surgery bell; I believe it was at the surgery door, and Mr. Palmer came to the bedroom window—he came to the window as soon as I stepped off the steps into the middle of the road—I expected him to come to the window—as soon as I rang the bell, I stepped off the steps into the road, and he was there, he did not put up the sash—I did not discover a light in his bedroom—I could not positively see him, I could hear him—I could not discern him exactly, he merely opened one square of glass, a small casement at the side, and spoke to me—I could not see whether he was dressed or not at that time—I could not see him at all, I heard him, I heard his voice—I knew his voice—I asked him to come over to Mr. Cook directly, he was much the same as he was the night before—I do not remember what answer he gave me, I turned round and went across again directly—Palmer came in two or three minutes, perhaps—I was in the bedroom when Palmer came—when he came in I think he said he had never dressed so quick in his life, that was the first thing he said—Mr. Jones was still with Mr. Cook—Cook was sitting up in the bed, in much the same state as he was the previous night—I had only been absent a few minutes—Cook was sitting up, and I believe Jones was supporting him—when I left the room after Mr. Palmer came in, I remained in the landing, just outside the door—I waited there—after I had been waiting there some short time, Mr. Palmer came out in about a minute or two, very shortly; I said to him, "He is much the same as he was last night, Mr. Palmer?"—he replied, "Oh! he is not so ill by a fiftieth part"—nothing else passed—he was then going down stairs, as though he was going to his own house—he returned in a very short time, in a few minutes, and went to Mr. Cook's room—I believe I went into the room after he had returned—I believe I heard Mr. Cook make a request about being turned over; I believe he said, "Turn me over on my right side"—I was not in the room at the time it was said, I was at the door—I heard it at the door, the door was open—I did not go in—I do not think I</p>

               <p>way in the room at the moment he departed—I believe I went in just before he died, but I came out again—I believe I was uot in when he de<lb/>parted—I saw Mr. Jones in attendance on him a few minutes before he died—he was supporting him, I think—I think the last I saw of him he had his right arm under Mr. Cook's head—I believe that was it, I cannot be positive—Mr. Palmer was then feeling Mr. Cook's pulse, and he said to Mr. Jones, "His pulse is gone"—Mr. Jones pressed the side of his face to Mr. Cook's heart, and after he had listened to his heart, Mr. Jones lifted up his hands, but did not speak—Mr. Palmer asked me to fetch Mr. Bamford, and I went over for Mr. Bamford.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the time that you were called up on this night, at about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock, to his death, how long do you think elapsed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be three quarters of an hour—he died before 1 o'clock—when I went to fetch Mr. Bamford I did not go into the room again; Mr. Bam<lb/>ford came over, and I saw him when he came down stairs, and he said, "He is dead, he was dead when I arrived"—after Mr. Bamford went out I went on the landing, and sat down on some stairs leading up to the attics—I sat there about ten minutes, and Mr. Jones came out of the room and looked at me, and said, "Mr. Palmer wants you," or, "Will you go in?" or something of that sort, pointing with his finger towards the door of Mr. Cook's room—I went into the room where Mr. Cook was lying dead—Palmer was there—no one was with him—I said, "It is not possible Mr. Cook is dead"—he said,. "Yes, he is dead! oh, yes, he is dead!"—he then asked me who I thought would come to lay him out, and I mentioned two women that I thought Mr. Palmer knew—he said, "Those are just the women"—Lsaid, "Shall I fetch them?" and he said, "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you seen in Mr. Cook's room, during the time he was there, a bet<lb/>ting<lb/>book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was a dark book with a gold band round the edge, with a clasp at one end—it was not a very large book, it was not exactly square, more long than square—I had seen that same book in his possession when he had stopped at the Talbot Arms before, on his way to Liverpool races—there was a case on one side to admit a pencil, and a pencil in it—I cannot remember how long ago it was that he had stopped there before, it was some months, perhaps three or four—I saw that book in bis room on the Monday night before his death—I gave him the book from the dressing table to his bed—that was before his attack on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to give it to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked me to give him the book off the looking glass, and I took it from the looking glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> For what purpose did he require it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked me to give him the book, the pen and ink and the paper, he was going to write, and I gave him all at once, I took them all to him in bed—that was between 7 and 8 o'clock on Monday night—after he had written the letters he took from the book a postage stamp—there was a pocket at one end of the book, where he took the stamp from—I then placed the book again on the look<lb/>ing glass—that was at his request—I never saw the book to my knowledge after that—I did not search the room for it the night Mr. Cook died—I did afterwards, the first time I was requested to do so—I searched everywhere—I could not find it—when I went into the room where the body was lying, when Palmer was there, I believe the clothes that Mr. Cook had worn were placed on a chair somewhere—I saw Palmer searching the pockets of the coat—that was on the Tuesday night after Mr. Cook was dead, at the time that Mr. Jones wished me to go in the room, perhaps ten minutes after—I went in and found Mr. Palmer with the coat in his hand;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140018"/>
               <p>that was the coat that I had seen Mr. Cook wear—he was searching the pockets of the coat—it was not a frock coat, nor yet a dress coat, or a great coat; I know the style of the coat, but not the name of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe him do anything with the bolster or pillow, where Cook had lain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he searched under the pillow and bolster—I saw two or three letters lying on the chimney piece, I think—that was at this time, immediately after Cook's death, and while Palmer was in the room—I never found them afterwards, to my knowledge—I did not go much into the room afterwards—I had not seen those letters on the mantelpiece before the death, to my knowledge—after his death I did, while Palmer was in his room—I have never seen them since to my knowledge.</p>

SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been at the Talbot Arms at the date of Mr. Cook's death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—I cannot exactly remember how long before Mr. Cook's death I saw him there first, he was there three or four months, almost altogether—he made it his home—I mean immediately preceding his death—he came first in May, 1855—he was there, on and off, about three months altogether—I never heard him complain of anything except his throat—he first com<lb/>plained of his throat perhaps two or three months before his death; he did not complain frequently, it was merely a sore throat, or something of that, through a cold—I believe he had a gargle for it, but I only saw one bottle—I believe he had the gargle from Mr. Thirlby—I did not observe any sores about his mouth when he first came, or at any time previous to his death—I never heard him complain of any difficulty in swallowing—I do not know of his tongue having been sore—I have seen him with a loaded tongue, from a bad stomach—he did not complain in my hearing of the tongue being sore, so as to render it difficult for him to swallow—I do not know of caustic having been applied to it while he was there—I do not know that Mr. Thirlby attended him for his mouth and throat at the inn—I cannot tell how recently before his death I heard him complain of a sore throat: it was longer than a fortnight, it might be a month, or more; a month, or two—he did not tell me that it was actually sore, that the skin was off, that it was sore in that sense; but that it was sore, he should fancy from cold, he had got a slight cold—he never told me that it had healed—he did not, beside the gargle, take medicine at the house that I know of—I saw pill boxes about during his last illness—he had not a violent cough, he had a cough which a person would have from a cold, but not a frequent cough—I do not say that he was rarely without one, I say that he bad a slight cough at the time his throat was sore; it would be through cold perhaps—he had not been ailing, to my knowledge, just before he went to Shrewsbury—when he came back from Shrewsbury he at once said that he was poorly—after he died I stayed at the Talbot Inn, till the day after Christmas day; I then went home; that is in the Potteries, Shelton—I have been in service since at Dolly's Hotel, Paternoster-row—I went into service there in Jan.—I am not in service there now—I remained till Feb., I stayed six weeks there—it is a chop house—I was there as chambermaid—after I came to London I saw Mr. Stevens, perhaps about a week after—I met him at Dolly's Hotel once, and perhaps four or five times—I will not swear that it was not ten or twelve times—I will swear that it was not twenty times—it might be six or seven times—I will swear that it was not twelve</p>

               <p>times—sometimes he spoke to me while Mrs. Dewhuret was there, in one of her sitting rooms—I did not go into a sitting room and speak to him alone, sometimes Mrs. Dewhuret was there, and sometimes Miss Dewhurst—it was not always about Cook's death that he spoke to me—he merely called to see how I liked London, and whether I was well in health.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He was in the station of a gentleman; do you mean to say that he called to see whether you liked London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, to see if I liked the place—I am not going to take my oath that he always called to ask me how I liked London—he sometimes talked about one thing, and sometimes another, but nothing besides Mr. Cook's death—I had conversed a little with him at the Talbot Inn when he was there, before the funeral—I had had no private conversation with him—I had never been in a room with him alone at the Talbot Inn—he had not spoken to me about coming to London—when he came to Dolly's Hotel, he spoke to me about many more things besides Mr. Cook's death—I cannot remember now what else.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Manchester, and am in the habit of attending races sometimes. I was at Shrewsbury races in Nov., 1855, and saw Palmer there—I had occasion to go and speak to him; that was on the 14th, Wednesday—I met him in the street on the first occasion, that was about 8 o'clock in the evening—I asked him if he thought his horse would win on the following day—that horse was called Chicken, and was to run on the Thursday—Mr. Palmer said, if I heard anything further, I was to call in at the Raven Hotel that evening, and tell him—the informa<lb/>tion was in reference to another horse called Lord Alfred, which was to run</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140029"/>
               <p>in the race—he merely said, "Be sure you call if you heap anything"—I went to see him that evening at the Raven, it was about half past 10 o'clock when I went; I had some friends with me who waited below—as I passed the clock in the market square, I noticed the time, and said if it was any later I should not like to call—my friends waited down stairs, and I went up to the first floor; a servant was going up as I went to the door, and I asked her to be good enough to tell Mr. Palmer I wished to see him—when you get to the top of the stairs there is a lobby or passage facing you, and another to the left—when I got to the top of the stairs, I turned to the left—I knew at that time which room Mr. Palmer was occupying, he stayed frequently at the Raven Hotel—I called there the evening before, but he was gone to Rugeley—I knew hut room, but never was in it—I knew the sitting room which he occupied—the servant called my attention to Palmer by saying, "He is there, Ma'am"—she just moved her head, she had a tray in her hand, and said, "He is there"—Palmer was at that time standing at a small table in the passage—he had a tumbler glass, something similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, when I saw him first—there appeared to be a small quantity of liquid in it, which appeared to be the colour of water; it was clear—I do not mean that it was water coloured, but that it was liquid of the colour of water—he just turned it in this manner, round, shaking the fluid up that was in it—there was a light in the passage where I stood—Mr. Palmer was a little in the shade, the light was nearer to me—he said, "I will be with you presently," and held it up in this way between him and the light—he noticed me the moment I got to the top of the stairs—after he had said, "I will be with you presently," he stood a few minutes longer, or perhaps a minute or two longer at the table, with the glass in his hand—he held it up once or twice during the time he staid there, and at intervals, between when he held it up first and afterwards, I observed him shaking it now and then—while he was shaking it, and holding it up to the light, I made an observation about the weather, what very fine weather we had—the weather was fine—there was a sitting room door partially open, adjoining Palmer's sitting room, and he carried the glass into that sitting room—I supposed at the time that it was unoccupied—I heard no one talk<lb/>ing—I heard no one address him as he went in, but I could not see the whole of the room—he was there about two or three minutes, and then came out again with the glass still in his hand—what I saw ia the glass was still of the colour and appearance of water—he then carried it into his own sitting room, and shut the door after him—he was there three or four minutes, and then he came out to me, and brought roe out a glass with brandy and water in it—it might be the same glass, it looked like it, but the fluid was different—mine was brandy and water; I had the brandy and water, and it produced no unpleasant consequences on me—a conversation took place between us about the race on the following day, about the horses—he said that he should back his horse Chicken—I was present at the race; Chicken ran, and lost—I did not afterwards hear from Palmer whether he had won or lost on the race.</p>

I shall die!" or something like that—Palmer said, "Don't be alarmed, lad"—I did not see any pills given—I saw Cook drinking a darkish mixture in a glass—I cannot remember who gave it to him, but I saw it in his hand—Palmer was in the room—when Cook put the glass to his month he was biting at it, snapping at it—I saw his teeth snap at the glass, I both saw and heard that—that black looking draught did not remain on his stomach, he vomited it—I left him between 12 and 1 o'clock—he was then more composed—I cannot remember when I first saw him on Tuesday—I did see him, and he seemed a little better—I asked him how he was—I saw him more than once on the Tuesday, he seemed better during the whole of the time—on the Tuesday night I was alarmed again by Mr. Cook's bell ringing—Elizabeth Mills went up to answer the bell—she was with me in the kitchen when the bell rang—I followed her up stairs, and met her coming back—I did not go into Mr. Cook's room then—I heard him screaming—I was standing on the landing by the door—I saw Palmer come, Elizabeth Mills fetched him—I was on the landing when he came, and said to him, "Mr. Cook is ill again"—he said, "Oh, is he?" and went into the room—he was dressed in his usual way; he had a black coat on—there was nothing peculiar about his dress, except that he had a cap on—after he had gone into the room I remained on the landing—I could not hear what was going on inside—after some time Palmer came out, and went down stairs and away for something—when he came out he spoke to me first, I think, and said that Cook was not so bad by a fiftieth part as he was the night before—I heard Elizabeth Mills ask him how Cook was—it was in answer to her question that he said that Cook was not one fiftieth part as bad as he was the night before—we were both standing together, and he said it to us both—I went into the room before Cook died; Mr. Jones was there in attendance on him—I heard Cook ask Jones before he died to be turned over—I was not in the room when I heard him ask that,</p>

Since then, he has been confined to his bed here with a very severe bilious attack combined with diarrhœa, and I think it advisable for you to oome to see him as soon as possible. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, William Palmer.")—that letter came to me on the Monday morning—I was very unwell that day—the next day, Tuesday, I went to Rugeley—I arrived by the 3 o'clock train, I believe—I got to the Talbot Arms something about half past 3 o'clock—I immediately proceeded to visit Cook—he expressed himself to me as being very comfortable—he said he had been very ill at Shrewsbury; I do not think anything else passed about What he had suffered at Shrewsbury—he said he bad been very ill at Shrewsbury—he did not tell me what the symptoms were, he said he was obliged to call in a medical man at Shrewsbury—Palmer came to the room where we were, soon afterwards—I examined Cook in Palmer's pre<lb/>sence—I felt his pulse, it was tolerably natural; his tongue was clean—I remarked to Mr. Palmer, "This is hardly the tongue of a bilious diarrhœa attack"—Palmer replied, "You should have seen it before"—I did not prescribe or recommend anything for him at that time, I did not consider him in my hands at all—I visited him several times in the course of that afternoon—I found that he changed for the better, his spirits were better, and his pulse was better; he was decidedly improving—he vomited in the afternoon—I gave him a little toast and water, and he vomited—he asked me for it—it was in the room—there was no diarrhœa—Mr. Bamford came that evening, somewhere about 7 o'clock—Palmer had previously informed me that he had called in Mr. Bamford to his assistance—when Mr. Bamford came he expressed his opinion that Mr. Cook was going on very satisfactorily.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything then said by Cook about the previous night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He objected to the pills of the previous night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140038"/>
               <p>agreed to it—Mr. Bamford then left—I went back to Cook's room—I think Mr. Palmer went with me—I have no recollection how long he stopped there; not long—I was afterwards in Cook's room several times in the course of the evening—I talked, to him a short time, and then left him—he seemed very comfortable all the evening—there was not any more vomiting that I observed—there was no diarrhœa—there was an action on the bowels, but not diarrhœa.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you were in and out in the course of the evening, after Mr. Bamford went away; did Mr. Palmer afterwards leave? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he left, and went over to his own house—I should think that was about 8 o'clock—I went with him—I remained with him from a quarter to perhaps half an hour, and then came back to Cook's room—the next time I saw Mr. Palmer in Cook's room was nearly 11 o'clock—he then brought a box of pills with him—he opened it in my presence, and showed me the directions—the directions were written on a slip of paper, which was round the box—he directed my attention to the paper, saying, "What an excellent hand for an old man upwards of eighty to write!"—I did not read the direction through; I merely looked at the handwriting—it was a very good handwriting—Mr. Palmer proposed to Mr. Cook to take those pills—Cook protested very much against it, on the ground that they had made him so ill on the previous night—Palmer repeated the request several times, and at last Cook complied with it, and took them—after he had taken them, we left him, and I went and took some supper—the moment he took the pills he vomited—he vomited into a utensil—search was made in the utensil by Mr. Palmer and by myself, at Mr. Palmer's request, for the pills, to see whether they had been returned—we found nothing but toast and water, no pills—the pills had evidently been retained—he did not take the pills in toast and water—he took them without anything, as far as I recol<lb/>lect—he could do it—he must have drunk the toast and water previously, I do not know when; he had it by his bed side—I do not think it possible that the contents of the pills could have caused the vomiting, it came too quickly—I should say that the act of swallowing could not have done it—after the vomiting, he lay down to rest, and we left him—he appeared quiet after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said that he seemed better; before that, had he become stronger than he was when you first arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he expressed himself so—he had got out of bed, and sat on a chair—that was before Palmer came and gave him these pills—I can hardly recollect whether it was between the time when I went over with Palmer to his house, and the time that he came with the pills, or whether it was earlier than that—in the course of the evening before he took the pills, his spirits were very good, and he was very jocose—he was laughing and joking, speaking of what he should do during the winter; that he intended to ride and hunt again—he spoke of his future plans and prospects—after Cook had taken the two pills which Palmer brought at 11 o'clock, I went down stairs, and took a little supper—I returned at very nearly 12 o'clock—it had then been arranged, at his request, that I should sleep in his room that night—it was a double bedded</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140039"/>
               <p>room—after going up stairs, I talked to him for a few minutes, and then went to bed—at the time when I last talked to him, before I got into bed, he appeared rather sleepy, but quite as well as usual—I wished him to go to sleep—there was nothing at all about him to excite any apprehension—I had been in bed about ten minutes, I should imagine, when he suddenly raised himself up in bed—I was not asleep—as far as I can imagine, it was about ten minutes, I cannot say how the time went—he suddenly started up in bed, and called out these words, "Doctor, get up! I am going to be ill; ring the bell for Mr. Palmer"—I did ring the bell—the chambermaid came to the door, and Cook himself called out to her, "Fetch Mr. Palmer"—he asked me to rub his neck—before that, he asked me to give him something—I said I had nothing with me; Mr. Palmer would be there directly—he was sitting up in bed at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe whether there was anything in the expression of his countenance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing very particularly; in feet, the room was rather dark, I could not observe—he then asked me to rub his neck—I do not think he said why—he said, "Bub my neck"—I rubbed the back part of his neck for him, and supported him in my arms at the time, while I was rubbing him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe anything about the back of the neck while you were rubbing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was stiff, a sort of hardness there appeared about the neck, a stiffness of the muscles—Palmer came very soon indeed after the chambermaid went away, two or three minutes at the utmost—he made the remark when he came in, "I was never so quickly dressed in my life" did not observe how he was dressed, I was so engaged with this poor fellow in my arms at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he bring anything with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave him two pills, I think he brought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> with him; he told me they were ammonia pills—Cook swallowed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> directly he had swallowed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> he uttered loud screams—directly he had swallowed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> he threw himself back in his bed, and was dreadfully convulsed—that certainly could not have been from the action of the last taken pills, as they had been taken immediately before—he said to me, "Raise me up, or I shall be suffocated"—the convulsions lasted from five to ten minutes, I should think—that was not before he called out to be raised up, it was at the time; it was at the commencement of the convulsions—he threw himself with a sudden jerk back upon the bed—it was just afterwards that he called out to be raised up, just after he was down—the convulsions then set in violently—the convulsions extended over all the muscular fibres; there was a violent contraction of every muscle of the body, and stiffening of the limbs—when he called out to me to raise him up lest he should be suffocated, I endeavoured to do so, with the assistance of Mr. Palmer, but found it quite impossible, owing to the rigidity of the limbs—when he found that we could not raise him up, he asked me to turn him over—I did so—he was quite sensible—listened to the action of his heart—that was after I had turned over—I found it gradually to weaken—I requested Mr. Palmer to go and fetch some spirits of ammonia for him, to revive the action of the heart, as a stimulant, in hopes of reviving him—Palmer went to his house, and fetched the bottle—he was gone for a very short period, I should say not above a minute; he was very quick indeed—when he came back the heart was gradually sinking, and life was almost extinct, and he died very quietly at last—he died very soon after Palmer returned, he was not able to take the ammonia when he came—from the time that he first</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of what, in your judgment as a medical man, did he die? what was the proximate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He died from tetanus—the meaning of the word tetanus is lock-jaw, that is the common term.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Lock jaw is a symptom of tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one of the symptoms, but every muscle of the body was affected in the same manner, with violent spasm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How should you express in ordinary English the general symptoms of what you call tetanus, in one word? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Violent spasmodic affection of all the muscles of the body—that affection causes death by stopping the action of the heart—it affects, the respiratory muscles, and so stops the action of the lungs as well—it is that spasm of the respiratory muscles that causes the sense of suffocation—when the death took place he was still on his side—he was still on his side after he was dead—I did not turn the body on its back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe what was the outward appearance of the body imme<lb/>diately after the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very dark; I could not mike the observation I should, there was only one candle in the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You could make no observation as to the colour of his skin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I could not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any opportunity of observing in what position his hands were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, clenched—both hands were clenched; the left hand particularly, that I had in my hands—I observed the clenching of the hands immediately after the attack took place, as he threw himself back in the bed—that was immediately after his taking the pills that Palmer brought over—I did not see the hands clenched when I was rubbing his neck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe, either before or at the time, of death, or immediately afterwards, anything in the position of the head and neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the head was quite, bent back, I mean into an unnatural position.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By spasmodic action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe whether there was any effect produced by spasmodic action in the form of the body, as regarded the back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the body was twisted back like a bow, twisted quite, back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you observe that appearance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately after death, or at the time—all the time—after he threw himself back, it was immediately drawn back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you had placed the body at that time, on the back, in what position would it have rested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the head and heels—if I had placed that body in a position on a plane surface, it would have rested on the head and heels—I did not observe anything at the time of death, or immediately after, about the jaw; his face was turned away from me, I could not observe that—after death I saw that the jaw was all affected by spasm; the side of the jaw, the side of the face, every muscle, of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After death did Palmer say anything to you on the subject of any claim that he had upon Cook? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was mentioned afterwards that he had a claim upon Cook—that was that night, it was not exactly a claim—it was some time after Ms death, that night—Palmer remained from half an hour to an hour after the death, I should think—he did not desire me to send the women servants in to him, that was a suggestion of my own—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140041"/>
               <p>wished to have some women to lay him out—I went out of the room to speak to the housekeeper, and told the two servants to go in, the two maids who were sitting on the steps just by, while I went down stairs—I remained down stairs a few minutes with Miss Bond, the housekeeper, and then returned, and fouad Mr. Palmer in the room with Mr. Cook's coat in his hand—he remarked to me, "You, being his nearest friend, had bitter take possession of his valuables," or "of his effects or something of that sort—I took possession of his watch, and his purse, containing five sovereigns and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was all the money I could and belonging to him—I could not find any betting book, or any papers—there were two letters which I had brought with me from the country—I had given them to Cook, and he said he would see? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> in the morning—they had not, been opened—he would not open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> then, he told me to open them I just broke the seal, and gave then to him—they were letters of his brother in law, of no impor<lb/>tance—after that, before Palmer left, he said that it was a bad thing for him that Mr. Cook was dead, for he was responsible for money of Cook's—he said, "I am responsible for some 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I hope Mr. Cook's friends will not let me lose it; if they do not assist me, all my hones will be seized"—nothing was said by him about securities, or papers, or anything of that sort, nothing mow definite than, that—I was present on the Friday whan Mr. Stevens, the step-father, came—I heard some remarks between them on the subject of the funeral—Mr. Palmer said that if Mr. Stevens did not bury him, he should himself—I do not recollect any expression then by Mr. Stevens as to burying him—I do not recollect how that observation arose—Mr. Stevens, My. Palmer myself and Mr. Bamford dined together at the Talbot Arms that day, about 3 o'clock, and after dinner Mr. Stevens requested me to go and look for Cook's betting book, Palmer being them present—Mr. Stevens was going to London by the train—we went and searched, and Palmer came with me—he followed me immediately after I went out of the room—he had told me previously to that, on the night that Cook died, that the betting book would be of no use to any one, but it most probably would be found—it was taking possession of the effects on the night of the deiyth which led me to have conversation with him about the subject of the betting book—I think I made an observation on the subject—we just looked for the book, it was very cursory, it was of no consequence—I looked for it, but certainly did not find it—made no particular remark on not finding it—he said that it was sure to be found, it was of no use to any one—he knew what I was looking for—I said, "Where is the betting book?" or something of that kind; and then on that he said, "I have no doubt it will be found, but it is of no use to any one"—he said, "The beta are void"—I am sure he said that—"When a person dies," he said, "all the beta are void"—I am not acquainted with the turf at all—on the Friday, Palmer went up stairs with me to Cook's room, when we looked for the betting book—he looked on that occasion—I could not find it, and he came down stairs with me, and I told the, maid servant to go up and search among his linen, a second search—after that I went into the room where Mr. Stevens was, and told him that I could not find it—Palmer went in with me—I do not recollect the remark Mr. Stevens made—on that evening, when I had sent the maid servants in to speak to Mr. Palmer on the subject of the women laying out the body, I went down stairs, but was mot absent move than two or three minutes before I returned to the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, living at No. 7, Gloucester-place. I knew the deceased Mr. Cook very well in past years, professionally—I have known him about four years—he has been in the habit of consulting me professionally during the last four years—he was not robust—his general health was good, for a man not robust—I only suspected that he was at all of a pulmonary disposition from his complaining of his throat, which induced me to examine his chest with that view—he came to me in May, 1855, but I saw him just before, early in the spring, and I saw him later in the autumn, Nov., 1854—it was for simple indigestion—if he felt a little out of order when he came to town, he used to call on me—in the spring of 1855, when he came to me, the old affair of indigestion was one sub<lb/>ject of his visit, but he was anxious about some slight spots, one on his forehead and one on his arm—he had two shallow ulcers on the tongue, which I found corresponded to two bad teeth—I attributed them to the teeth—he said he had been under a mild mercurial course; he imagined that those spots were what he called secondary symptoms, but I was of a different opinion—I thought they were not, certainly—I think up to the time he saw me he had been taking mercury; he did not show me any prescription—I immediately recommended it's discontinuance, and gave him quinine as a tonic, and an aperient containing cream of tartar, mag<lb/>nesia, and sulphur—I did not at any time give him antimony—under the treatment which I prescribed, those sores were quite well by the end of May, but he nevertheless continued to come to me—I saw him very frequently in June—he came in June still feeling some little anxiety about my treatment, and my notion that it was not secondary symptoms—I was anxious, I felt there was some difference of opinion between me and the medical man in the country—supposing I might be wrong, it would be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140045"/>
               <p>damaging to my reputation and injurious to him—whenever he came I always examined him carefully—my attention was directed to his throat—he never had the least ulceration of the throat, the tonsils were slightly enlarged, there was very little tonsil on one side and an enlarged one on the other—it was only one of those cases of diseased tonsil to which any<lb/>body may be subject, there were no indications of a syphilitic character; in my opinion—he continued under my treatment till a fortnight before his death—I saw him on 3rd or 5th Nov., I saw him on 29th Oct., and it was about a week afterwards—I examined him on 29th Oct., and the last time I examined him particularly, because I thought he was going away—I recommended him to leave the turf and go abroad—I examined his chest, and imagined that his left lung was slightly touched—there was some slight indication of pulmonary affection of the left lung, which afterwards disappeared, but I dwelt on it, as I wanted to get him away from his turf associations—I wished him to go abroad for two years—on that occasion I carefully examined him—I did not confine my ob-servation to the upper parts; as it was an open question with regard to the secondary symptoms, I examined his penis, and thought there was nothing venereal about it; there was a very shallow scar from a former excoriation, to which he said that he was liable—that was not what we usually call chancre, and there was no sore on any part of the body—that was the case up to the 3rd or 5th Nov.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Salt, a practising surgeon; of Rugeley. I know William Palmer—I saw him on Monday evening, 19th Nov., at Mr. Salt's surgery—he came there about 9 o'clock—I was alone when he came—he asked me for three grains of strychnia—I weighed it accurately, and gave it to him, folded up in a small paper, as a powder—it is a white powder—he did not make any remark—he said, "Good night," and took it away with him—he did not pay me for it—I gave it to him—knew him to be a medical man, and I made no charge—we do not sell drugs to ordinary persons—our's is a surgery—we do occasionally sell pills, or any<lb/>thing of that kind, or salts, but we have not a retail shop—we sell medicine, as apothecaries, made up, but we do not sell strychnia to an ordinary person coming—I should not think he was in the shop two minutes, just while I accurately weighed it—I saw Palmer again on 20th Nov., the following day, Tuesday, at Mr. Hawkins's shop, a druggist—I am not quite sure, but I think it was between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day—we have our drugs from there when we are out, but we deal in London—I am in the habit very frequently of calling in at Mr. Hawkins's shop as I go by—Mr. Palmer was in the shop when I went in—he asked me how I was, and put his hand on my shoulder, and said that he wished to speak to me, I went with him to the door—we</p>

               <p>did not go to the door only, but into the street—when we got to the door, Mr. Palmer went a little distance from the door into the street, and asked me when Mr. Edwin Salt was going to his farm; and while he was talking, a person named Brassington, a cooper, came up—Edwin Salt is the son of the chemist—the farm is at Sudbury, perhaps fourteen miles from Rugeley—I never was there—Palmer had nothing to do with the farm at all, but it was a rumour in the town—Brassington stopped and spoke to me, and while he was speaking to me Palmer went away—he remained in the same place while Brassington spoke to me—Brassington had two bills for Mr. Salt, bills due from Mr. Salt for work done for him—he spoke to me about those bills, and engaged my attention, and Palmer left, and went back again into the shop—I afterwards saw him come out of the shop—I was then still talking to Brassington in the street—I am not sure whether Palmer spoke to me when he came out, but he went by me—I was talking to Brassington at the time—he went towards his own house, which is about 200 or 300 yards from Mr. Hawkins's shop—after my conversation with Brassington was ended, I went into Mr. Hawkins's shop—there is a person named Roberta, an apprentice to Mr. Hawkins—he was in the shop when I went in—when I went into the shop something was said about Palmer—I know a man of the name of Thirlby—he deals in drugs—he if the man who succeeded to Palmer's business—Thirlby's name was not mentioned in my conversation with Roberts—I know, of my own knowledge, that Palmer bought drugs of Thirlby—Thirlby generally dispenses Palmer's medicines—I mean by that, that he makes up the medicine—he acts in Palmer's name—if Palmer wishes to give medicine to a patient, Thirlby makes it up—I always understood that Thirlby succeeded to the business which Palmer had, and that that was so in Nov.—on Sunday, 25th Nov., at 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sent for to Palmer's house—I am not quite sure who came for me, but I went in consequence of being sent for—I found Palmer in his kitchen, sitting by the fire, reading—he asked me how I was, and asked me to have a little brandy—I am not quite sure whether I sat down—I had some brandy and water—there was no one else present—he asked me, "What would be the dose of strychnine you would give to kill a dog?"—I told him, "A grain"—he asked me whether it would be found in the stomach; what would be the appearance of the stomach after death—I told him there would be no inflammation, and that I did not think it would be found—upon that, 11 think, he said that it would be all right, and did that (<hi rend="italic">snapping his fingers</hi>)—he said it to himself, and I saw him do that—we talked about some ordinary matters of conversation afterwards—he made some other remarks, occasional remarks on common subjects—I was with him in the kitchen that evening perhaps five minutes, or more—on Monday, the 26th, I heard that a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of Cook's body was to take place that day—I asked Mr. Salt if he was going to Mr. Bamford's to make the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and he went down with me to Mr. Bamford's, to ask him to let me go—Mr. Bamford was not there, and I went with Mr. Salt down the town, in his gig, and met Mr. Bamford near the church, asked whether he was going to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, and he said that he was not—I did not see Palmer—I saw him in the study of Mr. Bamford's house before we went to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—that was after breakfast, perhaps about 10 o'clock; I am not quite certain—he asked me what I wanted—I told him I was going to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—he asked me whether Mr. Salt was going—I told him that he was engaged, and could not go—I took some instruments and other things which were necessary, and</p>

               <p>went down to the Talbot Arms, to the examination—Dr. Harland went down with me—I know Mr. Frere—he is a surgeon, practising at Rugeley—after we got to the Talbot Arms, Dr. Harland went away for a short time, and the other doctors went away together, and left Palmer and me together—we were left together in, I think, the entrance hall—we were alone together, and Palmer said, "It will be a dirty job, and I shall go and have a little brandy; will you go with me?"—I went with him to his house, which is opposite, and had two wine glasses of neat brandy, and I saw him drink two glasses—when I was there he said to me, "You will find this fellow suffering from diseased throat; he has had syphilis, and has taken a great deal of mercury"—I afterwards went over with him to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and found that the other medical men had returned—Palmer was watching at the window—while the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was going on, Palmer stood near Mr. Bamford, against the fire—I was examined before the Coroner, but did not say anytning there about my having given to Palmer three grains of strychnia on the night of 9th Nov.—I first stated that to Cheshire, the postmaster.</p>

I know the prisoner, William Palmer—on Tuesday, 20th Nov., he came into Mr. Hawkins's shop—I believe it was between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day—he asked first, for two drachms of prussic acid—he brought a bottle for it—I was putting it up for him when Mr. Newton, the assistant to Mr. Salt, came into the shop—Palmer told him he wanted to speak to him, and they went out of the shop together—I know a person of the name of Brassington, a cooper—after Palmer had gone out of our shop, I saw Brassington, he took Newton away from Palmer—I saw that—he got into conversation with him—you can see from the shop window into the street clearly—when Brassington took Newton away with him in conversation, Palmer came back again into the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What were you doing when Palmer came back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was putting up the prussic acid into his bottle.</p>

JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were in the act of putting up the prussic acid; what did he say to you when he came back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He asked for six grains of strychnia and two drachms of Battley's solution of opium—that is what is commonly called Battley's sedative—the prussic acid remained on the counter while I was putting up the other—I had put up the prussic acid ready for him, and then he asked for the six grains of strychnia and the Battley's sedative, and I placed the prussic acid on the counter—I was behind the counter pre<lb/>paring these things—while I was behind the counter preparing these things for the prisoner, he was standing at the shop door—he ordered the things at the counter—it was while I was preparing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> he moved from the counter to the street door—I do not know which way he was looking while he was standing at the street door—he was looking into the street, with his back to me, standing in the doorway—I took about five minutes in the prepara<lb/>tion of these things for him before I delivered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> to him—he remained standing at the door until I was ready to give him the things—I then deli<lb/>vered the things to him, the prussic acid in the bottle which he had brought and the strychnia delivered in a paper.</p>

               <p>the time 1 delivered him these things, there was no other person in the shop—after the prisoner had left with these things, Mr. Newton came into the shop—I had some conversation with him—he made some remark to me—I had been six years, previously to that Nov., in Mr. Hawkins's employment—it was about two years before this since the prisoner had ever bought any drugs at our shop—I know Mr. Thirlby, he had been assistant to Mr. Palmer, and had opened a chemist's shop about two years before, and since that date, I had never sold him any drugs until this Tuesday to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Thirlby was still carrying on the business at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in no business now; I have retired from business—I was the step-father of the deceased Mr. John Parsons Cook—I married his father's widow eighteen years ago—I have known the young man intimately ever since that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he brought up in your family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not reside very generally with me—his mother died soon after our marriage, and some years after I was made the executor under his paternal grandfather's will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you on friendly terms with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always, most intimate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You continued on friendly terms with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, most affectionate terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where was it that you last saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the station at Euston-square—I have some recollection that he then told me he was going to Rugeley; I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state of health was he at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He looked better than I had seen him for a very long time—I was so gratified that I said, "My boy, you look very well; you do not look anything of an invalid now"—he said nothing to induce me to think he felt otherwise—he struck him<lb/>self firmly on the chest, and said, "Oh, I am all right!"—he merely said he was quite well, quite right—I think he added, that if he was quite happy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140053"/>
               <p>he should be all right—in point of appearance he was not a robust man; he was very pale in complexion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there been to your knowledge anything the matter with him recently before that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For some months in the previous winter he had a sore throat, some months before—he was staying with me then—I did not see him again until after his death, when he was a corpse—I first heard of his death on Wednesday evening, 21st Nov.—Mr. Jones, the surgeon, of Lutterworth, gave me the information—he came to my house to inform me—that was on the Wednesday—on the next day, Thursday, I went down with Mr. Jones to Lutterworth—that was to search for his will and any papers he had left—we found a will—the next morning we went to Rugeley—we got there between 12 and 1 o'clock, I think—as soon as I arrived at the inn I asked to see the body—I was then accompanied by Palmer—I met Palmer in the passage of the Talbot Arms—I believe I had once seen him before; I did not know him—Mr. Jones introduced me to him in the inn passage—he followed us up stairs to see the body—Palmer removed the sheet from the body to rather below the waist; I think the thighs were partially uncovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything about the appearance of the countenance that struck you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was very much struck by the appearance of the countenance—the first thing I noticed was a tightness of the muscles across the face—it was that tightness of the muscles across the face; that princi<lb/>pally struck me—there did not appear to me to be any emaciation from disease—after I had looked at the countenance of the deceased we all went down stairs—Mr. Jones was present when I saw the corpse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make any inquiry of Palmer on the subject of Cook's affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After some time—we were in one of the sitting rooms in the inn—I said, "I hear from Mr. Jones, Mr. Palmer, that you know something of my son's affairs, can you tell me anything about them?" he replied, "Yes, there are 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of bills out of his, and I am sorry to say my name is to them but I have got a paper drawn up by a lawyer, signed by Mr. Cook, to show that I have never had any benefit from them," or "never had the money," I forget the precise expression—I expressed great surprise, and said, "I fear there will not be four thousand shillings to pay them;" but I said, "Has he no horses, or no property? do you know of nothing?" he said, "Yes, he has horses, but they are mortgaged"—I said, "Has he no sporting debts owing to him, nothing of that sort?" I am stating the words as nearly as I can; he mentioned one debt of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was owing to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the name of the person from whom it was owing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Is it material that I should state the name? it would give great pain elsewhere; the man is dying at the present moment; I do not think it is material—it has not been received since—it has had nothing to do with the prisoner, or any party connected with him—it was not a sporting debt, it has nothing whatever to do with it—it was a personal debt from a relative of his for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not mention any other debt due to him—he said he did not know of any other—I said, I thought his sporting creditors would have to take his sporting debts and make the best of them, for I should pay nothing—I then turned round, and said, "Well, whether he has left anything or not, poor fellow, he must be buried"—Palmer imme<lb/>diately said, "Oh, I will bury him myself, if that is all"—I said, "Oh, cer<lb/>tainly I cannot think of your doing that, I shall do it"—Cook's brother-in-law was present, the husband of his sister, he had come there to meet me; he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140054"/>
               <p>immediately expressed a great wish to be allowed to bury him; I said, "No, no, that is my business; as his executor I shall take care of that"—he had appointed me his executor under his will—I said, "I cannot have the funeral immediately, because I intend to bury him in London, in his mother's grave; I am very sorry for the inconvenience to the people here at the inn, but I will get it done as soon as possible"—Palmer said, "Oh, that is of no con<lb/>sequence, but the body ought to be fastened up at once"—he repeated that in other words; he said, "So long as the body is fastened up, a few days' delay is of no consequence, or a day or two"—that terminated the conver<lb/>sation on that subject for the time—while I was talking to the deceased's brother-in-law, Palmer and Mr. Jones left the room—they returned in about half an hour—on their return I expressed a desire to know from Palmer the name of some respectable undertaker in Rugeley, that I might call in, that I might at once order a coffin, and give directions for the funeral—Palmer said, "Oh, I have been and done that, I have ordered a shell and a strong oak coffin—he did not say to whom he had been—I then expressed my surprise—I said, I think, "I did not give you any authority;" those were the words, some expression of that sort, I expressed my surprise in terms of that kind—I said, "But I must see the undertaker, to give him instructions about the funeral"—I think he told me the name of the undertaker, I am not quite sure—I then ordered dinner for myself and Mr. Bradford, my son-in-law, and Mr. Jones, and I asked Palmer to come and partake of it—we all dined together at the inn—I was going back to London by the quarter past 4 o'clock train—we dined about 3 o'clock—after dinner, before I went away, I desired Mr. Jones to be so good as to go up stairs and get me his betting book or pocket book, or any books or papers that might be there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know, of your own knowledge, from him that he was in the habit of carrying a betting book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had seen him with a betting book—I do not recollect the sort of book that particular book was; I have seen his other betting books—as one betting book was filled up, he would take ano<lb/>ther—those I have seen were clasp books, opening longways—upon this request Mr. Jones left the room—Palmer followed him—they returned in, I should think, nearly ten minutes, certainly more than five minutes—Mr. Jones came into the room, and said he was very sorry to say that he could not find any betting book—Palmer was present, he followed him in—Mr. Jones said he could not find any betting book, and I think he added, or papers—I had desired him to search for papers—I said, "No betting book, Mr. Jones!" and turning towards Palmer, I said, "How is this?"—Palmer said, "Oh, it is no manner of use if you find it,"or very nearly those words—I said, "No use, sir! I am the best judge of that"—he again said, "It is of no manner of use"—I said, "I am the best judge of that; I am told it is of use; I understand my son won a great deal of money at Shrewsbury," I am giving the words as nearly as I can, "and I ought to know something about it"—Palmer said, "It is no use, I assure you; when a man dies his bets are done with;" I think those were the words; "besides," he said, "Cook received the greater part of his money on the course at Shrewsbury"—I said, "Very well, sir, the book must be found; it ought to be found, and must be found;" Palmer then, in a much quieter tone, said, "Oh, it will be found, no doubt"—I again said, "Sir, it shall be found"—I then went to the door of the sitting room, and, calling to the housekeeper from the bar, I desired that everything in the deceased's room might be locked up, that nothing might be touched until I returned, or sent some one with authority to take</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140055"/>
               <p>possession—after that, and prior to leaving, I went up stairs to take a last look at the body—I saw some servants in the room turning over the bed clothes of one of the empty beds—I do not know what for—the undertaker was there—I did not notice any one else—I had before that had commu<lb/>nication with the undertaker, before I went to dinner—I had given him instructions for sending the body to London—I had given him instruc<lb/>tions to place the body in the coffin—when I went into the room the undertaker was standing by the side of the shell—the body had been just placed in the shell—I had given directions for that—I had given general directions—I went to the side of the shell—the body was uncovered—I knelt down by the side of the shell; and, taking the right hand of the corpse, I found it fastened in this way (<hi rend="italic">clenched</hi>)—I then looked across the body, and I saw that the left hand was clenched in the same manner—I observed nothing else—I returned immediately to town, and the next morn<lb/>ing communicated with my London solicitors—I communicated first with the uncle of the deceased, and then with my solicitors—they gave me a letter to Mr. Gardner, of Rugeley—I returned to Rugeley at 2 o'clock on the next day, Saturday—I left London by the 2 o'clock train, and got to Rugeley about 8 o'clock in the evening—on my arrival at the platform at Euston-square I saw Palmer, as I was leaving London—he said that he had received a telegraphic message after I had left Rugeley the night before, which had brought him to London—I think I asked him where Mr. Cook's horses were kept; he told me at Hednesford—I think he said he would drive me out there if I wished it—when I got to Wolverton I saw him again in the refreshment room—the train stops there for a few minutes—I said, "Mr. Palmer, this is a very melancholy thing, the death of my poor son happening so suddenly, and I think for the sake of his brother and sister, who are sometimes delicate in health, it would be desirable to know what his complaints were"—I meant his half-brother and his own sister; I think I said, "It might be desirable that their medical friends should know something of his complaints, and therefore I think I should like his body opened"—to that Palmer replied, "Oh, that can be done very well;" or, "That can be easily done;" or something of that sort—I think nothing more passed then, or very little more, nothing of importance; the bell rang and we went to our seats—he had not travelled with me in the same carriage, he had been in another carriage—he continued in the same Carriage which he had been in before, till we reached Rugby—I then saw him again in the refreshment room—he came to my side, indeed, as I was standing by the fire—I am not quite sure whether it was at that time or upon my arrival at Rugeley that I said to him, "Mr. Palmer, I am living at a distance, and the horses are said to be valuable, I had better ask some solicitor at Rugeley to look after my interests"—he said, "Oh, yes, you can do that; do you know any solicitor at Rugeley?"—I said, "No, I do not"—I believe the bell then ring again, and I ran off to get some refreshment, or for some purpose, and when I came back to my carriage I found Palmer sitting in my carriage; nothing further passed till we reached Rugeley; I had no conversation with him—there was a gentleman and lady in the carriage, with whom I had been conversing all the way from town, and I continued my conversation with them—I arrived at Rugeley between 7 and 8 o'clock; about 8 I think—when we reached Rugeley, Palmer said, "You were talking about a solicitor; do you know any solicitor in Ruge<lb/>ley?"—I think at that time we had reached the omnibus; I am not quite clear whether this took place on the platform or in the omnibus; we were but a few minutes in the station—I said, "No, I do not; for you know I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140056"/>
               <p>am a perfect stranger here"—he then said, "Oh! I know them all inti-mately; I can introduce you to one"—he said, "When I get home I must take a cup of coffee, and as soon as I have had that I will come over and tell you all about them"—I thanked him, as I had done once or twice before, and said I would not trouble him—he then repeated his offer, that he only wanted a cup of coffee, and he would come to me immediately; but he added, "You will not find any solicitor to<lb/>night"—I said, "Why not?"—he said, "It is late; besides, some of them live out of town"—I "Well," I said, "I never found any difficulty in finding a solicitor when I wanted one at any reasonable hour"—I think it was immediately after that, that changing the tone of my voice and my manner, I said, "Mr. Palmer, if I should call in a solicitor to give me advice, I suppose you will have no objection to answer him any questions he may choose to put to you"—I I altered my tone purposely—I had purposely mentioned the <hi rend="italic">post mortem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the alteration of your tone and manner appear to you to produce any impression upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I looked steadily at him, the moon was shining, I cannot say that I could see his face distinctly, but he said, with a spasmodic affection of the throat, which was perfectly evident to me, "Oh, no, certainly not"—I had purposely mentioned my desire to have the body opened—I when we were talking on the subject of the solicitor, something was said about taking a solicitor to Hednesford—I ought to say, that when I men<lb/>tioned the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> there was not the slightest change in Mr. Palmer's manner; he was perfectly calm and collected, and as usual—after this con<lb/>versation there was a pause for three or four minutes—he then again pro<lb/>posed to come over to me after he had had his coffee, to tell me about the solicitors, and I again begged that he would not trouble himself—in the course of the evening he came over to see me—that was after he had been home, and after I had been some time absent from the inn, seeking for Mr. Gardner—I went to Mr. Gardner's house that night, but did not find him at home—Palmer said, "It is a very unpleasant affair for me about these bills"—I said, "I think it right I should tell you, Mr. Palmer, that since I saw you I have heard rather a different account of Mr. Cook's affairs"—he said, "Oh! indeed; well, I hope it will be settled pleasantly, at all events;" or, "at any rate"—I said, "It will only be settled, sir, in the Court of Chancery;" or, "His affairs can only be settled there"—I do not recollect the precise words—I think he said again, "Oh, indeed!" in a lower tone—I think he then, after a short pause, asked me what friends Mr. Cook had to visit in the neighbourhood of London; this conversation, I think, passed at that time; what friends he had to visit in the neighbourhood of London, or what friends he visited—I said, "Several"—"Oh, but I mean," he said, "who does he stay with when he goes there?"—from the questions he put to me, he wished to know who had told me—I am not quite sure whether that same evening he did not speak about going to Hednesford—the next day, Sunday, I saw him again in the evening—I think between 5 and 6 o'clock, about 6—he came into the coffee room; my dinner was preparing, and was writing a letter—nobody was present—I am not sure whether it was on that night or the night before that he spoke about my going to Hednes<lb/>ford—this was what was said upon the subject, we were talking of going to Hednesford, Saunders, the trainer, lived there—and he said, "If I were you, I would not take a solicitor with me there"—I said, "Why not, Mr. Palmer?"—he said, "I should recommend you not;" or, "advise you not," I do not know which—I said, "Sir, I shall use my own judgment about that"—he said, "Oh, of course you will"—I said, "Of course I shall"—on the Sunday we had had some conversation on the subject of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140057"/>
               <p>not at this same interview—I am not sure whether it was not after the evening service—I think it was later in the evening, I am not quite sore; I know it was Sunday evening—he came into the room; I was sitting writing, and he approached me with a piece of paper in his hand as if he would give it me—I did not take it from him, I did not take any notice of him, I went on with my writing, and said, "Pray, Mr. Palmer, who is Mr. Smith of this place?"—I did not mention the Christian name—he said, "Smith, Smith, Smith," two or three times in that way, as if he did not know such a person—I said, "A Mr. Smith who sat up with my son one night, who slept in the room or sat up with my son"—he said, "Oh! he is a soli<lb/>citor in this town"—I said, "I ask you the question, sir, because as the betting book is missing, I should wish to know who was with the young man"—I first said, "Is he a solicitor in practice here?" and he said, "Yes"—after a short pause, I said, "Pray, Mr. Palmer, did you attend my poor son in a medical capacity?"—he said, "Oh, dear, no?"—I said, "I ask you that question because I am determined to have his body examined, and if you had attended him medically I suppose the gentlemen I shall call in would think it proper that you should be present"—I think the next thing he said was, "Can you tell me who is to perform the examination?" or words to that effect—I said, "I cannot, I shall not know myself until the morning; but I think it right to tell you of it; I shall have it done for my satisfaction, and whether you are present or not is a matter of indifference to me, if the gentlemen employed think it right you should attend"—"So it is to me," he said—he again asked who the medical gentlemen were to be who were to perform the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination; and I said, "I do not know, I can<lb/>not tell myself."</p>
               <p>

I hear there is a suspicion of poisoning"—he said, "Oh, no, I think not; he had an epileptic fit on Monday and Tuesday night, and you will find old disease in the heart and in the head"—we then went together into Mr. Bamford's house—I had been requested to go from Stafford to be present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, and I had brought no instruments with me—Palmer said that he had instruments, and offered to lend them to me—he also said that there was a very queer old man, who seemed to suspect him, of something, and that he did not know what he would he at, or what he wanted—he also said, "He seems to suspect that I have got the betting, book, but Cook had no betting book that would be of use to any one"—Mr. Bamford and I then went to Mr. Frere's—we walked together—Mr. Frere is a surgeon, in Rugeley—Mr. Frere told me something there, but Palmer was not present—from there we proceeded to the Talbot Arms, and the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was proceeded with—Mr. Devonshire operated, and Mr. Newton assisted him—Mr. Bamford, Mr. Palmer, and several other persons, were in the room—I stood near Mr. Devonshire, who operated, to observe what was going on—the body was very stiff, much more than dead bodies are five or six days after death—the muscles were very highly deve<lb/>loped; by which I mean, strongly contracted, and thrown out—I supposed that there had been strong spasmodic action in the body before death—I examined the hands—they were firmly clenched—the abdominal viscera were first examined.</p>

The stomach, on being removed, contained some ounces of a brown fluid—the large curvature resting on the spleen was of dark colour. The internal mucous membrane of the stomach was without ulceration or excoriation. On the inferior surface of the cardiac extremity were minute yellowish-white specks, of the size of mustard seeds. The small intestines contained some bilious fluid in the duodenum; they were altogether small and contracted, but presented no other remarkable appearance. The large intestines contained some fluid feculent matter. The spleen and pancreas seemed to be healthy. The right kidney was rather large, soft, and its whole texture full of blood; there were no granulations, nor coagulable lymph. The left kidney was of less size, but its appearance was the same as the right, in less degree. Between the base of the tongue and epiglottis were numerous enlarged follicles like warts. The œsophagus and epiglottis were natural. The larynx was stained with dark blood, which had pene<lb/>trated through all its tissues. The lungs contained much fluid blood in their posterior parts, which would be accounted for by gravitation. The lungs everywhere contained air. The pleura were healthy, the heart was of natural size, and in every part healthy. In the aorta, immediately behind the valves, were some yellow-greyish-white patches like soft cartilage. The heart presented no remarkable appearance. The skull was of natu<lb/>ral thickness. The dura mater had its arteries injected with blood. There was no excess of serum, nor adhesions. The pia mater and arach-noid, as well as the brain, appeared altogether healthy; all the blood was fluid and uncoagulated. Signed, J. T. Harland, M. D.")—That is the whole of the report—the abdominal viscera were the first parts that were examined—I found them in a perfectly healthy state—they were taken out of the body—we examined the liver, that was healthy—the lungs were healthy, there was much blood in them, there was slight emphysema—I do not think there was more blood than could be accounted for by gravitation—I noticed some appearances at the end of the stomach—I also examined the head; the brain was quite healthy, there was no extravasation of blood on the brain, and no serum—there was nothing in the appearance of the brain which, in my judgment, would cause pressure—the heart was con<lb/>tracted, and contained no blood; that did not appear to be the result of disease, but of action; I should attribute it to spasmodic action—the stomach was taken out, and at the lower end of it there were numerous small yellow-ish white specks about the size of mustard seeds—those appearances, in my judgment, would not at all account for death—I do not know whether they would have any effect upon the health—I think they may have been mucous follicles, nothing more—I am doubtful whether they would damage the health at all—I examined the kidneys—they were full of blood, which had gravitated there since death; there was no appearance of disease—the blood was in a fluid state; that is not usual; we find it so in some cases of sudden death, but such cases are rare—to find the blood in a fluid state is a rare occurrence, even in cases of sudden death—I did not observe about the whole body any disease or appearance of disease which could account for death—I discovered no appearance of organic disease—the lower part of the spinal cord was not minutely examined on that occasion—I examined the upper part, it presented a perfectly natural appearance—on a subsequent day it was thought right to exhume the body, in order to examine the spinal cord—that was done on, I think, 25th Jan.—Dr. Monckton made a report in writing of that second examination, it was made jointly—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140061"/>
               <p>whole of the spinal cord was then minutely examined—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the report—it is a true statement of what I observed—(<hi rend="italic">Reading</hi>: "Report of an examination of the spinal cord of the exhumed body of John Parsons Cook, Esq., on Friday, Jan. 25th, 1856. We, the undersigned, were shown the corpse which, to the certain knowledge of one of us, namely, Mr. Bam<lb/>ford, was that of the late John Parsons Cook, Esq., who died at Rugeley, Staffordshire, Nov. 20th, 1855, and were requested by the officers of the Crown to institute an examination into the condition of the spinal cord. The body was enclosed in both a shell and a coffin, and was found lying on its back The cranium, thorax, and abdomen had been opened at a previous examina<lb/>tion, and decomposition had proceeded rapidly in these parts in consequence of the admission of air. There was much rigidity of some of the muscles of the body, considerable force being required to flex the legs or to alter the position of the different limbs. The thumbs and fingers were partially but firmly flexed; the toes as firmly extended, and the inner edge of each foot drawn up by the <hi rend="italic">tibiales antici et postici</hi>, as in talipes," (that is a species of club foot,) "the postici slightly predominating, so as to point the toes downwards. The muscles of the neck and trunk were relaxed. We observed much lividity of the integuments of the dorsal surface of the body, putrefaction having softened and discoloured them. A longitudinal incision having been made along the course of, and down to, the spines of the vertebra, from occiput to sacrum, the muscles were reflected on either side from off the vertebral laminæ, these muscles presenting no other evidence of putrefaction than some softening but slight sero-sangui<lb/>neous infiltration. Sawing through the laminá, we removed the spinet of the vertebras, and so opened the spinal canal in its whole length. These portions of the posterior wall of the canal were successively and minutely examined, but no roughness, spicula, or other irregularity could be discovered The medulla spinalis now lay beneath our view, enclosed in its fibrous sheath, and surrounded on all sides by loose areolar tissue and fat, traversed in all directions by veins. This areolar tissue had not the colour ordinarily possessed by it in the recent state, but was of a livid hue, or of deep prune juice colour. This was, doubtless, owing to its being saturated, as a sponge would be, with the sanguineo-serous fluid which occupied the canal to a considerable extent, having gravitated to this dependent part of the body subsequent to its death. The chest having been raised on a large block, so as to give a proper curve to the dorsal portion of the spine, this fluid had mainly gravitated to the lumbar region; but the areolar tissue, lining the walls of the vertebral canal, was throughout its whole length infiltrated, saturated, and stained with this bloody serum. We now divided the dura mater, or medullary sheath, longitudinally, in its whole length, reflecting it off the cord on either side, a very small quantity of sanguinolent serum had gravitated within the sheath to the lumbar region, where it was lying staining the canal equina. The arachnoid was glistening and perfectly transparent The medulla oblongata had been separated from the medulla spinalis on a level with the atlas, and the medulla spinalis, as it lay in <hi rend="italic">situ</hi>, presented a most healthy appearance, smooth, glistening, and of a greyish-white colour; presenting, in fact, no departure from its usual normal character and condition. The post roots of the spinal nerves were regular in their origin and course, and when traced to their points of emergence from the canal exhibit no abnormal appearance whatsoever; they had a some<lb/>what darker grey colour than had the cord itself. The cord was next raised from its sheath, and its nerves being one by one divided, it was removed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140062"/>
               <p>from the canal, its anterior surface and the anterior roots of the spinal nerves being now scrutinized, they appeared in every way as healthy and free from disease as did the posterior. Stains or discolorations of the cords or nerves were readily removed by the effusion of water. There was no appearance of fulness of the veins of the spinal cord, or its members; the upper part of the cord, being more exposed by the previous opening of the skull, was softened by decomposition, but, upon examination, neither it nor any other part of the spinal cord showed any signs of disease. The proper envelope of the cord contained the nervous matter in a pulpy state, being softened by decomposition. After the removal of the cord, its fibrous sheath and osseous canal were carefully examined by the eye and finger cast along its whole length, and this proved the absence of all unnatural appearance or condition, roughness, irregularity, fracture, dislocation, exostosis, or spicula of bone, except at a point opposite the third and fourth cervical vertebrá where both the eye and the finger detected a slightly granular roughness of the arachnoid surface of the dura mater. Upon closer examination this slight roughness was found to depend upon the presence beneath the arach-noid of some twenty or thirty minute irregularly shaped granules, of some hard material barely raising the surface in a perceptible degree, they were found scattered over a space of less than an inch square. No more could be found elsewhere, each granule was gritty and hard under the point of the scalpel, and under the microscope had an appearance rather of calcareous than of osseous matter. The dura mater of the brain was next carefully examined, but nothing abnormal was found; no spiculae nor granules such as described above were detected. We believe that these granules could have no connection whatsoever with the death of deceased. Deduction: The only conclusion, therefore, at which we could arrive after this examination was a negative one. That there was nothing in the condition of the spinal cord or its en velopes to account for death; nothing but the most normal and healthy state, allowance being made for the lapse of time since the death of deceased. J. T. Harland, M. D., William Bam ford, apothecary, D. Henry Monckton, M. D.")—I am still of opinion that there was nothing in the appearances I have just described to account for the death of the deceased—there was nothing of an unusual kind that could not be referred to changes that took place after death—when the stomach and intestines at the first examination were removed from the body, they were separately emptied into a jar—Mr. Devonshire and Mr. Newton were the only two who operated—the prisoner at that particular period was standing at the right of Mr. Newton, and I observed that while Mr. Devonshire was open<lb/>ing the stomach, a push was given by Palmer which pushed Mr. Newton on to Mr. Devonshire, and which shook a portion of the contents of the stomach into the body, upon which I said, "Do not do that"—I thought a joke was passing among them, and I said, "Do not do that," to the whole of them—nothing was said on that observation of mine by either of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Mr. Devonshire, in your presence, express a contrary opinion, and say that they were unhealthy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said there was emphysema, and he thought there was congestion of the lungs—emphysema is not a natural state—it is a very constant state in persons who are supposed to be in health to the slight extent that he had it—they are not supposed to be in health until they die—it is a diseased state of the lungs—it consists in a distension of the air cells—it is an abnormal state of the lungs—the lungs were full of blood—the heart was empty—I examined the white spots on the wider part of the stomach—I examined them by removing the mucus that was on the surface of the stomach with the finger or scalpel—I had no lens, no glass—I should have examined them with a lens had I had one—my exa<lb/>mination of those appearances was satisfactory to me without a lens—I reported that the brain was healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of examination did you make of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The brain was carefully taken out, and was sliced—we first of all examined the ex<lb/>ternal part, and then slices were taken off from the apex at the base of the brain—they were thin slices, I should think a quarter of an inch thick—I think that that was sufficiently thin to show any disease, if there was any—if there had been any appearance of disease we should have examined the part more carefully, but there was no appearance of anything unhealthy—we examined the spinal cord as far as we possibly could on the first <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I requested Mr. Devonshire to cut the spinal cord as far down as he could, so that we might examine, and I said if there was any appearance of disease we must then open the canal.</p>

               <p>than that of sudden death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have read that in cases of poisoning the blood is sometimes fluid, in cases of poisoning by arsenic and strychnine—the white spots on the stomach were quite visible to the naked eye—I had no difficulty in ascertaining what they were, and their extent—there was nothing whatever in the brain to indicate the presence of any disease of any sort; if there had been, I never knew or read of any diseased state of the brain occasioning death by tetanus—there was nothing in the state of the spinal cord at all to account for the symptoms attending the death—death had not produced any amount of relaxation there—in my opinion, if I had examined the state of the spinal cord immediately, or recently after death, I should not have been able to make a better examination of it than I was when I did examine it—there is no disease with which I am acquainted which would produce tetanus and that form of death—sometimes in inflam<lb/>mation of the membranes of the spine there is tetanus—there was no appear<lb/>ance of inflammation whatever here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To what do you ascribe the granules that you found there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not unfrequent, on the dura mater particularly, for there to be small granules which are called Pacchionian glands—I should consider these were something of the same nature—it is doubtful whether that is a diseased con<lb/>dition or not; they are never found in young persons, they are almost always found after adult age—I believe hardly any one is exempt from them—I never saw a head without them.</p>

I made an examination of the spinal cord of the deceased man—the muscles of the trunk and neck were in a state of laxity, which I should consider due to the commencing decay of the body—that would certainly not be inconsistent with the fact of there having been great rigidity of those muscles at the time of death—I found the muscles of the arms and legs in a state of rigidity—I cannot say that it was an unnatural amount of rigidity—I think the rigidity was not more than I should consider would be found in an ordinary dead body, considering the time, but the position was peculiar; the muscles of the arms had partially flexed the fingers, the fingers were between flexion and extension—that partial clenching of the hand was very firm, it required considerable force to relax or alter the position—the feet were turned inwards much more than is usual—I care<lb/>fully examined the spinal cord—I wrote the report which has been read by Dr. Harland—the condition in which that part of the body then was, was such as to enable me to make a satisfactory examination of it—if there had been, prior to death, any diseased or abnormal condition in that part of the body, I should, I think, have had no difficulty in detecting it—I am speak<lb/>ing of the part of the body to which I confined my examination, the spinal</p>

I do not think it was mentioned at the inquest yesterday that Cook was taken ill on Sunday and Monday night in the same way as he was on the Tuesday night when ke died. The chamber maid at the Crown Hotel, Mastere's, can prove this; I also believe that a man by the name of Fisher is coming down to prove he received some money at Shrewsbury. New here he could only pay Smith 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he owned him. Had you not better call Smith to prove this? And, again, whatever Professor Taylor may say to-morrow, he wrote from Lonon last Tuesday night to Gardner to say, 'We and Dr Rees have this day finished our analysis, and find no traces of either strychnia, prussic acid, or opium.' What can beat this from a man like Taylor, if he says what he has already said, and Dr. Harland's evidence? Mind you, I know and saw it in black and white what Taylor said to Gardner; but this is strictly private and con-fidential, but it is true. As regards his betting book, I know nothing of it, and it is of no good to any one. I hope the verdict to<lb/>morrow will be that ke died of natural causes, and thus emd it fiver yours. W.

               <p>how much does that make it?"—I deducted the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the 1,020<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sold, "984<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "That is what Cook makes it; if I give you 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it will make up 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; out of that pay yourself 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that will pay fur my bill"—I stopped reading there, and said, "Your bill; I know no difference between your bills"—he said, "Pay Padwick 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Pratt 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there are two addresess on the paper—one he wrote himself, "H.

Bank of England note—he required 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I was not able to give him change—he said if I would give him a cheque that would be the same thing—I gave him a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and nine sovereigns—I believe I bad two other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in my pockety I do not know the number or date of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note he gave me—as I was going away he pressed me to send the cheques to Pratt and Padwick immediately—he said if I sent them immediately it would be before the closing of the bank, or before bank time, or some remark of that description—he said, "When you have settled this account, write down word to either me or Cook"—that was the first instruction he gave me, to send to him or Cook; I was then going out of the room, and I turned round and said, "I shall certainly write to Mr. Cook"—I said that because I thought I was settling Mr. Cook's account—he said, "It don't much matter which"—I I said, "If I address Mr. Cook, Palmer, Bugeley, Stafford, that will be correct, will it not?"—he said, "Yen"—after leaving Beaufort-buildings I went to Tattersall's—I there received all the money on Cook's account, except 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of Mr. Morris, who paid me only 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sent from Tattersall's a cheque for 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Pratt—I posted a letter to Cool from Tattersaill's, addressed as I have mentioned—on the next day, Tuesday, the 20th, I received a telegraphic message—I have not got it here, I gave it to Captain Hatton, on the Coroner's Inquest, at Kugeley—in consequence of receiving that message I wrote again on that day to Mr. Cook—I addressed that letter as before, I believe that letter was not posted till the Wednesday—I have here some bills of exchange (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I know I Palmer's handwriting—I have never seen him write, the only letter I ever received from him was the one handed in—I know Cook's handwriting—I believe the signature to two of these bills and the acceptance to the third to be in Cook's handwriting, but I am no judge of handwriting—I have</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and surgeon to the London Hospital. I have turned my attention parti<lb/>cularly to the subject of tetanus—I have published a work on that subject—tetanus signifies spasmodic affection of the voluntary muscles of the body—of the disease, there are two sorts only, idiopathic and traumatic—there are other diseases in which we see tetanic contraction, but we should not term them tetanus—idiopathic tetanus is a primary disease, it is tetanus originating, as it were, as a primary disease, without any wound apparently self-generated—the traumatic proceeds from a wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what causes, as for as you are aware, does idiopathic tetanus arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From exposure to damp and cold; from the irritation of worms in the alimentary canal—it is not a frequent disease in this country, a very rare one—where it does arise, it does not usually end fatally—I am not able to say what proportion the cases which end fatally bear to the general number of cases which arise, for I have never seen a case of idiopathic tetanus—I have been surgeon to the London Hospital twenty<lb/>two years—in all that time I have never seen a case of idiopathic tetanus—cases of traumatic tetanus are much wore frequent—I speak quite within compass when I say I have seon fifty cases; I believe 100 would be nearer the mark.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell us how the symptoms of traumatic tetanus first manifest themselves, and describe how the disease goes on to it's climax? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The disease first manifests itself <hi rend="italic">by</hi> a stiffness about the jaws and the back of the neck—rigidity of the muscles of the abdomen usually sets in early—a dragging pain at the pit of the stomach is almost a constant symptom from spasm of the diaphragm, and in many instances in acute oases the muscles of the back are extensively affected; then the spasms, though continuous, are liable to aggravation and come on in occasional paroxysms—as the disease goes on, these paroxysms become more frequent and more severe—when they occur, the body is drawn backwards—in some instances, though less fre<lb/>quently, it is bent forwards—then, in an acute case, a difficulty in swallow<lb/>ing is a very common symptom—a difficulty in breathing also during the paroxysm, a choking sensation—the disease may end, supposing it to be fatal, in two ways: the patient may die somewhat suddenly of suffocation, owing to closure of the opening of the windpipe, or glottis; or the patient may be worn out by the severe and painful spasms, and the muscles may relax, and the patient gradually sink and die—traumatic tetanus is generally fatal—the locking of the jaw is an almost constant symptom in tetanus from wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then lockjaw is a common symptom of traumatic tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it an invariable symptom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost constant—may say constant, in a greater or less degree; it is not always strongly marked, but generally so—it is an early symptom—have omitted another symptom which is important, a peculiar expression of the counte<lb/>nance, very characteristic of the disease—it shows itself generally throughout the countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this peculiar to traumatic or idiopathio tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I be<lb/>lieve not—my observations are taken from traumatic cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the appearance? can you describe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a contracted condition of the eyelids, a raising of the angle of the mouth, a contraction of the brow—in traumatic tetanus the lower extremities are sometimes affected, and sometimes, but somewhat rarely, the upper; the muscles affected are chiefly those of the trunk—when the muscles of the extremities are affected the period of the disease at which that occurs varies; sometimes, when the wound is in the lower extremities, the muscles of the extremities may be affected early—if you have a wound on either the arm or the legs, they are affected generally at an advanced period—I never knew or read of traumatic tetanus being produced from sore throat or from chancre—know of no instance of any syphilitic sore leading to tetanus—think it is a very unlikely case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long, ordinarily speaking, does a case of traumatic tetanus, which ends fatally, take before death ensues? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It varies very much, from twenty<lb/>four hours to three or four days, or longer—the shortest period which ever came to my knowledge in which the disease ran it's course and ended fatally, was eight or ten hours; the time could not be precisely ascertained—the disease, when once commenced, is continuous—never knew or heard of a case in which a man would be attacked one day, and then have twenty<lb/>four hour's entire respite, and be attacked again the next—as <hi rend="italic">far</hi> as my experience goes, such a thing could not be—should think it was not tetanus—heard the account given by Mr. Jones, the surgeon, of the death of the deceased man Cook—the symptoms there were not consistent with any form of traumatic tetanus which has ever come under my knowledge or observation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What distinguished them from the cases of traumatic tetanus which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140080"/>
               <p>you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was the sudden onset of the fatal symptoms—in all cases that have fallen under my notice the disease has been preceded by the milder symptoms of tetanus, gradually progressing to their complete development and termination and death—I heard also the description whicih was given by the woman Mills of what he went through on the Monday night—in my judgment, those were not symptoms of tetanus, there was the ab<lb/>sence of a continuity of symptoms between those two attacks—I am speak<lb/>ing of tetanus generally—I am not alluding to traumatic tetanus especially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are asked if, according to the symptoms described by Elizabeth Mills, you think the patient was suffering from tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have said no—I mean not from the tetanus of disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming tetanus to be synonymous with convulsive or spasmodic action of the muscles, was there in that sense tetanus on Monday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt there was spasmodic action of that muscles, but there was not what I should call either idiopathic or traumatic tetanus on the Monday night—I say that because of the sudden onset of the spasms and their rapid subsidence—they are not, in my opinion, con<lb/>sistent with the true form of tetanus—there is a form of tetanus also called hysteric tetanus—that is rather hysteria combined with spasms, or tetanic symptoms—that does not end fatally; I do not know an instance of it—do not know an instance of that disease in a male, possibly there may be—I I know that certain poisons produce tetanus; nuz vomica, through its two poisons, the strychnia and the brucia—they are poisons of a cognate charac<lb/>ter, only the brucia is much milder than strychnia—they both come from the nux vomica—I have never seen a case of human or animal life destroyed by strychnia—St. Ignatius's bean, I believe, is said to produce that effect—I do not know of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that your experience is confined to traumatic tetanus; have you known that descrip<lb/>tion of tetanus arise from any disease of the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Spasms I have known arise from disease of the spinal cord—the irritation of any of it's afferent nerves might be likely to produce tetanus—afferent means nerva proceeding to the spinal cord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated your opinion that almost constantly traumatic tetanus commences by lock jaw with greater or less violence or intensity; do you agree with this opinion of Dr. Watson, in his "Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Phsic," that "in four cases, perhaps, out of five, the disease begins with trismus or lock jaw?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With reference to the causes which may produce all the symptoms of tetanic convulsions, do you agree with Dr. Watson that it may arise from causes as slight as these, the sticking of a fish bone in the fauces, a slight wound of the ear by a musket shot, the mere stroke by a whip lash under the eye, though the skin be not broken, from the cutting of a corn, from a bite on the finger by a tame sparrow, from the blow of a stone on the neck or hand, from the insertion of a seton, from the extraction of a tooth, from the operation of cupping, and simple things of that character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; except, perhaps, from the concussion of the ear by the musket ball: I should, perhaps, question that one—I know of no well authenticated instance of traumatic tetanus occurring as shortly as a quarter of an hour after a slight injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told my friend you wrote a treatise on tetanus, which I see obtained the Jacksonian prize for the year 1834; did you inquire into the following case before you gave it as an instance: "Another rapidly fatal case is mentioned by the late Professor Robertson, of Edinburgh; a negro</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140081"/>
               <p>having scratched his thumb with a piece of broken china, was seized with tetanus, and in a quarter of an hour after the injury he was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did refer to the authority as far as I could, but I did not find any reference to it except in the Encyclopædia; and when I wrote that book I was a young man of twenty-two years of age—I think I am of maturer judgment and greater experience now—idiopathic tetanus would not be 90 likely to bring a patient to the hospital as a sudden wound leading to traumatic teta-nus—idiopathic tetanus would possibly have come more likely in the first instance under the notice of a physician than a surgeon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known any case of idiopathic tetanus in this country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have heard and read of such oases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHRE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that very lately there was a case in the London Hospital in which tetanus came on so rapidly, or rather so unaccountably, that it was referred to strychnia, and it was thought necessary to examine the stomach of the patient to see whether strychnia, existed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew that before the history of the case was investigated—I have heard that the body being examined, no strychnia was found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And do you not also know, on a full examination of the body, symp<lb/>toms of old syphilitic ulcers on the arms were discovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do know that sores were discovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bid you superintend that case yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—it was not my patient—I did not personally see the patient—he was only in the hospital half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know who did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The house sur<lb/>geons, who are now in Court—I do not think it is very likely that the irri-tation of a syphilitic sore by wet, cold, drink, mercury, or mental excitement, would lead to tetanic symptoms—I think the irritation likely to lead to anything of that kind may be produced from friction, as in the case in the hospital to which you alluded, but syphilitic sores are not much exposed to friction, in the throat, I mean—the irritation from a sore would fairly justify the case being termed traumatic—cases very rarely occur which it is difficult to class under the head of traumatic, as distinguished from idiopathic tetanus—I class the irritation of the intestines under idiopathic—epilepsy is not sometimes accompanied with tetanic contractions; by prolonged con<lb/>tractions, continuous contractions, as contradistinguished from spasmodic—that is not the character of the spasms of epilepsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are not the contractions of epilepsy sometimes continuous, so that the hand will be twisted into various forms, and remain rigidly fixed in those forms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not continuously; I think not for five or ten minutes together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to convulsions generally, without reference to wounds, does it not frequently happen that convulsions attributable to no cause, the trace of which cannot be found in the body after death by any disease or lesion of any kind, are known to have occurred in the most violent and spastic way, and to have exhibited the appearance of tetanic convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No instance of the kind has fallen under my observation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree in this opinion of Dr. Copland, who is an authority of considerable eminence, in his "Dictionary of Practical Medicine," under the head of "General Convulsions," "The character of the abnormal con<lb/>traction of the muscles is in some cases of the most violent and spastic nature, frequently of some continuance, the relaxation being of brief dura<lb/>tion, or scarcely observable, and in others nearly or altogether approaching to tetanic"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should rather speak from my own observation—I have not observed anything of the kind.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140084"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this definition of general convulsions correct in your opinion, "Violent and involuntary contractions of a part or of the whole body, some<lb/>times with rigidity and tension, tonic convulsions, but more frequently with tumultuous agitation, consisting of alternating shocks, chloric convulsions, that come on suddenly either in recurring or distinct paroxysms, and in irregular and uncertain intervals"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be a correct definition; but one has to read over very carefully a statement of that kind before one would give wholly one's consent to it—I do not think it often happens that an adult patient dies of convulsions, spasmodic in the sense of their being tumultuous and alternating, and tonic in the sense of exhibiting a continuous rigidity, and yet after death no disease is found—I know of no instance—I do not know from my reading and science, as a writer on tetanus, and one who has attended to this description of complaint, that it is so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this true, I read it from your own book, "Tetanus is a functional disease of the nervous system, that is to say, a disease unaccompanied with any perceptible lesion of structure, the nature of which, although essentially distinct from inflammation, is completely unknown, and there are, there<lb/>fore, no morbid changes peculiar to tetanus, and by which it can be recog<lb/>nised"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If your previous question, as well as this, has reference to morbid appearances, I have no hesitation in saying persons do die of tetanus and other diseases without morbid appearances after death—in respect of general convulsions not so marked as to be properly classed as tetanic, I do not think that they sometimes happen suddenly without any premonitory symptoms, and sometimes are preceded by premonitory symptoms; but I have not really observed the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I must ask you whether you agree in this, whether in convulsions not so marked as to be tetanic, they are not constantly preceded by nausea, retching, and vomiting, pain, and distension of the stomach, and left hypo<lb/>chondrium, and flatulence of the stomach and bowels, and other dyspeptic symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The class of cases you allude to do not come under my observation as a hospital surgeon—I think it is very likely that general convulsions are often accompanied with yelling and shrieking—I do not know that they frequently terminate in death, and that the proximate cause of that death is spasm of the respiratory muscles, inducing asphyxia—the Pacchionean glands are not in the spinal sheath; they are in one of the fissures of the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These general convulsions, about which my friend asked you some general questions, are they distinguishable from tetanus, properly so called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a medical practitioner, who saw a case of general convulsions, would be able at once, if a man of competent skill, to know the difference between such symptoms as those and of tetanus, which I have been talking of—there is generally loss of consciousness—one of the characteristic features of tetanus is that the consciousness is not affected.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would not include in that, I pre<lb/>sume, a case of tetanus resulting from poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think myself, that the term tetanus ought not to be applied to cases of poisoning for the symptoms are so essentially distinct from the disease—I should designate the symptoms tetanic in order to distinguish the character of the convul<lb/>sions—I have had under my observation cases of traumatic tetanus—in cases of traumatic tetanus arising from some lesion, the symptoms are precisely the same, as in cases of idiopathic and traumatic tetanus—the disease begins with stiffness about the jaw—the symptoms then extend themselves to the other muscles of the trunk of the body, and the symptoms gradually deve<lb/>lops themselves—when once disease has begun there are remissions, but I should say not complete and entire remissions—there is a diminution of the severity, but not a total subsidence; the patient does not express himself as quite comfortable or well—I speak from my own experience solely—as to the usual period that elapses between the commencement and the termination of the disease, the cases may be divided into two classes; there is an acute class and a chronic class, the acute cases will terminate in the course of three or four days, chronic cases will go on from nineteen to twenty<lb/>two or twenty<lb/>three days, and perhaps even longer—I do not think that I have known a case in which death occurred within four days in my own experience, but I know that some cases are related—in tetanus properly speaking, the extre<lb/>mities are affected, but not so severely as the muscles of the trunk—the affection of the extremities is at a late stage—the locking of the jaw is an early symptom—epilepsy does not 'produce tetanus or tetanic symptoms—it will produce convulsions, and sometimes the convulsions of epilepsy assume somewhat of a tetanic character, but they are essentially distinct from tetanus; they are very different from tetanus—when the epileptic con<lb/>vulsions assume somewhat of a tetanic form they are very quickly over, not persistent, not continuous—in epilepsy there is an abolition of consciousness for the time: that is a distinguishing feature of epilepsy as distinguished from all other convulsive diseases, and from tetanus—I should say that apoplexy is not accompanied with tetanic convulsions; perhaps I may be allowed to state that sometimes when there is an effusion of blood into the brain, and a particular portion of the brain is involved for a time, an apo<lb/>plectic patient may exhibit something of tetanic convulsions, the muscles are thrown into short tetanic convulsions—the consciousness in such a case would be completely destroyed—having heard the symptoms described of this gentleman's seizure and death, and also the appearances after death at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, I am not of opinion that there was either epilepsy or apoplexy.</p>

               <p>request of Mr. Palmer—I first saw him about 3 o'clock, on Saturday, 17th Nov.—I found him suffering from violent vomiting—his stomach could not retain a table spoonful of anything—he was in bed—I saw no other symp<lb/>torn except sickness—he was in no pain—his pulse did not exceed seventy<lb/>two—perfect moisture of the skin—perfectly sensible, no other symptom what<lb/>ever, I prescribed the medicine for him—Mr. Palmer went up to my house—I prescribed a saline medicine to be taken in an effervescing state—in the evening Mr. Palmer called upon me between 7 and 8 o'clock to request I would go with him again—I then saw the deceased—sickness still continued—I gave him a slight opiate—Palmer stayed until I prepared the pills, and he took them away with him—I did not go with Mr. Palmer when he took the pills—between 5 and 9 o'clock on the Sunday morning Mr. Palmer called upon me again—I went with him—I saw Mr. Cook in presence of Mr. Palmer—he was still sick, and continued so—I remained with him about ten minutes, and he continued to eject all he took—he then asked me to neutralize the medicine, as he did not like to take it in an effervescent state—I did not see him take anything—I did not examine what came from him—I saw several basins, and saw him throw up—the vomit was clear—I saw no appearance of bile, or in any way discoloured—he did not throw any blood from his stomach—what came from it was as clear as water—I saw him again between 6 and 7 o'clock on the Sunday evening—Mr. Palmer asked me to go with him—he still continued sick and bad—no pain what<lb/>ever—the skin quite moist when I saw him, he said his bowels had been moved twice or three times—his motions were in a natural state, and con<lb/>tained bile—no blood was with the motions—I made pressure upon the stomach, but he did not complain of any tenderness or pain whatever—I last saw him on Sunday, between 5 and 9 o'clock in the morning; he still complained of sickness, and had thrown up—on Monday I altered his medi<lb/>cine—I mixed the medicine and sent it to the Talbot; it was a draught to be taken every three or four hours—it was composed of three drachms of sulphate of magnesia, two of hyoscyamus, simple syrup, and one and a half drachm of tincture of henbane and five oz. of infusion of roses, made up in a six 02. bottle—a fourth part to be taken every three or four hours—I did not see him take the medicine—I saw the bottle in his bedroom, and some of it had been taken—he said the medicine agreed with him, and he had not been sick-since he took it—he had taken a basin of coffee, and a basin of broth; he said he should continue the medicine as it had done him a great deal of good—I saw him in the evening again, between 6 and 7 o'clock—he said he had been up and was comfortable, and wanted the two pills again in the evening, which I prepared and sent down—I sent them by my servant—I did not at any time see any pill box in the room—he had taken pills on each night from Saturday—they contained half a grain of morphia, one grain of calomel, four grains of rhubarb, divided into two pills, they were made up with a conserve of hip—between 7 and 8 o'clock on Tuesday morning I met Mr. Palmer in the street—he said he had been with Mr. Cook, that he was composed, and appeared very quiet and comfortable, and he did not wish him disturbed—on the same night Mr. Palmer called upon me between 7 and 8 o'clock, and asked me to go down—this was between 7 and 8 o'clock—he intro-duced me to Mr. Jones, of Lutterworth—in the presence of Mr. Jones and Mr. Palmer I again examined Mr. Cook—this was the first time I saw any change in him—he was irritable and uncomfortable—his pulse was then between 80 and 90, a full pulse and firm—his mind appeared distressed</p>

               <p>and irritable—he turned himself round in the bed, his face from me; stood on the left hand side of the bed, and Mr. Jones and Mr. Palmer on the other—he turned towards Mr. Palmer, and said, "I will hare no more pills to-night"—Cook said he would take no more medicine—Mr. Jones and Mr. Palmer came out of the room with me; we had a consultation together afterwards—Mr. Palmer and I went to my house—I made the pills in his presence—he asked me to write a direction; it was on a slip of paper, and was wrapped up with the box—they were the same pills I had before prescribed—I sealed them and gave them to Mr. Palmer—about a quarter past 12 o'clock on Wednesday morning I was called up and desired to go immediately to the Talbot—I there found Mr. Cook dead, and Mr. Jones and Mr. Palmer stood by his bed side—the body was not then cold—his body was perfectly straight, and he lay on his back—I left Mr. Palmer and Mr. Jones in the room—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, Mr. Devonshire made it—Dr. Harland, Mr. Palmer, and" Mr. Newton were also present—the examination was made on 26th Nov., six days after death—the body had not changed colour—the stomach was opened, and nothing particular was found there—the intestines, there were secretions in the lower part of the bowels—I could not discover the cause of death—the heart was quite empty—I thought the vessels of the brain, after the skull was removed, were rather full—there did not appear to be any congestion of the brain—the lungs were perfectly healthy—they were not in the least congested, they did not appear diseased—I did not then notice the Mood—there was nothing in the blood to attract my attention—the effervescing mixture was twenty grains of carbonate of potash, two drachms of com<lb/>pound tincture of cardamums, about two drachms of simple syrup and water—the acid was fifteen grains of tartaric acid in powder, fifteen grains in each paper—I keep the preparations of antimony, but gave him none—it was the acetate of morphia I gave him—ho one but myself mixed up the medicines—I keep strychnine locked up in a cupboard in the parlour—I carry the key—I may have about two drachms—it is sometimes used as a medicine—I have not used it for the last lour or five years—I am quite sure I made the pills from the same bottle, and no other—I have tartarized antimony and tartaric acid, but not close together—tartarized antimony in a pound bottle, and tartaric acid in a four-ounce bottle—I did not see the effervescing mixture after I made it, and Mr. Palmer took it away—I saw the mixture afterwards, when a portion had been taken, but I did not see the powders—the bottle containing the morphia is an ounce one, and is a stopper bottle—the other, strychnia, has a cork—the strychnia is tied up with leather—deceased's tongue was perfectly clear all the three days I saw him—I prepared the pills by candle light—I did not particularly observe deceased's eyes on Tuesday evening—I mixed up eight pills altogether, but at different times—his skin was moist—there was no fever—the heart was entirely empty—when I saw Mr. Cook on the Monday he did not complain that he had been ill—when I saw Mr. Palmer on the Tuesday he did say that Mr. Cook had had a fit—he also Said that Mr. Cook had had two fits before, but that he had not been called to him—when Mr. Palmer called upon me first it was on the Saturday, and he told me that he had dined with Mr. Cook on the previous day, and he had taken too much champagne—I said to Mr. Cook, "I understand you have been taking a little too much champagne"—Mr. Cook said he believed he had had a little too much, and that he was not in the habit of taking much—I have attended other patients for Mr. Palmer—the paper produced, containing the words, "One</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. TODD</hi>, <hi rend="italic">continued.</hi> Having heard that evidence read, and taking it into consideration, together with what I have heard about the symptoms from the other witnesses, I am certainly not of opinion that death was pro<lb/>duced by apoplexy or from epilepsy—I never knew tetanus arise either from syphilitic sores or from sore throat—there are poisons which will pro<lb/>duce tetanic convulsions—the principal of those poisons are nux vomica, which contains, as its active principle, strychnine and brucia, and Saint Ignatius's bean also—I have never seen a case of death in a human subject from that poison, but I have seen animal life destroyed by strychnine fre<lb/>quently—I can scarcely charge my memory as to what is the smallest quan<lb/>tity which I have administered to an animal to take away life, because in those cases you generally give a largish dose so as to shorten life and bring on the symptoms as quickly as possible; half a grain, perhaps—I should not like to give a quarter of a grain in a human subject—I think it likely in some subjects that half a grain would destroy life—I think a grain would—I have seen it tried on cats, dogs, and frogs—I should think half a grain would destroy a cat—the symptoms which show themselves in an animal after strychnine has been administered to it, consist of strong tetanic convul<lb/>sions—I have never given it in the form of a pill, I have generally given it in solution—I suppose it would act more speedily in solution—it's beginning to act depends very much upon the dose, a large dose would begin in ten minutes, a small one in half an hour to an hour—when it begins to show it's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140089"/>
               <p>effect, the symptoms are spasmodic action of the muscles, chiefly of the trunk and the spine—the spinal muscles produce a very marked opesthotonos, as it is called; the spine is drawn back, the head thrown back, and the trunk bowed in a very marked manner—the extremities are generally stiffened—there are violent jerks, and the muscles are all rendered stiff, and rigid, and hard from the spasm—that stifthess remains, once set in, it does not perfectly relax; fresh paroxysms come on, always accompanied by the peculiar curving back of the head and neck and spine—the movement of the muscles is a rigid jerk; I should call it a jerking motion—the legs and feet of the animal are forced out of their natural construction, decidedly—they are powerfully stiffened out, extended, and powerfully bent up, and jerked out again—the time it generally lasts before death puts an end to those struggles, would depend also on the intensity of the disease, but I should expect that death would be over very soon indeed, from a quarter of an hour to half an hour, unless it is a small dose, when the symptoms gradually subside; that is to say, if it is a dose not sufficient to destroy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there, in your opinion, a marked difference between such a case where death ensues after taking strychnia, and a case of tetanus such as you were describing just now from idiopathic or traumatic causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the distinction is very marked—the continuity of the symptoms in strychnine poisoning is very characteristic—as long as the poisonous influ<lb/>ence lasts the symptoms last, but the poisonous influence will subside after a time, I mean, if it is not strong enough to cause death; and then the spasms do not return—in tetanus, the symptoms from the commencement are continuous; they go on as long as the patient's powers are capable of enduring—the shortness of the duration of the symptoms is decidedly in favour of strychnine poisoning—brucia is analogous to strychnine in its effects, but it is weaker—I do not know that it is one<lb/>sixth the strength of strychnia—there are no other poisons that produce convulsions of a tetanic character that I know of—having heard the symptoms described which attended this gentleman's death, in my opinion they are not referable to idiopathic or traumatic tetanus—I never saw a person die from the admini<lb/>stration of strychnia—I have seen a person suffer from the administration of an over-dose—one instance I perfectly recollect, and I may have seen another—the patient there had taken too much—it was given medicinally—there was the oposthotonos, such as I have described in the case of animals, and there was consciousness perfectly retained—in that particular case there was also dilatation of the pupils—there was a peculiar convulsion of the muscles of the trunk, causing oposthotonos, and the limbs were stif<lb/>fened out, and there was an oppression of the breathing—the difficulty of breathing is common to both tetanus, properly so called, and to tetanic con<lb/>vulsions from strychnia, from the effect produced en the respiratory muscles—in the case I am speaking of, where the patient took too ranch, my impression is, if there was any action in the jaw. it was very slight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it occur to you, as distinct from cases of real tetanus, that in the case of Mr. Cook he was able to swallow a liquid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is an important distinction, not so much that he was able to swallow, as that he seems to have been able to swallow sufficiently easily, and that there was no rigidity of the muscles of the jaw, and none of that peculiar description of countenance which Dr. Curling described in cases of tetanus from disease or from wounds—the patient was affected who took the over<lb/>dose of strychnia, not more than an hour, or a couple of hours, and then it went off—judging from the cases I have seen of animal life destroyed by strvchnia, and the</p>

               <p>case of my patient who took too much of it, on the one hand, and the cases of idiopathic and traumatic tetanus on the other, and having heard the symptoms described which attended Mr. Cook's attack and death, I think the symptoms were those of tetanus from strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe the effect in tetanus, whether idiopathic or traumatic, is the same on the nerves of the spine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not unlikely that it is so—the particular effect on the nerves is unknown—in the disorder of convulsions, there are cases sloping into each other by imperceptible grades, from mild convulsions to rigid tetanus—chronic convulsions may be severe as well as mild—chronic and tonic convulsions are essentially different—you may have a chronic and a tonic convulsion, but not in the same muscle—chronic is more the irregular action of the muscles, irregular action stimulating somewhat more the volun<lb/>tary action, of a more violent kind—tonic is a more or less persistent con<lb/>traction—I have published some lectures on "Diseases of the Brain and Nervous System."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I find in that you say, "That tetanus may be produced through the blood, is shown by the results of the administration of strychnia, which exactly imitate the tetanic symptoms in every respect; so that you may at will develop the phenomena of tetanus in an animal by giving him strych<lb/>nine, or injecting it into his blood, but you cannot cause it by external injuries;" there you say it imitates the tetanic symptoms in every respect; do you adhere to that opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I adhere to the opinion that it exactly resembles the convulsions of tetanus—the statement is incorrect if it be interpreted to mean that it produces the exact phenomena of the disease in a clinical sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been describing a case of traumatic tetanus in this book, and then you say, "That tetanus may be produced through the blood, is shown by the results of the administration of strychnia, which exactly imitate the tetanic symptoms in every respect;" that is the symptom I presume you have been describing; you say also, in the same part of your work, "We may ask, what is the nature of the morbid process set up in these centres? Te that it may be confidently replied, as the result of repeated examinations, that it is not inflammation, nor anything allied thereto; and it may with quite as much certainty be affirmed that it is a state identical with that which strychnine is capable of producing"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt the pecu<lb/>liar irritation of the nerves in tetanus is identical with the peculiar irrita<lb/>tion of the nerves in strychnine poisoning, but I should not say that trau<lb/>matic tetanus admits of a great variety of symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But sometimes one set of muscles are affected, and sometimes ano<lb/>ther? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that there is such a marked difference as that—there are cases with which I am familiar where the limbs are affected, but the limbs become affected late; after the jaw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know any instance of the limbs being affected before the jaw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you speaking from what you have seen, or what you have read? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect any instance where the limbs were affected before the jaw—I am sorry to say that I am not familiar with Dr. Curling's book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the case I have just read, you state, "It fortunately happened that we were to have a post mortem examination under very favourable circumstances; it was made only four hours after death, when, if there had been any morbid appearances, they would have been free from the fallacy of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140091"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> change;" now is not the examination shortly after death, of the spinal cord, important? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a pathological point of view it is—there is, to a certain extent, a fallacy; there are morbid appearances produced by changes after death which sometimes simulate diseased conditions before death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If there had been diseased appearances when examined some time after death, would there have been diseased appearances if the exami<lb/>nation had been prior to it? <hi rend="italic">A. I.</hi> think if certain diseased appearances had existed before death, they would have been recognisable as long as the spinal cord could be recognised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Decomposition would alter the structure of the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The signs of decomposition are sufficiently evident, they could be distinguished by any careful anatomist—supposing the spine to be affected by decomposition, you would not be able to speak with certainty as to simple softening, if the examination had been long after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, you say in your book, "There was however," in the case which you have spoken of, "as I had anticipated, no morbid appearances which seemed to offer any explanation of the disease; the nervous centres, both brain and spinal cord, were perfectly healthy; perhaps the brain contained a little more blood than usual: a fact not to be wondered at when we con<lb/>sider the violence of the paroxysms; the grey matter of the brain was perfectly natural, and its demarcation peculiarly distinct: indeed, this remarkable distinctness may have been morbid, and may have indicated an undue functional activity of these parts;" and you say, "This case illus<lb/>trates the little hope we have of obtaining by <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination any other than negative information as regards the particular state of the nerv<lb/>ous system;" is it not the fact that the indications of tetanic disorder are slight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not during life; but after death there is nothing in the port <hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> examination on which any one could positively say that the patient died from the ordinary disease of tetanus—granules or small bodies dis<lb/>covered in the arachnoid of the spine, would not be considered as indicating tetanus; I think granules on the spinal cord, such as I have heard described, are not likely to cause tetanus—I am not aware that in several cases the deposition of small patches has been discovered on the arachnoid—I know no cases which have been attended by Mr. Travers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the animals which you saw, to whom strychnia was administered, did you observe, after the attack had come on, a remarkable intolerance of touch, that they could not bear to be touched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should scarcely call it an intolerance of touch, but by touching them the spasms were apt to be excited—I observed, in some of those cases, that they went off into a second spasm immediately they were touched—that is commonly observed in animals poisoned by strychnine—as long as the influence of the poison lasts, that tendency remains; I cannot specify time; as long as the influence of the poison acts; I cannot tell you approximately—I examined anatomi<lb/>cally several animals that were killed by strychnine—I observed the heart—I do not think the right ride of the heart was generally full—it was empty, I think, generally, and the heart contracted a good deal—in all the oases I think that I have seen, I have seen the heart contracted—I saw those cases at various times—I have not made any experiments lately—I dare say I did at the time take memorandums, but I cannot lay my hands on them—the last I saw were some years ago—I can undertake to speak distinctly from my recollection as to the state of the heart, that it was generally empty on both sides, not distended—in those cases where strychnine was admini<lb/>stered,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140092"/>
               <p>stored, I think the cause of death was partly due to the difficulty of action of the respiratory muscles, but chiefly to a general nervous exhaustion which the violence of the spasm produced—the difficulty of action of the respi<lb/>ratory muscles would not tend to leave the heart full—I do not think strychnine asphyxiates; there are differences of opinion on that subject—I think it is not generally laid down in the books that animals die with true asphyxia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After describing the symptoms, Dr. Taylor says, "The symptoms soon cease after a short interval; the chest is so fixed as to give it an appearance of suffocation; after several of such attacks, the patient dies asphyxiated;" do you agree with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not agree with that—I think if animals died asphyxiated, you would have invariably the right side of the heart frill of blood, which is not the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I find Dr. Christison, in his book, describing the paroxysm, says, "At length a fit takes place more violent than any before it, and the<lb/>animal perishes suffocated," which means pretty much the same thing as asphyxiated, does it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The expression is frequently used loosely—I think "suffo<lb/>cated" is used more loosely than "asphyxiated"—a person with spasm of the glottis, dies with spasm or asphyxia—if the animal dies asphyxiated, I think it is usual that the right side of the heart is filled with blood—patients sometimes have convulsions after taking morphia, but I think they are more of an epileptic character—I have never witnessed them—I know of such from my reading—morphia is a vegetable alkaloid, as strychnine is—the time in which, after morphia, the symptoms would come on, would, I should think, be very late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Later than in strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the dose entirely—I cannot answer the question, it is not a subject I have studied—in any case of strychnia that I have witnessed, I cannot say whether I have seen the paroxysms come on as late as an hour and a half after the administration of the poison—I should consider it quite possible—I cannot remember—I have not seen, in cases of animals, the jaw fixed (trisxnus) in oases of strychnia poisoning, in any marked way—I have no doubt the muscles of the jaw may be affected to a certain extent, but not in the marked way in which it is in tetanus—I cannot say whether trisxnus is a frequent effect of strychnia—I cannot charge my recollection on that point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At all events, if it is a symptom, though not in a marked way, at what period of the affection does it generally come on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should expect that trismus would come on soon, but it is not a marked symptom—in death from what I call tetanus, I should not expect to find anything particular about the heart—I have seen <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nations made where death has arisen from, trismus; in ordinary tetanus the heart is not filled; I have no doubt blood is sometimes contained in heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you find a distinction in that respect between cases of ordinary tetanus and cases of tetanic convulsions after strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing very marked—my impression is, the heart becomes strongly contracted after strychnia, more than after ordinary tetanus—the spasm, I think, extends to the heart—that would expel the blood from the heart, though, perhaps, not all—it would prevent sufficient dilatation of the heart to receive its full supply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend asked you whether there were any cases of convul<lb/>sions of the milder form going up to the extreme climax of tetanic rigidity; what are the distinctions? are they marked? would a medical</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140093"/>
               <p>practitioner have any difficulty in knowing a case of general convul<lb/>sions as distinguished from a case of tetanic convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not—I have said that it would be desirable, in a pathological point of view, to examine the spinal cord immediately after death, with a view to detect any abnormal condition of it—I heard the description given by the gentle<lb/>men who did examine it, and from their description it appeared to me that those parts were in such a condition that any bony deposit would have been discovered, certainly—there would be no difficulty in discovering them, none whatever—they do not undergo any decomposition after death, at least not for a considerable time—I heard it mentioned that the muscles were in the same rigid condition; that struck me as a very remarkable feature in the case—I cannot speak with absolute certainty, because it is a feature quite new to me; I have only beard one fact, since this trial began, which was a case in which a eat was poisoned by strychnine, and the muscles continued to be rigid six days after death—I have not heard it on oath during the trial—I did not see it myself—I cannot tell you whether in cases of ordinary tetanus that rigidity continues for so long a period—I have inquired into the point, and cannot tell you.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon at St. George's Hospital for many years—I have had considerable practice—in the course of that practice I have had tinder my superintendence a great many cases of death from teta<lb/>nus—death from idiopathic tetanus in this country, according to my expe<lb/>rience, is very rare; the ordinary death from tetanus is from traumatic tetanus—I have carefully attended during the trial to the description given of the symptoms on the Monday night and the Tuesday night, attending the death of Mr. Cook—in my opinion, as far as there was spasmodic contrac<lb/>tion of the muscles, the symptoms resembled those of traumatic tetanus, but as to the course which the symptoms took, that was entirely different—I attended to the detail of the narration of the attack on the Monday night, and its ceasing, and the patient being comparatively composed and comfortable during the Tuesday, and then to the attack again about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock on the Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain in what respect the symptoms are entirely dif<lb/>ferent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The symptoms of traumatic tetanus always begin, as far as I have seen, very gradually; the stiffness of the lower jaw being invariably the symptom first complained of; at least, so it has been, I believe, in my experience—the contraction of the muscles of the back is always a later symptom, generally much later—the muscles of the extremities are affected in a much less degree than those of the neck and trunk, except in some oases where the injury has been in a limb, and an early symptom has been spasmodic contraction of the muscles of that limb—I do not myself recollect a case of ordinary tetanus in which there was that contraction of the muscles of the hand which I understand was stated to have existed in this instance—then ordinary tetanus rarely runs its course in less than two or three days, and often is protracted to a much longer period—I know one ease only in which the disease was said to have terminated in as short a time as twelve hours, but probably in that case the early symptoms bad been overlooked—then I never knew these symptoms in ordinary tetanus to last for a few minutes, then subside, and then come on again after twenty-four hours—I think that those are the principal points of difference which I perceive between the symptoms of ordinary tetanus and those which I have heard described—I have not witnessed the tetanus or tetanic convulsions which are the result of strychnia—I have not witnessed them in the human form—I have not made any experiments myself—I do not believe that death here arose from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140094"/>
               <p>what we ordinarily call tetanus, either idiopathic or traumatic—I never knew death from tetuuus as the result of sore throat, or the result of a chancre, or any other form of syphilitic disease; I never heard of a case—in my judg<lb/>ment the symptoms of death, such as I have heard described, are not con<lb/>sistent with a fit of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Or epilepsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps I had better say at once that I never saw a case in which the symptoms that I heard described arose from any disease—when I ray that, of course I refer not to particular symptoms, but to the general course which the symptoms took.</p>

                  </hi>. I have now retired from the profession—for up<lb/>wards of twenty-eight years I was surgeon to the Bristol Hospital—I was in practice nearly thirty years, and I was a student some eight or nine years—in the course of my experience and practice I had occasion to see a considerable number of cases of tetanus—if I take it at a very small ratio of one a year, it would be nearly thirty—I must have seen, I should say, certainly that number—they were not all from wounds—there were two certainly of idiopathic tetanus—one of those cases terminated fatally—one did not—idiopathic tetanus is a thing of very rare occurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find in the cases of idiopathic tetanus that came under your observation any difference in the symptoms between them and traumatic tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared, in my judgment, simply a modified degree of the symptoms of ordinary traumatic tetanus, not so severe; arising from in<lb/>ternal causes rather than external violence—I was not able to trace those two cases of idiopathic tetanus to any particular cause—I have heard the other witnesses describe the course which the symptoms of ordinary tetanus run—I agree in that from my experience—I heard the description given of the symptoms which accompanied the attack of Mr. Cook before his death—it appears to me that the circumstances of his attack are distinguishable from those cases of tetanus which came under my experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you point out any instance in which you found a marked difference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should repeat very probably the words of Sir Benjamin Brodie—the tetanus, as far as my experience goes, invariably begins with uneasiness in the lower jaw, followed by spasms of the muscles of the trunk, and most frequently extending to the muscles of the limbs—the muscles of the limbs are affected generally towards the end—lock jaw is almost invariably a symptom in these cases of tetanus, traumatic in particular—the commencement of lock jaw is one of the earliest symptoms—I do not recollect that clenching of the hands is a frequent symptom—I think I have seen it, but I do not think a clenched hand is an ordinary symptom of common tetanus; nor twisting of the foot so as to turn it out from its proper position—I do not remember that as a symptom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of those twenty or thirty cases that have come under your personal experience, what has been the ordinary duration? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> have endeavoured, since the subject has been mooted, to recollect what was the shortest period, and I cannot recollect any case that took less than from thirty to forty hours—as surgeon to the Bristol Hospital, I have seen a good many cases of syphilitic disease—I never knew a syphilitic sore to produce tetanus—in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140095"/>
               <p>my opinion, the symptoms which I have heard described in Mr. Cook cannot be referable to apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would either the primary or the secondary symptoms of syphilis produce tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in my opinion—I never knew of such a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you think the symptoms cannot be referred to apoplexy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; or to epilepsy—both in the case of epilepsy and apoplexy there is a loss of consciousness—in all the cases of tetanus that have come under my observation consciousness has been retained throughout, the whole period of the attack—in the cases that have come under my experience, the symptoms have invariably been continuous, without any interruption—I never heard of a case of several hours intervening, when the patient was totally free from the disease—when the symptoms did set in, they generally commenced very mildly and gradually increased in intensity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bearing in mind all your past recollection and experience of the symptoms of tetanus in ordinary cases, in your judgment could the symptoms of Mr. Cook be referred either to idiopathic or traumatic teta<lb/>nus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my judgment they could not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know from your reading, that there are many cases of traumatic tetanus where there is a long interval between the symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw such a thing occur—I am not aware, from my reading, that there are numerous cases mentioned in which there was a long interval of some hours—I have not read Dr. Todd's book, or Dr. Curling's—you must recollect I have been oat of practice some seventeen or eighteen years—I have not read Dr. Copland on con<lb/>vulsions—I have not looked modi into the reported eases of tetanus of late, nor do I recollect my reading on the subject—I am not aware that excitement and irritation from vomiting are given at the cause of tetanic convulsions—the symptoms of tetanic convulsions vary—as far as my expe<lb/>rience goes, the leading symptoms always go almost in the same continuous route—I do not think that a pure and ordinary tetanus sometimes affects some muscles of the body and at other times others: I am speaking of the ordinary tetanus, traumatic—I do not think they do vary to any great extent—there may be an affection of a muscle in this man that there is not in the other, in a leg or an arm—I cannot take upon me to say whether it proceeds from the spine—the cause of death in tetanic affections arises from exhaustion not unfrequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not frequently arise from asphyxia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not like the term asphyxia—I will say suffocation, arising from the absence of ability to respire—I think that might be a cause, I am not positive upon it—I have seen <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations of persons who have died of tetanus—it is a great many years ago—I can recollect the general outlines—I do not think the heart is found full in tetanus; I cannot tell whether it is in death from suffocation—cases of tetanus proceeding from wounds, wounds would form a very small proportion of the cases that are followed by tetanic symptoms: infinitesimally small—I could not say whether that would be the same if syphilis were the cause—I really do not understand you—that would not be the same in another class of wounds, because it affects a different tissue—I recollect the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations of cases of tetanus sufficiently well to say that there was not any direct alteration of the normal condition of any part of the body that accounted for the tetanic attack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—I have been connected with St Thomas's Hospital as lecturer and surgeon twenty<lb/>eight years—during that time I have witnessed many cases of tetanus—I should find it difficult to state exactly how many; but I had six or seven under my own care, and I may have seen from ten to fifteen more, but I do not bear more than that in mind—there was one case in which I was doubtful whether it was traumatic or idiopathic; the wound was so slight and the symptoms so indistinct that it was questionable—the rest were decidedly traumatic—supposing that one to be a case of idiopathic tetanus, the symp<lb/>toms were slower in their progress, and generally rather milder than in the other cases—I can remember no case of tetanus that I have witnessed which occupied under thirty hours before the disease arrived at a final point—in those cases the symptoms were always progressive—I have heard the description given by the witnesses of Mr. Cook's attacks on the Monday and Tuesday—that account differs essentially from what took place in the cases of tetanus to which I have referred—in all the cases of tetanus that I have seen, there has been a marked expression of the countenance, that is the first symptom—it is a sort of grin—it is so peculiar, that having once seen it you can never mistake it—the cases also differ more particularly in this fact, that in the symptoms which I have heard detailed there were violent convulsions on the Monday night, I believe, and on the Tuesday the individual was entirely free from any discomfort about the face or jaw—in the cases that have come under my notice the symp<lb/>toms have always been continuous, and that expression of the counte<lb/>nance and the more or less fixedness of the jaw is the last symptom to disappear—in ordinary tetanus the muscles of the face are first affected, then the muscles of the jaw, then the trunk, and then the limbs—in my judgment, the symptoms described in Mr. Cook's case were not referable to apoplexy or epilepsy, nor to any disease that I have ever witnessed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that in all the cases that you have seen, there was a marked expression of the countenance, a sort of grin; is there a Latin term for that, which is known? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, <hi rend="italic">risus sardonicus</hi>—that is not common in all forms of violent convulsions—it frequently occurs in all violent convulsions which assume, without being tetanus, a tetanic form or appearance—they are not a numerous class—it is difficult to distinguish between them and idiopathic tetanus in the onset, but not in the progress—I have only seen one case of idiopathic tetanus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then when you answered that question of mine, you spoke from your reading, and not from your experience? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know your question applied to idiopathic tetanus alone—epilepsy itself is a disease of a convulsive character—I heard the account that was given by Mr. Jones of the few last minutes before Mr. Cook died; that he uttered a piercing shriek, fell back, and died—I heard the description of the shriek, with the convulsion; but it was the shriek that called the medical man into the room—in some respects that last shriek, and the paroxysm that occurred immediately afterwards, would bear a resemblance to epilepsy—all epileptic convulsions are not attended with an utter want of consciousness—death from tetanus, accompanied with convulsions, leaves seldom any trace behind; but death from epilepsy leaves a trace behind it generally; some slight effusion of blood on the brain, or congestion of the vessels—I am not aware that it frequently happens that convulsions that have not assumed the peculiar</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are they ever accompanied by that clenching of the hands that we have heard described, or the distortion of the feet and toes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The con<lb/>vulsions from epilepsy are accompanied with every contortion; not permanent—I say that in the case of Mr. Cook, he did not die from epilepsy, because there were none of the symptoms of epilepsy—when the patient dies with epilepsy he dies perfectly unconscious and comatose, his consciousness is en<lb/>tirely gone—I have never seen any case of convulsive disease at all like this—laceration of the brain from injury will produce convulsions which will termi<lb/>nate in death; a sudden injury to the spinal cord will produce convulsions which will terminate in death; irritation of the teeth in infants will produce convulsions—those convulsions are not in their onset similar to the convul<lb/>sions of tetanus, and there is no progressive movement—there is no appear<lb/>ance about the face or jaw which you have in tetanus; I have never missed that sign in tetanus.</p>

In September, 1845, I was in the Infirmary at Glasgow, as a patient—there was a paralytic patient in the same ward that I had to attend to—there was also a patient who went by the name of French, or Sennet, who died shortly after I was there—she was suffering from a sore head—in the course of the afternoon on which Sennet died, I was turning the wheel to the paralytic patient—it was to be applied to the skin for some purpose—while I was doing that, the girl who had the sore head came up and asked me what I was doing—there were some pills there, which the paralytic patient was to take, in a box—while the girl with the sore head was there, I saw the paralytic patient take one of those pills out of the box and swallow it—that was according to the order that had been given—she was to take one pill at a time—after she had done that she handed the box with the other pills in it to French—I saw her take two of those pills, she swallowed them—I only saw her take two—she then came and sat down by the ward fire—soon after that she was taken ill, I think in about three quarters of an hour—she fell back on the floor, and I went for a nurse—we then lifted her into bed, and the doctor was sent for—I noticed her after she was put upon the bed—I was in the next bed to her—I remained up some time after this—the nurse cut her clothes off; she never moved after she was put upon the bed; she was just like a poker—I did not notice her hands or her feet—I was just aside of her when she died, I was standing on the floor—she did not say anything—she never spoke after she fell.</p>

I was so in the year 1848—I attended Mrs. Serjeantson Smith—I remember being summoned to her house one morning, and on going there finding her dead—I got there between eight and nine o'clock—the body was lying on the floor between the bed and some piece of furniture, up in a corner somewhere—the state of the limbs was pointed out to me by Caroline Hickson—the hands were very much contracted, clenched, and the feet were con<lb/>tracted, turned inward—the soles of the feet were hollowed up, very hol<lb/>low—the toes were contracted and the sole hollowed up; unnaturally so, remarkably so—that appeared to have been from recent spasmodic action, I should suppose, and the inner edge of each foot was turned up; the foot was twisted—the limbs were remarkably stiff—the body was still warm—the eyelids were tightly adherent almost to the eyeballs—the druggist who made up the prescriptions for the family was a person of the name of Jones—I saw him shortly afterwards running up to the house in a state of great excitement—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination by order of the Coroner—I had not ordered any prescription for this lady on the day before, I had not seen her for some time—I think it was three days after death that I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—at that time the con<lb/>traction of the feet continued, but it had gone off somewhat from the rest of the body—this was somewhat the position of the hands three days after</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What result did you obtain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We observed in each of the animals more or less of the effects usually produced by the poison of strychnia, general uneasiness, difficult breathing, convulsions of the tetanic kind, muscular rigidity, arching backwards, especially of the head and neck, violent stretching out of the legs; death followed in four of the animals, in one in two minutes, that was a rabbit, in another in five minutes, and in the third in a little less than an hour, fifty-five minutes; that was a mouse; the guinea-pig suffered but slightly at first, and that animal having been left, was found dead the next day—the fifth animal, a rabbit, exhi<lb/>bited very strongly marked symptoms of strychnia poison; it lay apparently dead for a while, but it recovered entirely, and is still living—I did not observe that the muscular rigidity continued after death without any inter<lb/>mission, there was flaccidity immediately after death—the muscles relaxed, but soon became very rigid, I mean more so than was due to the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>—we afterwards made a similar series of experiments on similar animals with strychnia itself, pure strychnia, a great many, both fn a solid and in a liquid form—the symptoms and the results were exactly the same as those I have described in these animals.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you made your experiments in conjunction with Dr. Nunneley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—my opinion is, that in some of the expe<lb/>riments I made, the symptoms were as long as an hour in showing them-selves—I have not my notes with me, I speak generally, from my impres-sion—some animals lived several hours—I think in some animals the interval has been an hour, generally it is much earlier—all my experiments were not made in conjunction with Mr. Nunneley; some, especially on frogs, have been apart—frogs are slower in exhibiting the effects—they are cold blooded animals, and differ in certain respects from warm blooded animals, though in other respects the tetanic symptoms are the same—I discovered strychnia by all the tests that I applied, with more or less distinctness—I have in animals detected it where I have searched for it, where I have known it to have been administered—I speak doubtfully as to all cases—in one or two cases I should feel a doubt, but in almost all cases I have discovered it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In one, certainly; in that case we were sure that strychnia had been administered, our doubt was whether it had reached the stomach—in that case I may say there were appearances which a sanguine eye might say were those of strychnia; a more cautious one would doubt—I did not consider it quite certain in one case—I have detected strychnia in the stomach nearly two months after death, and after decomposition had proceeded to a considerable extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity have you given to the ani<lb/>mals which you have killed, and afterwards have analyzed the contents of the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quantities varying from under a grain to two or three grains—when I say under a grain, I mean between half a grain and a grain—from that to two grains, to cats, rabbits, dogs—the general dose to dogs is from a grain to two—that is quite sufficient to kill an animal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does the strychnia act? is it taken up by the absorbents and carried into the blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it acts on the nerves, but a part may be taken into the blood also and act through the blood—I think it acts upon the nerves immediately on it's introduction into the stomach, in part; it is absorbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what parts of these animals did you search to find the strychnia, or the presence of strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally in the stomach, in one case else<lb/>where, underneath the skin—in that case we had inoculated the animal—where it was administered internally there I searched the stomach—that which I found in the stomach would be that which was there in excess beyond that which had been absorbed into the system—that which is, absorbed into the system has the operation of poisoning, sufficiently to destroy life—I wish to say, that that is rather my opinion in theory than what I could prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the excess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That remains in the stomach, inactive after death, of course; to be found in the stomach after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would produce no operation, that which remains in the stomach in excess? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not sure that strychnia may not lie in the stomach, and act prejudicially, without being absorbed; I think it is an open question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the minimum quantity administered which, being absorbed into the system, would be capable of operating to the destruction of life; would you expect to find any in the stomach then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should expect sometimes to fail—I think, if death resulted from a series of minute doses of this poison, administered over a space of several days, the appearances would in some degree be likely to be different after death from what they would be supposing death was produced rapidly by one dose; but I should rather connect those appearances with the lengthened and protracted final struggle, I mean the struggle on the last day—I should certainly expect a different set of phenomena on a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination where the patient died after a brief struggle and where he died after a protracted one—in this case the blood was fluid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it your theory, that in the act of poisoning, the poison is absorbed, and ceases to exist as poison, as strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am inclined to think so—I have thought much upon that question, but have not decided in my mind—I incline to think it is so; I believe a part under<lb/>goes a chemical change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that strychnia, when absorbed into the system, under<lb/>goes a chemical change; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe part may be absorbed unchanged, a part may undergo a chemical change, and a part may remain in the stomach unaltered.</p>

               <p>opinion that strychnia, after having effected the operation of poisoning, ceases to be strychnia poison in the blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion rests on the general principle, the general fact, that in acting on living bodies organic bodies are generally changed; organic substances acting on the living bodies organic body, such as food or medicine, are frequently changed in composition—I do not know that strychnia, after effecting the operation of poisoning, has been discovered in the blood and liver still in the form of strychnia, but I believe it possible—the component parts of strychnia consist of four elements—I have no fact to show that it can be decomposed by any sort of putrefying or fermentative process, and I doubt if it would.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the College of Physicians, and lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital I am the I am the author of a well known treatise on Poisons and on Medical Jurispru-dence—among other poisons, I have made the poison called strychnia the subject of my attention—it is the produce of the nux vomica—there is also in the nux vomica a poison of an analogous nature, called brucia, which differs from it only in point of strength: there are some chemical differences—the whole quantity in nux vomica is considered not to exceed from half to one per cent, of the two alkaloids—in the seed, the strychnia predominates; in the bark, the brucia—the difference between the two poisons, in their relative strength of action on the body, is variously estimated at from one-sixth to one-twelfth; that is to say, brucia being from one<lb/>sixth to one-twelfth the strength of strychnia—most varieties of impure strychnia which are sold, contain more or less brucia—unless you are certain of the purity of the article, you may be misled as to the strength—I have tried a variety of experiments on animal life with strychnia—I have never wit<lb/>nessed an instance of it's action on the human subject—I have tried it's effects on animal life, I think, in about ten or twelve instances, always upon rabbits—the symptoms produced by the poison have on the whole been very uniform—I have given quantities varying from a half to two grains and three grains; not less than half a grain—I have found half a grain sufficient to destroy the life of a rabbit—I have given it in a solid state, and some in a liquid state—I have found there was a difference in the time required to show it's effects where I administered it in the liquid and where I adminis<lb/>tered it in the solid form—when given in a fluid state it has produced it's effects in a very few minutes, two or three minutes; and in the solid state, in the form of pill or bolus, from about six to eleven minutes, I think—I have found that the time was influenced by the strength of the dose—it is influenced by the strength of the dose, and also by the strength of the animal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way, in your opinion, does the poison operate to produce it's symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is first absorbed into the blood; it is then circulated through the body, and it especially acts on the spinal cord—that is the part of the body from which the nerves affecting the voluntary muscles proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose absorption of the poison into the blood to have taken place, what time would be required for the circulating process which would bring the matter taken up into contact with the nerves of the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The entire circulation through the whole system is considered to take place about once in four minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you speaking of the human subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the circulation in the rabbit is quicker.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is it as to the absorption? would that be quicker in a rabbit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it would, from the effects produced—that will also depend on the state of the stomach, as to whether there be much food in the stomach, and as to whether the poison comes in imme<lb/>diate contact with the inner surface of the stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your opinion, does the poison act immediately on the nervous system while in the stomach, or any portion of it, or must it first be absorbed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must first, I believe, be absorbed.</p>

               <p>tolerably uniform; will you describe the series of symptoms from the com<lb/>mencement to the close? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The animal for about five or six minutes does not appear to suffer; it moves about freely and actively; it then, when the poison begins to act, suddenly falls on it's side; there is a trembling of the whole muscles of the body; a sort of quivering motion, arising from the poison producing these violent and involuntary contractions; there is then a sudden paroxysm or fit; the fore legs are stretched out, and the hind legs are stretched out; the head is drawn back, and the tail, so as to give it the form of a bow; the jaws are spasmodically closed, and the eyes are pro<lb/>minent, protruding—after a short time there is a slight remission of the symptoms—the animal appears to lie quiet, but the slightest noise or touch produces another convulsive paroxysm—there is sometimes a scream, or sort of shriek, as if the animal suffered severe pain—the heart beats very violently during the fit, and after a succession of these fits, the animal dies quietly—I have observed immediately prior to death, that there is a remission of the paroxysm, not uniformly—I have only known it has died by having the hand over the heart, but it has been in a state of spasm at that time—in one or two cases the animal has died quietly, as if there was a remission—sometimes it dies apparently during the spasm itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What appearances have you observed after death, externally, which would be different from the ordinary appearances of a person who has died; are the muscles more than usually rigid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In some instances the animal has been rigid throughout, that is to say, it has died in a spasm, and the rigidity has continued; the muscles so strongly contracted, that for a week afterwards it was possible to hold the animal extended by the hind legs without the body falling—I took hold of it by it's hind legs, and the body kept straight out, horizontally—I have found that continue as long as a week—in an animal killed the other day the body was flexible at the time of death, but it became rigid in about five minutes after death—I have not seen it since—I have opened the bodies of animals that have been thus destroyed—I have not found any appearances in the stomach or intestines which would indicate any injury there—I have found in one or two cases congestion of the vessels of the membranes of the spinal cord, more than was due to the gravitation of the blood after death—in other cases I have not found any departure from the ordinary state, with respect to the spinal cord, and with respect to the brain; I may include both.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140109"/>
               <p>much experience in that—I have never Been it in animals—I saw one last Thursday week in the human subject—that was from an injury to the finger, in St. Thomas's Hospital—that did not end fatally, the person is recovering—I have heard the description given by Elizabeth Mills, and by Mr. Jones, of the symptoms which accompanied the attack of Mr. Cook—those symptoms, as described, appear to me similar to those I have seen in animals to which I have administered strychnia—the period it usually took in rabbits, from the first manifestation of the symptoms to death, was about ten minutes—it varied to ten minutes; ten minutes, I think, was the longest where the strychnia was given in a state of solid—I am speaking of the time from the administration of the strychnia to the commencement of the symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long does it take from the time the first symptoms manifest themselves to the time of the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They have died in various periods; one died in thirteen minutes, one in seventeen minutes; that I should mention would be the whole time—the symptoms appear more rapidly when the poison is given in a fluid state, and death has taken place in five or six minutes after—death takes place more rapidly when it is given in the fluid state—the poison operates more rapidly in it's commencement and in it's course when fluid—the experiments which I have particularly noticed and performed lately, and which I am about to detail, have been entirely in reference to solid strychnia—in the first the symptoms began in seven minutes, and the animal died in thirteen minutes, including those seven minutes from the time the poison was given; in the second, the symptoms, appeared in nine minutes, the animal died in seventeen; in the third, the symptoms appeared in ten minutes, the animal died in eighteen minutes; in the fourth, the symptoms appeared in nine minutes, and the death took place in twenty-two minutes; in the fifth, the symptoms appeared in twelve minutes, and the death took place in twenty-three minutes—supposing this poison to be administered to the human subject in the shape of pills, I should expect it would take a longer period before the poison began to act, because it requires that the pill structure should be broken up in order to bring the poison in contact with the mucous membrane of the stomach—in the case of the rabbits which I destroyed by the solid poison, I administered it in pills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What I am asking you is this: Given that the poison is administered in both cases to the rabbit and the human subject in the shape of pills; should you expect a longer period before it began to act in the human sub<lb/>ject than in the rabbit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think we can fairly draw any inference between the relative rapidity of death from strychnia in the rabbit and in the human subject, the circulation and absorption are very different—it is very probable that there would also be a difference between one human subject and another with reference to the power of the absorbents, to take a poison up with more or less rapidity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it depend on the difference of the substance of which the pills are composed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it's coming in contact with the stomach early or late.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the strength of the dose make any difference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would; that is to say, a large dose would produce a more rapid effect than a small dose—I have experimented upon the intestines of animals that I have thus killed, to reproduce the strychnia or to discover it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What, in your opinion, would be the correct chemical course to pursue, in order to reproduce the strychnia from the contents of the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140110"/>
               <p>The principle of extracting it consists in putting the stomach and it's con<lb/>tents in alcohol mixed with a small quantity of acid to dissolve the strychnia—supposing I took sulphuric acid, for instance, I should thus get sulphate of strychnia, if there should be any strychnia in the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If there be any discoverable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so—the use of the alcohol is to dissolve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having got the sulphate of strychnia, how would you next proceed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The liquid is filtered, gently evaporated, and an alkali added; you get rid of the alcohol in that way—carbonate of potash is the alkali some prefer, which I have used—that precipitates the strychnia—it combines with the sulphuric acid in the sulphate of strychnia, and so precipitates the strychnia, if present—besides this mode of getting at the strychnia itself, if there be strychnia present in the stomach, there are tests applied to the strychnia or supposed strychnia when extracted—strychnia has a peculiar taste, a strongly bitter taste—it is insoluble or nearly inso<lb/>luble in water—it is soluble in acids and in alcohol—it is precipitated by alkalies, when it has been dissolved in an acid—colour tests are applied to the dry residue, after evaporation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What substances are there which, when applied in this way, will pro<lb/>duce a change of colour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A mixture of strong sulphuric acid and bi-chromate of potash produces a blue colour, changing through a violet to a purple, and passing to a red tint—I think these colour tests are very falla<lb/>cious, with this exception, that when we have strychnia separated in a crys<lb/>talline state, when we have recognised the crystals by their form and their chemical properties, and, above all, where they produce, or the substance produces, tetanic symptoms and death, when introduced into a wound in the skin of an animal—you may introduce the poison into the system and produce all it's effects by introducing it through any puncture or wound in the skin as well as by introducing it into the stomach, and it operates more quickly in that case—absorption takes place—it is carried at once into the circulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there, in your opinion, other vegetable matters to which, if these colouring tests were applied, similar results as to colour might be obtained? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are a variety of substances—a mixture of sugar and bile will pro<lb/>duce the purple and red tint, and a substance called pyroxanthine—that sub<lb/>stance is a product of the distillation of wood—it produces precisely similar colours to those caused by strychnia, so that I have known persons deceived—in my laboratory, in performing the experiments, they have said, "You have got strychnia there," when it has been a mixture of pyroxanthine with a small quantity of salicine added to it; that is, the principle of the willow bark—allow me to state, in addition, that the mixture which I have just mentioned contains no strychnia, and has a bitter taste, so that it might be mistaken for strychnia by taste as well as by colour—vegetable poisons are more difficult of detection by chemical processes than mineral ones, and the tests are more fallacious—I have, in the case of animals that I have destroyed by strychnia, endeavoured afterwards to discover it's presence—I have tried to do so in four distinct cases—I was assisted by Dr. Rees, he was in conjunction with me—that was at Guy's Hospital—we applied the process that I have first described; that is, we endeavoured to reproduce the strychnia, if present, and then applied to it those colouring tests which I have mentioned just now—that is the course we pursued, and also by the effects of taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you able in those instances to satisfy yourself of the presence of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140111"/>
               <p>strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In one case by the colour tests; in another case there was a bitter taste in the liquid, but no indication of strychnia by the colour tests—in the other two cases there was no indication whatever of the presence of strychnia—the dose given, in the case in which we discovered by the taste and by the colour that there was strychnia, was two grains at intervals—that is in the first case I mentioned, where it was discovered by the colour tests—in the case where we had a bitter taste, but no indication by the colour tests, we gave one grain of strychnia—in the two instances in which we failed to indicate any presence of strychnia, one grain in one case, and half a grain in the remaining one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you account physiologically for the absence of any indication of strychnia where you know strychnia to have been given, and to have caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By its absorption into the blood, so that it is no longer present in the stomach—it is in a great part, too, changed in the blood; it undergoes a chemical change—I account in the case of the larger dose for the presence of strychnia, because there would be a retention of some not absorbed—that would be in excess beyond what was required for the destruction of life—supposing the minimum of the dose required to destroy life to be given, I do not think I should find any; it would be removed by absorption, and no longer discoverable in the stomach—the smallest quantity I have ever tried on a rabbit has been half a grain—there are no chemical means that I am acquainted with whereby the presence of this poison can be detected in the tissues—there is no process that I am acquainted with; when it is in the small quantity in which it exists there, so far as I know, it cannot—half a grain has destroyed life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose the half grain to be absorbed entirely into the blood, what proportion does that bear to the total quantity of the blood circulating in the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Assuming the quantity of blood to be at the lowest 25lbs. (I am speaking now of the human subject), that would be one fiftieth part; that is to say, one fiftieth of a grain in a pound—a physician in Canada died from that dose in twenty minutes; from half a grain—in addition, to this distribution of the half grain over the whole system, I believe it partially undergoes some change in the blood—that would increase the difficulty of detecting it in the tissues—I have never heard of it's being separated in a crystallized state from the tissues—the crystals are peculiar in form—they present themselves under the form of octohedral and quadrilateral prisms terminated by four-sided pyramids—sometimes the prism is wanting, and then the two are close together, to form the octohedron—there are other organic substances which crystallise something like them, so that a chemist would not rely on the crystallised form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe that after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination had been held on the body of the deceased Mr. Cook, some portion was sent up to you. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—it was delivered to me by Mr. Boycott, in a brown stone jar—the jar was fastened down, covered with bladder, tied, and sealed—it contained the stomach and the intestines of John Parsons Cook—I experimented upon that with a view to ascertain if there were any poison present—we sought for various poisons: prussic acid, oxalic acid, morphia, strychnia, veratria (the poison of white hellebore), the poisons of tobacco, hemlock, arsenic, mercury, antimony, and other mineral poisons generally—we only found small traces of antimony—with reference to the search for strychnia, the part which I had to operate upon was in the most unfavourable condition that could possibly be for finding that poison, if it had been there—the stomach had been completely cut from end to end—all the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140112"/>
               <p>contents were gone, and the fine mucous surface, on which any poison, if present, would be found, was lying in contact with the outside of the intestines, all thrown together—there was some feculent matter present also, on the surface of the mucous membrane, derived from the intestines, the contents of which had partly escaped—the inside of the stomach had been turned into this mass of intestine and feculent matter; at any rate, it was lying so—I presume that was the fault, or misfortune, of the person who had dissected it, but in journeying up to London it must have been shaken about in every possible way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And though there were the contents of the intestines, the contents of the stomach were not there; they were gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were gone—if there had been any of this poison present, I should have expected to have found it in the contents of the stomach and on the mucous membrane—at my request, other portions of the body were afterwards sent up to me to be experimented upon, the liver, the spleen, and the two kidneys—in addition to that, a small bottle of blood, unlabelled; that is to say, giving us no idea whence it was taken—that was delivered to me by Mr. Boycott—we analysed all those portions—in the liver and kidneys we searched for mineral poison—we discovered antimony in an eighth part of the liver—we analysed only the left kidney, and the spleen, and they all yielded antimony—there were traces of antimony in each—the quantity was less in proportion in the spleen than in the other parts—the blood contained antimony—the antimony was reproduced, or brought out, by boiling the animal substance in a mixture of hydrochloric acid and water, copper in the state of foil and gauze, a sort of web of fine woven copper was intro<lb/>duced while boiling, and the antimony was deposited on the copper—having got it on the copper we applied various tests to it, the known and established tests for that purpose—the experiments have been performed lately in the presence of Professor Brande—the copper acquired a violet tint, a deposit which is one characteristic of antimony—we applied the well known chemical tests for the detection of antimony, so that I had no doubt of its presence—Dr. Rees assisted me in the analysis—Professor Brande has seen it subsequently—there is a small quantity of antimony still remaining on the copper (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I detected some of it in the blood, in the small bottle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the fact of it's being found in the blood enable you to form any opinion as to how shortly before death the antimony had been given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible to say with any precision, but I should think shortly before death; that is to say, within some days—the longest period known at which antimony has been found in the blood, after a person has ceased to take it, was eight days—within my own knowledge, the earliest period at which antimony, taken into the stomach, would get into the blood, has been eighteen hours; the analysis was made of the liver in that case: the boy died eighteen hours after taking a dose of antimony, and then I found it in the liver—it was not a very large dose; that was not the cause of death—it was a medicinal dose prescribed for him; about six grains of antimonial powder—antimony is usually given in the form of tartar emetic, and acts as an irritant, to produce, and produces vomiting—if it be given in repeated doses, a portion of it, beyond what is ejected by the stomach, will find it's way into the blood, and into the system—if given in con<lb/>tinued doses of that description, it would destroy life, if it produced certain symptoms—it may be given in frequent doses with impunity, and it may be given so as to produce symptoms which will infallibly destroy life, if continued—I heard the account given by the female servant, Mills, of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140113"/>
               <p>the frequent vomiting of Mr. Cook—I also heard the account given of his vomiting at Shrewsbury—I also heard the account given by the medical men, Mr. Gibson and Mr. Jones, and Mr. Bamford's deposition as to the concomitant symptoms—in my opinion, the vomiting I heard described would be such as might be produced by antimony—tartar emetic is soluble in water; it does not affect the colour of any fluid in which it is mixed in small quantities—I do not think that such a quantity as would suffice to produce vomiting would affect the colour of the fluid with which it was mixed—it would not affect the colour of broth, brandy and water, wine, or toast and water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From these traces of the antimony in those parts of the body to which you have referred, could you form any judgment as to the time when the antimony was taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is impossible to say with any precision, but I should say within two or three weeks at the outside; within three weeks I should think—I mean before death, I think so—we did not find any perceptible quantity dissolved in the fluids of the bowels and the washings of the stomach, therefore I should infer there was no evidence of any given within some hours of death—I know by experiment it takes a shorter time to get to the liver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might that which you found in the liver, kidneys, and spleen have been administered within a few days before death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think that which I found in the liver might have been administered within eighteen hours of death, or within a few days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I asked you about the colour, but I omitted to ask you about the taste; does antimony affect the taste of any fluid in which it is given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not in quantities in which it would cause vomiting—if a person tossed off A quantity of fluid with which there was this substance mixed, it might, according to the quantity present, leave a sensation in the throat—a large quantity taken at once, might leave a choking or constricting sensation, as if the throat were contracted—in the various analyses that I made, I found no trace of mercury—if mercury had been recently taken, I should have found it, according to the quantity taken—if a few grains had been taken recently before death, I should have expected to find some trace in the liver—if a man had been taking mercury for any syphilitic affection within anything like a recent period before death, I should have expected to have found it traceable—it is very slow in passing out of the body, so that if given within two or three weeks from death there would be some traces in the liver, or if given within a few hours from death, there might be some in the liver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity given shortly before death would you expect to find appreciably, in the liver from <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think an amount of three grains, three or four grains might thus leave some trace; but it is impossible to give any precise answer to that—I have a recollection of a case of three grains of calomel having been given twenty-four hours before death, and I found mercury in the liver—that is the only fact I can give an opinion upon—supposing half a grain given each day for four days before death, and to be given favourably, not thrown off the stomach by vomiting, I should expect to find some trace of it; if one grain each day for four days, I certainly should expect to find some traces in the liver, or four grains taken in the period of four days, and in divided doses more favourable for absorption—I attended to the evidence which was given as to the deaths of Mrs. Smith and of Agnes French, and of the lady referred to at Leeds, and the case of the gentleman of whom Mr. Moore spoke—judging by the results of my own studies and experiments with reference to death by</p>

               <p>strychnia, I coincide in opinion that those deaths were occasioned by strychnia—the symptoms of Mr. Cook's case appear to me to be of a similar character with those of the cases that I have been just referring to—I know of no other cause in the nature of human diseases to which the symptoms of Mr. Cook's death can be referred, except to strychnia.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of your examination, while speaking of antimony, you have frequently used the word "trace" of antimony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Traces—a very small quantity which one can hardly estimate by weighing, we call a trace—"trace" in ordinary par<lb/>lance means a small quantity—I do not imply it to mean an imponderable quantity—it is frequently so used in chemical language—some chemists mean that by it—centesimal, millesimal, infinitesimal quantity would be called a trace—I have heard an imperceptible quantity called a trace—I do not use it in my examination in that sense—I mean we obtained antimony in small quantities from many parts, but that the antimony so collected would make up a ponderable quantity in the whole—this is a very small residue of what we obtained—what we discovered altogether in all the parts of the body we examined would make up about half a grain, as we thought—we did not actually ascertain it to amount to half a grain—I do not think a quarter of a grain would explain the quantity we obtained—I will undertake to say there was half a grain, to the best of my judgment—there was more in the parts of the body examined, but we extracted that quantity—it was antimony—that would not be sufficient to cause death—one of the animal substances in which the antimony was found was blood—I have described the tests used—I said we applied the usual tests.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you what those tests were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under the circumstances, only arsenic or antimony could be deposited on the copper, then we applied heat to the deposit on the copper, no sublimate of arsenic was obtained—we cut up some of the gauze containing the deposit—we heated it with nitrate of soda in a platina crucible—that converted the antimony to antimoniate of soda—that was dissolved, or rather diffused, in water containing a little hydro-chloric acid, precipitated by sulphureted hydrogen, and a precipitate after twenty-four hours was deposited—it had a reddish-brown colour, like sulphuret of antimony, and like it was soluble in strong hydrochloric acid—then there were, in addition, two other processes; one part of the acid solu<lb/>tion of Mr. Cook's stomach was placed in a glass, and a piece of metallic tin immersed in the acid solution—there was a black deposit on that tin indicative of antimony—some of the same acid solution was placed in contact with pure zinc—there was also a black deposit on the zinc, and when the whole was dissolved in nitro-hydrochloric acid, the black precipitate was converted into antimonic acid, peroxide of antimony—I have no doubt whatever, from thirteen years' practice on these tests and processes, that it was antimony—the failure or inaccuracy of one step in that long process, or the badness of the quality of one of the materials used, might affect the result, but I used pure materials—such an accident could not take place without my having intimation of it in the course of the process—in my opinion, the antimony that I discovered must have been taken within three weeks—it may have been taken within that period—that opinion is formed on the observation of the rapidity with which antimony gets out of the body, not so much in animals as in men—I have not tried these experiments on animals—I should think it would probably get out more quickly in animals than in men—I am acquainted with the works of Orfila—he was in the highest rank of analytical chemists—he is dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not say that they were, but I find it in his book; I read this to you out of his book: "A dog was killed three and a half months after all antimonial administration to him had ceased; he had taken three grammes" (which is forty-five grains) "of emetic in ten days." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where was the antimony found?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is what I meant: "Antimony was found condensed principally <hi rend="italic">dans le gras</hi>"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the fat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So I thought—"It was found condensed in the fat; the liver con-tained some of it, also the bones and the other tissues; but fifty grammes of it furnished as much as 500 grammes of the rest of the other tissues put together." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That shows, after antimony has been four months in the body, it goes out of the liver, kidneys, and splaen, and gets into the bones and fat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not see how it shows that it gets out of the liver, because he writes, "The liver contained some of it as well as the bones." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Let us have it quite fairly; if you read the last part about the proportion contained in all the tissues, compared with what was contained in the fat, you will see what an enormous difference it makes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see that; but still, it does not affect what I called your attention top that after three and a half months the liver contained some of it. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some of it, and allow me to tell you this, that forty-five grains given to a human being over ten days in food, is not a case which I am at all supposed to give an opinion upon—I have never heard of such a case—in the instance read first, it was after four months—the last one, "The metal had accumulated in the bones; the liver also contained a great deal, the other tissues very little," I think proves clearly this: if any person was to take forty-five grains of antimony over a period of eight or ten days, possibly some might be found in the liver after four months—everything must depend on the dose and the mode of giving it—it does not require such a pretty good dose to poison people as you think—it depends on the mode of giving it more than the dose—a dog has been poisoned by sue grains given in a certain way, but you have not mentioned that two of the dogs died in that case from the effects of the antimony—there are two cases of dogs that died from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is one just above; a dog fed ten days with aliments mixed with emetic, three grammes, that is, forty-five grains in the whole, died six days</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140116"/>
               <p>after they had ceased to give him that aliment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when antimony has been given in that way to animals for some time, it generally affects the liver—the gentlemen whose experiments you are quoting have found that the liver became fatty and brittle—Cook's liver presented nothing of the sort, therefore I should infer, from the absence of any change in the liver, the diffusion of antimony through the kidneys, the spleen, liver, stomach, and intestines (there is nothing mentioned about any being found in the stomach and the dog, in the case you mentioned of a long duration), I should infer that the antimony in Mr. Cook's body had been much more recent than those experiments would show, but I cannot decide positively when anti<lb/>mony gets out of the body; no doubt it differs in different persons—the best opinion I can give is, that this was within two or three weeks of his death—I had to analyze the body of a man who had taken twenty-three grains twenty-four hours before death, and it had all passed out of him—in four months it gets into the fat and bones, but you do not find it in the stomach and bowels—I do not form my opinion from one fact, but from all—I was first applied to to investigate this case on Tuesday, 27th Nov., by Mr. Stevens, introduced by Mr. Warrington, Professor of Chemistry at Apothecaries' Hall—he did not put me in communication with any solicitor on that occasion, I do not think he mentioned it—I am not sure whether it was on that day, or subsequently, that he mentioned Mr. Gardner's name—I had not known Mr. Gardner before—I had not been at all concerned in any recent cases at Eugeley before that—afterwards, Mr. Stevens came with the jar—Mr. Boycott and he came together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You wrote a letter on the subject; and is this a passage from it, "We do not find strychnia"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Head it all, if you pleaae. (<hi rend="smallCaps">LORD CAMPBELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the whole letter should be read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. I will read it all to you then. It is in reply to a letter received from Mr. Gardner.—"Dr. Rees and I have completed the analysis to-day. We have sketched a report, which will be ready to<lb/>morrow or next day. As I am going to Durham assizes on the part of the Crown, in the case of Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Wooler, the report will be in the hands of Dr. Bees, No. 26, Albemarle-street. It will be most desirable that Mr. Stevens should call on Dr. Bees, read the report with him, and put such questions as may occur. In reply to your letter received here this morning, I beg to say that we wish a statement of all the medicines prescribed for deceased (until his death) to be drawn up and sent to Dr. Bees. We do not find strychnia, prussic acid, or any trace of opium. From the contents having been drained away, it is now impossible to say whether any strychnia had or had not been given just before death, but it is quite possible for tartar emetic to destroy life if given in repeated doses; and, so far as we can at present form an opinion, in the absence of any natural cause of death, the deceased may have died from the effects of antimony in this or some other form"—was that your opinion at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—that was all we could infer from the chemical analysis—I have told you to<lb/>day that the quantity of antimony that we found in Cook's body was not sufficient to account for death, but what was found in Cook's body was not all that he took: I wish to add to my testimony, because I see it is only a little misunderstanding; if a man takes antimony it produces this effect; first, he vomits, by which some passes out of the body; some may escape by the bowels; there is a great deal that passes at once into the blood by absorption, and is carried out with the urine: I find by Orfila, whom we are all inclined to rely upon, that, in from four to seventeen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140117"/>
               <p>hours, antimony is found chiefly in the urine—I mean to say, perfectly and distinctly, from such traces as I found in Cook's body of antimony, I was justified in stating my opinion that his death may have been caused by antimony—the amount found in a dead body is not the slightest criterion of what has been swallowed—I have sometimes found less arsenic in a body than would account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if the amount found is not the slightest criterion of what may have been administered, how does that justify you, as an analytical chemist, in stating your opinion that so small a quantify may have caused death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not said what quantity would cause death—I have said a certain quantity was found in the body, which may have been the residue of what had caused death—I will explain it to you, I see the point you are working at; we found antimony in this body, and we could not account for it's being there; I wrote to know whether antimony had been given as a medicine, and I considered that at people had died from antimony, it was necessary to have information of the symptoms connected with this man's death, which I knew nothing about at the time; finding antimony there, and no explanation, I put it as possible and the only hypothesis to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you wrote this, that in your opinion the man had died from the effects of antimony, had you any reason to think any undue quantity had been administered to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not speculate on that from the quantity there, for I did not know at all what quantity he had taken, or whether it had been prescribed medicinally—the opinion was based upon this, that antimony was the cause of death, many people will die from small and some from larger quantities—the quantity found in the body is no criterion of what is taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May not the injudicious use of quack medicines containing antimony, such as James's powders or other medicines, have accounted for as much antimony as you found in the body of Mr. Cook? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Any antimonial preparation would account for it—an injudicious use of James's powder, or even the judicious use, might do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And do you mean to say, with that knowledge, consulted by a gentleman who appeared to entertain suspicions, that you felt yourself authorised in giving an opinion that this man died from the poison of antimony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You are perverting my meaning entirely, I must really say; what I said in my conclusion was this, that antimony under the form of tartar emetic may occasion nausea, vomiting and other symptoms of irri-tation, and that in large doses it has caused death, preceded by convul<lb/>sions: then, that antimony and tartar emetic may be given as a safe and innocent medicine, which answers your question about it's being used as a poison; this is my report—I do not see you are justified in making use of a private letter to a solicitor—I sent in a report, if you will read it to me again, I will give you any explanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I have misunderstood the last passage of the letter, I will read it again: "We do not find strychnia, prussic acid, or any trace of opium; from the contents having been drained away, it is impossible to say whether any strychnia had or had not been given just before death; but it is quite possible for tartar emetic to destroy life, if given in repeated doses; so far as we can at present form an opinion, in the absence of any natural cause of death, the deceased may hare died from the effects of antimony in this or some other form." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Stevens had told us he was in very good health about seven or eight days before his death—there was a letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140118"/>
               <p>previous to this, to which that was an answer—Mr. Stevens told us his step son was in very good health at Shrewsbury races, that he was taken very sick there, that he was ill for six or eight days, and died suddenly in convulsions, without any further particulars: we were led to suppose he had not died a natural death—there was no natural cause to account for death, and, finding that antimony existed throughout the body, we drew the conclusion that that was a possible cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, when you are consulted as an analytical chemist, do you enlighten your judgment by all the hearsay statements that the person consulting you chooses to make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not enlighten my judgment by it—I endeavour to procure the information necessary for an analysis—the analysis cannot be made quite as effectually without any information at all—the chances are that poison would be often lost; there are a hundred poisons that may destroy people—I do not think it neces<lb/>sary, before I make an analysis, to have a long statement of the symptoms before death—a short statement will do—I rely upon no statement at all, I just check the result by the statement and the statement by the result—I do not allow my judgment to be influenced by the statement of a person who knows nothing of his own knowledge, not in the least degree—I do not allow my judgment to be influenced in any way on such a matter—what Mr. Stevens told me assisted me in arriving at the conclusion which I stated in writing to Mr. Gardner as a possible case, not as a certain case—I say, "As far as we can at present form an opinion in the absence of any cause of death, the deceased may have died from the effects of antimony in this or some other form," that is correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, is this correct, at page 491 of the first edition of your book on "Poison:" "Medical jurists must remember that the discovery of tartar emetic in the contents of a stomach is by no means a proof of it's having been taken or administered as a poison, since it is frequently prescribed as a medicine, and often taken as such by persons of their own accord; we can only infer it existed as a poison or caused death when the quantity present was very large, and there were corresponding appearances of irritation in the alimentary canal; still less would the discovery of it in a mixture, unless in a very large proportion, be evidence of an intent to poison"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That means, if we had found a very large quantity in the stomach or bowels, we should have come to the conclusion that the man had died from it; but finding only a small quantity throughout the body, we say, <hi rend="italic">he may</hi> have died from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at your first page; is this right? after the definition of a poison, you say, "It would, if admitted, exclude a very large class of substances, the poisonous properties of which cannot be disputed; as, for example, salts of lead, copper, tin, zinc, and antimony, which are only poisonous when administered in very large doses"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in the ordinary way; but if you spread that large dose over a long period, you will equally kill the person—in the case of those dogs which you read to me, they took forty-five grains over ten days, and they were killed by the doses—they took only four and a half grains a day—I attended at the coroner's inquest on the body of Mr. Cook—I think I was first there on the 14th of December, as nearly as I can remember—some of the evidence was read over to me—Dr. Harland was the first witness examined when I was there, I think, but I am not quite sure—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was gone into first—I heard Mr. Bamford examined—I think I heard Lavinia Barnes and Elizabeth Mills—I am not quite sure about Newton—I heard Jones.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140119"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell me, before you went to that inquest, how many of those ten rabbits that you spoke of you had experimented upon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had experi<lb/>mented some years ago upon five, and experimented on those connected with the analysis with the poison given in a solid state since the inquest—the first five was when I first began to lecture on medical jurisprudence, that is twenty-three years ago—that was the only knowledge of the effects of strychnia poison on animal life which I had when I wrote that book—I have a great objection to destroying life except from absolute necessity—it may be that that great necessity arises when it is for the purpose of saving human life and detecting crime, but every toxicologist cannot sacrifice one hundred rabbits when the facts are well ascertained from other sources; I did not feel myself justified in going on on points which I knew were well established in the profession—I experimented on the last rabbits since the inquest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think it is rather rash to judge of the effects of strychnia poison on man, by so small an experience as that of ten animals of a parti<lb/>cular species? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think you must add to experimental experience some<lb/>thing like a study of poisons for twenty-five years; that is, study on the relations of others, and the collection of cases—I do not think a rabbit is a very unfair animal to select.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not a dog be much better? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Dogs are very dangerous to handle, I have a very great disinclination to meddle with them—I know that dogs and cats are considered to bear a greater analogy to the human being for this reason, that they readily vomit, while rabbits do not vomit; now a rabbit is a much more manageable animal, and I have not pretended to settle either the time of death or the quantity that will destroy life in a rabbit, I merely pretend to determine the physiological effects—from the experiments I have tried on dogs and cats, I have had no inclination to go further—I do not admit that they would be better to experiment upon, parti<lb/>cularly as to the action of the respiratory functions, than a rabbit, nor as to the effects of poisoning—I think the rabbit is quite as good as any animal that can be selected, the poison is retained and shows it's operation—Mr. Gard<lb/>ner was at the inquest—the first time I saw him was in the inquest room—I suggested questions to the Coroner, personally addressing him—he put them, or they were answered by the witnesses on my merely addressing him—I do not remember whether Mr. Jones and Mills were examined, before Ro<lb/>berts—I think Roberts was examined afterwards—I really cannot tell the order in which the witnesses were examined, the only evidence I particularly attended to was the medical evidence, and the statements of Mills and Barnes—I do not think I heard Roberts say, before I gave my opinion, that the prisoner had bought strychnia in his shop on the Tuesday—Roberts was examined after me, but I knew strychnia was bought before we sent in our report—it was in Mr. Gardner's letter, to which that was a reply which you read—Mr. Gardner gave the information in that letter, I do not know whether it has been produced, that strychnia, prussic acid, and Battley's sedative of opium, had been bought by the prisoner—that was before the report was signed—I mean bought on the Tuesday, and that led to my putting into the letter which you read, that no trace of strychnia, prussic acid, or morphia had been found—that was in answer to the inquiry—it was ten days before the inquest that I knew it—it was with that knowledge, and after hearing the evidence of Mills and Jones, that I gave my opinion—I did not associate that knowledge at all with the facts and symptoms—we signed the report after we knew strychnia had been bought—we did not allow it to</p>

               <p>influence our judgments in the smallest degree—(<hi rend="italic">At the request of Mr. Serjeant Shee, the deposition of Dr. Taylor before the Coroner was here read, as follows</hi>: "Alfred Swaine Taylor, sworn, saith, I am a Fellow of the College of Phy<lb/>sicians and Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital, London—I received a jar from Mr. Boycott on Tuesday, the 27th Nov., at the laboratory of Guy's Hospital—I found the jar contained the stomach and intestines of the deceased—the stomach had been cut open, the contents had drained away, and it was lying on the surface of the intestines—the surface of the stomach was first carefully ex<lb/>amined by a magnifying glass by Dr. Bees and myself—there was a brownish coloured, bilious liquid adhering to the surface of the lining membrane—there was no appearance of ulceration, perforation, or other disease—the lining membrane was generally reddened, and this redness was very strongly marked at the lesser end of the stomach—there was no ap<lb/>pearance of effused blood, or mineral or vegetable matter, on the surface of the stomach—there was no smell of opium, prussic acid, or spirits—the only odour perceptible was that of feculent matter, in consequence of the stomach having been in contact with the intestines—the large and small intestines were examined throughout—they presented slight patches of redness, both on the outside and inside, at different parts—the small intestines contained a yellowish coloured fluid, chiefly consisting of bile and mucus—the contents of the intestines, after being cut open, were removed, and allowed to stand in a dean glass vessel twenty-four hours, the sediment was examined and found to contain no mineral or vegetable matter, or any other suspicions matter—there was no blood mixed with or contained in the intestines—on Saturday, Dec. 1st, I received from Mr. Boycott another jar containing the liver, kidneys, and spleen of the body of the deceased—the liver, kidneys, and spleen were all healthy in their structure, nothing to account for disease or death—the left kidney was rather less in size than the right, but the structure was healthy—there was nothing in the stomach or intestines to indicate the cause of death—the first analysis was made of the mucus and bilious looking liquid on the surface of the stomach—it was tested for all the poisons which would cause sudden death, including prussic and oxalic acids, morphia, opium, strychnia, veratria, nicotina (poison of tobacco), conia (poison of hemlock), as well as for mercury, antimony, and the other metallic poisons—the result of the most minute examination by Dr. Kees and myself conjointly was, that there was only a slight trace of antimony in the parts examined, and there was no trace of any other substance—the coats of the stomach were examined, and there wan only a small portion of antimony in them—the coats of the intestines and the contents of the intestines were similarly tested, and we found only antimony in both—about one eighth part of the liver, spleen, and kidneys were examined, and we found only antimony—there was no trace of any other substance—the drainiugs of the jar were also examined, and were found to contain a larger portion of antimony than the other parts—they were especially examined for morphia and strychnia, but no traces were discovered of either—there was a bottle contained in the second jar containing a bloody liquid—this was analysed and contained anti-mony—the conclusions drawn from the investigations were these—that first, antimony derived from some antimonial preparation and taken during life was present in the body of the deceased—secondly, that antimony had beenabsorbed, carried into the blood, and deposited in the various parts in which it was found—thirdly, that the quantity found was small, and might be the residue of a large dose or of various small doses taken some hours or days before death—fourthly,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140121"/>
               <p>that the quantity taken by the deceased cannot be inferred from the small quantity found in the body, or from the appearances presented by the stomach and intestines—fifthly, that antimony, under the form of tartar emetic, may produce nausea, violent vomiting, purging, and other symptoms of irritation of the stomach and bowels—there is also another symptom pro<lb/>duced by mercury, arsenic, and antimony—that is constriction of the throat, and a choking sensation—the sixth conclusion was that the viscera of the deceased presented no appearance whatever, so far as they were examined by us, to account for death from natural causes—seventhly and lastly, that tartar emetic may be used as a safe and innocent medicine, or may be used as a poison, according to circumstances—we have no evidence before us to enable us to form a judgment as to the circumstances under which it was taken by the deceased, or to enable us to say, in this case, whether it was or was not the cause of death—therefore, the result is, we find antimony in the body, but cannot account for the cause of death—Dr. Bees, who made the analysis with me, fully concurs in these conclusions—Dr. Bees is assistant physician to Guy's Hospital—the antimony may have been given in small doses, hours, if not days, before death—antimony is given in cases of fever and inflammatory diseases—the heart might have been emptied by spasms, or by poisons—antimony would not cause it—my opinion is that Cook died from tetanus, and that this was caused by medicine adminis<lb/>tered or taken shortly before death—I believe that the pills on the Monday night and the Tuesday night contained strychnia—I do not believe that the medicine administered by Dr. Bamford could have produced the effects I have heard to-day—on the Monday night and Tuesday night, after these pills were taken, there is not the slightest indication of the action of morphia on the body—further than this, we found no mercury in the liver or other parts of the body, and I do not think that mercury or calomel could have been taken on Monday and Tuesday night, as well as on the other nights, without our discovering traces of it in the liver—the witness Mills has accurately described the symptoms produced by a small dose of strychnia, such as would be caused by the pills given at half past 10 o'clock on Monday night, and the symptoms on the Tuesday night were those which would be produced by a larger dose of strychnia given in the pills taken on that night—there is an absence of any natural cause or disease to account for this tetanus—the brain and spinal marrow were healthy—there was no insensibility before death, perfect consciousness and merely that effect of spasm upon the muscular system which a poisonous dose of strychnia would cause.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you knew, of course, that his life depended in a great degree on your opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my opinion was in reference to death from poison—I expressed no opinion of the prisoner's guilt—I knew that I should be examined as a witness in all probability upon his trial—I thought it my duty, knowing that, to abstain from all public discussion of the questions which might influence the public mind—I wrote a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi> on the subject, contradicting several misstatements which were made with regard to my evidence.

               <p>in a previous journal—the "<hi rend="italic">Audi alteram partem</hi>" is not mine—none of I the heading is mine, it is the editor's—he inserted certain observations in reference to the case, misrepresenting the case, and completely misrepre<lb/>senting my opinion, and I wrote that in answer.) "Sir,—I have great pleasure in replying to the inquiries contained in your leading article of January 19th. 1. I stated that I had never known antimonial powder, when given in medicinal doses (<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> from 5 to 8 grains at a dose), to produce violent vomiting and purging, I am aware that experience differs on this point; that some have found this substance inert, while others have found it very active. From some recent experiments on antimonial prepara<lb/>tions, I think it not unlikely that the powder may sometimes contain arseniate of lime. Dr. Pereira mentions, that in the large dose of half a teaspoonful, it on one occasion produced violent vomiting, purging, and sweating; while in still larger doses (120 grains at a dose) prescribed by Dr. Elliotson, it occasioned in some instances only nausea. I have never met with any case in which serious symptoms could be referred to its operation; and in the case of Ann Palmer, this medicinal preparation would not account for the antimony found in her body. 2. My statement as to the cause of death was, that the deceased died from the effects of tartar emetic, and from no other cause. That is the opinion which Dr. Rees and I formed from the result of our examination, and from the description of the symptoms under which the deceased laboured during the eight days which preceded her death. It is an opinion which I believe is now equally shared by the two medical attendants of the deceased We are quite pre<lb/>pared to maintain this opinion on the trial. You will excuse me from entering into our reasons for this opinion on the present occasion, as this may form a very fair and proper subject for cross-examination at the trial. Possibly the defence may be, that tartar emetic in small doses is not a poison, that it cannot under any circumstances destroy life, and that it was the very best remedy for the disease (English cholera) under which it was stated the deceased was labouring. One other point connected with, this inquiry may be here adverted to. The examination of the organs was made <hi rend="italic">fifteen months</hi>, not' fifteen weeks' after death, and the viscera examined were as well preserved as I have seen them in many cases of arsenical poisoning. They were in a better state of preservation than the viscera of Walter Palmer, whose body has been buried for a period of three months only in a leaden coffin. The viscera in Ann Palmer's case were in such a state of preservation as to allow us to form an opinion of their condition. 3. This inquiry refers to the elimination of antimony from the body. Ac<lb/>cording to my experience, antimony is analogous to arsenic in the rapidity with which it enters into the blood and passes out of the system. These two metals are wholly different in this respect from mercury and lead, and probably from copper. I shall be most happy, after the trial, to furnish you with facts and authorities, as far as 1 can, in reference to these interesting points. In the meantime, as this question may also form a fair subject for cross-examination, a detailed answer to it may be for the present reserved 4. The fourth inquiry involves, as you have justly suspected, an error of the press, What I said was to this effect: that if there were symptoms of fever, antimonial medicines may be fairly prescribed. In concluding this letter I would observe, that during a quarter of a century which I have now specially devoted to toxicological inquiries, I have never met with any cases like those suspected cases of poisoning at Bugeley. The mode in which they will affect the person accused is of minor importance compared with</p>

               <p>their probable influence on society. I have no hesitation in saying, that the future security of life in this country will mainly depend on the judge, the jury, and the counsel who may have to dispose of the charges of murder which hare arisen out of these investigations.") (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Serjeant Shee read again to the witness the concluding paragraph in the letter</hi>)—That is my opinion now—I found it stated broadly and openly that strychnia might cause death, and that if it did, it would always be found in the body, which I deny—it is untrue, and would lead to the loss of hundreds of lives—further, it has been circulated in every paper thai a person could not be killed by tartar emetic in small doses; that I deny—it is untrue, and would lead to hundreds of lives being destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And did you think it a right thing to publish that opinion before the man was put upon his trial for his life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no prejudice against the man, I merely speak as to the investigation of the facts of the case—I entertain no prejudice whatever—I maintain the principles of science in the doctrine which I there comment upon—if those statements which I have seen circulated in medical and other periodicals were to have their way, there is not a life in this country that would be safe: that is what I say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then do you adhere to your opinion that the mode in which they will affect the person accused, that is, leading him to the scaffold, is of minor importance compared with their probable influence on society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have never suggested the leading to the scaffold; I hope he will be acquitted if that is concerned, but I say that the lives of sixteen mil<lb/>lions of people are of greater importance than that of one—allow me to state, as you are putting this as a sort of objection to my views and evidence, that I find here in two dead bodies antimony; one of these per<lb/>sons died suddenly; in the other I find the body saturated with antimony, which I never found before in my examination of 300 dead bodies in this country, and I say these circumstances demand explanation—I have ex<lb/>pressed no opinion about the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you adhere to the opinion, as a medical man and a member of an honourable profession, that you were right in publishing that letter before he came to his trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was right in stating my opinion in answer to the comments that have been made on my evidence—no comments had been made by the prisoner, but his attorney, Mr. Smith, has circulated through every paper that Dr. Taylor was inaccurate—I had no wish or motive to charge any one with poisoning, but my duty concerns the lives of all, as well as one person—I have seen a Mr. Augustus Mayhew, the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Tynes</hi>, Once or twice.</p>

               <p>did not know what it would apply, to—I did not think so—I did not think anything about it—I thought it was a great cheat to extract from me this information and to publish it—it was on the morning of Thursday that he called on me with the slip, the day before publication—he was with me not above twenty minutes or half an hour—I remonstrated with him—I was not angry in the sense of the word quarrelling—I told him I objected to that mode of dealing with the case.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not produced from your hands two days ago in court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You are under a mistake about it; it was a private letter, not signed by the gentlemen, from Dr. Harland to Mr. Stevens—it was a statement of the results of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination for Mr. Stevens's private information—it has been inaccurately called a medical report in the course of this trial—it is merely Dr. Harland's statement of the examination for the informa<lb/>tion of Mr. Stevens—it has been read here as a formal medical report—I believe that it has no signature but Dr. Harland's—I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you distinctly to say, that as respects the effect of strychnia on the human body, you have no knowledge of your own at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen a case; I have some knowledge—I have written a book upon the subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you, from your reading, know of any fatal case in which the patient under strychnia poison has had, while the paroxysm lasted, as much command over the muscles of animal life and voluntary motion as Mr. Cook had on the Monday and Tuesday nights, according to the evidence of Mills and Jones? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not see that he had much command over the muscles of voluntary life and motion—I mean to say, his symptoms are quite in accordance with the ordinary action of strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me a single case, either in your book or in any authentic medical work, of a patient seized with tetanic symptoms by strychnia poison, sitting up in his bed talking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was seized with the tetanic symp<lb/>toms after he had sat up in his bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know of any instance in which a patient has been beating with both his arms the bed clothes under the influence of strychnia poison within a short time, a quarter of an hour, before his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The symptoms generally commence with some agitation of the body—it is manifested in various ways—it is exactly what I should expect from the sense of suffocation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it is exactly what you should expect; your experience is on rabbits, and the first symptom you have seen is a sudden fall on the side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You asked me the question with reference to my reading and knowledge—I am quite willing not to answer, except as to rabbits; but I thought you asked me with reference to my general knowledge—the beating of the bed with the arms in the way described merely indicates to me that he was very uneasy, that there was some difficulty about his breathing, that he felt an oppression, and it was an attempt at relief—that was before the tetanic symptoms set in; there was a feeling of suffocation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> First answer my question; do you know of a single case, either in your book or in your general reading, of the symptoms of poison by strychnia commencing or exhibiting themselves during any time of the paroxysm, by the operation of beating the bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There have been only about fifteen fatal cases altogether—I have not heard of a person taking strychnia in bed before—I do not think the beating of the bed is well known under the name of malleatio, and is a very common symptom of ordinary convulsions, not to my knowledge—I know the term malleatio—it means beating of anything—that does not terminate in tetanus—it is a common form of vio<lb/>lent convulsions in persons who suffer from a sense of suffocation, whether it depends on strychnia or other causes—I have heard of one such case that has been communicated to me by a friend—it was in a private letter which came to me—it is not a published case—the person did not sit up, but he shook as if he had an ague fit before the symptoms came on; that was all, agitation—I should not call that malleatio; I should not give it so learned a name—I would call it quaking, shaking; the agitation is ex<lb/>pressed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140127"/>
               <p>in different ways—I have not met with a case of a person who had taken strychnia, sitting up in bed and beating the bed—I have not known many instances in which the patient has screamed before he was seized with the fit; that is common in convulsions not occasioned by strychnia poison—in many cases they scream very soon after the spasm sets in, when the spasm begins; the pain felt is very severe—I have not known it before they begin—I have known cases in which they speak freely—I cannot refer to any case of that kind after the paroxysm has commenced—I do not re<lb/>member one at the present time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree as far as your reading enables you to do so, with this description of strychnia in Dr. Watson's book; it was a case in Middlesex Hospital: "Unluckily, through mistake or negligence of the person who was at that time the dispenser, a grain of the poison was administered at once to each patient; it was given about seven o'clock in the evening; about half past 7 it began to produce its characteristic effects upon one of the patients. He was suddenly seized with tetanic spasms; legs separated widely from each other, and rigidly extended, and the head and trunk bent backwards; he was in fact in a state of oposthotonos; his abdomen was quite hard, and his limbs were stiff even when the violence of the paroxysm had abated. He cried out with the pain at the coming on of the spasms; any attempt at movement, even the touching him by another person, brought them on. That is just what happens in the disease; the opening of a door, a sudden current of air; the smallest bodily effort, the act of swallowing, nay, even the imagination will be sufficient to renew the spasmodic tightening of the affected muscles." Is that consistent with your knowledge and reading of the effect of the spasms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have noticed it in animals especially; I stated that—I have a collection of cases, but that fact is not noticed as a point at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell me or refer me to any one case in your book or elsewhere, any authentic writing, in which the effect of the strychnia affection or paroxysm in a fatal case has been delayed so long after the ingestion of the poison as in Cook's case on Tuesday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and longer, a fatal case; in page 185 of my "Medical Jurisprudence," 5th edition—the book on poisons is eight years old, I put it down as an observation—"In a case commu<lb/>nicated to the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, of Aug. 31, 1850, page 259, by Mr. Bennett, one grain and a half of strychnia, taken by mistake, destroyed the fife of a healthy young female in an hour and a halt. It is remarkable that no symptoms ap<lb/>peared for an hour"—I do not think that is the longest period on record which has elapsed between the ingestion of the poison and the commence<lb/>ment of the symptoms—I think in that case it was taken in pills; but I have the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi> here to refer to if you wish—that was a remarkable and unusual case—it was certainly long with regard to the cases that had up to that time occurred—there is one case of two hours, and a half—that was not a fatal case, but that does not at all affect the medical question—I beg to say that the fatality of the case has nothing to do with the period of commence<lb/>ment of symptoms—that was not a fatal case—a grain and a half is a full dose, not a very considerable dose—it is a dose from which a man is very likely to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any one case in your book in which the attack has taken place more than half an hour after the ingestion of the poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What book are you referring to—the book on poisons is eight years old—I believe there is not in that book, but there is in the other book—cases have occurred since 1848—I have a reference to a case here of one grain and a half</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140128"/>
               <p>—that is a case published by Dr. Christison—the symptoms came on in three hours—it was fatal—that is a case by Dr. Bardsley, page 895, 4th edition—it was a case in which the patient had been affected with hemiplegia for four weeks and began to use strychnia, and had been doing so for eleven days with<lb/>out particular inconvenience—"During this period he had taken twice a day gradually increasing doses until the amount of one grain was attained, when the usual physiological effects having ceased to occur, the quantity was in<lb/>creased to a grain and a half, but the first dose caused anxiety and excite<lb/>ment; in three hours (it says it ended in three hours, it does not say that, I the symptoms did not commence in three hours,) there was stupor and loss of speech, and at length violent tetanic convulsions, which proved fatal in three hours and three quarters"—it does not tell you when it commenced—Dr. Christison can give an account of it—I do not know of any other fatal case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any case in your book on poisons in which the symptoms have been known to occur at a longer period than half an hour from the ingestion of the poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but you must not go back to 1848—in giving an answer to your question, I am looking to what has occurred in the meantime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that Dr. Bardsley, from whom Dr. Earth took the case, states that he cannot admit that the death was wholly attributable to the dose of strychnia employed, but might be referable to other conditions, which he enumerates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All those conditions are quite compatible with death from strychnia—I would not, after that opinion from the gentleman who reports it, say it was attributable solely to strychnia; but I should exercise my judgment, and see whether strychnia had not something to do with it—I have no other case in my reading to which I can refer—I have here the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, which contains the case that has been referred to, and it is more remarkable than I had thought—the account is this: "On the day previous, she had consulted a surgeon for amaurosis, for which he prescribed three grains of strychnine in a solution of ten drachms of cinnamon water, directing twenty drops to be taken three times daily in a wine glass of water—a written label of directions was attached to the bottle, and she was also verbally informed of the dangerous nature of the medicine—upon the bottle containing the medicine being pro<lb/>duced, I found the unfortunate young woman had taken about four and a half or five drachms, which had been poured out by a little girl thirteen years of age, who, on being told to pour out twenty drops, and probably being ignorant of the meaning of a drop, poured out the above quantity—after taking the medicine, she went about her work, cleaned out a room, and went into the kitchen to breakfast—she swallowed a cup of tea and was commencing a second, when she complained of feeling very ill, having a peculiar kind of twitching over her limbs, which began rather more than an hour after the administration of the poison; and in a very short time after this, general tremors and violent spasmodic fits came on, which excited the alarm of the family, and I was immediately sent for"—so that in that case the poison was really taken dissolved, and one would have anticipated a more speedy action—the stomach pump was used, and strong emetics were administered; perhaps I had better read on: "On my arrival and examina<lb/>tion of the patient, I found a general tremor over the body, the limbs rigid, and the face exhibiting an almost maniacal expression, which was soon fol<lb/>lowed by a violent fit of tetanus—between the fits she did not utter any expression of alarm, but would occasionally request a little cold water—the muscles of the jaw remained so rigid between the spasms as to prevent their</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140129"/>
               <p>being opened sufficiently to admit the tube of the stomach pump being in<lb/>troduced, but were sufficiently relaxed to admit of the emetic being adminis-tered—it however repeatedly happened that the attempt of the patient to take liquids was followed by so violent a spasmodic fit as to prevent her swallowing it, and to give that apparent dread of water so well marked in cases of hydrophobia—even after her request for water, on attempting to give it to her, she would find herself so incapable of swallowing it, as to request that its administration might be deferred until the fit was over, the effort to place the cup to the mouth being generally sufficient in itself to induce a relapse of the spasms."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know a single fatal case in which the symptoms have manifested themselves as long as an hour and a half after the ingestion of the poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you refer me to any authentic case of strychnia poison in which the patient has recovered from a paroxysm in so short a time as Mr. Cook recovered from, the paroxysm on Monday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within what time did he recover?—I do not understand that it was so short—if he was well the next morning, and it had no effect during the whole of the next day, but he was comfortable and happy, the recovery would depend entirely on the dose taken; if he took the sixteenth of a grain he would recover sooner than if he had taken an eighth—I do not at present remember any authentic case of strychnia poison in which the patient has recovered from a paroxysm in as short a time as Mr. Cook did, he being well before the morning, but I can conceive in medical practice such cases would frequently occur; it is nothing at all unusual—I say from my reading and experience, a recovery after three or four hours will depend materially upon the dose—I see in a case at page 265 of the "Medical Jurisprudence," second edition, "the con<lb/>vulsions gradually subsided about four hours after the first attack"—that was a case of nux vomica—that is the same poison, but in a much milder form—all its power depends on the strychnia—"in this case a girl aged twenty swallowed half an ounce of the powder, and in half an hour the usual tetanic symptoms came on, but she was perfectly sensible—in administering the remedies, the spasms in the muscles of the jaw were such as to cause her to bite through the tongue—the convulsions gradually subsided about four hours after the first attack, and the next day, although feeble and exhausted, she was able to walk home"—I learn from Mr. Cook's case that he was asleep before three o'clock, and comfortable during the whole of the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know any other case in which, after an administration of strychnia poison, the patient has recovered as soon as Mr. Cook did on Monday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The difficulty is in settling the time of recovery; that is not a point that medical men enter into—they do not give the time generally, they merely put "The patient recovered," without any particular statement as to the period of the attack—I do not think the attack on Tuesday night was the result of anything given on Monday night—I do not know of any case of strychnia poison in which there was so long an intermission of the paroxysm as between the iwo fits of Monday and Tues<lb/>day night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the result of your experience or reading, that the person who dies from strychnia poison continues rigid in the attitude and position of limb in which he dies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen that in animals, in rabbits; they continue rigid in the attitude and position of limb in which they die—I do not remember a case in particular as to men—if a person dies in a spasm, the spasm is likely to continue—I have a case which will answer it in the fifth edition of the "Medical Jurisprudence;" it was inspection twenty</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140130"/>
               <p>hours after death, and the body was then very rigid—there is no account in these cases of how the body was at the moment of death—the body would be rigid in twenty-four hours, whatever sort of convulsion he died of; not very rigid—there would not be the slightest difficulty, I think, in finding such a case, but I cannot refer you to one now—I found in one of the rabbits destroyed, that the spasm continued after death—I do not know that it con<lb/>stantly happens, even in rabbits, that the spasm and the contractions instantly cease immediately with death, or just before death, and that the body becomes perfectly pliant—it does so in some instances, in one out of five cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree in this opinion of Dr. Christison, "I have not altered the statement as to this point in the former edition," that is, that the rigi<lb/>dity supervenes at an early period after death; "yet I strongly suspect that authors, who describe the spasm which precedes death to continue as it were into the rigidity that occurs after death, must have observed inaccurately, for, in the numerous experiments that I have made and witnessed upon ani<lb/>mals, flaccidity invariably took place at the time of death, and continued for a moderate interval"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Dr. Christison speaks according to his own experience, and I speak according to mine—it happened in one case in my own experience, and it became rigid very soon after, as Dr. Christison describes it—I do not recollect enough of those that I killed twenty<lb/>five years ago to know whether their limbs were stiff or flaccid—four of the five last remained stiff after death; one was quite flaccid; that was seen by Dr. Christison—I attended particularly to the last five—I see that in Dr. Bamford's deposition, he went to Mr. Cook as soon as he was called, arrived immediately after he was dead, and found the body quite straight upon the bed—in my judgment, that body might be under the influence of oposthotonos—the oposthotonos may have relaxed in the act of dying—that would be an instance of becoming flaccid—the clenching of the hand is the result of violent tetanic spasms—that may occur in other violent spasms—it does not occur in all forms of convulsion—the great point is this, that in tetanus it remains so; in other convulsions it comes and goes—it is always so, according to my knowledge—I stated that the heart was generally full of blood in animals—I mean to say that the colour tests of strychnia are so uncertain and fallacious that they cannot be depended upon, unless you first get strychnia in a visible and tangible form—it is not impossible to get that from the stomach in all cases; it depends on the quantity that remains in the stomach—I think it is in some cases impossible, where the quantity is very small—I do not think that as much as the fiftieth part of a grain could be discovered; that is to say, not separated—it might be a case of difficulty to detect half a grain—it depends upon the amount of food in the stomach with which it was mixed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your reading, about which my learned friend has been asking you, have you met with cases in which it has appeared that the heart was found empty after death, where the death has taken place from strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that has been in the human subject—I find three such cases—I think the emptiness of the heart, after such a death, is owing to spasmodic action, spasm affecting the heart in the last moments of life—there is no reason why that should be more likely to be the case in the human subject than in a small animal like a rabbit; I know of no distinction—the only thing I would observe is, that I think the heart is generally more filled where the paroxysms are more frequent, so that the blood accumulates more in the interior—suppose the paroxysms to be short and violent, and cause death in a few minutes, that is the kind of case in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140131"/>
               <p>which I should expect to find the heart empty—the rigidity after death in the cases where I found it, always affected the same muscles; the muscles of the limbs especially, and the muscles of the back—where the rigidity is relaxed in death, it afterwards returns, while the body is warm; I mean in cases of death by strychnia: in ordinary death it only appears when the body is cold—the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> comes on after the body is cold, or nearly so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the rigidity of the muscles of the extremities as long as two months after death, the clenching of the hands, and the distortion of the feet and toes, afford you any indication of whether the person died from tetanus or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never before known such a case—it would indicate the great violence of the spasm from which the party died—I am not able to say whether the poison of strychnia would act witty greater power when once its effect was set up, upon a person who had been lowered by previous disease—with regard to the duration of time in which the effect of the poison would begin to show itself, it would depend on the violence and frequency of the spasms—the period required to set up the action of the poison would vary according to the constitution and the strength of the individual, and according to the power of absorption—the beating with the hands and arms I ascribe to a sense of general uneasi-ness, and a feeling of suffocation—the feeling of suffocation is one of the early symptoms of death by strychnia—that uneasiness would produce the effect in question—with regard to the detection of the antimony, we separated the antimony, and then applied various tests—I have been asked whether one or other of those processes would not be open to difficulty, supposing there were any impure substances used in the chemical process—that would be so with regard to impure substances—I have no doubt the substances I used were pure—they were all tested on that occasion before I used them—it would certainly not be at all likely to be the case with regard to three distinct processes—it is the fact that the three distinct processed gave the same result, which strongly corroborates the correctness of each—I and Mr. Brande witnessed them—I have not the least doubt that that which I produced was antimony—the quantity I found does not enable me to form any judgment as to the quantity that may have been administered; that is to say, a small quantity may be the residue of small doses, or the residue of large—supposing that the antimony were given for the purpose of keeping up sickness, the effect of the sickness would be to throw off some portion of that which was taken—when antimony is given, it passes out with the urine, but some of it passes into different parts of the body—if the antimony is not withdrawn, it remains longest in the liver; it then goes into the fat and bones, where it may be found after three or four months, but I have not met with an instance yet, and the cases quoted do not show that in those instances in which there was antimony in the coats of the stomach and in the bowels, it had been longer than two or three weeks in the body.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Failing to find either prussic acid, opium, or strychnia, you referred to antimony as the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As the only substance found in the body—on the occasion of my writing the letter to the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, I had myself been made the subject of a great many attacks—I had been misrepresented as to what I had said upon the subject of the possibility or impossibility of detecting strychnia after death—not in the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi> only, but in the newspapers, and in every quarter in fact, in the letter to Sir George Grey written by Mr. Smith there was a repetition of the same thing—before I wrote the letter to the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, the subject bad been misrepresented in various newspapers in every direction—it had been represented that I had said that strychnia could not be detected in a dead body, that it was destroyed by putrefaction, when the question of putrefaction had never even arisen in Cook's case.</p>

I am a Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and Lecturer on Materia Medica at Guy's—I assisted Professor Taylor in making the analysis of Cook's stomach and intestines sent up—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Taylor of the result of that analysis; it has been very correctly given—I have at different times had my attention drawn a good deal to poisons after death—Dr. Taylor has accurately explained the quantity and the site where the antimony was discovered; I was present the whole time—antimony may be discovered if administered within a few days or a few hours of death—I agree with Dr. Taylor that, under the circumstances, the quantity of antimony we discovered was no test of the quantity which may have been administered—we failed, having applied all the tests, to discover strychnia—the stomach was presented to us in a most unfavourable state for the discovery of strychnia—I opened the jar myself, and found that the stomach had been cut open, and turned inside out,</p>

               <p>it's mucous surface lying and rubbing against the intestines—the contents, bad there been any at all, must have been completely thrown among the intestines, and mixed up with them—that rendered it decidedly unfavourable to the hope of discovering strychnia—I believe that strychnia is absorbed before it produces it's symptoms—if by accident or design, enough strychnia is given to destroy life, that might be the consequence, I believe, without my being able to discover it after death—I quite agree with Professor Taylor, that it is the excess which you find; that when vitality is destroyed by the excess of the poison, and an excess remains, you can discover that with care sometimes—I have seen the various experiments tried on animals—I saw the experiments which Dr. Taylor tried on four of the rabbits, not on the fifth—I assisted in the analysis made of the animals, with the endeavour to discover strychnia in all these cases—we destroyed four animals, and failed to detect it in three—the symptoms which I remarked of the death of the animals very much resembled the symptoms which are described as attending Cook's death—I have never seen death in the human subject from strychnia—I have heard narrated in this Court the symptoms attending the death of Mrs. Serjeantson Smith from strychnia, those of the girl in a hospital in Glasgow, and those of a case which is anonymous: all the cases which have been detailed here I have listened to—they are in my opinion closely analogous to the symptoms attending this case, and quite analogous to the experiments which I have made on animal life: from strychnia.</p>

I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Physi<lb/>cians, and Professor of Materia Medica to the University of Edinburgh—in 1845, I published a treatise on poisons in relation to medical jurisprudence and the practice of physic—among other poisons, I have turned my attention to strychnia—in my opinion strychnia acts upon the human frame through absorption into the blood, and through the blood on the nervous system—I have seen a case of strychnia upon a human subject, but not fatally—an over-dose taken medicinally—I have frequently seen experiments tried upon animals, frogs, rabbits, cats, dogs, and one wild boar—I first directed uiy attention to this poison in 1820, in Paris—it was first</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140135"/>
               <p>made matter of inquiry by the French—it was discovered two years before that, at Paris—in these experiments upon animals, I have given, in most of my experiments, very small doses, but sometimes as much as one grain—I call a small dose a sixth part of a grain—I do not know what is the smallest dose to kill a rabbit, as administered by the stomach—I have administered it by injecting it into the cavity of the chest by a small incision—I have given it by the stomach—I have found a sixth part of a grain take life away—in that way it killed a dog in two minutes—I have administered it oc-casionally by the stomach—I have seen a grain so given, I do not recollect having given more—that was to a rabbit; the animal died, but in how short a time I cannot recollect at this time—it is a long time since I made these experiments, but I have seen an experiment made lately—that was on a rabbit the other day, one of the experiments made by Dr. Taylor—he gave then, I think, about three-quarters of a grain; a very small quantity of that was rejected by the animal, or rather was not swallowed, three-quarters was given, but a very small quantity was not swallowed—between the eases of rabbits, cats, and dogs there is very little difference, but there are differences between individuals of the same species, and differences between the species—the first symptom that I have observed has been a slight tremor and unwillingness to move, then frequently the animal jerks it's head back slightly, and very soon after that all the symptoms of tetanus come on, which have been so often described in the evidence of previous witnesses—there is occasionally an intermission of the symptoms for a short while, an inter<lb/>mission of the spasms—where it has been introduced into the stomach it is between five or six minutes and twenty-five minutes before the animal dies, in other cases it is much more rapid—from the giving the poison to the first symptoms coming on I have seen it as late as twelve minutes before it begins to act, before the first appearance of tremor: and then from the first commencement of the symptoms to their termination in death it is from five or six minutes to twenty or twenty-five minutes—the symptoms always have been very much the same—I think, where one can trace it very care<lb/>fully, that the jaws and the back of the head seem affected first, and then the trunk and the extremities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Which first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In such rapidity that it is very difficult to follow the succession—I mentioned that I had sometimes observed differences in individuals of the same species, that the intermission sometimes is wanting—they die in one long, continuous spasm, with scarcely any intermission; but that is uncommon—I have commonly found a remission of the symptoms immediately before death, so that the animal has died quietly, that is a, state of fiaccidity about the period of the termination of life—I have always observed an interval before the rigidity of the muscles that takes place after death—there is a cessation of the symptoms immediately before death the rigidity is gone, the body is quite flaccid—in such cases, after death, we find the rigidity renewed very soon—I have not attended to it's duration—I have frequently opened the bodies of animals that have been thus killed—I never could see any effect which I could trace upon the stomach or intestines, nor any apparent effect upon the spinal cord or brain, any visible or apparent change; none which I could trace satisfactorily to the poison—the heart of such an animal after death generally contains blood—I have not found it devoid of blood in animals, it has been found so by others, but I have not—I have seen one case in the human subject—I have seen several where a mild over-action was produced, but one in which a severe over-action was produced—it was from an overdose given medicinally—the symptoms of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140136"/>
               <p>that case were the fixing of the jaw, spasmodic retraction of the head, slight grinning expression of the mouth, and a slight stiffness of the anus and fingers, no convulsion of the muscles of the trunk, great alarm; no con-vulsive movement of the arms and legs—I have collected all the cases that have occurred up to the time of the publication of my book, as far as I could discover them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Should you expect to find that the poison took a longer time in pro-ducing it's effect upon the human subject than it would upon an animal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears to require a longer time in the larger animals; in the case of the wild boar, it was injected into the chest—the operation, therefore, was rapid—that animal was dead in ten minutes from the third of a grain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To come back to the human subject: in what length of time, with the knowledge that you have derived from the cases that you have collected, does the poison operate upon the human subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you mean operate to produce death, or begin to operate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Begin to operate. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there are cases where strychnia, in the shape of nux vomica, has not operated for about an hour; but given in the shape of strychnia, the time seems in general shorter than nux vomica, but that will depend upon the mode in which it is given.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the generality of cases which are reported in the books it has been given in the solid form, generally in the solid, but sometimes in the fluid; and it will make a difference whether it is in the one or the other in the time it will require? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, there is a want of precise information as to the materials with which the poison is given, and that often signifies materially—I mean the material with which it is mixed up—supposing that it was given in the shape of a pill, much might depend upon the materials used for making the pill—it might certainly be mixed up with materials which would protract the period at which the symptoms would make their appearance—resinous materials are all difficult of digestion—such materials would be within the knowledge and reach of a medical man—some of those resinous substances are often used for making ordi-nary pills—absorption would begin as soon as the pill came to be broken down or digested, but not before—the less soluble the pill the longer would be the period required—I do not think we can fix, in the present state of knowledge, the precise time for the poison beginning to operate after it has been taken into the stomach—when we give it to an animal for the purpose of watching the effect of the poison, we take care that the animal is fasting, and have every circumstance favourable for the action of poison—we mix it up with materials that shall be readily soluble in the stomach—I have seen cases of tetanus of the natural kind, arising from disease and from wounds—I cannot say how many instances—I have seen a good many arising from wounds, but very few from natural disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there, in your opinion, any marked difference between natural tetanus and the tetanus of strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would not rest much upon the little difference of particular symptoms, but rather upon the course of the symptoms and the general circumstances attending them—the difference in respect of the course of the symptoms is, first, that in all the natural forms of tetanus the symptoms begin and advance much more slowly; and secondly, they prove fatal much more slowly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q. When</hi> once set up, do you find in the natural tetanus any complete intermission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In certain forms of natural tetanus there is no inter-mission—where the first paroxysm does not prove fatal, there are occasional short intermissions in tetanus from strychnia—I heard the evidence given</p>

               <p>by Elizabeth Mills of what took place on the Monday, and by Mr. Jones of what took place on the Tuesday night, when Mr. Cook died—referring to my experience, both by personal observation and by general study of the two classes of tetanus, I should refer the spasms and other symptoms spoken to by those two witnesses, to strychnia, or one of the natural poisons containing it—there are four kinds of poisons, different from one another, which contain it—they are nux vomica, St. Ignatius's bean, snake<lb/>wood, and a Java poison called tschk—they belong to different plants of the same genus, stryehnos, from all of which strychnia has been obtained—when I refer those symptoms to strychnia that would be pure strychnia, or one of the natural poisons which contain it, which I have enumerated—there is no natural disease to which I can refer these symptoms, none that I have ever seen or that I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now there is one thing which I omitted to ask you with regard to animals, and also to the human subject; when death takes place from tetanus or tetanic convulsions, does consciousness continue, or is it ever overcome? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As long as, one can make an observation upon it, it remains—when the animal is in a state of strong universal spasm, it is impossible to make any observation on it's consciousness—in the animals that I have seen killed, the heart of some remains with blood in it—that is not always 90 with the human subject—it varies in the human subject—I ascribe the feet, that it sometimes is found with blood in it, and sometimes empty, to the particular mode of death, to the dose varying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What mode of death will have the effect of emptying the heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is evident that in some instances, as in this case, that took; place by a spasm of the heart—I then expect to find emptiness of the heart—the ipasm expels the blood—with regard to the finding of strychnia altar death, where the death has taken place from strychnia, I should not expect to find it where the quantity is small: but where there is an excess over the quantity necessary to destroy life by absorption, I should expect to find it if the excess is considerable—I think the colouring tests are uncertain in some respects—vegetable poisons are generally more difficult to detect—there is one, I know, for which there it no test that I know of—I did not see the stomach that was sent to Dr. Taylor to operate upon—I heard the description that he gave of it to-day—my opinion is, that it was in a very unsatisfactory condition for chemical analysis—if I had been called upon to analyze such a stomach as he has described, I should have entertained no reasonable expectation of doing any good with it, unless I had been informed that there was a considerable quantify of strychnia present—I mean it would be necessary that there should be a considerable quantity of strychnia in the stomach beforehand, in order to be able to find it under the circumstances—I heard the evidence as to the Leeds case, the Romsey case, and the Glasgow case—those were deaths by strychnia, I have no doubt—the symptoms of Mr. Cook appear to me to have been very similar.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that the experiments, all but one that you made, were made by you many years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those experiments, excluding the one, were before the colour tests were known—I do not think that I have made any observation about my having experimented much upon the tests for strychnia—none of the experiments that I made long ago had any reference to chemical analysis—I have made an experiment with the colour tests in the case of a man poisoned by strychnia, and I failed to find strychnia by one of the tests most relied on—that is the only one in which I made an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140138"/>
               <p>experiment with a colour test—that occurred in 1851—the test I employed there was the development of a violet colour, by means of sulphuric acid and the oxide of lead, used instead of the bichromate of potash, I did not try that in that case, nor the manganese, and no experiments with animals with those tests—that case was a man who was found dead—I did not see him, or see the administration of strychnia to him—he was found dead on a moor—I know nothing about the exhibition of strychnia of my own know-ledge—the case was investigated, and the particulars submitted to me in the usual manner—it is reported by the medical gentleman who consulted me upon the matter, in the Monthly Medical Journal of September, 1851, I think—from my own observation, I should say that animals who die from strychnia die by asphyxia—but you will find in another part of my work from that to which you refer, that I leave the question open—I wish you to understand by asphyxia, stoppage of the respiration—the literal meaning of it is stoppage of the pulse, but it no longer bears that meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you refer me to the head in your work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is under the head of Nux Vomica, at the bottom of page 898: "On account of the sin<lb/>gular symptoms of irritation of the spinal cord, uncombined with any injury of the brain, this poison is believed to act on the spinal marrow alone; but from some experiments by Segalas, it appears also to exhaust the irritability of the heart, for in animals he found that organ could not be stimulated to contract after breathing. A similar observation was made long ago by Wepfer, who found the heart motionless, and distended with arterial blood in its left cavities; and a case of poisoning in the human subject, to the same effect, will be presently related"—that leaves the question open, whether death, may not take place through an influence of the heart on the respiration, which is now decidedly my opinion from what has been done before, and from what has occurred since—the distension of the heart which you mention would not be consistent with death by asphyxia; not with arterial blood in the left side of the heart—I think it is a fair inference, therefore I leave the question open in that passage, and I quote experiments different from those which I myself found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is a case where the heart was distended with arterial blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Death must have taken place from an affection of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to state that you do not give that as an inference in your book, which I am not able to find, and do not find it now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is to be understood that that was addressed to medical men, and they would understand it by that statement—I would beg to be allowed to add, that twelve years have elapsed since that book was published, and a great deal of information upon that subject has been acquired since—I do not infer that death arises from asphyxia if the body is flaccid—death must have arisen from the heart in that case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the animals that you examined there was blood in the right cavity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you state in your book, tell me whether you have reason to alter your opinion, that "When death does not take place suddenly, in a fit of spasms, the person continues to be affected for twelve or fourteen hours, with similar but milder paroxysms, and afterwards he may either recover without further symptoms, or expire in a short time, apparently from exhaustion, or suffer an attack of inflammation of the stomach and intestines, which may or may not prove fatal." Is that a statement which is in your opinion correct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the man to whom reference was made a short time ago, whom I saw----</p>

               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140139"/>
               <p>Be kind enough to direct your attention to my question; is the case I have read to you the general description of the effects of the poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is, as we were acquainted with the facts at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And subsequently, as to the general character; I am not asking you as to any special case; I read it, twelve or sixteen hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known the effect cease in a shorter time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tou state at page 903, after mentioning a case where the body was rigid, "The state of rigidity, however, does not invariably occur; on the contrary, in animals the limbs become flaccid immediately after death, but the usual rigidity supervenes at an early period;" I presume the usual rigidity is the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis? A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You add a note, "I have not altered the statement as to this point in a former edition, yet I strongly suspect that authors who describe the spasm which precedes death to continue, as it were, into the rigidity which occurs after death, must have observed inaccurately, for in the numerous experiments I have made and witnessed on animals, flaccidity invariably took place at the time of death, and continued for a moderate interval"—is that your present opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is very likely, the interval being very short, that the attention may not have been attracted to the fact of there having been an interval of flaccidity—there have been, in some cases men<lb/>tioned, very strong indications certainly of the spasm having continued from the spasm of life to what we call the spasm of death; but I think the ease may be explained on the supposition that there has been a want of minute attention—it is right to state, that in all investigations on the action of poisons, very close observation is necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mention a ease at page 906, where you say, speaking of the true Angustura, "A boy who fell a victim to it implored his physician not to touch him, as he was immediately thrown into a fit." Is there a tendency to throw the patient into a fit when touched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That does not appear an immediate cause generally, but in animals it is very remarkable—it is not noticed in the generality of cases—there is no doubt it has been noticed—there is a case in Dr. Watson's book, in which it has been noticed—I have been struck with observing that it has not been so often noticed, considering that it is so very general in animals—it is not mentioned—in animals I have invariably observed it, unless you touch them very gently indeed—the bitter taste of strychnia is very remarkable and enduring—a grain in 80,000 gal<lb/>lons will make it taste bitter, it is said; that is upon the authority of the French gentleman who discovered the poison—it is one grain in 80,000 parts, a little more than a gallon—it is not my own observation, I wish it to be understood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You stated that care was taken, in administering it to animals, to administer it to them fasting; do you think it likely that the effect would supervene more quickly if administered to an empty stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I stated that we took pains to administer it to a healthy animal, and on an empty stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If resinous substances were used in a pill, would they not be found in the stomach afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, if they were not acted upon, they would pass into the intestines, and would be found in the intestines, if not discharged—the strychnia would be discharged with them, or gradually acted upon, for even resinous substances undergo solution in time in the stomach and intestines—if the resinous substance prevented the poison acting rapidly, it would prevent its absorption into the blood for a time—if</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140140"/>
               <p>so, it would be more likely to leave portions of it in the stomach or intestines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would that depend materially on the quantity of the dose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Both on the dose and on the time during which the pill was allowed to remain—the oase of the gamekeeper is reported by the medical gentleman who called in my assistance—it is to be found in the "Monthly Journal of Medical Science," published at Edinburgh, of Sept., 1851—the facts are: a gamekeeper was found dead after being four days missing, and the head of the body was thrown back, the hands clenched, and the muscles rigid—a paper of strychnia was found in his pocket, and I found in the contents of the stomach indications of strychnia, sufficient to satisfy me under these circumstances as to the probable cause of death—by a process like that of Dr. Taylor, I obtained an extract strongly and enduringly bitter, and which became yellow by nitric acid, but it did not give the indication of the other colour test already mentioned; violet.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you ascertain that there was strychnia in the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The gentleman who examined the case on the spot ascertained that it was strychnia—I do not recollect at the moment what his test was, but I was quite satisfied with his method of investigation at the time—it is a very easy matter to detect strychnia when it is found in a state of purity, as he found it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He had it in his pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was in the practice of using it for the purpose of killing vermin—I have nothing further to say upon the head of colour tests—it appears that colour tests are not to be relied upon in the case of strychnia in an impure condition—in the first place, you may not find indications of strychnia, we cannot depend upon finding strychnia by them; and secondly, they are subject to fallacy even when the strychnia is pure; that is from other substances not contain<lb/>ing strychnia presenting similar appearances—those substances that might present the same appearance are the substances mentioned by Dr. Taylor—I should add, that I was not aware of that until they were pointed out to me by Dr. Taylor, and exhibited—I saw the results produced by him.</p>

               <p>in Staffordshire. I attended the Coroner's Inquest oil the body of Cook—after the verdict had been returned, I searched the house of Mr. Palmer on Saturday night, 15th December—I found some papers, and had them conveyed from the surgery into the drawing room—the great proportion of them were found in a drawer in the surgery, and a few were got in Mr. Palmer's bedroom—I searched every part of the house for papers—I put all that I found into one place, in the drawing room, locked the door, and put the key in my pocket—on the following day, Sunday, I endeavoured to make a selection of them in the presence of Mr. George Palmer, the brother of the prisoner—he is an attorney at Rugeley—I cannot say that I had given him notice what I was about to do—he was in the house, and was present—I found him there at the house, or else he came in immediately afterwards—he was present the greater part of the day, on Sunday, when I went through the papers—I was assisted in going through them by In<lb/>spector Crisp and Superintendent Woollaston—we made a selection from the papers—I eventually carried all the papers to Stafford, I gave up the idea of selection—I continued the selection on the Monday, and took them all away on the Tuesday morning—Mr. George Palmer was there on Monday again, but I do not think he was there on Tuesday—I placed the papers all in a black leather bag, every paper I could lay my hand upon, and conveyed them to Stafford, where I delivered them to Mr. Hatton, the Chief Constable—some days afterwards, I believe on the 24th, the bag was opened in my presence, and the papers were then minutely gone through by Mr. Deane, the solicitor for the prosecution, who classified them, and they were then put back again in the bag, at night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>.). I am a fellow of the College of Surgeons and professor of surgery in the Leeds School of Medicine—I am also a member of several scientific societies, foreign and English—I have been in practice between twenty and thirty years—I have had a large practice—I have seen oases of tetanus from convulsion, both traumatic and idiopathic—I have seen four coses of idiopathic tetanus in my own experi-ence—they did not all commence with the symptoms of lock jaw, one did not, lock jaw did occur, but very slightly, not to prevent swallowing in the course of the disease—I have been present during the evidence given as to the symptoms of Cook—I had previously read copies of the depositions, as to the medical and scientific part of the case—judging from the symptoms described, confining myself to the scientific portion of the evidence, in my opinion Cook died from some convulsive disease—I formed that opinion upon the symptoms described in the depositions, and upon the evidence before the Court—(<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the witness could not be asked his opinion upon anything contained in the depositions, except as a matter of science</hi>)—upon the symptoms described by the witnesses in Court, my opinion is that the death arose from some convulsive disese—his preview state of health has an influence on my judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been present in Court during the whole of this trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I have heard the symptoms described by the witnesses, of Mr. Cook's health previously to his final attack at Rugeley, the description of the actual symptoms during the paroxysms, and the facts which have been spoken to, and the appearance of the body upon the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I assume him to have been a man of very delicate constitution, that for a long period he felt himself to be ailing, for which he had been under medical treatment, that he had suffered from syphilis, that he had disease of the lungs, and that he had old standing disease of the throat, that he led an irregular life, that he was subject to mental excitement and depression, that after death appearances were found in his body which show this to have been the case, that there were found unusual appearances within the stomach, that the throat was in an unnatural condition, that the back of the tongue showed edmilar indications, that the lungs were in an emphyseraatous condition, that the air cells were dilated, that in the lining of the aorta, the large artery of the body, there was an unnatural deposit, and that there was a very unusual appear<lb/>ance in the membranes of the spinal marrow—those are the indications which are unnatural upon the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I should also state</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140158"/>
               <p>that it has been described by one of the witnesses, that there was a loss of substance on the penis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is one of the elements of your opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Precisely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What in your judgment as a medical man would that indicate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That scar described upon the penis could only have resulted from an ulcer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean a chancre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is the usual place for a chancre—it proceeds from an ulcer—a chancre is an ulcer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> An ulcer is not necessarily a chancre? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is the usual place for a chancre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To what do you ascribe the symptoms to which you have referred, under his tongue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the root of the tongue, in the throat, I should say to syphilitic inflammation of the throat—supposing the symptoms which I have described to be correct, I infer that his health had not been good for a long time, and that his constitution was delicate—there is another point that I should wish to mention: it has been stated that his father and mother both died young, that is part of the foundation of my opinion, and that his brother and sister were both delicate—supposing this to have been the state of health of Mr. Cook, I should think it would make him liable to nervous irritation—in my judgment, other causes besides physical causes, moral causes, for instance, would tend, in a person in such a state of health and of such a constitution, to excite nervous irritation—any excitement or depression might tend to bring on nervous irritation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a disordered state of the stomach and bowels supervened when he was in that condition, what effect do you think that would have? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would very much depend upon the violence of it—if it was violent, to the extent of frequent vomiting, and continuous vomiting for several days, it would produce a greater effect upon such a state of mind and con<lb/>stitution than in a healthy person, out no peculiar effect—exposure to wet and cold would have a greater effect upon a person of such a state of mind and constitution than upon a healthy person, it would produce more serious illness—perhaps I had better give an explanation of my opinion upon that question, which is a very general one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your opinion upon what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon the condition of the constitution; I mean that convulsive disease is more likely to supervene in such a constitution—I have nothing further to add upon that point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would you infer from the fact, supposing it to have occurred, that three days before his death he suddenly awoke in the middle of the night in a state which he described as a state of madness, for two or three minutes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand that he had three attacks upon succeeding nights, and each occurring about the same hour—I should infer from that periodicity, that those attacks were of a convulsive character, in the absence of other causes to account for them—convulsive attacks are as various as possible in their form and degrees of violence—it is not possible always with certain accuracy to ascribe particular symptoms of convulsion to any one of the classes of convulsion into which they are divided by medical authorities—it is not possible to give a definite name to every convulsive attack.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there many forms of violent convulsions in which the patient retains his consciousness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not a great many forms of convulsive disease—there are some—there are some forms of hysteria.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that apply to the male sex? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, occasionally, but far more commonly to the female.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there any forma of convulsion, epileptic in their character, in which the patient retains his consciousness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is so stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you met with any such case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not during the fit, not in epilepsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know by your reading as a medical man, that that, though rarely, does sometimes occur? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was about to add, that the degree of consciousness in epilepsy varies very much; in some attacks consciousness is altogether lost, and prolonged during the whole attack—convulsive attacks are sometimes accompanied with violent spasms and with rigidity of portions of the body, rigidity of the limbs—convulsions, properly so called, occasionally assume something of the complexion of tetanic affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain what you mean by convulsions properly so called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand from the learned Serjeant's question what is ordinarily called a convulsive disease, either of infancy, or under that form, not exactly tetanus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you read the passage from Dr. Copland which I read yesterday to the Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—I agree with what Dr. Copland there states—when I say that convulsions sometimes assume a tetaniform appearance, I mean convulsions arising from almost any cause; worms in children will produce it, affection of the brain in adults, hysteria, and the giving of chloroform will produce it in some persons—it is consistent with my experience, that adults are sometimes attacked by such convulsions—I do not confine it to diseases of the brain—affections of the spinal cord, and die eating of indigestible food will produce it—I do not know that I have known instances in which it has arisen from retching and vomiting—I agree with Dr. Copland as to these convulsions sometimes ending immediately in death—when a man dies in one of these convulsions, the proximate cause of death is frequently asphyxia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mean suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Precisely, from the air not entering the lungs, or from spasm of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You do not call that asphyxia? It would produce similar appear-ances—death from spasm of the heart is often loosely described as death from asphyxia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with Dr. Copland that con<lb/>vulsions of the character you have described are sometimes recurrent? (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">objected to the form of the question, if the opinion of Dr. Copland was of importance, he might himself be examined; but it was not competent to counsel to obtain that opinion by an irregular question to another person.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD CAMPBELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that the question was irregular</hi>)—I have seen convulsions recur at very various intervals, sometimes at hours, in others days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon have you known a patient who has suffered from a violent paroxysm of such convulsions as you have described, regain his ease and comfort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, that is very varied; in a few minutes, or it may be hours—I should draw an inference as to the nature and character of the convulsion from the interval which elapsed between one convulsion and another—I should infer that it would depend upon some slight irritation in the brain, or the spinal cord—it sometimes happens when death takes place in a paroxysm of such convulsions, that upon <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination there is no trace of organic disease in the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known at all, or frequently, in persons not further advanced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140160"/>
               <p>in years than the age of twenty-eight, that there have been granules between the dura mater and the arachnoid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are not common at any age, that I am aware of—I do not know that any particular inference could be drawn from their appearance between the arachnoid and the dura mater of a man twenty eight years of age—it is not a very easy question to answer, whether they would lead me to any reasonable medical conjecture as to their cause and effect—they might or they might not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form any opinion with regard to the cause or the effect of such granules; say aye or no? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, my lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might they in your judgment produce any effect upon the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they might; there are preparations in museums where granules are found in the membranes of the spinal cord, in which the patients are said to have died from tetanus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether such granules, so situated, have been part of the symptoms of tetaniform convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have just stated that there are three preparations; I have not seen the cases, I have seen the prepare<lb/>tions, they are in the museum at St. Thomas's Hospital—in order to ascer<lb/>tain with satisfaction to myself, the nature and probable extent of injury from such granules, I should think it desirable that the spinal cord should be examined immediately after death—not the roost remote medical opinion of their effect could be formed from an examination so long as two or three months after death—I mean of their effect upon the spinal cord itself, more especially if the brain had been previously opened—independently of the appearance of granules between the dura mater and the arachnoid, I do not think it would be possible at that distance of time, viz., two or three months after death, to form any satisfactory judgment upon the general healthiness of the spinal cord—if there had been a large tumour, or some similar change, it might have been discovered, but neither softening nor induration of the minute structure of the cord could be detected—the minute nervous structure changes within a few days after death—in order to ascertain satis<lb/>factorily the condition of the minute structure, it sometimes requires the assistance of a glass or microscope—that is often required when the exami<lb/>nation takes place immediately after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you, in the course of your experience, had cases of traumatic tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have—it commonly begins by an attack of the jaw—I have had experience, by personal observation, of idiopathic tetanus in four cases, one of them was my own child—in three of those cases the symptoms com<lb/>menced with lock jaw, the fourth commenced in the body—the power of swal<lb/>lowing easily was retained to the last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any personal experience in cases of tetanus which you have known, or which you now know to have been produced by strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of two persons who have died from the poison of strychnia, within the last twelve months—I have seen the effects of an overdose of strychnia—I did not see the patients in either of those two cases, before death—I made the examination by order of the Coroner—it was by chemical analysis in both cases that I ascertained that the death had been caused by strychnia—I have my minutes of both those examinations here—in one case the examination was made forty<lb/>two hours after death, and in the other thirty hours—in the first case the body had not been opened when my examination commenced—I have here my written statement, which I made at the time—(<hi rend="italic">reads: "</hi> General surface not unnatural, no mark of violence nor of external injury of any kind, except an excoriation between the shoulders, produced by vesicatories applied</p>

               <p>shortly before death. On the anterior surface of both thighs the skin was pale, with a defined boundary, in other parts perfectly natural, with the usual amount of lividity in the back. The eyelids were partially open, the globes were flaccid, and the pupils dilated. The colour of the face rather livid; the expression of face distressed; edges of the lips and teeth dark from sordes, probably the result of dark mucus. Muscles of the trunk not in the least rigid, indeed they were soft, and the body could be bent in any direction; those of the hips and shoulder joints were not quite so flaccid, though they allowed these joints to be easily moved, while those of the head and neck, fore arms and legs were quite rigid, the fingers being flexed, and the feet were somewhat arched. All the muscles, when cut into, were found soft and dark in colour. Head, scalp, and bones not more vascular than usual Dura mater and other membranes exces<lb/>sively so; all the vessels of the pia mater enormously distended, with very dark fluid blood; upon the entire surface of the brain and cerebellum there was a considerable amount of bloody serum, particularly upon the upper surface, where in some places it looked almost like blood, probably occasioned by the rupture of some bloodvessels while removing the skull cap. Structure of cerebrum and cerebellum firm and natural as in health, except that it was far more vascular than usual; there was a large quantity of reddish serum in both ventricles. Spinal marrow, spinal veins, and those of the membranes of the cord very much congested; a large quantity of theacal fluid of a red colour. Medulla itself natural, except, perhaps, that the enlarged portion at the lower cervical portion, was rather softer than natural Chest; there was some bloody serum in the pericardium (about an ounce). Heart healthy, but soft and uncontracted; nearly empty, all the blood having pro<lb/>bably drained out from it, and the large vessels, through the sinuses of the skull (this having been first opened), and then the vertebral canal, during which the body was placed with the head hanging over the table. Bloody serum in the cavities of both pleurae, the membranes being stained of a dark hue. General structure of the lungs quite healthy, but enormously distended with dark fluid blood. Some of the air cells were ruptured, so that there was sufficient emphysema to prevent the lungs from collapsing. The lining membrane of the trachea and bronchi was covered with a layer of dark bloody mucus. It was the most congested and darkest I ever saw; it was literally dyed of a deep chocolate colour, which even pervaded the car<lb/>tilaginous rings of the trachea. All the thoracic viscera with their mem<lb/>branes were much congested, and the blood was everywhere dark and fluid. Abdomen and pelvis were, in structure, quite healthy. The stomach and duodenum were removed for analysis, but when opened were found to be quite healthy. The guts contained a large amount of faeces.") This is the second case that I referred to, in which the examination was made thirty hours after death (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>: "I saw the body about twelve hours after death. The muscles were then flaccid, so that the want of rigidity mentioned was not owing to any <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> change; besides, the weather was not very hot. The immediate cause of death was clearly asphyxia, as all the appearances in the body showed. A <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was made thirty hours after death. The body was well formed and plump, but very dirty, with considerable evidence of severe syphilitic disease. The left labrium was greatly swollen, ulcerated, and indurated. The mine escaped through a large ulcer in the vagina, which communicated with the neck of the bladder. Not more than the usual <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> discoloration was present, except about the face and neck, which were livid and bloated. There was much foam about the mouth and nostrils. There was scarcely any rigidity,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140162"/>
               <p>less than usual, in the lower extremities; none whatever in the upper arms, chest, or body; little in the thighs, hand, and feet, the legs and lower arms being somewhat rigid. On removal of the integuments, the muscles seemed to be very flaccid. The lungs were emphysematous, from rupture of air cells. The posterior part of the lower lobes was congested, and rather, but not ex-cessively œdematous; otherwise they were quite healthy. The bronchial tubes were filled with frothy mucus, as were the larynx and upper part of the trachea, the lining membrane of which was so congested as to be quite crim<lb/>son in colour. The small muscles of the larynx and glottis were more firmly contracted than those of any part of the body. There was no effusion into the pleuritic cavities or pericardium. The heart was perfectly flaccid, con-taining, on the right side, a large quantity of dark fluid blood, with some little soft pale fibrinous clots in the ventricle; on the left side, only some small quantity of dark soft coagulum. The structure of the heart was healthy. The stomach was distended with flatus, but containing not more than three ounces of a pale bluish green coloured thick gruelly fluid, without any appearance of other food. Near the larger end were some few spots of extravasation in the mucous membrane, which in other parts was pale and natural in texture. The small intestines, within and without, were pale, containing nothing except some bilious mucus and flatus. The large in-testines contained some small portion of excrementitions matter; but, like the small, they had in them little else than flatus. The spleen was large and dark from congestion. The liver and kidneys were natural The bladder was partly filled with natural urine, which escaped by an ulcer into the vagina. The uterus was enlarged, very dark, and congested, containing an ovum of about seven or eight weeks; ovaries very large, and in one a large corpus luteum. The vessels of the scalp, dura mater, and pia mater were much distended with dark fluid blood. Some serous effusion was present in vessels of the pia mater and upon the convolutions; none in the ventricles. The substance of both cerebrum and cerebellum was perfectly natural, except, perhaps, having more vascular points on being sliced. The medulla oblongata was firm and natural. The spinal veins were congested; the medulla spinalis itself was natural, except perhaps (but of this I am doubtful) rather softer than usual at the bulbous expansion about the seventh cervical vertebra; and there was some serum effused within the membranes of the spinal cord.") In both these instances the persons were females—in the former case the age was twenty-eight, I believe, and in the second near twenty—I should mention, in addition, that which was not mentioned at the time, and is not down in this copy, although it is in my original notes, that there was fluid in the membranes of the spinal cord—these are not my original notes—it was sent to the printer's, and altered without my correcting it—there are two or three mistakes in other parts, but not in the part I have read—that is correct—I gave it in evidence before the Coroner—I have seen a patient under the influence of strychnia poison, from accidentally taking an over-dose—I have seen more than one case in my practice where persons hare taken too large a dose—none of those cases have been fatal—there was one case in my own family, and two others—about one-sixth of a grain was the dose taken—that was in the case of a man of middle age—the symptoms came on a very few minutes after the ingestion of the poison—I had given it in solution—the patient was up and walking about when attacked—the symptoms were want of power of controlling the muscles, manifested by twitching and rigidity, with some cramp, more violent in the legs than any other part of the body—the twitching and rigidity was not very violent—it was not a severe case—the spasms were not very violent—they lasted for six hours</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140163"/>
               <p>before they entirely disappeared—during that six hours they were inter<lb/>mittent, at varied intervals; as the attack passed off the Intervals became longer—at first they were every two or three seconds—they were not combated by medical treatment—I do not know of any medical treat<lb/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had the patient taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One<lb/>sixth of a grain, as near as we could ascertain—I had prescribed one-twelfth of a grain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you describe the other case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The other case was very similar, so similar as not to need description—I had prescribed one-twelfth of a grain in that case, and the patient had taken about one-sixth—the symptoms were similar—those are all the cases in which I have had the opportunity of witnessing the action of strychnia poison in the living human body—I have experimented upon upwards of sixty animals with strychnia poison, dogs, cats, rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, frogs, and toads—there is a great general resemblance in all animals under its influence—some are much more susceptible to its action than others, and bear a very much less dose than others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after the ingestion of the poison, generally speaking, has its action made its appearance by symptoms in the animal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From two minutes to thirty—more generally about five or six—where the poison has not been administered in a solution, the usual interval between the ingestion and the paroxysms has been about five minutes—I occasionally administered it in solution, but more generally in the solid state; sometimes placed dry on the back part of the tongue, and some fluid poured down the throat, sometimes enclosed between two portions of meat, sometimes mixed up with butter or suet, and sometimes rolled in a small piece of the gut of an animal; and in frogs and toads it was given by the skin, putting them into a solution of it—I have also applied it direct to the spinal cord, and in other cases to the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has been the first symptom of the animal having come under the influence of the strychnia poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A desire to be quite still, hurried breathing, slavering of the mouth, only when given at the mouth, and then twitching of the ears, trembling of the muscles, and inability to walk, convulsions of all the muscles of the body, the jaw generally firmly closed during the convulsions; convulsions followed by a total want of power in the muscles, which, on the least touch, are thrown into violent spasms, with a galvanic-like shock; that also occurs if the animal attempts of itself to move, of its own volition; the spasms come on if the animal is either forced or touched, or attempts voluntarily to move—that is the usual course—occasionally the animal is able to move without a recurrence of the spasm—the spasms recur at various periods until the animal dies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Increasing in violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not always—the animal dies in various periods, up to three hours and a half, which is the longest period at which I have known an animal die—in cases where they lived for any great length of time, the violent convulsions recur at less frequent intervals—in every case, immediately before death, the rigidity ceases; I do not know an exception to that, and the muscles are quite soft and powerless; flaccid; the limbs may be put in any position whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Being put in any position, does the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis come</hi> on quicker or slower than in ordinary cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there is little difference after all convulsive deaths—I observed the same where I have destroyed animals by hydrocyanic acid, chloroform, and other substances, which produce similar convulsions.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140164"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the rigidity after death from strychnia, what has been the extent of the rigidity as compared with the rigidity when destroyed by other chemical agents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there is very little difference—in the cases of the two women, it was much less than usual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean much less than common where death is by natural disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned some slight symptoms; a desire to be quiet, slavering at the mouth, and twitching at the ears, which preceded the convulsions. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the violent convulsions—those symptoms occurred in the order in which I have named them—that has been at varying intervals before the convulsions—I have known fatal cases of animals poisoned by strychnia in which there has been a considerable interval between the first paroxysm and the second; I have just stated that; about half an hour, I should think, but that is not common—I have examined the bodies of upwards of forty animals which have been killed by strychnia—I have invariably found the heart full on the right side, very generally the left ventricle firmly contracted; the blood usually dark and often fluid—there is no particular appearance attached to the spine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you experimented largely with other poisons producing sudden death on animals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Largely is a comparative term, I may perhaps say I have—I perhaps have experimented upon upwards of 2,000 animals—I have for many years devoted much attention and study to the effect of poisons—I have published two essays on the subject—in the case of the sudden death of an animal by poison the blood is very often fluid after death, but not invariably by any means—it is frequently fluid, but I do not think it is to be depended on at all; it varies with the nature of the poison—it happens in cases of sudden death from other causes—I have attended to the evidence that has been given as to the symptoms of Mr. Cook on the Monday and Tuesday nights, and on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you assume the symptoms to have been on the Sunday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A state of great excitement; that Cook described himself to have been very ill; that he was in a state of great excitement; and in such a condition that he considered himself mad for two minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember also what he was sworn to have stated as to what he imagined to be the cause of the excitement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was about to add that; that there had been some noise in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, adverting to the symptoms described on those three occasions here in Court, is it your opinion that they could have been produced by the poison of strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do not resemble what I have seen follow—he had more power of voluntary motion than I have observed in animals poisoned by strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does this include the Sunday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It seems to me that you have no direct evidence, except his own statement, what his symptoms were on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then confine your evidence to the Monday and Tuesday; you say he had more power of voluntary motion than you have observed generally in animals under the effects of the poison; to what symptoms of the existence of that power do you refer in the evidence you have heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sitting up in bed, moving his hands about freely, swallowing, talking, and asking to be rubbed and moved—I believe that completes the symptoms which satisfy me that there was a greater power of voluntary motion—and this case also varies from those I have observed in animals in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140165"/>
               <p>the sudden accession of the convulsions without the usual premonitory symptoms, and in the greater length of time which occurred from the taking of the pills which were supposed to contain the strychnia, which is so much greater than any period that has occurred in my experience—no other particular difference in the symptoms before death at present occurs to me; the screaming and the vomiting I should mention—I have never seen an animal vomit after taking strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Nor scream? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nor scream, as a voluntary scream, using the scream as an expression of voluntary noise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any medical reason that occurs to you why the patient should not vomit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> apprehend where there is so much spasm of the parts, there is an inability to vomit, and cases are related where attempts at vomiting have been made, and they could not succeed—I have a case which is related in the 10th volume of the "Journal de Pharmacie," in which attempts were made to give emetics, without success—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> observations which I have made upon the bodies of animals poisoned by strychnia, and the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances of Mr. Cook's body differ materially in the particulars I have mentioned—the heart is stated to have been empty and contracted, flabby I think, the state of the lungs not congested, and the state of the brain not congested—there is no other differ<lb/>ence that occurs to me—in the cases of the animals upon which I expe<lb/>rimented, where the paroxysms have recurred, the course of the subsiding of the paroxysms has been gradual—I have never known the case of a severe paroxysm recovered from, and then a long interval of complete repose for several hours; I have stated for half an hour, in an animal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you also experimented upon the bodies of animals poisoned by strychnia, with a view of discovering the strychnia poison in the body, the body being in various stages of fermentation and decomposition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have, from a few hours after death, at varying periods up to the forty<lb/>third day, the body being quite putrid in the latter cases—I have not failed in any one case to discover the poison by the tests which I have applied—I could not say the number of cases in which I have experimented for that purpose, but in many cases, fifteen perhaps—I cannot say to a few, more or less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have died under the immediate effects of strychnia poison in the first paroxysm after its administration, and his stomach to have been taken out and pnt into a jar on the sixth day after death, in your opinion must strychnia have been found in the body upon proper chemical analysis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If it were there—if I am to assume that he died of it, I say yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person had died in the first paroxysm of strychnia, and his stomach to have been taken out and put in a jar on the sixth day after his death, in your opinion the poison—? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ought to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What tests would you use to detect the poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Extract it first from the other matters with which it was mixed, endea<lb/>vour to obtain it separate; I should place the contents in water acidulated with acid, boil it for a short time, and filter, neutralize with an alkali, potass or lime, evaporate, and dissolve the residue after evaporation with spirit or ether—I am stating the process which we did follow, dissolve with alcohol, evaporate the alcoholic extract to the consistency of a thick syrup, and I should then have the strychnia in a state to apply the tests—if it is common commercial strychnia, such as is almost invariably found in use among medical men and druggists, one test is nitric acid, which gives a red</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140166"/>
               <p>colour, which in a great measure disappears upon the addition of protochlorids of tin; if the strychnia be pure, it does not undergo any change on the addition of sulphuric acid; but upon the addition to this mixture of bichro<lb/>mate of potass, and several other substances, it produces a beautiful purple, which changes through varying shades till it gets to be a dirty red—there are several other tests, but that I think is sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, adverting to the statement about putting the stomach into the jar; taking it that the stomach was put into the jar on the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and brought up to London, and then immediately sub<lb/>mitted to experiment; in your judgment was that in an unfavourable, or in a favourable condition for ascertaining, aye or no, whether strychnia was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would give a little more trouble, I do not see anything else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you think it was not in an unfavourable state for exa<lb/>mination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would give more trouble, but not affect the result otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing, four days later, the liver, the spleen, and the kidneys, had been placed in another jar, and sent up, and forthwith examined, in your judgment, if the person had died of strychnia poison, ought it to have been discovered in those parts of the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have seen strychnia discovered in the corresponding portions of the system of animals killed by strychnia—I have seen it done by other analysts—I have also seen it detected in the blood—I have not done it, I saw it done by Mr. Herepath, of Bristol—I do not think that an analysis would bt defeated or confused by the existence in the stomach of any other substance which would produce the same colours—the existence of pyroxanthine or salacine in the stomach, or in the other parts examined, would not defeat the experiment—pyroxanthine is about the most unlikely substance to exist in the stomach of an animal—it is one of the rarest and most difficult sub<lb/>stances to be obtained, even by chemists—the distinction between pyroxan<lb/>thine and strychnia is quite evident and distinct—in order to detect pyro<lb/>xanthine it is not necessary to apply bichromate of potass—pyroxanthine changes to a deep purple on the addition of sulphuric acid alone, and on the addition of the bichromate of potass the colour is spoilt; whereas in strych<lb/>nia, upon the addition of sulphuric acid no change is produced; it requires the addition of the bichromate to induce the colour—I have the substance in my pockets—supposing death to have been caused by a dose of strychnia poison, sufficient, but not more than sufficient, to destroy an animal, in my judgment, it would not be so decomposed by the process of absorption as that I should not be able to detect it by those tests, in some portion of the system—if death were produced by a minimum dose of strychnia, I believe there would be no decomposition that would prevent the discovery of it—that question has been a matter of consideration to me previously to this trial—I know that it has been a question with some toxicologists.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it a question upon which toxicologists have formed different opinions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe they have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you studied the question sufficiently to be able to state sufficient reasons for thinking that a minimum dose, after having done its work, continues as strychnia in the system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Reasons which are sufficient to my mind—I believe the illustration given was, that as food undergoes a change on its being taken into the body, so did this substance—that is the argument of those who have expressed an opinion upon it—I say there is no analogy; the change in food takes place during digestion, and, consequently, its elements are not found in the blood; at least the sub<lb/>stances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140167"/>
               <p>stances; or if change does not take place, then they remain unchanged in the blood—these substances or alkaloids are absorbed without digestion, and may be obtained unchanged from the blood; but those substances may be administered in various ways—in my judgment, no amount of putrefac<lb/>tion, within reasonable bounds, would prevent the discovery of the strychnia—to say that strychnia was absolutely indestructible would not be correct, bat within the ordinary bounds of decomposition strychnia is a fixed sub<lb/>stance; I have found it after forty-three days—I should imagine that the more empty the stomach the quicker would be the action of the strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you are the lecturer on surgery at the school at Leeds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mr. Morley, the gentleman called for the prosecution, is the lecturer on chemistry—part of the experiments on these sixty animals I have spoken of, were made by Mr. Morley and myself jointly; not the greater party perhaps half of them might be—the general result was the same in those cases in which I experimented alone—the experiments upon the sixty animals has been spread over a period of thirty years—the experiments that I made in common with Mr. Morley have been made partly since the Leeds case that has been so frequently referred to, and part of them were made before that, in a case with which Mr. Morley had nothing to do—that was not in regard to this case, but in reference to the case which has been so frequently referred to—a great number of experiments were made conjointly—there were others that I made alone, both before and since—some of them were made in reference to this case, others certainly not—it would be difficult to say how many I have made with reference to this case—allow me to say, that I am engaged in the case that occurred at Leeds, and a great many of those experiments were made with reference to that case—I cannot say how many experi<lb/>ments I have made with reference to this particular case—I cannot give any notion—I have made a few in reference particularly to this case, but the great bulk certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were you first concerned in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About the period of the death of the person whose case has been so frequently referred to—I was applied to on the part of the defence, in correspondence—I believe it began in this way, that the published case which I have read was forwarded to Mr. Smith, the prisoner's attorney—it was forwarded by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give it voluntarily? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called his attention to it—it was the first case, die second in the order in which your Lordship has taken it down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the case that we have all agreed to make an anonymous one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that case—I cannot be sure whether that case had then occurred or mot—in the various experiments that I have made the general dose that has been given has been from half a grain to two grains—I have found half a grain sufficient to destroy life in the larger animals on which I have experimented—I have seen both a dog and a cat die from half a grain; not always, I mentioned that some animals were more susceptible than others—that applies to animals of different species; some animals, as a species, are more susceptible than others; and in individuals of the same species some are more susceptible than others, but there is a greater differ<lb/>ence between the species.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned that the symptoms have generally shown themselves in from two to thirty minutes; Mr. Morley told us from a few minutes to less than an hour: will you undertake to say that there have not been cases in which the first appearance of the symptoms have not been delayed an hour?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140168"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I say there have not been, that I have seen—I have known instance in which I have had to repeat the dose of poison—that is when the dose has not been sufficient to kill; but you say to produce symptoms, there is a wide difference—I have given it three times before killing—I gave half a grain each time—that was to a cat—it is very probable that the periods at which I gave the three doses were 34 minutes past 5, 10 minutes past 6, and 35 minutes past 6 o'clock, making, on the whole, two grains—I cannot be sure whether it wy so or not, I think it is very probable—there is no statement that symptoms were not shown; there were symptoms shown, certainly; the symptoms of spasms, but the animal did not die, and I had to repeat the dose—the cat did not swallow those doses—I think I have found other animals of the same cat species killed by it, young ones, but by no means uniformly old ones—with cats in general half a grain is the minimum dose—I think half a grain would be a small dose to kill an old strong cat, in the solid state—I am not sure whether a smaller dose will suffice in the fluid—it is probable, but I am speaking now of my own experience—I have stated already that it is my experience that when given in the fluid state a smaller dose will suffice—you may assume that hard breathing is among the first symptoms that show themselves, then comes twitching, an indisposition to move, then generally some slavering of the mouth, then twitching, then trembling of the muscles, and then usually convulsions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What I want to know is, whether these symptoms make their appear<lb/>ance in all animals of the same species, or whether there ia diversity in the intervals at which they present themselves, and in the order in which they present themselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would not swear that that may not occur, but such is the result of my observations as the rule—I mean that they certainly do not occur at uniform periods of time—in describing them I should say that they occurred in the same order—I would not say there are not exceptions, there may be—I have not observed considerable variation in the order, I have in the time—when the convulsions have once set in, I have found some differ<lb/>ence as to the periods at which these convulsions take place, with greater or less intervals—I have also found considerable variety in this, that one animal will undergo a succession of these attacks before it dies, and that another will die after a much less amount of convulsion—it seldom dies after one, generally four or five, and often a great many more—I have known one or two instances in which the animals have died after one convulsion—that has been where the death has followed from a dose equal in quantity to some other quantity which has not produced the same effect—the order in which the muscles of the body and limbs are convulsed, varies to some extent in violence—I think the limbs are generally affected first, that is the general rule; very often both together—where they are not simultaneous, the twitching of the extremities generally precedes, but I doubt whether that if not rather the result of their being more easily observed than the muscles of the trunk—the violent convulsions generally occur together—I do not think there is any difference with regard to the rigidity that I have men<lb/>tioned as occurring after death, I think it is not greater than is due to the ordinary <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have known of no instance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known instances in which the muscles of these animals have been very rigid, but I have known instances in which the animals, having died from different effects, have been equally rigid—I mean to state I do not think there is any peculiar rigidity induced by strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If that be not so in the animal, how was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140169"/>
               <p>it that in the two instances where you found death from strychnia in the human subject, you found an undue rigidity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mentioned that there was considerably less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the lady whose case we do not name, was it not the fact there, that, although the muscles of the body were flexible, the hands were in<lb/>curved and the feet decidedly arched by muscular contraction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than is usual in death from ordinary causes—I have said that the hands were incurved and the feet decidedly arched by muscular contraction—I mean no more than is due to the ordinary <hi rend="italic">riyor</hi> of death—by muscular contraction I mean that they were rigid—I mean to say that I meant no more than was due to the ordinary rigidity of death, and I stated so at the time; not in the report that I signed, but in conversation with the parties who were engaged—the report was a statement of a fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You meant to describe the common <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis? A.</hi> Yes—it is stated in the former part of the report that the other muscles of the body were less so—I merely meant it to be understood that there was a distinction between the two portions of the body—a statement of that fact, but nothing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Morley stated here the other day, that in the experiments he made with you on animals killed by this poison, that after death there was an interval of flaccidity, and that after this, rigidity commenced, more than if it had been occasioned by the usual <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi>; you do not agree with him as to that statement of fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—it is a difference of opinion entirely—I have said that I have generally found the heart full, the right side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the fact of the heart having been found empty in this case lead you to the conclusion that it was not a death by strychnia poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Amongst other things—I heard the evidence given here the other day of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of Agnes French or Sennet, who died in the Glasgow Hospital—I heard it stated "that the heart was distended, stiff, and empty"—I believe I was in court when the gentleman who con<lb/>ducted it gave his evidence of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of Mrs. Smith, who died from the unfortunate administration of strychnia—if he stated that the heart was perfectly empty I should have heard him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the fact in those two cases, where the death was undoubtedly from strychnia, of the heart having been found empty, exercise any influence on your judgment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not unless I knew how the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was made—if the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> was commenced in the head, the explanation was given by Mr. Morley and myself—in the case at Leeds, we had no doubt of the heart being full, but the blood being fluid, and the head being first removed, the large vessels are necessarily opened—the consequence is that the blood, by mere natural physical causes, drains away—I am not aware how the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was made in this particular case of Mr. Cook—I beg pardon, the chest and abdomen were opened before the head; it was stated so, and therefore if there were blood in the heart it ought to be there—the head was not opened there in the first instance—that is my explanation of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would occasion, in your opinion, the contraction of the heart in Mr. Cook's case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The heart, if empty, is usually contracted—it is like other muscles, if the other muscles are contracted that will contract—if it be empty, and there is nothing to oppose its contraction, it will contract—I cannot account, from the appearances of the body after death, for the emp<lb/>tiness of the heart, any more than it might be the usual effect of death—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140170"/>
               <p>varies very much, but as a general rule in <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations we find, if the heart is empty it is contracted—the heart is a circular sac<lb/>like muscle, and if there is nothing to distend it, it contracts—I do not say that in all cases that I have examined of strychnia poison the blood was fluid—in the great majority of instances it is so—suppose there is blood in the heart at the time of death it would not contract, it would be flabby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Therefore, if you find a heart contracted after death, it shows that that heart was in a contracted state at the moment of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then must be a distinction made, which is very frequently not made, between the two cavities of the heart—it is a very common thing to find the left ventricle contracted and hard, and the right flabby and uncontracted—it is very often spoken of, that is death by asphyxia—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances of Cook's body, which I say differ materially from those I have seen after death from strychnia, were the emptiness of the heart, the state of the lungs, and the want of congestion in the brain—the lungs are described as not being con<lb/>gested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you attach any importance to the emphysema? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Emphysema is of two kinds, one of them consists in a dilatation of the air cells, the other is a rupture by which the air, not being in the cells, passes amongst them—I inferred, from the description given, that it was not from the rupture of the cells here—I have found emphysema in the case of animals that hare died from strychnia—it has always been from rupture of the cells—it could be in no other way there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is there in the statement of the witnesses which makes you think this was emphysema of the other sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We are told that there was during life a diseased condition of the lungs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am speaking of the appearance of the lungs after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I must put the whole together—who was to be asked what the character of the em<lb/>physema was?—the witnesses who made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination were examined—if the question had been put to them they might or might not have been able to answer it—I have not been sitting here advising counsel throughout the case—while Dr. Harland was being examined I might have been—it did occur to me that it was proper to ask him what was the nature of it—I did not ask to have that question put because a question was an<lb/>swered which was sufficient to my mind to show that disease existed—the question was put, as to disease of the lungs, to Dr. Savage—it did not occur to me when Dr. Harland was examined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told us the various symptoms about this gentleman, from which you gather that he was of a delicate constitution; to which of them do you ascribe these convulsions of which he died? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to any—I stated that the fact of his having syphilis was an important ingredient in my mind—but you ask as to convulsions—I admit that he died from convulsions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were carried through a long detail of the various ailments under which this unfortunate man suffered, and you say that those would, at all events, predispose him to convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—that is what I say—I mean the whole; the combination of them in a delicate man—amongst others I mentioned excitement and depression of spirits—the evidence of that is that he was three minutes after the winning of the race by his horse in which he could not speak—it was stated by Mr. Jones that he was subject to depression of spirits—mental depression I understood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you find any mental depression, from the time of the Shrews<lb/>bury races to the time of his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a good deal of bodily depression.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140171"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you expect excitement to produce its effects recently after its existence, or after it had totally subsided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may induce that state of brain in which convulsions may follow at some distance—I do not find from the evidence that the brain watt perfectly healthy—Mr. Bamford said it was not—I judge from the evidence stated at the inquest itself as put in the depositions, I mean to say that in that condition of brain and system I believe it to be quite possible that convulsions might come on and destroy a person, and leave no trace—I do not believe this man died of apoplexy—you must bear in mind he had taken doses of morphia—I do not ascribe has death to morphia, except that it might assist in the coming on of the convulsive attack, and there might he changes in the spinal marrow; I do not mean changes brought about by the morphia—I should think morphia was not very good treatment in the state he was in then; I mean in the state of excitement—I do not mean to say that there was excitement at Rugeley, but morphia, where there is sick<lb/>ness, will often disagree with the patient when there is an irritable state of the brain—there is no evidence of an irritable state of the brain at Rugeley—I object to morphia, because sickness is very often one of the symptoms indicative of there being an irritable state of the brain without there being delirium, and from what he said himself, he must have either been delirious on the Sunday night, or he must have had some attack similar to what he had afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to represent that you believe, on your solemn oath, that he had convulsions on the Sunday the same as he had on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say what he had—I do not believe he had—I do not believe he had not—in my opinion, the attack of the Sunday night was of less intensity than the attack on the Monday night, but, I think, very probably of the same character—I do not believe there'were convulsions on the Sunday—he died of convulsions—I say they were of the same character, but not of the same intensity—I believe he had convulsions on the Sunday, to a certain extent, but less in intensity—there was a stateof great mental and bodily excite<lb/>ment—I do not believe they were convulsions, but a state that very often precedes convulsions—I admit that if a man has been put to sleep under the influence of morphia, and he is suddenly disturbed by a noise, it is likely to have a depressing effect upon him; but there is no proof that there was a noise except his own statement—it is part of my opinion, that he did not state what had occurred accurately—I do not mean to say that he did not state truly, but that he was mistaken—that is one of the symptoms we often find—I believe the man to have been delirious then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be so good as to tell me what are those forms of convulsions of which you gave some statement to my friend, which will produce convulsions of a tetanic form? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Any intestinal irritation will produce it—it may end in death—I have seen instances in children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am not speaking of children; what convulsions are there which are attended with tetaniform symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Any convulsions, if by tetaniform you mean an outstretching of the limbs—I have known convulsions ending in death accompanied with tetaniform symptoms, in children—I have never had a case of such forms of convulsions producing death, in an adult—the general statement of all writers is, that such cases do occur—my medical nomenclature will not furnish me with a name for it, except convulsions, convulsive diseases—I have never known or read of a case of convulsive disease of that nature, terminating in death, in which the patient was conscious to the last—I have seen it stated so, but I have never met with such a case—in epilepsy you sometimes have those tetaniform symptoms—where</p>

               <p>epilepsy terminates in death consciousness is gone, so far as my experience goes—I have had four cases of idiopathic tetanus, and some five or six, perhaps, of traumatic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be so good as to attend to what I am about to read to you, which is the statement of Mr. Jones of the symptoms under which Cook suffered from the coming on of the paroxysms: "Directly he bad swallowed the two pills he uttered loud screams, threw himself back on the bed, and was dreadfully convulsed; he said, 'Raise me up; I shall be suffocated!' that was at the commencement of the convulsions, which lasted five or ten minutes; the convulsions affected every muscle of the body, and were accompanied by stiffening of the limbs; I endeavoured to raise him with the assistance of Palmer, but found it quite impossible, owing to the rigidity of the limbs; when he found we could not raise him up, he asked me to turn him over on his side; I listened to the action of the heart; I found it gradually sinking," and so on; and he adds, "When he threw himself back on the bed he clenched his hands, and they remained clenched after death;" then, after another passage which I won't for the moment dwell upon, he says, "After death his body was so twisted or bowed, that if I had placed it on the back it would have rested on the head and feet; that twisting or bowing I first observed when Cook threw himself back on the bed."Now, I ask you to distinguish any one circumstance as regards the symptoms of convulsion and the stiffening of the limbs in real tetanus, traumatic or idiopathic, which differs from the description that I have just read to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is not tetanus at all—I do not think it is tetanus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you to distinguish it in any one single particular? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Let me clearly understand the question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have read to you the description of Cook's symptoms as witnessed by Mr. Jones; I ask you to point out any distinction between those symptoms and the symptoms of tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Do you mean the one paroxysm of tetanus, or the representation of the disease which is called tetanus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am speaking of the paroxysm of tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then it is very like a paroxysm of tetanus.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What you just now said was, "This is not tetanus at all." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as a disease, that is what I say—not traumatic or idiopathic tetanus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want you to point out any distinction between the symptoms which accompany the paroxysms of real tetanus, and those? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that there is any distinction—the symptoms that have been read to me are symptoms of one portion of tetanus, one con<lb/>vulsive attack, as far as they go, but that is different from the symptoms of tetanus as a disease—I only wish not to misrepresent—I was about to say I never saw a case of tetanus in which the rigidity continued at the time of death and afterwards—the symptoms of the paroxysms of the convulsions are not distinguishable from those of tetanus, nor from many other convul<lb/>sive diseases at the moment of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as they go, do they coincide with the symptoms of tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the moment of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Observe, that you have here consciousness to the last; that before the man dies he says "Turn me over;" and as soon as they turn him over he dies: tell me of any case you know of from your experience or reading, in which death has ensued from convulsions, where the patient was conscious to the last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already said I do not know I of such a case—the convulsions that take place after an administration of strychnia are very properly called tetanic.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140173"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with Sir Benjamin Brodie, that the symptoms in the convulsions arising after strychnia, are of the same character while they last as the symptoms in traumatic or idiopathic tetanus, and that the distinction between the two consists in the course in which the symptoms run? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there is a difference, I think the hands are less violently contracted in affections of ordinary tetanus, and that the whole effect of the spasm is less in ordinary tetanus than in tetanus from strychnia—I think in tetanus from strychnia the hands are more firmly and tightly closed—I do not agree with Sir Benjamin Brodie in other respects, that the difference is in the course that the symptoms run—there is another difference, that in ordinary tetanus the convulsions never entirely pass away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe, from your frequent observation of the symptoms from strych<lb/>nia, you felt perfectly prepared, in the case at Leeds, upon the description of the symptoms, to come to the determined opinion that it was a death from strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought it probable and possible, but did not come to a determined opinion—I expressed an opinion—I said I had no doubt as to the cause of death; but that was after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I think that is in the deposition before the coroner, after the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and if you read correctly, you will find added," and the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances"—we had at that time ascertained that it was from strychnia—we had discovered the strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me ask you if this is your view of the symptoms of strychnia as distinguished from the symptoms of ordinary tetanus: "The symptoms described were not assignable to any other cause—tetanus in many respects resembles the symptoms under which" the party whose case was in question—"laboured; tetanus is a disease of days, strychnia of hours or minutes?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I stated,"tetanus is far less violent in its effects, and in the great majority of cases comes on after external injury; when it comes on, it comes on slowly, by degrees; it usually commences about the jaw, and hence it is anatomically called lockjaw; it is not usually accom<lb/>panied by the same convulsive twitching, and, I think, not by the same grasping of the hands, and the twitchings are not in the legs and feet—in strychnia they are the first symptoms, in tetanus the last—in tetanus, the hands, feet, and legs are the parts usually last affected—after strychnia, they are the parts first affected"—I stated that—I certainly do not mean to represent that this was a case of idiopathic tetanus, I never did, and you have heard nothing from me to infer that—nor do I think it was a case of tetanus in any sense of the word as usually applied, because it did not run the course of tetanus; it differed from it in the particulars I have already described, the very sudden accession of the convulsion, after the first rousing of Mr. Jones, his power of talking—that did not occur in the case which came particularly under my observation—I do not found my con<lb/>elusions upon that individual case, but I take it as an element in them—I heard it stated, that in the case of Mrs. Serjeantson Smith, that she talked, and asked to have her legs rubbed, that she was conscious to the last, and that she asked to have her legs rubbed just before she died—that shakes my faith—I heard it stated that before she died she said something, but what the words were I don't remember—I don't know that her last words were asking to be turned over, but I don't dispute it, if you say so—the asking to have the neck rubbed in this case was a premonitory symptom of some convulsive affection—I believe I have stated already that in poisoning by strychnia the symptoms are usually first developed in the legs and feet—I have said that an animal first begins to feel twitching in the ears—before</p>

               <p>the convulsion came on Mr. Cook had stiffness in the muscles of the neck and jaw, and begged to have his neck rubbed; they might be premonitory symptoms of that or any thing else—difficulty of breathing is one of the pre<lb/>monitory symptoms—the first thing a person does who feels a difficulty of breathing is to sit up in bed—I know that Mr. Cook complained of stiffness about the neck and asked to have it rubbed, and so far as my experience goes in animals, in no one single instance could the animal bear to be touched, and it was evidently most painful for the animal to be touched—I have heard that Mrs. Smith asked to have her legs and arms straightened—it ig not stated that it gave her pain to have that done—I have not found that the pain upon touch was after the paroxysms had once set in—I have seen the paroxysm brought on by it; not in all cases, because the animal is not always touched—where it is touched the twitching comes on more violently; and you must allow me to add, that in the Leeds case, the lady for two hours, when she could speak, begged them not to touch her—it was when the attack was mild that she begged to be rubbed, not dur<lb/>ing the fatal attack; it was not before the paroxysm had set in—she asked her husband to rub her feet and legs; that was just before the convulsions came on—after they commenced she could not bear it, because it caused a recurrence—I do not think it was in consequence of the twitching that she asked to have her legs rubbed—I think not, it was decidedly stated by all the witnesses there that she begged that she might not be touched—I think that Mr. Cook's case also differs from death by strychnia in this, that there was the power of swallowing so lately—that arises from inability to move the jaw—I have never seen an instance of tetanus from strychnia in which lockjaw did not make its appearance—I have stated in the Leeds ease that it was the last symptom, but in other experiments I have made on animals, I have not seen it—I do not deny that it may be so—I am speaking as a general rule—I think it is quite possible it may—I am speaking of the general result of my observations in the Leeds case—it came on very early, more than two hours before death—the paroxysms in that case continued for two hours and a half before death—I am speaking from memory—in that case we suppose there had been doses of strychnia four times repeated—I have not experimented upon the tissues, or upon the blood, I have seen it done—I first saw it done the day before yesterday—I have been in town several days—I thought it pro<lb/>bable that this poison could be extracted by chemical process from the tissues—I never tried it—I saw Mr. Herapath experiment upon one case in that way—in that case the animal was killed by a dose of strychnia given by the mouth—I am not sure whether it was in fluid—I cannot recollect, or I would state it at once—two animals were killed at the same time, one by a solution, and the other by a solid; I think the quantity given was half a grain, but I did not make the experiment—a dog and a cat were killed at the same time—in the Leeds case there was strychnia enough given to poi<lb/>son four animals afterwards with the contents of the stomach—I have stated that I succeeded in every case where I tried experiments in finding the strychnia—I think I am correct, for I have the original minute—Mr. Morley did not differ with me as to the strychnia being found in two cases; in one he did, but I will explain that; there was not in reality a difference of opinion between us, it was a mistake; we divided the portion that we found in the stomach into two portions; we adopted two different processes for ex<lb/>tracting it, and by the one process we were both rather doubtful whether we detected it; but by the other process we were quite certain that it was detected—one of the processes failed, and the other succeeded—I do not</p>

               <p>know that there was another case in which we differed, in which I thought I found it, and he thought he did not—I have no recollection of it—I do not know that Mr. Morley, throughout the experiments, had been doubtful as to the result, certainly not—Mr. Morley stated differently in his own ex<lb/>amination here, and if you refer to it you will find it, except in one cast, and that Is the explanation which I give of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I an Professor of Chemistry and Toxicology at the Bristol Medical School—I have been occupied with chemistry forty years, and toxicology probably thirty years—I have experimented on the poison of strychnia—I have not seen a case in the human subject; I pre<lb/>sume you allude to the symptoms—I am not a medical practitioner, I am an analytical chemist—I have seen a human body after strychnia has been taken, where death has occurred from strychnia—in one case I had the contents of the stomach—in that one case I examined the contents of the stomach for strychnia only in the simple state—I recognised it in that case by a chemical test—I discovered it in the contents of the stomach—that must have been about three days after death—the tests by which I ultimately recognized it were sulphuric acid and bi-chromate of potassia; sulphuric acid and puce-coloured oxide of lead; sulphuric acid and per-oxide of manganese—those are separate tests, that is the third which I am now giving—a fourth test is sulphuric acid and red ferri-cyanide of potassium—red prussiate of potash it is sometimes called—the puce-eoloured oxide of lead is the highest oxide—the other oxides would not succeed—those are all colour tests—they all produce a purple colour with strychnine if it is present, which purple passes to red—there is another class of tests which produce another set of colours with common or impure strychnia, but not with pure strychnia—my process, previous to applying the test, is to get the strychnia separated from the solution—the principle which has bees pointed out here was originally proposed by Orfila with sulphuric acid-then to evaporate and then to dissolve by some solvent—in the case of the human subject we make evident the existence of strychnia by the colour tests—I have experimented on animals which have taken strychnia, not to a large extent, but sufficient to establish the principle—I have witnessed experiments to the extent of, I should say, perhaps, eight, or nine, or ten—I have not analysed all of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many cases have you analysed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two which I destroyed myself—each of those were cats—I gave one grain of strychnia in the solid form—I could not get the animal to take the strychnia, and I left it in some meat at night, when I went to bed, and I found the animal dead in the morning; the body was dreadfully contorted, extremely rigid, the four limbs extended, the head turned round, not to the back but to the side, the eyes protruded and staring, the iris expanded, so as to be almost invisible.</p>

               <p>also, a second case in which I discovered strychnia—that also was a cat—I gave it the same quantity in a solid form in food.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. How soon afterwards did the animal die? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I watched it for three hours, for after this it had a second spasm—the first lasted about a minute or two—a frothy saliva was dribbling from its mouth, and it forcibly ejected it's urine—it had a second spasm in a few minutes after, when I thought the animal would die, but it soon recovered itself, and then remained quiet, at least still, with the exception of a trembling all over—it continued in that state until I went to bed—that was about three hours—during two hours and a half or nearly so the animal was in a peculiar state—touching it appeared to electrify it all through—even blowing on it produced the same effect; even touching the basket—the slightest thing which would affect the animal produced a galvanic jump, such as when the electric stream is passed through an animal, or a shock—I left it at the end of three hours, thinking that it would recover, but in the morning I found it dead, in the same indurated and contorted condition that the former animal was found in—in thirty<lb/>six hours I proceeded to my chemical examination—I found strychnia in the urine, in the stomach and upper intestines, in the liver, and in the blood of the heart—I detected it in that case by the same test, but I took extraordinary precautions to get rid of organic matter—in all the cases where I have made a chemical analysis when strychnia has been taken, it has been successful, and not only strychnia, but in cases where nux vornica has been taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In all the cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about nine; I have found nux vomica in a fox and in dogs—that does not present exactly the same ap<lb/>pearances—all the strychnia is found as nux vomica and I have found it where nux vomica has been taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that the nux vomica is rather more diffi<lb/>cult to detect than strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mean to say that it is rather more complicated, because you have the vegetable matter of the nut—I mean to say that I have found strychnia when strychnia has been taken, and the nux vomica when nux vomica has been taken—in one case the animal had been buried two months—I have experimented with stiychnia mixed up with organic matter out of a body; I mean purposely mixed up with the putrid remains of animals, and have detected strychnia in those cases—I took the putrid remains of animals which had been sent to me from the laboratory, mixed strychnia with it, and found it in all those cases, whatever was the state of decomposition—I am of opinion, as a chemist, that where strychnia has been taken in a sufficient dose, it ought to be detected by chemical science up to the time that the body is decomposed—I do not think putrefaction would decompose it completely—by decomposition mean when the body has become a dry powder—having heard the evidence as to the jar which was conveyed to Dr, Taylor, I am of opinion that the jar containing the stomach, as is now stated, in the state it then was, from</p>

I</hi> can show you some which I extracted from a dog—if the strychnia is perfectly free, I am certain that I could discover the fifty-thousandth part of a grain, that is, if it is unmixed with organic matter, because ten grains of that body is soluble in a gallon of cold water—I mean to say that I have dissolved it in a given quantity of water, and have ascertained that I can detect it—ten grains is soluble in seventy thou<lb/>sand—I can take the tenth part of a drop of that water and demonstrate the presence of strychnia, if it is perfectly free from organic matter—I do not go so far as to say that, if mixed with organic matter, I could separate it, and get the fifty-thousandth part of a grain—there is more difficulty the more organic matter there is present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bachelor of Medicine—I am also a Professor of Toxicology at the London Hospital, and Medical Officer of Health for the City of London—I have been engaged for a considerable time in the study of poisons and their action on the living animal economy—I have been engaged frequently on behalf of the Crown in prosecutions of this nature; I believe in every case that has been tried in this Court fertile last fourteen years, or if not every one, nearly every one—I have "been present in court during the examination of the medical witnesses on this trial, and have attended to the evidence that they gave—I have heard certain symptoms described as attending the death of Mr. Cook—I have witnessed many cases of death by poisoning from strychnia; many of the lower animals; and several cases of poisoning by nux vomica in the human subject, one of which was fatal—the symptoms that have attended the cases of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140180"/>
               <p>animals that I have seen, do not accord with the symptoms described in this case—in the first place, I have never witnessed such a long interval between the administration of the poison and the coming on of the symptoms, as was said to have elapsed in this case—after the administration of strychnia to animals, the longest interval that I have noticed for the symptoms to begin has been three quarters of an hour, and then the poison was administered under what may be called the most disadvantageous circumstances, in order to prolong the effect as much as possible—the disadvantageous circum<lb/>stances were, a very full stomach, and the poison given not in a form easy of solution; the animal was quite gorged—I have seen the symptoms begin in five minutes after the poison was administered—I will not say that I have seen hundreds, but I have seen dozens of cases of the administration of strychnia to the lower animals—a quarter of an hour is the average time that the symptoms begin after the poison is administered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any other particular besides the delay in the appearance of the symptoms which makes you conclude that this was not a case of strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in all animals I have seen, and in the human subject also, when under the influence of strychnia, the system has been in that irritable state, that the very slightest excitement, as an effort to move, a alight touch, a noise, or a breath of air, will set them off in convulsions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, let me assume a case: do you believe it possible that a person to whom a dose of strychnia has been given, could rise out of his bed and ring the bell violently? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot undertake to say what is possible, it is not at all probable—I do not think it probable that he could pull a bell violently—any movement at all would excite the muscular system, and therefore the nervous system, and there would be convulsions, there would be spasms—it is not likely that a person in that state of nervous irritation could bear to have his neck rubbed—where a case of poisoning by strychnia does not terminate fatally, the paroxysms, when they go off, are succeeded by other paroxysms, which gradually shade themselves off—they gradually become less and less, one paroxysm being less in violence than the other, over a period of some hours—my experience quite accords with what has been stated by Dr. Christison, that the paroxysms last over a period of six<lb/>teen or eighteen hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known of morphia or any antidote being given when those paroxysms have come on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have some antidote, the usual hospital practice—I will not say morphia, but patients have been re<lb/>ceived into the hospital under the influence of nux vomica, and we have watched the progress of a case, and antidotes have been administered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that there would not be an entire cessation of the spasms, but they would gradually go off during ten or twelve hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not hesitate to say, that of all poisons, either mineral or vegetable, strychnia is the most easy of detection after death—I have detected it in the stomach of animals in numerous instances—I have detected it in the blood and in the tissues—the longest period that I have examined a body after death, has been one month—the animal was in a state of decomposition—I have succeeded in detecting very minute portions of strychnia—when it is pure it can be detected in very small frac<lb/>tions of a grain, at least the twenty-thousandth part of a grain—when mixed up with matter it would be more difficult of detection, no doubt<lb/>still, I can detect the tenth part of a grain in a pint of any liquid that it may be put into—I have detected it in broth—I can detect it whether the liquid is pure or putrefied—I have detected it in a pint of the most putrid liquid that I could obtain, in which the tenth of a grain had been stand<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140181"/>
               <p>for two months—in the case of the animal which had been killed a month, and was in a state of decomposition, I gave it half a grain of strychnia, and I have the strychnia here within a fraction of what I gave—it was a rabbit—that half grain killed it—I lost about a tenth of a grain of strychnia in the course of the investigation—I operated on the whole of the liquid—supposing a person to have taken strychnia eight or ten days before his death, and a jar containing the stomach had been sent to me, I say positively that I could detect it—I have never failed—I have made <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations on those various animals which I have destroyed by strychnia, and have always found the right side of the heart full of blood—the physical reason of that is, that death takes place by the fixing of the muscles of the chest in spasm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it your opinion that it does so invariably? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive so; in my opinion it does, by the fixing of the muscles of the chest in spasm—at that time the blood is unable to pass through the lungs, and the heart cannot relieve itself of the blood which is flowing to it, it therefore becomes gorged with blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you observed any particular appearance about the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they are congested, filled with blood—I have admin<lb/>istered strychnia in a liquid and in a solid form—I may agree with the opinion of Dr. Taylor, that when strychnia is administered in a sort, of pill or bolus, it kills in a period of six or seven minutes, but I do not say that it always will do so—it may kill—if it is administered in a pill it may show itself in that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the first remarkable symptom you have noticed after the strychnia begins to operate on the animal: Dr. Taylor says that it falls on its side, do you agree with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When it is in spasm it falls on its side—the jaws are sometimes spasmodically closed—I have said that I agree with Dr. Taylor that the slightest noise or touch reproduces another con<lb/>vulaive paroxysm—I do not agree with him that the colouring tests for the discovery of strychnia are fallacious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say they always succeed with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dr. Taylor has given as a reason for the non<lb/>finding of the strychnia, that it is absorbed into the blood, and is no longer in the stomach is in a great part changed; do you agree with that theory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I agree with its absorption, but I do not agree with its being changed—I have examined the tissues of the body, and I have found strychnia; and my opinion is, that it is not changed so as not to be discoverable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the contents were put into a jar, and jumbled up with the intestines and a portion of the stomach, would that prevent the discovery of strychnia, if the person had died of strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would not—sup<lb/>posing that all the contents of the stomach were lost, I think the mucous membrane ought, in the ordinary course of things, to exhibit traces of strych<lb/>nia—I have also studied the poison of antimony—supposing a quantify of antimony were infused into some brandy and water, and it was drunk off at a sudden gulp, the immediate effect of that would not be to bum the throat, or anything of that kind—antimony, in point of fact, to my knowledge, does not possess any such quality as that of immediate burning; not tartar emetic; not that form of antimony—I have turned my attention to poisons, I suppose, for seventeen or eighteen years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY<lb/>GENEBAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you a member of the College of Physicians? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I am not—I am not a member of the College of Surgeons—I do not now carry on business in the medical line—I do not practice medically—I have done so, in general practice, that means</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140182"/>
               <p>every species of medical practice—I have not done so now for more than two or three years—the last case that I was employed in for the Crown, was some time ago—it was the case of Ann Merritt—it was in 1851—I gave evidence in that case of the presence of arsenic—the woman was convicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you state, in addition to the finding of the arsenic, your opinion that it had been administered as recently as within two hours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four hours—the sentence was not carried into effect, in consequence of my har<lb/>ing written a letter—I was the cause of her being respited—other scien<lb/>tific gentlemen interfered and challenged the soundness of my conclusions before I wrote any letter at all—I have been employed since on the part of prosecution, but I do not think by the Crown—there has not been a case that I know of since in this Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The whole question turned on the accuracy of the opinion as to bow recently the poison had been administered; you were the only scientific man examined in that case, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> was the only one that detected the poison—I had no doubt of it, and I still hold that opinion, and stated that in my letter—the question was put to me as to possibility—I said, "I cannot speak of possibilities, I adhere to the probability that the poison was given within four hours of death"—I cannot tell how many animals I have destroyed by means of strychnia, it has spread over a large number of years;. pretty well fifty, some recently; five within the last two months—I have never given more than a grain—I have administered it in these recent cases always in a solid form; sometimes made into a pill or mess with bread, and at other times put on the tongue of the animal—I am not sure it would operate sooner if put on the tongue, because it adheres some time to the mucous surface of the tongue, and does not get absorbed so soon, from the circumstance that there is no acid—a pill would have to be dissolved—still I think it would be shorter, because it gets into an acid, which is the more capable of dissolving it—in the case where I gave the poison under the disadvantageous circumstances, the dog had had a very hearty meal, and it was kneaded up into a hard mass with some bread, and it took three quarters of an hour before the action came on—I never allow them to eat it voluntarily; I always open their mouths and cast it into the stomach—there was one other animal which took about half-an hour before the action came on, but the poison was not given in sufficient quantity—that was given in a solid form, and it did not manifest any action, and we gave it another dost—the dose was half a grain; and we gave it another dose which acted within ten minutes—with regard to what was said by Mr. Nunneley, as to the pre<lb/>monitory symptoms, I have noticed the irritability of the animal before it has become convulsed—Mr. Nunneley talks of the ears being moved I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What he describes is this; first, a desire to be still, then a difficulty in breathing, a slavering of the mouth, twitching of the ears, trembling of the muscles, followed by convulsions; did you observe all these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say all of them in that order; there is an excitement manifested in the ani<lb/>mal, an indisposition to be touched, and trembling on being touched—I have noticed that the touching did occasion a tremulous action of the muscles—they have not come on in regular order—sometimes one set of symptoms in one animal and another in another, not much varied; but there are those little variations—after the convulsions have once commenced, there is an interval; then a breath, a sound, or a touch will cause a recurrence of the convulsive symptoms; that is, after they have been seized—that would not apply to a case where the animal died in the first paroxysm—I have known many instances where an animal has died in the first paroxysm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned that there is a distinctive feature in this case of Cook,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140183"/>
               <p>that 7011 were surprised at his manifesting so much power as to be able to at up in bed and ring the bell; are you aware that that was the first commencement, before any of the convulsive symptom! had set in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I apprehend that was at the onset or beginning, as it were, of the convulsive symptoms—this was five minutes before the convulsive symptoms began—I know that he sat np in bed and rang the bell, and that it was not until Palmer had been fetched across and had gone back and given him the pills, that the convulsions came on—I have noticed in animals that the mere touch sends them into convulsions, and they show an indisposition to move—I heard about the lady who died near Romsey; that the maid said that when her mistress's bell rang violently she went, and found that she had got out of bed, and was sitting on the floor—that struck me as inconsistent with what I have seen, but I have no doubt that was a death from strychnia—if that evidence be true, and it is a fact that she got np and rang her bell, that does not shake my opinion; I still adhere to it; it is not consistent with what I have seen—you must compare it with what I have seen—I tell you that both that case and this are irreconcilable with what I have seen—I have no doubt of this lady dying from strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With the exception of the symptoms which came on at a longer period after the supposed administration of the poison, a longer period than you have ever known, and that the gentleman was able to sit up in bed and ring his bell, is there anything to distinguish these symptoms after the convul<lb/>sions began, from the tetanus you have seen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, one part of my dis<lb/>tinction is, that when a fit of tetanus from strychnia manifested itself if the individual did not die, there was a gradual shading off of the symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am speaking at present of the Tuesday night; with the exception of the ringing of the bell, and that in this case it was an hour or am hour and a half; can you point out anything to distinguish the symptoms and death of Mr. Cook from the symptoms attending on and leading to death by tetanus from strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot—it is inconsistent with what I have observed in animals, but it is not inconsistent with what I have heard in the case of Mrs. Smith—the first symptom is a panting respira<lb/>tion—it is excitement, rather than difficulty, of breathing—it is not an early symptom, it is in the convulsions that there is a difficulty of breathing—if a man were to breathe hardly it is a position naturally assumed for him to sit up—until the convulsions and rigidity comes on there is nothing to prevent his sitting up in his bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if you except the delay in the manifestation of the symptoms, and the fact of his sitting up in his bed and calling for help, is there anything to distinguish the convulsions under which this man suffered, and under which he died, from the convulsions of tetanus from strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ton will ex<lb/>cept one other thing, which was the fit on Monday night; that is the important distinction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose that were all you knew of the subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then there is not—the violent ringing of the bell is not perfectly inconsistent with the tetanus of strychnia, but the account which in given of Mrs. Smith is what I cannot reconcile with what I have before observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the abrupt termination, instead of the gradual subsidence of the paroxysms in the cases where you have observed it in animals, has it been where you have given them the full dose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> And in the human subject also—mind, I am speaking from my experience on man as well as on animals—there was a ease of a man who had taken very nearly a grain of strychnia—that is a strongish dose, and you might expect a recurrence of the paroxysms—the subsidence will not depend</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140184"/>
               <p>on the strength of the dose, it will depend on whether the individual is to recover or not—of course, that will be dependent on the strength of the dose—I have seen four or five cases of recovery, and at the time Dr. Pereira wag making his experiments at the hospital, I have seen the human subject under full doses of strychnia; on one occasion it is stated in the books that he gave a grain and a half of strychnia in the course of a day—that would keep up the recurrence of the symptoms—he ceased when he found they were under its influence; it would have killed the patient, but the dose wit stopped, and gradually shaded off—we had gradually worked him up to it by a succession of doses—the effect does not manifest itself in the small dote—when you give them a larger dose it is possible that the other portion is carried away from the system.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not generally supposed that the effect of strychnia is very varied in different individuals? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there is great uniformity in the effects of strychnia—there would be a little variation in time, but in the main features of the case there would be none—I find this difference, that from the same dose in the same species you get one paroxysm, or you get a series of paroxysms terminating in death—but the effects are the same for all that—the symptoms are precisely the same, that is what I mean—I was disposed to think it was a fit on Sunday night—I cannot tell you what it was, I have formed no opinion—Mr. Cook's death is irreconcilable with everything am acquainted with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it reconcilable with any known disease which you have ever seen or heard of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is irreconcilable with everything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it is not reconcilable with anything you have ever heard of—do you mean to say that it could not be the result of any variety of convulsions, however violent, though not classed under any particular description of convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In order to answer that question must tell you that we are learning new facts every day, and I do not conceive it to be impossible that some peculiarity of the spinal cord, unrecognizable except the examination be made immediately after death, may produce symp<lb/>toms like those—when I say that it is irreconcilable with anything I have heard of, I include everything I have heard of strychnia poison as well as every<lb/>thing else, natural disease or poison—the vomiting of the pills by Mr. Cook just before death, is not consistent with anything I have known and observed of strychnia poison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether in the interval between the fits of an animal under the influence of the strychnia poison, touching it does not bring a paroxysm on—have you tried and ascertained whether if you touch an animal which is beginning to exhibit those minor premonitory symptoms, but which as yet has had no paroxysms, whether the touching it at that time will bring the paroxysms on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it does—any excitement will produce them—the Romsey case was an exceptional case, from the manner in which the strychnia was administered, and the quantity of the dose—in my judg<lb/>ment, the ringing of the bell by the lady the moment she felt anything of uneasiness, produced the paroxysm which ultimately was observed in her—it is quite consistent with all I have seen, that a movement would excite a paroxysm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the Romsey case the poison was administered in a liquid, and the paroxysms took place within ten minutes—is it safe, in your opinion, to argue from the symptoms that occurred in that case as to what might be the nature of the malady in this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With regard to the great features, they are the same in all instances—the mode in which it is administered, in a fluid or a solid form, will make a difference in the time, but not in the nature</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140185"/>
               <p>of the operation—I am still of opinion that the evidence I gave on Merritt's trial is correct—I have never altered my opinion—I am not a ware of there being any ground for imputation on me in reference to that matter; not the slightest—I know of no ground for supposing, until this moment, that there was the slightest displeasure on the part of Government—I have since been on the prosecution side in cases, and I very much think the Crown has been the prosecutor—it came to my knowledge, after I had given my evidence, that other gentlemen differed from my opinion, and I answered their objec<lb/>tions—Dr. Pereira came to the laboratory and said, "Save this woman's life if you can by admitting the possibility of its being otherwise"—I said, I had no objection to write a letter, admitting the possibility, but not the probability—that letter was taken to the Secretary of State, and within one hour the respite came—I did it as an act of mercy, on the ground of possibility—I wrote the letter to Dr. Pereira, not suggesting the possi<lb/>bility that I might have been tinder a mistake—he asked me, as an act of mercy, to write a letter to him, to be shown to the Home Office, to admit the possibility of the poison we found in the stomach having been adminis<lb/>tered longer than four hours before death—I wrote a letter, and in admitting the possibility, drew an instance of what might be possible, but not probable—I do not know whether I may tell you what that instance was—the woman was not pardoned, but transported for life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. On the 2nd of October, 1855, I attended a person named Forster, suffering under tetanus—he had an inflammatory sore throat, muscular pains in the neck, and the upper portion of the cervical vertebrae—he was feverish, and had the usual symptoms ordinarily attending catarrh—I put him under the usual treatment of salines and aperients, also using embrocations externally to the muscles of the neck and throat, and also prescribed gargles for him, which he used for the inflammatory sore throat—about the fourth day of my attendance the mus<lb/>cular pains extended to the face, difficulty of swallowing came on; the pains in the muscles covering the cervical vertebra became increased, as also did those of the muscles of the face and lower jaw; the muscles of the entire face, and particularly of the lower jaw—on the afternoon or evening of that day the jaw became completely locked, pains came on, and the muscles of the bowels the lame, and the legs and arms had become very much convulsed—throughout the entire muscular system he had frequent and violent contractions of the arms and hands, and afterwards the legs, and difficulty of swallowing, which was increased up to the 9th or 10th day—the symptoms increased, the difficulty of swallowing in particular, that not a particle of food, solid, or liquid, could be taken or introduced into the mouth, and on his attempting to swallow the smallest portion it brought on most violent convulsions, which were at times so strong throughout the whole system, that I could compare him to nothing more than a piece of warped board in shape—the head was thrown back, and the muscular covering of the bowels, the abdomen, was forced forward—the legs were forcibly thrown upwards and backwards; the attempt to feed him with a spoon, the opening of the window, or placing the fingers on the pulse, frequently brought on violent convulsions—he complained of great hunger.</p>

               <p>feeble pulse, breathing quickly though not laboriously, the jaws were closed god fixed, there was an expression of anxiety about the countenance, and the features were sunken—he was unable to swallow—the muscles of the abdomen and back were somewhat tense—after he had been in the ward about ten minutes he had another paroxysm, spasm, and oposthotonos was well marked—that lasted about one minute—he was then quiet for a few minutes—he had then another and died—he had only been in the hospital about half an hour—an inquest was held on the body—the body was examined—no poison was found—the stomach was examined by Dr. Letheby—I attribute the death to tetanus—there were three wounds, two at the back of the right elbow about the size of a shilling each, and one on the left elbow about the size of a sixpence—the man told me he had had them about twelve or sixteen years—they were old chronic indurated ulcers, circular in outline, the edges thickened round, undermined and covered with a dirty white coating without any granulations—I am unable to say what produced those ulcers—I have seen other wounds like them in different parts of a body—I have seen old chronic syphilitic wounds in the legs of other patients similar to those in the elbow, but I cannot say that these were so—these wounds were the only things to account for tetanus—there was no other cause found.</p>

I have heard the evidence in this case as to the symptoms of Mr. Cook, and as to the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I heard that portion of the evidence which mentioned the examination of the spine—of course it is most important, in a case of death from convulsion, to examine the spinal cord shortly after death—I heard the statement as to the gritty granules that were found—I have no doubt that such granules would be likely to cause inflammation of the arachnoid membrane—such inflammation would have been discoverable if the spinal cord or its membranes had been exa<lb/>mined shortly after death—if examined nine weeks after, it would not be likely to be discovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would such inflammation, if it existed by the granules, be capable of producing tetaniform convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not seen such a case, but such cases are undoubtedly on record; I have read of them—the medical term for such inflammation of the arachnoid is meningitis, or arachuitis, inflammation of the membrane—that disorder produces convulsions and death; I should say not universally; it sometimes does not result in death; spasms of the muscles, oposthotonos are tetanic symptoms—I could not form any positive judgment as to the cause of death in Mr. Cook's case—I have heard the evidence as to the state of contraction after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form any judgment an to whether that is an exceptional state, or whether in death rigidity from natural causes is observed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is every variety in that respect—no conclusion can be formed from the degree of contraction, or the kind of contraction, that I heard described.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By no conclusion, do you mean no inference at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None—I mean from the contracted state of the body after death—I speak merely with reference to the particular symptoms I have heard described during this case—if I found the back curved, and the body resting on its back and feet after death, I should infer that he died of that form of tetanus which convulses the muscles of the back; I should suppose he died from tetanus—when I say that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140191"/>
               <p>no inference can be drawn from the contracted state of the body after death, I speak with reference to the symptoms I have heard described, not as a general thing—I can conceive cases in which an inference might be drawn as to death by tetanus from the contracted state of the body after death.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you under<lb/>stand these granules, from which you say arachnitis might have pro<lb/>ceeded, were situate in the deceased man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I understand rightly, they were situated on the inner surface of the fibrous investment of the cord—I understood so—granules are not commonly found in the human subject in these parts—they are sometimes—arachnitis, producing con<lb/>vulsions, has never come under my own personal observation—it has not satisfactorily come under my observation without producing convulsions—it is a rare disease—I am not enabled to state, from the recorded oases, the course of the symptoms of the disease—the cases have varied in duration—the period commonly has been days, at the shortest—it is accompanied with paralysis, if they live—it does not produce any effect upon the brain by sympathy, manifestly, I mean, not recognizable after death—it would not affect the brain by sympathy, or otherwise, prior to death—I do not know whether it is attended with loss of sensibility before death—in these eases, where granules have produced arachnitis, they have varied, in point of size, in different cases—suppose them to be very small and minute, I should think there would be less likelihood of their producing inflammation—I should not conclude there was inflammation without an appearance of it—supposing decomposition of the part not to have commenced, but that it was found in its complete integrity, and I found no trace of inflammation of the spinal cord, I should not feel myself warranted in inferring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will put any period short of decomposition—supposing the spinal cord examined, and the decomposition had not commenced, and, in fact, no trace of inflammation in that part, would you be warranted in inferring any? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Allow me to say that you are putting an impossible case; the spinal cord could not remain in its integrity after that period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The limit of time is prior to decomposition; that is the terminus to which you are to direct your attention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then it might be observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose in that case you see no inflammation, would you be warranted in inferring it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the shortest period in which arachnitis kills is a matter of days—that is my impression—it some<lb/>times extends to months, where the dose does not kill; not otherwise, unless it terminates in palsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When it kills, how long may it last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may go on for months.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not affect the patient by a series of recurring convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That varies—J never knew, or heard, or read of a case in which the patient died after a single convulsion of arachnitis—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140192"/>
               <p>cannot say whether it would affect the rest of the system or the general health—I do not believe that a man could have twenty-four hours of com<lb/>plete repose between the convulsions—I have no personal knowledge what would be likely to be the symptoms produced, independently of convulsions, by inflammation of the spinal cord—I should expect to find great pain in the back sometimes, but I have no personal knowledge—the symptoms I should expect would be pain, associated with spasm and palsy—palsy would come on last—I am not aware whether the health of the system would be in any other respect affected than by the reproduction of the con<lb/>vulsions; I cannot answer—that in the interval between the convulsions he could be quite well—there would be pain and uneasiness, according to where the convulsions were situated, according to the situation of the muscles convulsed; the back usually—I should not expect complete repose from convulsions for a period of twenty-four hours—I have heard the symptoms stated, and have heard that, from the midnight of Monday till Tuesday Mr. Cook had complete repose—I should think that Mr. Cook's death did not proceed from arachnitis—the majority of the symptoms are not associated with arachnitis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You mentioned that there were one or two of the appearances after death in Cook's case, which would be common to other cases, such as the semi-closing of the hand—have you ever known, except in a case of tetanus, the hand after death completely clenched, so as to require force to take the fingers away from the hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not—I have never seen a case of idiopathic tetanus—in traumatic tetanus I have seen the hand clenched; not so much as that—they often require a great deal of force to be straightened—the arching of the feet occasionally takes place in death—I have often noticed it—I have never known the feet to be so distorted as to be described by a medical man as assuming the form of a club foot—I heard the description given by Mr. Jones, that, when this man died, the body was bowed, so that, if he had turned it from its side upon its back, it would have rested on its head, and on its heels—I have no doubt that that indicates death from tetanus; from that form of tetanic spasm—I am acquainted with the symptoms that accompany death from tetanus resulting from the administration of strychnia, only by reading and hearsay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your knowledge of the subject, having attended to the symptoms described by Mr. Jones from the moment the paroxysms set in of which Mr. Cook died, and the symptoms and appearances attending his death, does it appear to you that those symptoms are consistent with death by strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some are consistent and some are inconsistent—one of those which are in<lb/>consistent is the long interval which occurred after the taking of the poison—the symptoms described by Mr. Jones are quite consistent with what I know of death by strychnia—I quite agree in the description that has been given by various witnesses that the symptoms of traumatic tetanus come on gradually and progressively, and that, although they are remitted, the disease is never wholly intermitted—I have never known the disease of traumatic tetanus to run its course to death under three or four days, within my experience—if a case were described as of shorter duration, such as a day or a few hours, I should consider it probable that the premonitory symptoms had very likely been neglected—I have never witnessed a complete case of death from strychnia, either in animals or in human life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bearing in mind the distinction between traumatic and idiopathic tetanus, and a case such as has been here described, in the whole course of your experience or knowledge have you ever seen such a death as this, with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140193"/>
               <p>the symptoms that have been mentioned, proceed from natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were going to state, when you were stopped, those symptoms that you considered inconsistent with strychnia, and you men<lb/>tioned the time after the attack came on—will you go on and mention what other symptoms you consider inconsistent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The sickness manifested before the attack came on, the beating the bed clothes with the arms, want of sensitiveness to external impressions, and the sudden cessation of the con<lb/>vulsions, and apparent complete recovery—I think those are the principal points—I mentioned previously the distance of time that occurred between the ingestion of the poison and the coming on of the symptoms, I assume that to have been about an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As to the mode in which it came on without premonitory symptoms, do you consider that is inconsistent with strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was appa<lb/>rently an absence of the usual nervous and muscular agitation that is described—I stated to the Attorney-General that the bent form of the feet indicated some tetaniform spasm—that answer applied as well to natural tetaniform spasm as to that produced by strychnia—that would be the case whether it was a tetaniform spasm with poison or without poison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The other symptoms of rigidity, though indicating death by tetanus, would appear if death arose either from natural tetanus, if I may call it so, or from poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is rather a question of degree—oposthotonos arises from natural tetanus, but it would be more violent if from strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do the symptoms of convulsive disorders arising from injury to the spine, vary considerably in their character in different cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only know by reading, they do vary, according to the muscles affected; they vary in their degree of violence, and in the periods of intermission, and in the nature of the particular muscles attacked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that in the cases of tetanus you have seen, there was no intermission of the disease—do you know, from your reading, that the intermission of the disease is not an unfrequent thing in traumatic tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know it occurs, but it is not frequent—I do not remember cases of arach<lb/>nitis in which death took place in a period of fifteen hours—I do not bear in mind whether forty-eight hours is an uncommon time for such disorders—such granules as are described are more unusual in young people than in old people—I cannot tell whether they are more indicative of disease when seen in young people than in old—I do not know of any case in which the spine would preserve its integrity as long as nine weeks—I should not feel myself justified in saying that there was no disease from an examination made at that period.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose you saw the spine entirely free from decompo<lb/>sition, maintaining its integrity, and you saw no symptoms of disease, would you infer that there had been any at the time of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GROVE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the usual period at which decomposition sets in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It varies very much, from a few hours to a few days, according to the temperature and various things—I do not think it in the least probable that it could remain for nine weeks undecomposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the stomach had been brought by any other cause into a state of irritation by any other means, would you think sickness inconsistent with the use of strychnia? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it not inconsistent.</p>

               <p>hare ceased to be so for two years—I had under my care a ease of traumatic tetanus in a boy—it was in the year 1843—he was eight years old, and was in the hospital—he was brought in during the time he was ill—I took rough notes of the case at the time, it is so many years since, that I quite forget—may I refer to the notes?—he was brought in on the 28th July and died on the 2nd Aug.—the acci<lb/>dent occurred a week before he was brought in—during the first three days he had the usual paroxysms, but unusually severe—I saw him on the 28th July—his mother complained when he came in that he could not open his mouth—he complained of great pain and stiffness about the neck—during the first night of his admission he started up convulsed, and spasmodically closed his jaw—I suppose it had been relaxed in the meantime—during the following night he was again convulsed at times—the abdominal muscles, as well as the muscles of the neck and back, had become rigid during the night—the muscles of the face were also in a state of great contraction—on the following day I found that the muscles remained in the same state—in the morning of the third day at 2 o'clock, on visiting him, I found there was much less rigidity of the muscles, especially those of the abdomen and back—the following morning the muscular rigidity had gone—he opened his mouth as wide as usual and was able to talk—the lad appeared to be thoroughly relieved—he had no return of the spasm until the following day; at that time he asked the nurse to change his linen, and as she was lifting him up in bed to do so, violent convulsions of the arms and face came on, and he died in a few minutes—from the time at which the convulsions of which he died came on, and the last preceding convulsions, I should say about thirty hours elapsed; it would be difficult to say exactly—the last paroxysm before he died lasted a few minutes—before that paroxysm came on, the rigidity I describe had been completely relaxed—it was merely the act of lifting him up in bed to change his linen which caused it—in this case, I had given the patient something to produce vomiting—the second day I gave him, in order to produce vomiting, small doses of tartar emetic, and they produced no effect—I gave a grain on the following day—I repeated them in larger doses—they produced no effect, that is, they did not pro<lb/>duce vomiting—two grains of tartar emetic I gave to the child of eight years old—I did not repeat it after the third day—I thought there was no necessity for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have not heard, and I think it is desirable we should know, what was the accident which caused the tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was an accident by which the toe was smashed—a large stone fell on the middle toe of the left foot, and had completely smashed it—the wound bad become very unhealthy, very much so—when first I saw it, it had portions of bone and cartilage adhering to the surface—I amputated the toe at the time he was brought the mother said that he could not open his mouth so wide as usual—that I think first attracted the mother's attention—when I saw him the mouth was almost closed up—I have a recollection of the case—the jaw remained closed until 1st August—when I administered tartar emetic to him the jaw was closed in all these cases; so small a quantity as the tartar emetic is easily got into the mouth—the tongue seems to retain its powers—I should say that the case is recorded in "The Lancet"—the convulsions came on during the night of the 29th July, and they appear to have remitted during the day, except the rigidity, the tetanic symptoms remaining—there were no spasms during the day-time, I believe, but I never was in the habit of recording medical evidence—in the day-time, although there were no convulsions, the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140195"/>
               <p>muscles of the body, of the chest, and of the abdomen, back, and neck were all rigid—that continued throughout the two days that I administered tartar emetic—the rigidity of the muscles of the chest and stomach would, I have no doubt, go far to prevent sickness—if rigidity of those muscles had not set up, I should have expected that the boy would have vomited from so large a dose—I have no doubt it would have done so except from the rigidity of the muscles—the symptoms began to abate on lit Aug., the fourth day, and they gradually subsided during the night—I saw the child during the middle of the day, and I found from the nurse that the rigidity of the muscles had entirely gone off—I thought he was going to get well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told us the woman sat him up in bed for the purpose of changing his linen; might that in any way have brought the toe, that part affected at least, into friction with some parts of the bed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I think not—it might have done so certainly, but I do not think the simple irritation of the toe would have any effect in producing tetanic symptoms—if the cause had not entirely gone, the symptoms were brought back by the act of sitting up in bed—my impression is, there must be some action about the spinal cord as the immediate cause of the spasm or convulsions; action set up in the spinal cord by irritation of the nerves in the immediate seat of the laceration or wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May it not be reasonable to infer that any irritation of the part originally injured, exciting and irritating the nerve or nerves connected with that part, may support its action over the whole system to the spinal cord, and so produce the symptoms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had removed the end of the injured nerve, so I suppose that the same cause could not exist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you feel yourself justified in saying that the irritation of the spiral cord once set up continues, why should you infer that the irritation of the nerve may not also continue? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There must be some peculiar irritation of the nerve to affect the spinal cord from which tetanus arises, or else it would be more frequently produced—there appear to be some particular circumstances under which it is produced—I have no doubt the state of the toe was the original cause of the convulsions, and that death took place by something or other from that first cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you told my friend that, with regard to the convulsions which ended in death, you thought they arose from some irrita<lb/>tion set up in the spinal cord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> did; I said, from that and other causes—the causes of such irritation in the spinal cord which would end in a tetaniform convulsion may, I think, be very various.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think it is possible, merely from a death with symptoms of a tetaniform character, from the observation you have had, to ascribe them to any particular cause? suppose you have a death accompanied with tetaniform symptoms and oposthotonos, and other symptoms of a tetanic character, in the absence of any knowledge of the cause, namely, the irritation of the spinal cord, do you think it is possible to ascribe them to any particular cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it would be extremely difficult to do so, probably impossible—in the event of a given set of symptoms, tetanic symptoms, being proposed, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, without some other evidence, or collateral evidence, to assign it to any given diseas or cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the College of Surgeons at Edinburh, and have been in practice about eight years—during that time I have had considerable experience at home and abroad—I have had practical as well as theoretical knowledge of tetanus, idiopathic and traumatic—I have seen two cases of idiopathic tetanus—in addition to those, I have</p>

               <p>made tetanus a subject of medical research—tetanus will proceed from very slight causes, almost any internal disorder or alteration of the secretions will produce idiopathic tetanus—exposure to cold or damp will produce it, and mental excitement would be a probable cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Without any organic disturbance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mental excitement will cause an organic disturbance—mental excitement would be a proxi<lb/>mate cause of tetanus, and sensual excitement also—the presence of gritty particles or granules in any portion of the body connected with the nervous structure of the spine or the brain, would produce tetanic convulsions—I have seen several slight miliary tubercles, the only assignable cause for death, terminating in convulsions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Allow me to call your attention to a case of idiopathic tetanus of your own; do you remember the case of the female, Catherine Watson, who is here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was fortunate enough to restore her—to tell you the symptoms of that case, I had better read my notes—they were made at the time—this is a copy of them—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>: "Case of idiopathic tetanus occurring in a female aged twenty-two, with recovery; no cause of disease traceable, Oct. 20th, 1855. Was asked to see Catherine Watson at Garnkirk, a pre<lb/>viously healthy and muscular young woman; was informed that she was so <hi rend="italic">much cramped</hi> in stomach, arms, and legs, that if not soon relieved she would die. I saw her at half-past ten, p.m.: she was then fearfully convulsed; body arched on head and heels; face livid and swollen; tipper extremities rigid, the left more so than the right, which could be flexed with a little force; respiration hurried; pulse irregular, from 120 to 130, firm and bounding; partial sensibility present. I asked her if she could take a drink? She tried, but could not swallow. I at once opened a vein and bled freely, The pricking of the lancet brought on a spasm, as during my examination there was a relaxation from the arched spasm, the abdomen and extremities still being rigid; the bleeding caused a longer interruption than any she had had, as I was informed. Convulsions, ushered in with an involuntary shriek, then set in, and the body was drawn to left side; jaws set firm together. Seeing this, I began to give her chloroform in drachm doses, and about an ounce was inhaled ere any decided impression was made. The spasms then relaxed, and she lay quiet, with an anxious expression of coun<lb/>tenance; abdomen and extremities still rigid. If I omitted the chloroform for a short time, the spasms returned with great force; I then steadily gave the chloroform, pouring on another dose when the vapour of the previous one was exhausted, until I finished all I had, about four ounces. At this time, half-past two, a.m., I left her asleep, having sent off a messenger for another supply, in case of a return of the spasms. I visited her three times during the day, but found her asleep. She slept for thirty-six hours con<lb/>tinuously, and awoke complaining of great soreness over all her body, particularly extremities. Mouth was contorted, drawn to left side; purgatives were given, which brought away fæces of a dark colour and disagreeable odour; and in a few days she recovered—mouth gradually</p>

Catamenie regular; had been unwell a few days previously; bowels had been freely open day of attack; had gone about her usual duties till the evening, although she had felt dull in spirits for a day or two previous; she had eaten nothing but a little toast with tea all day. No cause for illness can be traced, unless the weather, which is chilly and cold, may account for it. Her position, and absence of all motive forbid the idea of strychnia having been used.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I wish to have merely the general result; is there any other pecu<lb/>liarity with reference to the brain that attracted your attention, or have you comprised all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I have comprised all that I can recollect—I have found the lungs of those animals either collapsed or congested—the heart invariably filled on the right side with blood, and very often on the left—the liver in those animals has been congested, the kidneys normal and healthy; the spleen normal generally, in a natural ordinary condi<lb/>tion; the vessels of the stomach on the outer surface congested, and on the mucous or inner surface, highly vascular—that is, the vessels filled with florid and red blood, giving a red or inflamed appearance, deeper in some places than in others; the vessels of the spinal cord congested, the vessels of the membranes; and also a red point seen on cutting it through, but not invariably—these symptoms, or rather appearances, on <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion, are not always a true test of the cause of death—symptoms are a different thing altogether—you may judge of the cause of death from a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, but not always—you can generally give an opinion—I have experimented in a great many cases for the discovery of strychnia—you may discover in the stomach of an animal the smallest dose that will kill the animal; if you kill an animal with a grain of strychnia, you may discover traces of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think your proposition is, that, wherever a man is killed by strychnia, that strychnia may be discovered? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a trace of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Evidence of its presence—that may mean an imponderable quantity—I mean by trace to convey the idea that I can discover the smallest quantity that will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140198"/>
               <p>kill—I can discover the fifty-thousandth part of a grain—I have actually experimented so as to discover that quantity—I have heard a theory in the course of this inquiry which has been propounded by Dr. Taylor; to my knowledge, as a scientific man, that has not been propounded by any eminent chemist before; I mean the supposed decomposition of strychnia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> To your knowledge, has any scientific man of eminence ever pro<lb/>pounded that theory before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I first ascertained that that theory had been propounded by any one, in this Court—speaking scientifically, in my opinion there is no well-grounded reason for the theory of the decompo<lb/>sition of strychnia, on absorption—I have proved that that theory is false, by numerous experiments—I have taken the blood of an animal poisoned with two grains of strychnia, about the least quantity that would kill an animal, and have injected it into the abdominal cavities of smaller animals, and have destroyed them, with all the symptoms and <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances of death by strychnia—I can read you a few of those experiments, if you wish it—this paper contains a summary of the proofs which, at all events, to my own satisfaction, disprove that theory—I have made numerous experi<lb/>ments in different ways, and have long known it—I should, think it would make no difference how strychnia is administered—if the pills were hard, and not readily solved, you might find it much easier, because you might find some remains of the pill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would its administration in pills have the effect of keeping its parts together, and thereby strengthen the possibility of detection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—by keeping the parts undissolved you might find some remains more easily—I have heard what Dr. Taylor said was his opinion about the fallacy of colour tests—I do not agree with him in that opinion—colour tests an reliable modes of ascertaining strychnia—I have found it invariably in urine that had been ejected—part of it may be thrown off by the kidneys—it is not true that strychnia can be confounded with pyroxanthine—in the animals which I killed with strychnia I observed generally an increased flow of saliva—that was a very marked symptom—those creatures were very susceptible of touch; a stamp of the foot, a slight touch, or a breath or a sharp word, throwing them into tonic convulsions—we generally recognise them by the stiffened condition of the muscles, it is a marked convul<lb/>sion—supposing that a dose of strychnia sufficient to kill a man were admi<lb/>nistered to him, having his neck rubbed would be very likely to throw him into convulsions even before the paroxysm came on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As soon as the poison is taken into his stomach, would that effect be produced, as soon as he has swallowed the poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—after a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> time—you, of course, have the first symptoms of poisoning produced first—you have the first symptoms of tetanus produced before he is in danger of being thrown into convulsions by the neck being rubbed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would not give him any kind of relief? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think so, judging from experiments I have made—a man pulling a bell violently, if he was poisoned by strychnia, would, I think, be extremely improbable, if the dose had been sufficient to destroy life, provided the symptoms had made their appearance; always premising that—I agree with Mr. Herapath that where strychnia is taken in a sufficient dose to poison, it can and ought to be discovered—I have heard the evidence that was given in this case; the medical evidence, and the evidence as to the symptoms—the symptoms I attach very little importance to, as a means of diagnosis, as we may have the same symptoms developed from many different causes—that is the only reason with regard to the symptoms, so far as the symptoms</p>

               <p>are concerned; but there is one principal reason I have, which is this: a dose of strychnia, sufficient to destroy life in one paroxysm, would hardly require an hour and a half, or two hours—as to the cause of death in this case, the principal argument is—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. We do not want your argument; we want your opinion: you are asked what is your opinion as to the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KENEALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now tell us the grounds of that opinion. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cause of death was epileptic convulsions with tetanic complications—that is the nearest approach, from my reading, and from the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> appearances in Cook's case being so different from those I have described previously, and from the supposition that a dose of strychnia sufficient to destroy life in one paroxysm could not, so far as I am aware, have required even an hour for its absorption; that is, for its action—the interval of repose from the Monday night to the Tuesday would operate on my judgment in coming to that conclusion, if my opinion that it was of an epileptic character were correct—the intermission from the Monday night would be considered important, as epileptic seizures very often recur about the same hours, as I have seen them—assuming that a man was in such an excitable state of mind that he was silent for two or three minutes after his hone winning a race, that he exposed himself to cold and damp, that he excited his brain by drink<lb/>ing, and was attacked by violent vomiting, and that there were bony de<lb/>posits or gritty granules found in the neighbourhood of his spine, any one of those causes might aggravate or hurry his death.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where do you practise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At Chryston, near Glasgow—I am a general practitioner there, and surgeon to the Garnkirk works—that is not a public institution—I am medical officer to the pariah—I have had personal experience of two cases of idiopathic tetanus; this one that I have recorded, and another—I have only seen two cases—what have been telling you about mental excitement, sensual excitement, and granules; is not within my own observation; they seldom occur to any medical practitioner—we have had many medical practitioners examined here, who have not seen them at all—I have not seen them—this case which I have recorded might have arisen from mental anxiety—I have no reason to think it did—Catherine Watson I saw about half-past 10 o'clock at night—she had been ill very nearly an hour, I suppose, before I saw her—she had convulsions—she had gone about her usual duties until the evening—she felt a slight las<lb/>situde for two days previous to the attack—I could only press her to that acknowledgment in my anxiety to get at the symptoms—she would not own to anything being the matter with her—she would say very little—it was only by close pressing that she could call it to mind—she did not call to mind that she had felt any stiffness—this was the night I was called in—the lock<lb/>jaw came on, I think, in an hour or two, I could not be positive—I could not make any minute inquiries—the case occupied all my attention—the other case, named Copeland, was a young child of, I think, between three and four months old—I saw it in good health half an hour before the attack came on; I was attending the mother—it had an attack of convulsions and opo<lb/>sthotonos—it had the remains of the <hi rend="italic">rigis subdonœum</hi> when I saw it—I rode away from the house, and they supposed I had gone a mile from the house or a couple of miles when it died—it was seized with a spasm, which I con<lb/>jectured to be of the diaphragm—I had seen it half an hour before—there was nothing the matter with it then; it was in bed—the mother was laid up, and I think the child was lying in the bed—I did not see it—I saw it lying in bed, but I did not examine it—I do not recollect whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140200"/>
               <p>I saw its face—I saw the child—I did not see its face—I saw it asleep in bed—I judged it to be asleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the same thing as seeing it asleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very near—you must recollect, we medical men can form a judgment on such a subject better than lawyers or any one else—I was applied to in this case in January—Mr. Smith applied to me—I can hardly say how he found me out—I communi<lb/>cated this case of Catherine Watson to him, as resembling the symptoms of what I had read of Mr. Cook's death, as being nearly the same—I furnished I my notes just now, the night before last I think—I have been here about a week, from the beginning of the trial, attending daily, and, of course, at the consultations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You wrote to Mr. Smith, sending this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I suppose Mr. Smith may produce the minutes of the case, my original notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not mean to suggest that there has been any alteration of the notes; do not suppose that for a moment; with regard to the cases of the animals that you experimented on with strychnia, when did you begin the series you have been describing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I began this series of experiments for this case in January—the experiments I had made before, I think, eight or ten years ago—it was at the time I discovered that strychnia could be de<lb/>tected in the blood by vital or physiological tests—the doses with which I killed the animals on which I experimented, were, I think, from a grain and three-quarters to two grains—the animals were dogs, cats, rabbits, and fowls—this series of experiments all relate to dogs—I administered from three<lb/>quarters of a grain to two grains—a grain is the smallest dose I gave, and two grains is the largest—I made four experiments with a grain, five with a grain and a half, one with a grain and a quarter, and two with two grains—I gave some of them half a grain, but to the dogs one grain was the minimum and two the maximum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You tried with half a grain in that series of experiments? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did it for the purpose of ascertaining the least dose that would kill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you try to see whether there was any strychnia there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> How could I before I killed the dog?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean, on your oath, to tell me you do not understand my question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Repeat it again—perhaps I slipped it—upon my oath I may have slipped it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you-mean, standing there as a witness in this Court, you do not know the question I put to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have perhaps forgotten the question—was it, did I detect half a grain of strychnia?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you believe that to be the question I put to you—on your solemn oath do you believe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On my solemn oath I understood you to ask me if I had detected half a grain in a dog.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I asked you whether in that case you gave the minimum dose, and had afterwards tried to find the strychnia by your chemical process? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> De<lb/>cidedly—I gave five or six doses—I began with a quarter or half a grain to discover the smallest quantity that would kill—I tried to find the strychnia afterwards in some cases—they are enumerated among these—I did not make a note of those where I have given half a grain, because it did not kill—in that series I have not one with less than a grain, not for the finishing the killing—those are the doses with which I kill the animal—this does not apply to this series of experiments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I want you to show me a note of your having killed a dog with half a grain, and finding the strychnia afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have killed upwards of forty animals, and there were a dozen for the purpose of finding it on the <hi rend="italic">post</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">mortem</hi> symptoms—I have never destroyed a dog with half a grain of strychnia; I could not; I have tried it, and it did not answer—I say that I have always found the brain highly congested—I ascribe that to the stop<lb/>page of the circulation in the system; the spasms impede the circulation—it is the spasms of all the muscles together which produce that congestion—the spasms of the legs and arms would help to do it—the immediate cause of the fulness of the heart after death is not that the respiratory muscles are arrested in their action, and the lungs cannot play; the immediate cause of the fulness of the heart is this, the violence of the spasm drives the blood out of the smaller capillaries into the large vessels of the cavity, and you find all the large vessels distended, and in most cases you find the lungs entirely collapsed, you rarely find them congested, sometimes you do, the respiratory muscles prevent the play of the lungs, from being expanded—I have not found in some cases that the brain was not congested—I think in every case there was more or less congestion—I do not find that to be greater in proportion to the length of the paroxysm; I find it to be greatest where the animal is young and in a full state of health—there would be this difference, that, according to the age of the animal and the state of health, there would be more or less fulness of blood—I have seen a case of traumatic tetanus; I think two in my own practice, but I have seen a few others in hospital—one of them, in my own practice, lasted about five or six days, I cannot remember the particulars—I think the other recovered—the paroxysms lasted six or seven days, and he eventually recovered—it is a long time ago, and I have not a note of the case, I could not be precise about it—I have never seen a case of strychnia in the human subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understand you to say, that, in your opinion, this was a case of epilepsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As far as I can judge from hearing the evidence in Court, I think it was a case of epileptic convulsions with tetanic complications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What does epilepsy proceed from. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nobody can answer you that question—I have not exactly arrived at any definite theory on the subject; not quite so definite as strychnia or tetanus; it is buried in mystery—I have seen one case of death from epilepsy—the patient was not conscious when he died—I have seen only one death from epilepsy—I can refer you to Dr. Goode's work, where you find instances of consciousness during epileptic attacks—I cannot recollect whether the patient was conscious when he died—I cannot recollect any case in which consciousness has preceded death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have studied this matter—I suppose you are pretty well up in this branch of your profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am pretty well up in most branches of my profession—I do not know of any single recorded case of consciousness at the time of death, not from my own knowledge—I do not know of any case—I heard what Sir Benjamin Brodie said, and several gentlemen who have been examined on both sides, that they could not refer the symptoms of Mr. Cook's attacks to any known disease—I think I heard Sir Benjamin Brodie say he never had a case of idiopathic tetanus—I heard what Mr. Par<lb/>tridge said, and I have given you my opinion candidly and openly—I have given you my opinion that it was, as far as I can learn, a death from epileptic convulsions with tetanic complications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that a disease known among medical men? <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Yes; you will find it in all medical works, you will find it in "Copland's Dictionary."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is the gentleman of whom we have heard once or twice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I presume so, you will find it in almost every work on convulsions—I have not made any application to Dr. Copland in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140202"/>
               <p>this case—I have his work, which I have studied occasionally at home—I mean to state that I believe this death to have been a death from epilepsy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Without being able to refer to any cause whatever as producing that disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When I have told you before that deaths often take place in idiopathic tetanus without leaving any trace behind, I think I may say—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is idiopathic tetanus, I am speaking of epilepsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Or epileptic convulsions, they are all of the same class—you ask me what epilepsy is, I believe that epilepsy and tetanic convulsions, and all forms of convulsions arise from a decomposition of the blood, and that if a person has probably an incipient tendency to disease of the brain that organ may be affected, or any other organ, and that the decomposition of the blood may set up the diseased action in that other organ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We should like to understand this, will you just repeat what you have said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe that all convulsive diseases, including the epileptic forms and the various tetanic complications (that will include all), arise from a decomposition of the blood, and that this decomposed Mood acts on the nerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I understand you that in your opinion mental excitement had anything to do with this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say it had, I said it might have had—I said it might have caused it; that it was within the range of probability that it might have caused the convulsive attack—any mental excitement might—it is stated that he was subject to excitement—I find that at Shrewsbury he was excited, and, wherever you have excitement, you have a consequent depression—when you find a mat lying in bed sick and vomiting, he must be depressed—if I have much ex<lb/>citement, if I am up all night, it upsets me the next day, and I generally vomit the food I take—Cook was overjoyed at winning his race; he might have vomited in consequence, if he had the same predisposition that I have, the same dyspeptic symptoms—I do not mean to say that the excitement of the three minutes on the course on the Tuesday accounts for the vomiting on Wednesday night—there is nothing reported of any excitement or de<lb/>pression from that time till the time he died, that I can recollect just now—a person may be joking and laughing and still be subject to bilious fits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We are not talking now about bilious fits, we are talking of excitement, as a consequence of epilepsy, with tetanic complications—I want to know on what you can put your hand in the whole history of the roan's symptoms in the way of excitement or depression, which will account for that remark<lb/>able physiological phenomena? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have told you that almost any one of the circumstances found might cause it—in many cases we can discover no traces at all—we cannot in many cases discover the cause—I give a series of causes which I say might account for it—those causes were stated to have been present in this case—one was those white spots that were seen in the stomach—those might have caused the convulsions—they might have been the means—we often find that an inflammatory condition of the stomach acts upon the brain—we heard about these white spots—Dr. Harland described them—if those white spots were present in the stomach you must have had inflammation—you never can have those white spots without inflammation—if they say there was none, I do not believe them—sensual excitement might be a cause of epileptic convulsion with tetanic complications—I think there is evidence of this man having undergone such excitement, when you have the chancre and syphilitic</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140203"/>
               <p>sores, there is no doubt about it—I am not called upon to say whether that excitement had taken place at some anterior period; I take my opinion from what was seen on him—supposing the man had intercourse of the description I mention, a week before, that is sufficient to account for epilepsy, with these peculiarities—we have instances on record where convulsions have supervened on the very act you allude to—I have no instance of its setting in a fortnight afterwards, but it is quite within the range of possibility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to take down that it is within the range of possibility that within a fortnight after sexual intercourse, that might bring on tetanic convulsions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The results of the sensual excitement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the results of sensual ex<lb/>citement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have seen the results; I have described them—chance is one of them, and syphilitic sore-throat—I do not mean that—the chances here caused the epilepsy—I have never known a chancre cause epilepsy—I have never heard of it—I never heard of any other form of syphilis producing epilepsy, but tetanus; you are forgetting the tetanic com<lb/>plications.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, if I understand it right, it stands thus—that the sensual excitement produces the epilepsy, and the chancre superadda the tetanic complications. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You have misquoted me; I say the results of the sensual excitement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there anything else to which you can ascribe this extraordinary death, which several medical men have said could not be ascribed to any known form of disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have only given my opinion; I have said it might have been that—I did not volunteer, in this case, to come and give evidence—I wrote and sent up the notes of the case—I did not propose to come as a witness, nor did I want to come; I was particularly asked to come—I cannot recollect reading of cases, where the death has arisen from strychnia, where there was so long a period as an hour and a half between the taking of the poison and the appearance of the symptoms—in the case read the other day from the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, by Dr. Taylor, the symptoms appeared an hour after the administration; I said, an hour and a half—I heard the case stated in evidence of the girl at Glasgow—if I recollect rightly, the first symptoms appeared in twenty minutes, and in three quarters of an hour she was dead, I believe—I cannot recollect reading of any instance in which the symptoms have come on so late—the fact of morphia having been given for an hour or two previously, would not, in my opinion, in any way retard the action of the poison; I have seen opium bring on convulsions very nearly the same; I think a grain and a half—I think that would have an effect, judging from my experience; opium will bring on convulsions, but a different form of convulsions from epilepsy—I think it would accelerate the action of the poison—judging from my experience of the effects of opium, I think it would bring on convulsions, epileptic convulsions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, because opium brings on epileptic convulsions, you assume in this case that morphia accelerated the disease? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Drawing that inference, I should say it might—that is what I mean—in some oases morphia stimulates—in this case it was exceedingly apt to cause congestion of the brain—and, as the action of strychnia causes congestion, we might have had the two working together—it may cause excitement—it depends on the idiosyncracy, on the habit of the person—it is given to allay excitement, but it very often has the opposite effect; it may hare done so here, or it may not.</p>

SERJEANT SHEE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> My friend asked you about this child in the cradle; I suppose you have seen a great many children in their cradles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—and I have seen them with their bodies and their arms in certain positions that may give a pretty good idea whether they are asleep or not—from what I saw, and my experience in such matters, I now think it was a very fair opinion to form under those circumstances that the child was asleep—Dr. Mason Goode is a well-known author on the subject of convulsions, and their various forms and resemblance, and so on—I have, from my reading of that and other works, ascertained that there is a class of convulsions which are called epileptic, but which are not, strictly speaking, epilepsy, though they resemble it in some of its features—I know M. Esquirol, of the Salpetrière, in France—he is a well-known author on epilepsy—I know, from those and other works, that convulsions of an epileptic character, violent enough to cause death, are of frequent occurrence, without the patient entirely losing all consciousness—epilepsy, properly so called, is sudden in its attacks—the patient falls down at once, with a shriek—it very often occurs at night and in bed—it sometimes happens that its existence is known to a young man's or woman's family without being known to himself or herself—that comes within the range of my own experience—convulsions which the authors of whom I have spoken, and persons of medical science generally, do not class properly as epilepsy, but as convulsions of an epileptic character, are sometimes attended with premonitory symptoms; and the patient is sometimes thrown into tetaniform convulsions—it may sometimes happen that, pending the struggle of the convulsions of an epileptic character, actual epilepsy comes on, and the patient dies from spasm—it very often happens, in convulsions of an epileptic character, that a patient may have suffered in the night and be well the next morning, and as well the next day as if he had had no fit at all, more especially where adults are seized for the first time—when an adult is seized for the first time, it is consistent with my experience that several fits follow each other during a short period—I heard</p>

               <p>the deposition of Mr. Bamford read—if it were true that Mr. Cook's mind appeared distressed and irritable the afternoon before he died, I should infer from that, considering the excitement and elation under which he had formerly laboured, that he was under a state of depression—I recollect what was proved to have been said of what happened in the middle of the Sunday night—I should infer from that, supposing it were true that he represented himself to be mad for ten minutes, and that it was occasioned by a quarrel in the street, that he had been seized with some sudden cramp or spasm—sup<lb/>posing there were no such cramp, and that he meant to tell the truth, I should refer what he said, to nervous and mental excitement; if there were no cramp or spasms, there must have been some disturbance of the brain—as to the spots in the stomach, I stated that I differed in opinion from some gentlemen who had been called and who attached no importance to them—I said I did not believe that inflammation could be absent and these spots present—I have known in my own experience of serious consequence of a convulsive character, arising from, or reasonably imputed to, spots of that description—that case occurred about twenty years ago—it was published in 1820—the case I have seen, would be about eighteen months ago—it was a case of death, and I was examining the stomach—that was not the cause of death, it was a case of fever—I found these spots in the stomach—I did not know what they were, and consulted all the authors who had treated on the mucous structure of the stomach, and could find no account of it bat in one, which I have here—that is an essay by Dr. Spode Bowen—he is deceased—he practised in Edinburgh—this is the case he speaks of—"it was taken from a stomach in the possession of my friends Dr. Sharpey and Dr. A. Thompson, who thought the greater part of its surface presented nothing remarkable excepting being more than usually disposed in regular folds—about three and a half inches from the pylorus this disappears and the surface then displays a crowded assemblage of small eminences each about one-sixth of an inch in diameter, and marked in the centre by an orifice distinct to the naked eye—some glandular appearances are also visible around the cardia—the stomach was taken from a young girl who died suddenly while apparently in a state of perfect health."</p>

I am a doctor of medicine, and medical officer to the St. Martin's workhouse—I have had very considerable experience of convulsive disorders—they admit of great variety of symptoms, very great indeed—the causes of them vary from what are called chronic convul<lb/>sions to rigid oposthotonos or tetanic—hysteric convulsions are very fre<lb/>quently accompanied with oposthotonos of the muscles of the back and of the limbs—the different cases vary as to the frequency of the recurrences, and as to the muscles affected, very much—periodicity, or recurring at the same intervals, is very common; I can mention a very remarkable instance of that—I mean recurring at the same month, the same hour, the same day, after twelve months, and it occurred in my own pupil—he was attacked on Christmas night, he was called up, and fell near the door—on Christmas night twelve months he had the same kind of attack exactly, and at the same hour—I have known this very common at shorter periods, such as twelve or twenty-four hours—these disorders run so imperceptibly one into the other, that it is almost impossible for the most experienced medical man to decide where one kind terminates and the other begins—hysteria is frequently accompanied by tetanic symptoms; I apply that answer to males as well as females—epileptic attacks are accompanied frequently with tetanic spasms, and hysteria also—I have not heard the witnesses in this case, except to<lb/>day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the convulsions of epilepsy sometimes assume a tetanic character; how many cases have you seen of epilepsy in which that has been the case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In all cases of epilepsy there are violent convulsions—I cannot tell how many I have seen assume the tetanic character; perhaps twenty—I will say that I have seen twenty—it has not gone as far as oposthotonos; not the extreme oposthotonos, not the oposthotonos of tetanus—the whole body has been stretched out, and the head thrown back, but not the marked symptoms of oposthotonos a slight degree of it—I attended to the description given by Mr. Jones as to the symptoms of Mr. Cook; that the whole body was so stiffened that he could not raise it, and so bowed that it would have lain upon it's heels and the back of it's head if it had been put horizontally—I have never seen epilepsy like that, not to the same degree—I can only repeat what I said before; that I have seen a slight case—I have seen the body so stiff that if you attempted to lift the body at the back of the neck you would be obliged to lift the whole body—you could lift the body with sufficient force—I have never seen it so that the body would have rested on the head and heels—you may have convulsions of the same character occurring from other causes, tetanic convulsions sometimes occur from the operation of various poisons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am putting to you natural disease, or natural tetanus; I am not dealing with poisons; keep to natural diseases: did you ever know symp<lb/>toms of oposthotonos, to that extent, arise from anything but tetanus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not within my own experience; I have read of epilepsy being accom<lb/>panied with tetanic convulsions; the degree of oposthotonos was not men<lb/>tioned—as far as my experience goes, epilepsy, when it assumes that marked character, has always been accompanied by more or less unconsciousness—I have read in a publication of Dr. Marshall Hall's, that sometimes uncon<lb/>sciousness is not present; he does not mention whether death' took place or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that make all the difference? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Undoubtedly; the disease would be more severe—I cannot give you the narrative of a single case that I know of, either of my own experience or on record in medical works of authority, where there has been death from epilepsy, and consciousness has</p>

               <p>continued till death; but if death had occurred in any of those cases described by Dr. Marshall Hall, that would have supplied a case—Dr, Marshall Hall is, I believe, living—I do not know whether he is in thia city.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you feel yourself warranted in inferring that these granules caused epilepsy in this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think they might have done so; and if I put aside the hypothesis of poisoning by strychnia, I would undertake to state my opinion that they did—several of the symptoms described by Mr. Jones, the sudden paroxysm, the stiffening of the body, the convulsions of all the muscles, both of the trunk and the limbs, and the complete oposthotonos which has been described, are also common to other diseases, but are cer<lb/>tainly consistent with death by strychnia—I think there would be some twitches before oposthotonos came on—the stiffness of the neck would very likely amount to a premonitory symptom of tetanic convulsions about to come on—I have seen it in tetanus, it would be the first symp<lb/>tom, I think—if I had no other cause to which I could ascribe the death, I should ascribe it to epilepsy; but. in this case I admit that two of the symptoms, namely, the preservation of consciousness and the complete oposthotonos, are inconsistent with my experience of epilepsy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you state what symptoms of that disease, when it has proved fatal, you particularly refer to as resembling those that have been stated in the case of Mr. Cook? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps I could not do better than describe a case which I myself saw, a girl, ten years of age, was under my care in Nov 1850—I supposed she had suffered from scarlet fever, for she had a slight feverish attack, and scarlet fever was in the neighbourhood—she recovered no far that my visits ceased on the 26th Nov.—I left her amused and merry in the morning—at half-past ten in the evening a messenger came, and I was called hastily to see her, and found her dying—she was supported upright, at her own request, by her sister—the face was pale, the muscles of the face rigid, the arms rigid, the fingers clenched, the respiratory muscles completely fixed and rigid, and with all combined an intense agony and restlessness such as I have never witnessed—there was perfect consciousness; the child knew me, and expressed herself as in intense agony, and eagerly took from my hands some brandy and water in a spoon—I left at that time to go to my house, twenty or thirty houses off, to got some chloroform for the purpose of producing anistheria by chloroform vapour—on returning, the head was drawn back, I could detect no respiration, and the heart had stopped; the eyes remained fixed open, and the body just resembling a statue: she was dead—I did not observe whether the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> came on at it's usual time or later, but on the following day it was on when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—unfortunately I left the body in the amis of the sister, and it was laid out afterwards, so that I cannot say what change took place—on</p>

               <p>the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination I found the brain slightly congested—a portion of the upper part of the spinal cord deemed normal and healthy—(I have not made a written report)—the lungs were collapsed—the heart was in such a state of firm spasmodic contraction, and so empty, that I remarked that the blood in it might have been rinsed out, it was so perfectly clean and free from blood—I found no disease which could account for death—there were no appearances of functional or structural disturbance, and no heart disease, except a slight effosion of serum in one pleural cavity; I forget on which side; I believe the right side—I examined the upper part only of the spinal cord, and it was in a normal state—the history of the friends was, that the child was unusually well at rapper, and very merry; that she leaped into bed mervily, and, on lying down, suddenly jumped up, and said, "I am going to die," and begged her sister to rub her—there had been nothing of the same kind in the family—the father was then dead—the mother was a woman of fifty years of age at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that in your opinion that it was a case of <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris? A.</hi> I do—it accords with all the descriptions of <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi> by the best authors—E—was the first who described it—it has since then been described by Wat<lb/>son, Latham, Bolleau in France, Sir Everard Holme, and Ridge—what <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi> arises from, is quite another question—it was the opinion of the dis<lb/>tinguished Jenner that it arises from the small coronary vessels of the heart—frequently that disease does exist, but not always—it did not in my case, for I looked specially—<hi rend="italic">angina peatoris</hi> has been laid down as a ease also of valvular disease of the heart; might I explain that the coronary arteries supply the heart itself with nourishment—it is also a disease of the valves of the heart—there have been many cases" met with where there has been no discovered cause—I know it is <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi>, as I do ether diseases: we assume—diseases from certain classes of symptoms, and by those names we call those diseases—it is called <hi rend="italic">angina pectorie</hi> because there is oppression of the chest—it is marked by that; it is anguish of the cheat—Dr. Watson or Dr. Latham describes that the pain is so excruciating that they feel as if the chest was in a vice—those symptoms which I class under <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi> are not exactly those symptoms that would be produced by taking strychnia—the difference is this, in <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi> the patient requests to be rubbed—friction gives relief; the hands generally are asked to be rubbed—I have not seen a case of strychnia poison, but from my reading I do not know that it is the fact; it may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear the Leeds case, and of the lady asking her husband to rub her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Assuming that that wan a case of strychnia, I must say the two forms of death are so similar, that I feel there would be a very great difficulty in distinguishing <hi rend="italic">angina</hi> from the effects of strychnia—I wish to add, with this difference, that <hi rend="italic">angina</hi> is paroxysmal, it comes and goes, and strychnia would not be so likely to assume that type—you would not expect that to be so for many months—in this ease it ended in the first paroxysm—as regards symptoms, I know no difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How then are you justified in cases where you discover no abnormal conditions of the heart, or it's arteries, in setting down the death to <hi rend="italic">angina Pretoris?

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing that the symptoms were referable to two causes, in the absence of all evidence, what is there to warrant you in setting it down to one in preference to the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I candidly admit that in that case, if I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140212"/>
               <p>had known as much of the analogy which exists between the two classes of symptoms as I do now, I should hare gone on to conduct an analysis—I have had only two cases of this description in my own experience, and I have heard of another one; that was a case of organic disease of the heart—I cannot speak exactly as to the proportion the cases of <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi> bear to cases in which there is no abnormal appearance after death; but, I believe, in six, seven, or eight carefully recorded cases, there has been no pathological lesion found—<hi rend="italic">angina pectoris</hi> is attended with most painful symptoms before it terminates in death; it is very rare—I am not pre<lb/>pared with data as to how many cases are reported—the paroxysms ter<lb/>minating in death may run on for not more than eight minutes—it does not manifest itself by painful symptoms before; it makes a sudden appearance; and kills at the first attack, but not always; not generally—I think the person will generally have more than one paroxysm in <hi rend="italic">anyita</hi> as a general rule—in the case of the girl that I mentioned the head was somew hat bent back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that what would be called, in the medical sense of the term, oposthotonos, the beading back of the body, so that it would rest on its head and heels? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Granting that a body is sitting upright when I see it, I cannot conceive how the body would rest on its head and heels—then was then rigidity, not amounting to oposthotonos, but still very marked—the body had been laid out—the neck was so stiffly bent back, that if the body had been laid down, and the lower limbs, which did not so especially come under my attention, had been at stiff in proportion as the neck, I have no doubt that it would be properly classed as opo<lb/>sthotonos from tetanus—I did not look at the legs to speak with accuracy about them—the case was so firmly fixed in my mind that I can never forget it—during the time I was with the poor child she was so intensely restless, and desirous to be changed, that her sister moved her again and again, her only cry was to be moved, as if nothing else would relieve her; so that I did not pay attention to the condition of the lower extremities—I did not send a note of the case to any publication—I believe I reported it to the Medical Society of London—I have not inquired for it for the purposes of this inquiry—I have seen the hands firmly clenched after death so that they were difficult to open, not in epilepsy only, but in many forma; in cases where there has been violent convulsions—I saw them once firmly clenched after death had occurred from haemorrhage, and where the convulsions were violent—I can only say in a general sense that I have seen the hands clenched over and over again, and have paid no atten<lb/>tion to it; but my belief is from seeing persons die, and I have watched with great interest, for the purpose of ascertaining how death really took place, in various classes of cases, for six years past, that the clenching of the hands is, in many respects, a mere matter of accident; it depends upon what the patient is doing at the moment of death; if he is grasping the bed-clothes, for instance, the hands will remain clenched, and he might have a portion of the bed-clothes in his hands—that very often happens in cases of sinking from inflammatory disease—I cannot state positively that I have seen the hands firmly clenched so as to be difficult to open after death, in cases exclusive of tetanus.</p>

               <p>in his house, and went home—I did not order anything to be made that night at the Albion for Mr. Cook—I did the next day—I invited Mr. Cook to dine with me on the Saturday—on the Friday, after I dined with Mr. Palmer, I asked Mr. Cook and Mr. Palmer to dine with me on the Saturday following—Cook did not dine with me—he sent me a message about 12 or 1 o'clock, that he was not well, and he thought that he should not leave his room, and he did not dine with me—I had a boiled leg of mutton for dinner, and I sent some of the broth to him—it went from the Albion in a jug, by a charwoman from Palmer's, named Rowley, I think Ann Rowley—shortly before Mr. Cook's death I borrowed money for bin—I borrowed 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and negotiated a loan from Pratt of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in May and August—I have given the particulars to the prosecution, I have been subpœnaed for the prosecution—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in May, 1855, I am almost positive, because I think it was at the Shrewsbury races—I do not now recollect whether I borrowed any other sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Cook—I nego<lb/>tiated two loans, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., through Pratt—I borrowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mrs. Palmer and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>: of William Palmer, to make up the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect any other 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I might have—I only know of my own knowledge that Palmer and Cook were jointly interested in one horse—I told the solicitor for the prosecution the same—it was Pyrrhine—they were in the habit of betting for each other very frequently—when Palmer's horses were going to run, Mr. Cook would ask Palmer to allow him to put money on because he thought he should get better odds; and when Cook's horses were going to run, Palmer would ask him to allow him to put on—they put on for each other frequently; it was a common occurrence—I have seen Mr. Palmer's assistant, Thirlby, dress Cook's throat with caustic—I am not quite positive whether it was before or after Shrewsbury races—I cannot tell exactly the times, I think it was chiefly before the races—I have here a genuine signature of Mr. Cook's, which, having seen him write, I know to be his writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are two notes I received from him, and these instructions for the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him write the instructions—they are for a mortgage—one is signed "J. P. Cook," and the other, "J. Parsons Cook"—I saw that signed, but the other was sent in an envelope, which I did not keep—here are two notes and a memorandum—I was not present when a writ was served upon Mr. Cook—he was served with a writ, I know—I cannot say that he gave me any instructions as to the writ shortly before his death, instructions to enter an appearance-(<hi rend="italic">Letters read</hi>: "My dear sir,—I have been in a devil of a fix about the bill, but have at last settled it, although at a cost of an extra two guineas, for the damned discounter had issued a writ against me, and I am very much disgusted at it—John Parsons Cook")—I have destroyed the envelope in which that letter was conveyed—they were both addressed to me ("25th June, 1855.—Dear <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi>,—I should like to have the bill renewed for two months more; can it be done? let me know by return; at 4, Victoria street, Holborn-bridge.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he apply to you in Dec., 1854, to attest a proposal on the life of his brother Walter for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Solicitors' and General Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been told there is such a thing—I cannot say if he applied to me to sttest such a document—if I could see the document I could say whether it was my handwriting—it is so long since; but if I could see any document with my name to it, I could recognise it instantly—I am on my oath, and am speaking to the best of my belief, I do not recollect—I will not swear that I was not applied to for that purpose, nor that I was, but if I could see the document, I could recognise it immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In Jan., 1855, were you applied to by Palmer to attest a proposal lor 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Prince of Wales Office on his brother Walter's, life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that either—13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a large sum for Walter Palmer—I do not know that he was a man of nothing, that he his not a shilling in the world—I know that Walter Palmer had money, because he lived independent, out of business—I do not know that he was then in great distress, and that he was at that time an uncertificated bankrupt—he had been a bankrupt—that was six years before—at least that—he had not done anything for himself since—he had been in no business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know he was at that time living upon an allowance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week from his mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell the allowance, I never heard what it was—I know that he had an allowance—I do not know that he had anything from any other source—I think his brother William gave him money at different times—I do not say thai he had an allowance from his mother, because I never saw it paid, and I do not know the amount—in 1864 I think I resided partly with William Palmer—sometimes I was at his mother's—I slept at his mother's sometimes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you slept at the mother's, where did you sleep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a room—it was not in liers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you, upon your oath, whether you were not intimate with her, you know what I mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not—I was no more intimate with her than a proper intimacy—I slept there, I cannot say the number of times, but frequently: I should say two or three times a week—I had my own place of abode in Bugeley—I am a single man—this habit and practice of sleeping two or three times a week at Mrs. Palmer's, continued for several years—I had my own lodgings at Bugeley at the time, my own chambers—I had chambers in Rugeley—lodgings—I had a bedroom—I should say my lodging is nearly a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Palmer's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you be so good as to explain how it happened that, having your own place of abode and your own bedroom, that for several years you slept two or three times a week in Mrs. Palmer's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes some of the members of the family used to come and visit her, her sons; Joseph used—he has latterly resided at Liverpool—I should think for two years—before that he lived at a place seven miles from Rugeley, and he went to a place called, I think, Worley, about eleven miles off—Walter used to come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140224"/>
               <p>and visit Mrs. Palmer—sometimes he lived at Stafford, and sometimes he was at Liverpool—he did not live at Rugeley long together, sometimes two or three weeks—he died at Stafford, I believe—I was not present at the time—I understood so when I returned from Thurlow—when I went to see the members of the family, I used to stop and have a glass or two of gin and water, and play at cards—I went to the mother's to see them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you did not sleep at the mother's to see them; how was it that you did not go home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had no particular reason why I did not—I used to have some gin and water, and play at cards, and smoke, and if it was late they used to say, "You had better stop all night"—this went on three times a week for several years—but I used to stop there frequently when there was no one there, neither the mother, nor the sons, nor any one—they used to go to Buxton for a month in the summer—I have slept there when the sons were not there, and when the mother was—I could not state the number of times that happened—two or three times a week, for two or three months together, and sometimes I did not go nigh, for a week, or a month I have been away from the house—and then I would go for two or three nights for two or three weeks, when there was nobody there but the lady—there was only the mother, and the daughter, and the servants—I could have gone home on those nights, but I did not—I could not say that I did when I did not—I mean to say before this jury that there was nothing but a proper intimacy between myself and Mrs. Palmer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have called your attention to two of these proposals; were you called upon to attest another proposal in the Universal Office for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the life of Walter Palmer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—let me look at the paper and I will tell you—I do not recollect that I was, but if I could set any letter, or my name written to it, I could say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you as an attorney and a man of business, do you mean to say that you cannot give me an answer whether you were applied to by William Palmer to attest a proposal for an insurance upon his brother's life, more than once, for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect it, but if I could see any document or any letter to remind me of the circumstance I would not deny it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the signature of Walter Palmer, and say whether that is a good imitation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe that to be Walter Palmer's signature—the attestation, "signed, sealed, and delivered," is in Mr. Pratt's handwriting—most likely I might receive that from Mr. Pratt myself—I cannot swear it—I think it is very likely it might have been sent to William Palmer—I think Mr. Palmer gave it to me—I believe he did—I do not recollect—I have heard talk of this document, and I have asked to see it many times—most likely William Palmer gave it to me—it was not signed at that time—lie did give it me—I have no doubt he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If that be the docuraeut which he gave you, bearing Walter Palmer's signature, and the writing of Mr. Pratt, which you say is his, upon your oath, is not that your attestation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I tell you it is not—I believe it not to be—I believe I had that document from William Palmer—I believe it not to be my handwriting—I remember it by the manner in which it is folded, and the dirty mark, because I carried it out shooting, and I had a powder flask—it is dirty—it got dirty in my jacket pocket, and I recognise it by that—I applied to the Midland Counties Insurance Office to be appointed their agent at Rugeley—that was in October, 1855—if you would allow me, if you are going on with the examination, I should like to fetch all the documents and papers—I did apply to the Midland Counties Office to be appointed their agent in October, 1855—I sent them a proposal for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the life of Bate—I recollect it very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did William Palmer apply to you to send that proposal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bate and Mr. Palmer came together with the proposal to my office—I knew Bate at that time—they came together, and asked me whether I knew if there was any agent for that office in the town of Rugeley, and I told them I never heard of one—they asked me afterwards whether I would write and get an appointment, because Bate wanted to raise some money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Bid you send to the Midland Office, and get appointed their agent, in order that this insurance for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might be effected on Bate's life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote to the office for the purpose of getting appointed then: agent—whatever I did, I did it to get the insurance effected upon Bate's life for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will explain the reason why that occurred, I never was an agent for any office, Bate was at thai tame superintending William Palmer's stud and stables, whether at 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week I cannot tell, he was living at Rugeley; after this I went to the widow of Walter Palmer, to get her to give up her claim upon the policy of her husband—she was at Liver<lb/>pool—Mr. William Palmer gave me a document from Mr. Pratt to take to her—I think it must have been directed to kim—I believe he gave it me—the widow said that she should like her solicitor to see it, and I said, "By all means"—she finally refuted to do it—I brought back the document—I said, "I have no instructions to leave it, but if Mr. William Palmer wishes you to do it, it shall be returned to you."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you got that document, the signature to which you say you doubt whether it is in your handwriting or not, do not you know that Walter Palmer signed the document, and that the signature to it is his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it is—I believe he ultimately had something—he had a house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140226"/>
               <p>furnished for him—I do not know that he got a pill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell that that bill was never paid—I do not recollect knowing that from William Palmer—I knew William furnished the house—I do not know that there was a man put into that house, who kept possession of it from the time that the assignment was executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will refresh your memory a little as to these proposals—look at that (<hi rend="italic">handing a paper to the witness</hi>), and tell me whether that is your hand<lb/>writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is my own signature—I do not recollect that I was applied to by William Palmer in the month of December, 1854, to attest a proposal upon his brother's life for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Solicitors' and General Office, I might have been—it is from memory I am speaking, and therefore I wish to be as correct as I can—I say I have no doubt I might, the time is so long ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that document (<hi rend="italic">handing a paper to the witness</hi>) and see who<lb/>ther, in a month afterwards, you were applied to by William Palmer to attest another proposal for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my signature also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Refreshing your memory by that document; you said if you had the document you could tell, have you any doubt that in the month of January, 1855, you were called upon by William Palmer to attest another proposal upon his brother's life for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in another office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you will give me the paper, perhaps I can tell you—this is my signature to it—the body seeins to have been filled up by Mr. Palmer—I might have signed it in blank—I cannot swear that I did or did not—I nave some doubt whether I did not sign several of those in blank—the body is in William Palmer's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not trifle, sir, with the Court, and with the jury, and myself; upon your oath, looking at that document, do not you know that William Palmer applied to you to attest a proposal upon his brother's life for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in January in that office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did apply to me for a proposal in some offices in January—one was for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I might be applied to to attest another for a like sum in the Universal Office, for this simple reason, they might say that they had not insured in the other, and I had no reason to know—I do not recollect having any answers at all—I am not aware of being applied to by William Palmer to attest a proposal to the Universal Office after the execution of that assignment of the policy which I knew that Walter Palmer signed—I think I might venture to swear that I was not—I should be very sorry, if I was not quite positive, to speak that which was not true—I do not know when the document bears date—I have never seen the assignment till I saw it this morning—William Palmer gave it to me, but it was not signed then—I do not recollect that I was present when it was signed—it is a very good imitation of my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you were not present when it was signed, when Walter Palmer executed the deed of assignment; now, be cautious, you will hear of this another day if you do not take care; will you swear upon your oath that you were not present when Walter Palmer signed that document? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I say that the "Jeremiah Smith" is very much like my writing—this part,"Solicitor, Rugeley," does not look like mine—I am not quite positive whether, upon some occasion or other, I did not attest a deed of assignment by Walter Palmer to his brother of his interest in the policy for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as I said before, I believe the "Jeremiah Smith" is very much like my writing, but "Rugeley" is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you the question upon your oath, whether at some time or other you did not attest the assignment by Walter Palmer to William Palmer of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140227"/>
               <p>the policy for 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might—as I said before, it is a very good imitation—I might have attested it—I really do not recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you get a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for doing it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wish to have it brought to my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that (<hi rend="italic">a paper</hi>) and say whether you did not see William Pal<lb/>mer write that on the counterfoil of his cheque book; is that his hand<lb/>writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is William Palmer's handwriting—I might have seen him write it—I cannot swear positively that I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you get a piece of paper, and go to the bank and get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I most likely might—I might have got it from the bank, but not for the purpose of signing that document—I say that I might have got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the bank, but not for attesting that document—I am not positive that I got it for attesting the signature of Walter Palmer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That piece of paper seems to burn your fingers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, upon my honour it does not—I am come here to speak the truth as far as my memory serves me, for or against—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I speak of—he did not have it to enable him to go to London to take up an acceptance—he went to Shrewsbury races with it—I am speaking of the time when the money was lent by Mrs. Palmer and William Palmer—I think it was in May—I believe Shrewsbury races take place in May, the early part of May—I do not know what became of the bill—Mr. Cook gave him a bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had the absolute cash—I brought 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from William Palmer's mother, a hundred pound note, and he had that which Mr. Palmer gave—the bill was drawn in favour of William Palmer—that is the bill that is referred to in one of these notes—it was cashed—it was charged two guineas—I do not know what became of it—he writes to me about a money lender issuing a writ—that money lender was Mr. Pratt, I believe—I do not know that—when the bill was given I handed it over to Mr. Palmer—what he did with it I do not know—I cannot tell whether Palmer discounted it with Mr. Pratt—I have never seen the bill since—that was not at the very time that William Palmer was short of money—he was not short of money because he lent Mr. Cook 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that he wanted some money to make up the sum of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payable to Mr. Sargent—he lent Mr. Cook 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he lent him 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he took 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the accommodation—I weni once to Mr. Palmer when he was in Stafford gaol, but never spoke to him on the subject of this trial—during the time that I was there an officer was in the room—I was at the inquest, but I was not examined, excepting there was something named about the assignment, and I said, if it was produced I would say whether it was my handwriting as the attesting witness—I was not present at the inquest on Mr. Cook—T was staying in the town.</p>

I saw the prisoner go up stairs, and saw him putting a paper parcel in his pocket—that was a month or two after we found the parcel, he remained in the service about two months after that—I have heard the conversation Evans has detailed, it is true—two or three days after the parcel was found I was talking to the prisoner, and he said, "The bark is not worth so much a pound as they have stated, by a good bit"—I said, "How can you know?"—he said, "I have a friend in London who is in the habit of buying bark," and that his friend had been an assistant in a doctor's shop—he said that we might all be as happy as the birds in the air if it was not for that b—y black-legged old b—, meaning Evans; and that we might put a few shillings into each other's pocket if it was not for him—I told him that I should not have anything to do with it, he would not put any money into my pocket that way—he said that we were not like they were at other places, but we were all against each other—I was present when the parcel was found by Evans—I was not down when the conversation between Evans and the prisoner began, but I heard the latter part—I heard the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of No, 5, Lauderdale-buildings, Aldersgate-street. Beckley lodged with me till some short time after Nov. last, and the prisoner used to come to see him, sometimes once a week, and sometimes twice—he came invariably on Saturday evenings, and occasionally on Tuesday evenings, and he invariably carried a basket; and on one occa<lb/>sion I saw in it something in a brown paper, parcel—one Saturday night, about 6 o'clock in the evening, it might be three weeks prior to Beckley, being taken, the prisoner came; I opened the door, and he asked for Beckley, I told him he was not within; he seemed vexed, and said that he had come a long journey, from Stratford, and was tired—I told him if he liked to leave his banket, which seemed to be heavy, I would take care of it till Beckley came—he declined leaving it, and said that he would go over to the public house opposite, and await Beckley's return, if I would let one of my children let him know when Beckley came in, and invited me to partake of a little porter at the public house—I told my children, and then went over with him to the public house where he put a brown paper parcel on a form, and I saw a brown powder which seemed to ooze from it, as it does from these parcels produced—I did not remain two minutes with him, I had no drink—I did not see him afterwards at my house, but my children told me something—subsequent to Beckley's apprehension, I saw him at my house and opened the door to him, and I met him in Barbican after Beckley'a apprehension, and noticed that his whiskers were shaved off.</p>

               <p>morning, on 1st May, I saw a van belonging to the Great Northern Rail<lb/>way Company, in King William-street—the prisoner was in that van in a stooping position, which induced me to watch him—I saw him take out of his pocket, under his waistcoat, this hammer (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—he next proceeded to prise up the lid of the top box—there were two boxes—after he had raised the lid and released the nails, he lifted the lid up and took a salmon out, and placed it under some straw—he lifted the lid of the same box again and took another salmon, and secreted it in the same place—after" he had done that he nailed the lid down again with this hammer—he then got down and got on the driving box, apparently going to drive off—I told him I wanted him, and he must come down—he said, "I am going to deliver these goods at the South Eastern Railway station, and must go"—I said, "Yon must go with me; I must deliver you and the goods at the police station"—he got down, and I said, "How about these fish?"—he said, "For God's sake, don't say anything about it; if you do I am a ruined man"—after some little time I got the assistance of a brother officer to take charge of the van, and I took the prisoner—in going along, he said, "For God's sake, take no notice of it; I will give you a sovereign or anything"—I said if he would give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I could not do it—in going along, he said, "I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will give you anything in the world"—he was taken to the station, and while the charge was being booked, he took this hammer out of his pocket under his waistcoat, and said, "This is what I opened the box with"—I found the salmon secreted in the straw under the tarpaulin.</p>

Between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning, on 1st May, I saw the van which the prisoner drove—amongst the goods were three salmon boxes—I noticed that the lid of one was a little loose—it was open about half an inch when he left the station—they were to be taken to the South Eastern Railway—the Van stopped at London-bridge, and the prisoner told me to go down to the market to see whether there was any ice—I went and was</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of St. Stephen's, Coleman-street, and lire in Little Bell-alley. On 10th March, about a quarter past 7 o'clock in the evening, I was crossing Moorgate-street, and saw a large crowd of persons—I crossed to see the cause, and saw Ginn attempting to take the two prisoners—they were struggling with him, and Peters was kicking him—I took Quaid by the collar, and I said if he had done no harm he could not object to go to the station—he took Ginn by the collar—I took hold of Quaid, and kept him at arm's length from Peters—I saw Ginn with his staff, and saw him strike Peters a slight blow on the side of the head—Peters was kicking him very violently at the time, and Ginn called to me, "He has got my truncheon," and I saw it in Peters's hand—Peters said, "It is mine"—I seized Peters by the right wrist, and prevented him from using it, while I had Quaid by the collar—Ginn was nearly exhausted—I saw Peters taken to the station—I went with him—there were four to take him—I got a severe kick on my hand—when at the station I examined Peters's shoes—they were tipped at the heels, and had hobnails at the front, enough to kill a man with a kick.</p>

Sunday morning, 20th April, I had occasion to come down stairs to the water closet, and found a man bursting out through the window on to a bench underneath, it—the house stands up a passage, and the window faces the street—I pursued the man, calling "Stop thief!"—I did not see his face, only his back, but I never lost sight of him till I left the constable in pursuit of him and then both the man and the constable got out of my sight—to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man; he is the man that was brought back—I could not swear to him, because I did not see his face, but he resembles the man in size and dress—I after<lb/>wards examined the window, it was open, the lower part slides up, two panes of glass were broken, and two nails which fastened down the sash were removed.</p>

On Tuesday, 1st April, before 12 o'clock, I went to the Rose and Crown public house, in Burn-street—I remained there until between 3 and 4 o'clock—I went there to see a person on business—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Of with me in gold, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I am quite positive I had it safe while I was there—I had a portion of some drink there—I was there, I should say, an hour and a half, or more, before I saw any of the prisoners—my friend and I went into the skittle ground, and played—there were various parties there who were acquainted with me—somewhere about 2 o'clock the prisoners came in—they each came in separately—Bands wanted to force me to bet, and I would not—I was going to the bar to get some spirits, when Rands caught me by the collar, and said, "You shan't go, for you owe me a shilling"—the other prisoners were present—I had betted a penny or two with some parties on the ground; I do not know who they were; I did not bet with either of the prisoners that I know of—I had not played with either of them, only with my two friends, Breewood and Henley—when Rands collared me, each of the other prisoners held me in a position that I could scarcely tell what they were about; they threw me across a rail, and held me, whilst one of them got his hand into my left hand pocket, and took out the money—I could not say who it was that rifled my pockets, because I was lying with my back across the rail, and my head down—I felt somebody's hand in my pocket, and they took my money out—I am quite sure that the three prisoners were engaged in holding me down at that time—they then left me, and escaped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, at No. 28, Praed-street, Paddington. I was at the Rose and Crown on this afternoon, and saw Mr. Fudge there, playing skittles with several persons, in fours—he played with Rands—the other two prisoners were sitting in the ground; I had not seen them with Rands—I saw Fudge attempt to go out of the ground; Rands laid hold of him by the collar, and thrust him back into the skittle ground, and said he owed him a shilling, what he had betted—Fudge said, "I owe you no shilling"—Rands said, "You do"—Fudge said he did not, and Rands backed him into the skittle ground by the collar—the other two prisoners were then in the ground; there were four of them altogether; one has not been taken—Fudge was backed across the bar—M'Kenley laid hold of him by</p>

On the day the lady got into the omnibus I remember the prisoner coming, but I do not exactly remember the place—it was probably between the Bank and Cheapside—he sat the second on the left hand side of the omnibus—at the bottom of Cheapside the lady called to me to get out—I saw her get up from her seat—she could scarcely get up, she was entangled with something—when she got up she turned round and looked on the seat, and after she set her foot on the step she looked at the bottom of the omnibus—I looked, but I did not see the purse—the lady stepped on the ground, and the pri<lb/>soner immediately got up, pushed by the lady, and ran out, and at that instant I saw the purse on the floor of the omnibus—I chased the prisoner round St. Paul's Churchyard, and caught him.</p>

The prisoner is my wife—she came out of prison on New Year's day—I fetched her home, and she lived with me till 27th March—on the Sunday before this the prisoner's sister had come up from the country on a visit—she and the prisoner were very good friends at first—on the Tuesday I was going to take my wife and her sister to a place of amusement, but instead of that I went over to my own sister's, at Rotherhithe—I left my wife at my sister's, and returned home to business—I expected my wife home the next morning—she never arrived—I staid at home till 11 o'clock at night—I then went out to see if I could find her anywhere in the neighbourhood—I did not go to Rotherhithe to fetch her—I heard something about her, and when I got home, I found the prisoner and her sister quarrelling in the kitchen—the prisoner said to me, "You have been out with some one, and could not come to fetch me"—I tried to make peace—she tore her sister's bonnet off and threw it on the fire—I begged her to be quiet, and tried all I possibly could to keep them both quiet—I could not, and I left them to put on my cap and jacket, and when I came back to the kitchen she flew at me, and scratched my face—I said I was determined I would not put up with that—she said, "I will do for you, I will smash the windows"—she took the poker, and was breaking the glass—I went to take the poker, and received two blows on the front of my head—I fell back insensible into the arms of some one—I was taken to St. George's Hospital; I did not remain there—I continued an out patient about five weeks.</p>

On Friday night, 28th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in High-street, Shoreditch—when I got to Hare-court, which I did not know before, two men came out of it; one of them jumped at me, and snatched at my watch, and the taller one hit me a How under the ear—I fell against the corner of the alley, and then ran after the other party, and was struck a violent blow—the men both went up the court—I ran after the one who had taken my watch, the shorter one—I cannot say who he was, as it was done in a moment—in the court I was struck another violent blow on the back of the neck—I cannot tell by whom, am I was running, the person was on one side of me—that knocked me senseless to the ground, and stunned me—mine was a silver hunting watch, with No. 8172 on it, and my initials—I have not seen it since—this chain was left hanging round my neck.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office in St. Martin's-Grand—on the morning of the 15th April I saw Blackburn, the plumber, clear out a water closet on the basement floor of the General Post Office—it was the second one on the left, coming out of the London District Office—I believe it is one of the closets appropriated to the letter carriers—Blackburn cleared out the pan, and stopped it, by putting in some brown paper—after he had done this, I watched that closet—I went to the back of it, to what is called an air shaft, and looked through a grating—there is a gas light in the closet, which is burning all day; it was burning then—I watched therefrom about half-past 6 o'clock till about half-past 6—Smee, my brother officer, then came and relieved me—up to that time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140275"/>
               <p>nobody had entered the closet—I still continued to watch—I was away for a short time, but about half-past 7 o'clock I heard the door leading from the office shut, and I went back, looked through the grating, and saw the prisoner enter the closet—the grating is at the back of the closet, at the right hand of a person on the seat, it forms part of the wall—the prisoner sat down on the seat—I heard some paper tearing when he was sitting down—I then saw his hand go behind him—he got up in a minute or so, and went out—as soon as he had left, I went and fetched Blackburn, and instructed him to search the closet—I left Smee at the grating—Smee had a better view of the closet than I had, because he was more at the front—I saw Blackburn search the pan, and take out some pieces of paper which appeared to be portions of a letter—I have it here—after the pieces were taken out Blackburn washed them and pot them together, and then they were given to me by Mr. Sculthorpe, and have been in my possession ever since—after the papers had been examined, I went to look after the prisoner in the Sorting Office—that was about half-past 7 o'clock—I could not find him there—I gave information to Mr. Gapes, the inspector of letter carriers, of what I had seen—I afterwards went into the Sorting Office again, about 8 o'clock, and picked out the prisoner, and he was taken into Mr. Sculthorpe's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post Office. On the morning of the 15th April I was watching this water closet—I relieved Peak about half-past 6 o'clock—it was one of the letter carriers' closets, the second from the corner, next the iron gate—I remained there until a quarter past 7 o'clock—I could see the entire of the closet through the grating—there is a gas light in the closet—up to that time nobody had entered the closet—at a quarter past 7 o'clock the prisoner came in—he turned himself round, and fastened the door—he then arranged his clothes and sat down on the seat—I then saw him put his left hand into his left coat pocket at the side of him (it was a shooting coat with two pockets)—he took something out, of the appearance of a letter, and brought it in front of him—he tore something with his hand of the appearance of a letter, but he sat in such a stooping position that I could not exactly see whether it was a letter or not—the paper was torn up in small pieces—I then saw him put his right hand behind him to the pan, and drop pieces of paper of the appearance of a letter—I saw a post stamp on part of it as it was felling—it was a red stamp—I directly turned off the water, to prevent them being washed away—after about a minute or so, the prisoner got up, arranged his clothes, and went out, and directly afterwards Blackburn came in—Peak and I were both together all the time—he left me for about a minute, and returned directly—he had the opportunity on his return of seeing into the water closet—he had not so good a position as I had—he could see the person in the closet—he had a better sight of his face when he came in than I had—when Peak went for Blackburn I remained watching, to see that no one else came in—no one but the prisoner came to that closet up to the time of Blackburn's coming—when he came he commenced taking out the fragments of a letter—I saw writing on them—it looked like a letter—it was all in small pieces—I went with him into his shop, which is in the vaults, and there he put them into a bucket of water, and washed them—we then put them together, and saw the address on them—I afterwards delivered them to Mr. Sculthorpe, after Blackburn had put his initials on some portions of them—I have here on this piece of tissue paper the papers I saw Blackburn take out of the pan, and also a portion of two cards—they are the same pieces that I received from Black-burn—one of the cards bears the name of "Mr. G. T. Attwater," and the other "Mrs. Frederick Davidge"—they had been torn up, but have since been put together—I afterwards gave information to Mr. Gapes, the inspector of letter carriers, and was in the office when he took the prisoner into Mr. Sculthorpe's private room—I heard Peak say to him, "You have been down to the water closets this morning"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I have"—Peak said, "The second one on the right from the door, in the letter carriers' closets?"—he said, "Yes"—Peak then said, "We saw you tear up a letter this morning"—the prisoner made no answer to that—I then searched him—in his left trousers pocket I found a purse containing a sovereign, half a crown, and a sixpence, and in his right trousers pocket</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140277"/>
               <p>two sixpences, and three halfpence in copper—Peak then took up the purse and the sovereign, and asked the prisoner where he got this sovereign from, holding it in his hand at the time—the prisoner said, "I received it last week for my wages"—I then went and fetched Mr. Sculthorpe, and he was told all the circumstances in the prisoner's presence—we told him that we had been watching this certain closet in the basement, and that we saw the prisoner come in and tear up a letter—I then said, "I have searched the prisoner, and found a purse on him containing a sovereign, half a crown, and a sixpence, and two sixpences and three halfpence in the other pocket"—I then handed Mr. Sculthorpe the sovereign, which he closely examined—he held it up in his hand, and said to the prisoner, "Where did you get this sovereign from? I mean this particular sovereign, it is a George and Dragon sovereign of 1824"—the prisoner hesitated for a few seconds, and then said, "I received it from the bank with other money"—Mr. Sculthorpe asked him what bank, and he said, "The Provident Bank, St Martin's-lane"—Mr. Sculthorpe said, "When?"—he said, "About three or four months ago"—he was then given into custody—I took possession of the sovereign—I have had it ever since, and now produce it—from half-past 6 o'clock, when I went to relieve Peak, down to the time when Blackburn, brought these papers from the closet, no one had been to that closet but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not what the prisoner said, that he got the sovereign from the bank last month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not try to ascertain from the Provident Bank, in St Martin's-lane, whether he had drawn out any money the month before, I am not aware that any one has done so—I had no instruction to go—there is a savings bank there, called the Provi<lb/>dent Institution—he did not say he got it out of the savings bank last March—he said "three or four months ago," he never mentioned any month—my deposition was read over to me before I signed it—this is my signature (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being ready stated</hi>: "The prisoner than stated he received it from the bank in March last")—it is my impression that he said "three or four months ago"—I will not say that what I said before the Magistrate was not true—I think he did say "March last)" I cannot say positively, it is some time ago—when Peak first spoke to him about the sovereign he said, "I received it last week for my wages"—he did not say he had saved it from his wages and drawn it out from the bank in March last—he said nothing about the bank at that time—I did not hear him mention the fact of having received it for his wages more than once, and that was to Peak: nor yet about the bank—the first of these conversations was about a little after 8 o'clock, and the other, I suppose, about 9 o'clock—it was in answer to Mr. Sculthorpe that he mentioned about drawing it from the bank—he did not use the word <hi rend="italic">saved</hi> to Peak—that I swear—I heard Peak examined—I was not in the sorters' room about half-past 7 o'clock, I was at the door, and Peak had been in and said he could not see him—I looked through the door—I did not see him—he was not sitting in the same place as he was when I saw Mr. Gapes go in, and took him to the comptrollers' room—he might have been in some other seat—there might have been a dozen sorters there when I looked in, they were just returning from their breakfast—I believe they breakfast down stairs in the kitchen—I cannot say which water closet would be nearest to a person coming up from the kitchin—in order to get from the front of the water closet to the air shaft where Peak and I were, you must come up stairs into the office, go into the hall of the Boat Office and through a door, and down into the vaults—it would take about a minute or a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185605140278"/>
               <p>minute and a half to do that—I continued at the air shaft while Peak went for Blackburn—I saw Blackburn take out the fragments of a letter it was as light there with the gas, as it is here—I could not see right down into the hole, I saw him put an instrument down and bring them up, it was a wooden instrument about three or four feet long, I could not see how far down it went.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber employed at the General Post Office. On the morning of 15th April I was directed to go to the water closets on the basement—I went there about a quarter past 6 o'clock—Peak was not with me, he was in the air shaft; he could see me—I washed out the closet and stopped it, I put a sheet of brown paper into the trap; it is a self acting closet, the seat is on a spring, and when a person rises the water flows in—there is a trap below the pan—I washed that trap out—it is a ten inch trap, made of lead, and contains a gallon of water—the contents of the pan go into that trap in the ordinary way, and when the person rises the fall of water washes out the trap—I put the brown paper in the trap for the purpose of preventing anything from passing down it without my knowledge—after doing that I left the closet, leaving nothing but water and the brown paper in the trap—Peak was then at the grating; about a quarter past 7 o'clock Peak came and fetched me, and I went to the same closet—I examined the pan, I found that it had been used in the usual way—I cleared out the trap—I had an instrument made of two pieces of wood like a pair of tweezers, and with that I pulled up the contents of the trap with the sheet of brown paper—there was soil in the trap—I took out some torn pieces of paper and pieces of card, I picked out the pieces, put them into a sheet of brown paper, took them into my shop and washed them in Smee's presence—these are them—Smee wished me to mark one or two of them, which I did, and gave them to him—here are my marks—my attention had been called to this water closet the day before, and I took out seven letters from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you take out of the water closet when you went at a quarter past 7 o'clock, with your wooden tweezers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took out the torn pieces of paper and some fragments of printed paper besides these—some parties had been to the closet, I cannot say who—I have no doubt it had been used in the ordinary way, I merely picked out the letter, I did not want those, I put the pieces of printed paper into the trap again, with the brown paper—the rushing of the water into the pan makes a noise, and can be seen by the person using the closet, about a gallon and a half of water flows in—when the water is turned off, there would, of course, not be that noise, the seat would rattle, but there would be no noise of gushing water—I washed out the four letter carriers' closets that morning—there are ten closets in a row, there is a wide space between the clerks' and the sorters', and an iron gate; that gate divides the two closets belonging to the sorters from the four belonging to the letter carriers—a person coming up from the sorters' kitchen would be nearest the sorters' closets—I cannot say whether the prisoner was in the habit of eating his breakfast in the letter carriers' kitchen, they take their breakfast as they can get the</p>

               <p>chance—the place is very small, and they are tied for room, and they go where they can—the sheet of brown paper which I put in the trap I doubled up and pushed down—it would be supported simply by its own pressure against the sides of the trap—I found a great many fragments—I washed them and gave them all to Smee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistant comptrollers of the London District Office. I have been in the Post Office thirty-two years. On the morning of 15th April, Smee came to me at my chambers, and in consequence of what he said, I went to the Post Office—I got there about 9 o'clock—I there found the prisoner in my private room with Peak and Smee—Peak informed me that the prisoner had been seen to destroy a letter in the water closet, and Smee handed me the fragments of a letter, and likewise a sovereign, which he stated he had found in the prisoner's pocket—I closely examined the sovereign, and asked the prisoner where he got it from—he hesitated and then said, "I received it from the bank in St. Martin's-lane"—Peak then said, "Why, you stated you received it for your wages"—I do not recollect that he made any reply to that—he was asked, I think, by Peak, what bank he had received it of, and he replied, "The Provident Bonk, or savings bank in St Martin's-lane"—I did not notice that he said at what time he had received it—I believe he has been in the Post Office about twenty years—I think his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I received these fragments of a letter, envelope, and cards, from Smee—I put them together, and gave them to Peak—I find a General Post mark on one of the pieces, of 15th April—that denotes that it arrived at the Post Office in London on the 15th—that impression is pat on before the sorting—I also find the county post mark, "Gloucester"—the portion of the letter containing the date is destroyed—the first despatch to Hackney is at 7 o'clock, and the second at half-past 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I presume they have been pasted together in order to represent them as they were in their original condition before they were torn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did it in a hurry—my chief object was to make out the address—it does not exactly represent what it was originally—there are some portions of it absent—there might have been another postage label on the envelope—a portion of the address is missing—the pieces do not fit in, because the whole of the envelope was not discovered—the defacing stamp is not all on the label here—it ought to be—but it is not always so—it is frequently done in a hurry—it was a larger envelope than I have made it—I put it in too small a compass—the prisoner would not have remained for twenty years in the Post Office if he had not borne a good character—every inquiry is made, but I am sorry to say that many dishonest persons get into the Post Office—the prisoner was nine years a letter carrier, and eleven years a sorter—I did not think it worth while to inquire as to the truth of his statement about getting the sovereign from the bank, because he had made two statements.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tragedian; I reside in Nelson-street, Camden-town; I perform at the Princess's Theatre. On Friday night, 2nd May, before 12 o'clock, I was in company with Mr. and Mrs. Brazier, and Mr. Cook, leaving the theatre—on reaching the gateway in Oxford-street, I saw the prisoner—she stepped forward, and presented a pistol—Mr. Brazier instantly said, "Good God, she has got a pistol!"—a snap was heard immediately—she presented the pistol towards me; as far as I could judge, it was towards my breast, or my face—I think she made an exclams<lb/>tion, but I cannot recollect it—a policeman came up, and the prisoner was taken—she had formerly lived with me—I have been separated from her about two years.</p>

On the afternoon of 5th May, the two prisoners came hastily into my passage, and I went to the door of my shop—immediately a crowd came round—the lady came up with the policeman—the prisoners were brought further into the passage to the side door of the house—I begged the policeman to keep the people back, and said he had better bring the lady farther in—they went in, and I heard the prisoners urging the lady to take the purse back again—I saw Jones put her hand towards the prosecntrix with something in it—she appeared to me to pass it to the prosecutrix—the prosecutrix said they had given her the purse back again—the prisoners could hear that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a crowd outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—at the time I was knocked down I only saw Wren and Raymond there—there was nobody else there—I was knocked down directly I got out-side—I do not know how many persons were in the coffee shop—there was a young girl with me—she was in the private room, and there was a young man who was having supper with her—not a single soul saw me knocked down—Wren is not the owner of the coffee house, he is the waiter—Raymond has nothing to do with the house that I know of—I have seen him there as I passed through sometimes—I have not said that he struck me on the forehead with his crutch or with his hand—I said that he held me down, with his hand on my forehead, but did not knock me hard—that was when I was knocked down, and while he was taking the money from me he hit me with his open hand—Wren was on the step of the door—the girl was inside finishing her supper—the door was not open—she could not see—there are two doors—Wren served in the shop, and Mrs. Smith and the servant girl were serving in the bar, which is through the shop—I did not notice any customers in the shop when I went out, but there were some when I first went in—two men were sitting by the fire when I first went in—it was on the step of the door that Wren asked me to lend him some money—the girl desired me not to pay a sovereign in the shop, but before that I paid down a sovereign and thought it was a shilling—it was before that that Wren asked me to lend him five shillings—I was then outside the door on the step—I had changed the sovereign before that—the other girl came from the Caledonian-road—I went into the shop alone at first, that was to have my supper—I gave Wren the half crown on the step of the door just as the other girl was coming up—the rest of my money was in my purse at that time—I do not know the young man's name—I had seen him before—I am not an acquaintance of hia, but I have seen him with my friend—I do not know whether he is a witness here—I have not seen him since—he was in the coffee shop at the time I was knocked down—he did not call out, but when I called out he came out—he said that he did not hear me—when I first went in with the other girl I do not know whether the two men were there, but they were when I first went in—I brought my money out because I was going to see some girls whom I knew, and I might spend some of it—I did not think anything about losing it or I should not have taken it—I did not show it to the other girl—she knew that I had it, because she lived with me, and knew that I took it out—she left the house with me—I did not see her first in the coffee shop, I left with her at 8 o'clock in the even<lb/>ing, and took my money in my purse—I did not tell her the reason I was taking it—she told me to leave the money at home, and I would not—I told her I was going to Islington to see somebody—it was a small green purse, a</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You made your complaint to Mrs. Smith? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I think Wren heard that—he did not answer, that I know of, when I told her that I had been robbed—I said nothing to her about borrowing the half crown, nor did he—Mrs. Smith saw that I had money, because I paid her some money that T owed her before—I did not get the change for the sove<lb/>reign then—my supper only came to 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid Mrs. Smith the money before I Went out to see whether the girl was there—I paid her the money when Jane Hamilton was with me—I do not know whether it was two or three shillings I paid her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Wellesley-street, at the same house as the last witness.

               <p>is a private place where people can go and have supper, it is next to where they serve—I was in the little room behind, inside—I did not see Wren inside the place after he said that a girl wanted her outside, and went out—there were some people sitting there when we went in—Charlotte King went into the shop first, and left me and Raymond outside—I opened the door in two or three minutes, and she was in the shop accusing Wren of being the instigation of her being robbed, and when I opened the door she came out—we went together to look for a policeman, it may have been half an hour before we found one—Raymond was given in charge, he was then standing opposite the coffee shop—I did not say anything to Raymond outside, nor did I hear what she said to him—he still stood there—the pro<lb/>secutrix was perfectly sober, and so was I; I had had nothing to drink that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you been long acquainted with Charlotte King? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four or five months, but I have known her since she was a child; we were both children together in Norfolk—I lived at Market Dereham, and she at Bargewelt—I have been in London about three years—I knew that the had this money—she was going to meet some friends, and took out the money—I wished her to leave it at home—by friends, I mean females—I do not know what she was going to do, or any object which she had in taking out the money—we lodge at Mr. Watkins's, we are the only two girls in the house—I have got my room, and she has got her's—we do not live together—I know Mrs. Smith who keeps the coffee house, we were in the habit of going there almost every night to have supper—the Crown public house, where we were going to meet, is not far, it is about: five minutes walk—I was in the habit of going to the Crown as well as to this place.</p>

About 12 o'clock on this night I was in the Caledonian-road, and saw Wren and the prosecutrix outside Smiths coffee house talking—I saw them again about a quarter past 12 o'clock, Hamilton was then there, and they all went into the coffee shop—about a quarter past 1 o'clock I was called to take Raymond into custody; I had seen him by the coffee shop about half past 12 o'clock, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards saw him cross the road from the coffee shop—when I took him he was standing on the opposite side, about forty yards from the coffee shop—they both denied the charge.</p>

               <p>I am not in any employment at present—I was last employed by Mr. Harris, the tailor, of Oxford-street, as porter—in Feb. last I was out of a situation—on the 18th I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and among other replies I received one purporting to come from a gentleman of the name of Hammond—in consequence of receiving that note I went next afternoon, between 2 and 3 o'clock, to No. 6, Oakley-crescent, City-road—I inquired for Mr. Hammond, and was shown np stairs, into the front room, and there saw a person calling himself Mr. Hammond—the prisoner is the person—if it is not the same person it is one just like, him—he asked me who I was—I told him I was James Humphreys—he said he wished me to produce the note, and then he should see which it was that had come, because he had written to several—I gave him the note—he said he had got business to do at Oxford and in London, and he should want me to collect bills and likewise to look after his horse and chaise—he said he was in Oxford some<lb/>times and sometimes in London, but his residence was in Oxford—I told him I could not take the situation because he said he wished me to go to live at Oxford—he said he would rather I would see him again to<lb/>morrow, he should like me to take his situation—he said, "I rather like your appearance, and if you will come to-morrow morning I have a few little jobs for you to do, if you don't mind undertaking them"—I then left—that was all that passed that day—I was with him perhaps six minutes—he—had his hat on during this conversation—he was sitting when' I went in, but he was standing part of the time—I went again next morning about 10 o'clock—he was not in—I waited for him in the passage—he came in in a few minutes—he went up stairs first and asked me to wait a minute—he afterwards called me up stairs—I had told him on the first occasion where I had been living, but that morning I told him I had made up my mind not to undertake the situation—he then asked if I would mind doing a few little jobs for him, and asked me to go to the Euston Station to fetch him luggage, a portmanteau and a carpet bag, coming from Bath, I believe—he said, "You know my name, you can ask; for Mr. Hammond's luggage"—I went and there was no luggage for him there—they said I had better go to the luggage department at Camden-town, which I did, but did not find any—I then went back to the prisoner—I found him waiting for me—I told him I could not find any luggage for Mr. Hammond—he said he did not know how it was that it was not there, it ought to have been there; however, it did not signify, he must send again—he then asked me if I would go to Lombard-street foot him, to take a cheque—I said yes—he gave me the cheque—this produced is it—I was to take it to. Smith and Sons, or Smith and Payne's, in Lombard-street, and get 91<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me to get so much in notes and so much in gold I forget what it was exactly, and bring it back to him—he said, "I suppose, you have not had your dinner"—I said, "No, sir"—he said, "I will give you sixpence, and you can have it before you come back, as I have act got the wherewith here to provide it for you"—I then took the cheque to Smith, Payne, and Smith's, the bankers, in Lombard-street, and presented it at the counter for payment—it was refused—I was taken into the; bank, and from there to Messrs. Mullens, the solicitors—I made a communication to them—I was detained there while they made inquiry about my character, and I was then released—I did not go back to the prisoner—on 5th April, I was taken by Mr. Forrester to the House of Detention (I had previously given a description of the person from whom I had the cheque)—I was taken to the doors of different cells, and was desired to look in each cell as I</p>

               <p>passed—two servants of the House of Detention were with us; one went before and opened the door, and the other came behind—I looked into each cell as I passed—I looked into twenty or thirty, it might be—I had passed all the cells except the last one, and after I had passed the servant said, "Have you seen any one that you know I" and I said "The last one that I passed was something like him"—the prisoner was in the last cell—the officer then said, "You have passed them all"—a day or two afterwards I went to Marlborough-street police court—I there saw the prisoner—I recognized him immediately upon his being brought into Court—I now believe him to be the man.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you any doubt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I do not feel to have any doubt—I have no doubt but what he is the man—I saw him on three occasions at the house in Oakley-crescent; the first time for five or six minutes, the second time for about the same, and the third not so long—he had a hat on and he had spectacles on, white ones—once he had not got them on, but he put them on when I went into the room—he was a minute or two without them; he went to the window, took them out, and put them on—I solemnly believe him to be the man—I went with Forrester to the House of Detention for the purpose of identifying him—Mr. Mullens was not with me—Forrester did not give me any clue or hint—the gaolers told me not to stop at the cells, but to look and pass on—there was only one person in each cell—the gaoler did not say when I had passed the last cell but one, "You have passed him"—he did not say so till I had passed them all—I said there was no one I could identify, with the exception of the last man, and he was something like the man—I do not believe the gaoler said, "You have passed him," before I said that—after we had passed them all, I believe he said, "That is all, have you seen him?"—he said "You have passed him," when I came to the end—it was then that I said "The last man was something like him"—I said if Iwas compelled to swear to the man, I would not say it was him, by the time I had seen him—on leaving the prison, I believe I told Forrester I had seen them all, but there was but one there that was like him—I do not recollect saying, "My impression is I have not seen the man"—I will not swear I did not—when I saw him at Marlborough-street he was in the dock—I had then heard of his being committed on another charge—I then said he was the man—I have never mentioned before to-day that the man I saw at Oakley-crescent had spectacles on—I told Mr. Mullens so early in the case—I did not say so at the Mansion-house—I did not repass the cells at the House of Detention, after having once looked into them.</p>

Ransom's bank—I said, "I shall give you in charge on a case of forgery on Messrs. Ransom's bank"—he said to the officer, "It is all right, where am I to go to?"—his companion walked off towards the Edgware-road—the prisoner did not say anything till he was taken to Marylebone-lane station—he there abused me very much, called me a scoundrel and a vagabond, and made use of all sorts of abusive names—when he was taken he said he did not know where the bank was himself, and he did not know where Stanhope-street was—he was taken by the constable, in my company, to No. 16, Stanhope-street, the same evening by my desire—I had a very slight doubt about his being the person at the time when I took him—when we got to No. 16, Stanhope-street, we first saw the servant who had previously opened the door to me—the policeman asked if Mrs. Hall was at home—I think that was the name; and the prisoner said to the servant, before he allowed the police<lb/>man to speak, "Am I the man that took your lodging?"—she said, "If you are not him you are his brother"—I cannot say what observation he made in reply to that, but he called me a d—vagabond, and held up his stick to me—the policeman said he must call in another constable to assist if he did not be quiet—the servant girl then feinted away—in looking at the prisoner now I. have not the least doubt that he is the person who handed me the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police inspector, Brighton Railway</hi>). I was first spoken to about this matter on 15th March—I did not go into it till 15th or 16th March—I received some information, which induced me to go, on 17th April, to a beer shop in King William-street, where this bag was ultimately discovered—while I was there, a person came for Dr. Lenden's luggage—it was refused—the application was made the next morning, and the same application was made the next evening at 5 o'clock, and refused—I was in the house when the person came and made the application—he left, and went out when he got his answer, and I went out too—I went twenty or thirty yards, and saw the prisoner's head peeping round the wall of the steps leading down to Thames-street—the person who had applied for the bag went to him, and insisted on his going to give an order to the persons to have his luggage delivered—the prisoner stood for a minute, and the person said, "Come along," and he followed him into the beer shop, and told the landlord to let the gentleman have his goods—he was then going out, but I stopped him, and told him I wanted to speak to him up stairs in his room—I told him I was a police officer—he said, "Very well"—he went up into his room—I followed him, and told him I came respecting his having obtained 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Brighton Railway Company, under pretence of his having lost this bag (<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>)—I told him he need make no reply unless he chose, as I should most likely have to repeat it—he immediately said, "Oh, that is the way the railway people pay persons for the lose of their property"—I took the bag, turned it up, and showed him the bottom—I said, "This is the French ticket from Paris"—I pointed out to him the portions of the figures, which I told him were the remains of No. 28—he said, "That bag never was in Paris with me"—I also found this other little bag, with this strap t it—I said that he had passed through the Custom House at Newhaven, and there were entries there of his having passed through the Custom House with two bags—a gentleman who was there told him to say nothing—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How do you know the letters that you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I brought them to this Court—I found all these at the prisoner's lodging—I believe these straps were on this small bag at the time I found it, or they were lying by the side of it—I had been to that place one day before, but I had never been in the prisoner's room before that day—I never saw the carpet bag elsewhere before that day—I saw it that day before the prisoner was there—I had it in my hand, and examined it—Mr. Lipscombe was present, and also the landlord of the house—I did not know when I went that there was something due to the landlord—I knew it before I took the bag away—I knew it before I saw this man peeping round the corner—I heard some person, who said he was a solicitor, say he would pay it—the money was not paid by my advice, certainly not—when I had this bag first in my hand, I saw it about ten minutes—I examined it with the description I had given me, and found it corresponded with it—the room was locked of again.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">MACKIE</hi>. I was a fellow traveller with the prisoner from Paris to London—I was with him on board the steamboat—I believe I was the person principally associating with him—when we arrived at Newhaven I saw him—I believe we landed together—I believe we passed through the baggage warehouse together—I do not believe he said anything about his luggage—we went into the luggage place together—my impression is that he was the first person from me—I believe he had something slung round him—I think I saw a belt; I am not quite sure—I do not exactly recollect what luggage he had; it was luggage of some kind—it is my impression that he was showing something as part of his luggage—I left my luggage in the baggage warehouse—when we quitted the examination of the luggage, I believe the next place I saw the prisoner at was at the Lewes station; he left me there to go to Brighton—I was in a first class carriage; he was on the platform—he wished me good bye, and asked if madam was better—I do not know that he was going to Brighton—I did not see him do anything with a key at the baggage place—he exposed his luggage—I do not know whether it was fastened with a lock, or what it was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 30, Eaton-place, in the parish of St. George's, Hanover-square. Charnell was my butler—on the night of the 4th April I went to bed about half past 12 o'clock—I went by accident into my study, got hold of a book, and sat there for half or three quarters of an hour—the house was perfectly quiet when I went to bed—I supposed that every body was in bed—my dressing room is in a situation that I can hear the least talking or noise (I do not make a practice of going to bed after the servants, I generally go at about 11 o'clock)—about 7 clock in the morning in consequence of something a female servant said to me, I went down and saw Charnell—I should have been up soon after 8 o'clock, in the ordinary course—Charnell met me on the stairs, and began in rather an extravagant way to ask that I would forgive him—there were two maid servants stand<lb/>ing there, and I told him to go into the drawing room and say what he had to say—he said, "I hope you will forgive me, I am sure you never will forgive me"—I said, "Just go into the room, and I will oome and speak to you"—I went in and shut the door, and he said that he had been called out at night soon after he got into bed, a relation came or had sent for him, that a cousin of his was dangerously ill, that he got up, went away at 12 o'clock, was absent two hours, and when he came back he found that the plate was taken—I said, "Why, I was up myself at 12"—he said that it might been twenty minutes or half past 12, that the husband of his cousin had come and called him up—I went and dressed, saw him afterwards, and asked if he had gone for the police—he said that he had not—he told me after<lb/>wards that his bed was put down, he sleeps in the pantry, and he told me that his watch was lying on the bed—the plate was kept in a very strong plate closet, built on purpose, fire proof, and opening out Of his pantry, and there are two strong chests to keep what is not used in, and which I believe are in Court (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a fire proof door which opens out of this butler's pantry, where he sleeps, and the two chests are in the closet; in which to send the plate backwards and forwards—they are fitted up for each parti<lb/>cular article—the keys of the chests, as well as of the closet, were in the possession of the butler—I gave him the keys and the entire control of all the plate—I have no reason to believe that there were marks on the cheats before—the last time I saw them was when I sent them up from the country</p>

               <p>to the silversmith's, and they came from him to the prisoner, Charnell, in December—it was his duty to sleep in the room where the plate closet was—I dressed on the ground floor, and came out immediately, went to the police station, brought a policeman, and examined the place down stairs with him, and examined the locks—I think Charnell was present—he told me that he had locked the door of his pantry when he went out, and took the key with him—he spoke to me so often that I cannot exactly recollect the time—he said that he had locked up the key of the plate closet, a large key, and deposited it in a side press, a wooden fixture in the room, with a very weak lock, which had been <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> open, and the key taken out, and he found it in the plate closet—he also said that he had locked up the plate chests, and had taken those keys with him, that he found the door of the pantry broken open when he came home—I asked him if there was any appearance of anybody having been in the house—he said that there was not, and that he went out by the area door, and took the key of that door and the key of the area in his pocket—I said, "Then who can have taken the plate?"—he said, "That is what puzzles me, Sir"—I said, "Of course it was taken either by you or some of your friends"—that was before I knew that he had had any friends—he said, "None of my friends would do it"—afterwards, in my room, before the policeman, he told me the address of his cousin who had sent for him, and I told the policeman to take it down—I then said, "A cousin may be a near or a distant relation, and it is very strange to send for you"—I cross-examined him about the nature of the cousin's illness—he said, "She is the only relation I have," either "in the world," or "in Lon<lb/>don," I do not know which—I said, "How is she related?"—after a good deal of hesitation, he said, "She is the daughter of my mother by a former marriage"—I said, "Why, that is your sister"—he said no more, that seemed to embarrass him—he seemed surprised to hear that she proved to be his sister and not his cousin—Thurstell afterwards went away, and about two or three hours after he went away I was reading the paper in my study (it was about 11 o'clock), and Charnell came in and said, "Sir, I will not conceal the truth any longer; what I have told you is false; I went out last night with some friends"—I took down this note of what he said at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he told me that he went out with some friends, and mentioned the names of Peshell and Martin, who lived at No. 7, Princes-street: that Martin had called in the morning about 11 o'clock, and told him that there was a ball that night at Willis's rooms, that he did not like to ask me to go out, but after a good deal of persuasion he consented to go after I had gone to bed; that Martin told him he would let Tillett know, and that he wrote to Tillett himself to meet them at the ball, and Martin put the letter into the post (I think he must have mentioned that Peshell was to go to the ball, as I have his name on the top of my paper)—he said that Tillett came unexpectedly to him about 10 o'clock, and Martin also; that they waited in the pantry together till I had gone to bed—he then locked up all his things, took the keys in his pocket, went out with Martin and Tillett, and met Peshell in the street, just outside; that they three took a cab at the end of the street and went to Willis's-rooms, but they were not open; they then went to Evans's, and heard a song or two, waited till it was getting late, then came home, and arrived about half-past 4 o'clock—I do not think he told me where he parted with the others, but he said that they all four were together at Evans's-rooms—he made no mention of the prisoner Sale to me—he said that they went out by the area door, and locked both the house door and the area door—I asked him how the hall door was found—he said that it was</p>

               <p>unbolted but the latch lode and the other lock were both sprung, as they would be if anybody had gone out—that was the state of things when he came back—he had not a latch key, I have one.</p>

On Saturday, 5th April, about half-past 7 o'clock, I was fetched to Mr. Fisher's—I examined the premises, but found no trace of any entry being effected at any part of the house—I examined the area gate, the door leading from the area into the house, and the front door, but there was not a single mark on either of them—I had the lock of the door leading from the area into the passage, taken off by a smith, but could discover nothing to show that it had been tried—in the butler's pantry I found a small plate chest which bore marks of having been forced—I have examined the larger chest carefully, but there are only very slight marks on it—I am of opinion that those marks were not made then, but that the chest was actually open—there are two locks on it, and both were in perfect order—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the keys; they were given to me by Charnell among other keys on a ring—the door of the plate closet was perfectly sound—it is a large iron door, about the size of one of the doors of this Court—it could not have been broken open without a sledge hammer—the proper key was in the door, and it locked it.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). There were several marks on the pantry door, out not sufficient, in my opinion, to make an entry—the box of the lock had not been broken, and when I locked the door, I could not push it open—the box of the lock would make considerable noise in breaking it—few days after the robbery, I am not sure of the date, I called at No. 7, Princes-road, Pimlico, and saw Peshell, Martin, and Sale—I do not think I was in uniform, but they knew I was an officer—constable Fells, who had been there before introduced me as his inspector—Martin said that a friend of Peshell's, a person named Fisher, but whose real name turns out to be Holt, called on him on the Friday, and stated that there was to be a ball at William's-rooms, Brewer-street, Golden-square, that he, Martin, went to 30, Baton-place, and asked Charnell if he would go, and returned in the evening, saying to Peshell that Charnell would go, and had written to invite a friend to accompany him—that friend was not Sale, it was Tillett, a servant at Westbourne-terrace, Hyde-park—he said that later in the evening Sale called on them, and they asked him to accompany them to the ball, and they all went together to 30, Baton-place, at half past 10 o'clock, that Martin went into the house, and Sale and Peshell remained outside, but Gharnell came to the area gate and called then in; that they were very reluctant to go in, thinking it improper, but were overruled by Charnell who pressed them—they stated that before they got to the house they found that Tillett was there; that they waited a considerable time, that Charnell left the pantry frequently to see if Mr. Fisher had retired to bed; that they became very impatient, add at length Charnell said that it was all right, that Mr. Fisher had gone to bed, and they then left the house together by the area door and steps—Sale and Peshell added, that on leaving the house, they fancied that they heard a rustling of a dress, apparently on the stairs leading to the upper part or the house, and told Charnell that they thought it was not all right, and wished him not to leave home, but he replied, that there was nothing to fear, and he had frequently gone out without Mr. Fisher knowing anything about it; that they got into a cab at the comer of Eaton-place and Belgrave-street, and were driven to Brewer-street, Sale stating that he left them there, he having previously stated to the others that he could not go to the ball, as he was not properly dressed, and that his ball days were over, and he had no desire to go, but was driven there, it being part of his way home; that when they found the room closed they went to the other Willis's-rooms at St. James's, thinking that the ball might be there, found those rooms closed also, and then called at several public houses and coffee shops about the Haymarket—(Charnell mentioned Evans's, but I do not know whether the others did or not, that is in Covent-garden)—that Peshell left them in the Haymarket, they had some little dispute about taking some more refresh<lb/>ment, and Martin, Charnell, and Tillett walked together to we end of St. Jaraes's-street, where Tillett left, and Martin and Charnell came on their way home to the corner of Arabella-row, Pimlico) Martin going home, and</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAREY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you saw these parties, did they give the elaborate account you have described in an unembrrassed manner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought so—the Monday after the robbery was, I believe, the first time I saw Sale—Fells saw them before me—I did not go by appointment, they did not expect me—Sale did not live there—the inter<lb/>view lasted half or three quarters of an hour—I saw them three or four times, still pursuing my inquiries to detect the perpetrators or the robbery—I took Sale on the evening of the 24th by the direction of Mr. Fisher, he insisted on it—I did not suggest to him that any of them should be taken, I merely stated the facts—it is my duty to take persons in custody, against whom there is a case—it is my duty to take a party who I consider criminal—I took Sale a fortnight afterwards, on the 24th, at his own lodging—I knew the address of all of them, and they knew that I was pursuing these inquiries—Sale is a butler out of place—Martin is a butler—Peshell is a foreigner; he told me that he expected a situation at the Lord Warden hotel at Dover, and gave me that address—I saw him again, and he told me that he had got it—I took Sale on the morning of the 25th April, about half past 12 o'clock—I also took Martin on the 25th at his lodging, about midnight—I waited for him to come home—Peshell was apprehended at the Lord Warden hotel—all that was done; by Mr. Fisher's instructions, he was determined that they should be taken in custody—I told Sale that I was sorry I was obliged to apprehend him—I searched their lodgings—I made certain inquiries of William Ault, a butler out of place, and mentioned the result to Mr. Fisher—these inquiries were made in consequence of the very minute information that Martin and these three parties gave me as to their movements on that evening—I know Brewer-street, Golden-square—I know a place called Willis's-rooms there, they are sometimes taken by one individual, who arranges for a ball to take place at intervals of several weeks—I know Evans's in Covent-garden.</p>

               <p>do you know bow he came to do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe there was a commu<lb/>nication with Mr. Paynter, the Magistrate—I know that Mr. Paynter and Mr. Fisher had interviews, and the result was, that I took the parties into custody—I have seen Ault here to-day, he is not subpœnaed on the part of the prosecution—the keys of both these boxes were given to me by Charnell—he showed me the cupboard where the key of the closet was deposited—that was within the pantry—there were marks on the pantry door as if it had been attempted to be broken open, but had not been—I think it was opened with a key, the lock was in good condition.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On the morning of 5th April, in consequence of information I received, I went to No. 39, Somens-street, Portman-square, about 9 o'clock, and found a person named Gilbert—he did not at that time give me any letter—on the same morning I took Charnell, and on the way from the station to the police court, between 11 and 12 o'clock, after the charge had been taken, he said, "What can we do?"—I said, "I really do not know, unless you can give us any assistance"—he said, "I left my master's house about half past 12 o'clock last night, in company with four other men; we took a cab and drove to Brewer-street, Golden-square; one of the men, who was a perfect stranger to me, left us there; we went to Willies-rooms and found them closed" (that is in Brewer-street, it is called Little Willis's;) "we then went to Willis's-rooms in King-street, St. James's, and finding them closed we went back to the Haymarket, when Peshell, who felt <hi rend="italic">tiffed</hi> at some little circumstance which happened, left us; we afterwards went to the corner of St. James's-street, when Tillett left us, and myself and Martin returned as far as Arabella-row, where Martin left me"—after he had been remanded that day, Saturday, 5th, I went again to Gilbert's, on the Monday morning, about 9 o'clock, and received from him this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 2nd May I took Tillett in custody, and he stated the same as nearly as possible as Martin and Peshell had to the inspector—I asked him for the letter which Charnell had sent him to invite him to the ball, and he gave it to me—he said that he received it about tea time on Friday, 4th April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an excavator, and live in North Woolwich-road. I resided there with my wife in April last—I have been married about eleven years—I had some money, which I had saved up—it was in a box at the foot of the bed, in the bedroom up stairs, where I slept—I cannot say exactly the amount, I believe nearly 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was all in gold, in sovereigns and half sovereigns—on 21st April I left home between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning; I went to Chatham to seek for employment—I returned between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening—I found my wife was not at home, and I missed my money and my clothes—there was some little money left, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the box was always kept locked, and my wife kept the key of it—I missed all my wife's wearing apparel, and some blankets, and sheets and other things, and five shirts, these articles which were brought from Liverpool—I can identify this patchwork quilt, and this towel I know—these sheets and blankets are mine—I can speak to them as being my pro<lb/>perty—my wife did not return that night—I went over to the Borough, where I expected to find her—I never saw Howes but once before, which was at my wife's father's house at Maidstone—I knew Fennell before—he had lodged with me for two years I dare say, but he had left me a good while, for more than a year—I saw Howes the next day in the Borough—I asked if she knew where my wife was; she said she did, and she said she would bring her to me, and I should see her, which she did not do—she told me times and times over that she would bring her to me, but she did not do it—she said the same again till I got tired of it—I saw her seven or eight days, and she always repeated the same words to me—I offered her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if she would show me the house where my wife was, that I could see her—I asked her if there was a man with my wife—she said no, there was no man with her, and she asked whether I thought there was—I said I did not know; I could not say exactly whether there was or not, but I had a suspicion—the last conversation I had with Howes was on the Monday before I gave her into custody—she then told me if I would come the next morning she would take me to her—on the Tuesday I saw her again, and gave her in charge of the police—when she was given in charge I and the policeman went with her to a house in Brook-street, West-square—the first house we went to we did not go in—when we did get into a house, there was a great deal of conversation—Howes said that my wife was staying with Mrs. Hughes, and likewise Fennell—we could not find them—Mrs. Hughes's husband was there—Mrs. Hughes said that Howes, had done all the mischief, and wanted to get all the trouble off her, and Mrs. Hughes's husband said if Howes came there any more he would throw her out of the window—Howes said she did not want to come there, she did not know that she had done anything wrong—after that I made further search for my wife—I did not find her—I never saw her—I gave the case into the policeman's hands—this gold watch and chain are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William East, and keep a sweet<lb/>stuff shop, at Lower Sydenham. On 14th April, about 6 o'clock: in the evening, the two Reynolds and Gore came into the shop, and asked for some almond rock; I could not reach the glass, and asked one of them to take it down from the window for me—they would not do so—John Reynolds said, "Come round and get it yourself"—I went round the counter and got it; in doing so I passed the prisoners—I had the glass in my hand, and then they said they would not have any sweets, I sold them too dear—I told them it was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce—they said they would have a biscuit—John Reynolds</p>

               <p>took one out of the window, and gave his brother one—they each took one, and each gave me a farthing—they then went away in a hurried manner—before they came in I had a purse in my pocket—I know I had it safe about a minute before they came in, because I had just paid a bill, and had used it—I had about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it—there was a half sovereign, three or four half crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—the half sovereign was wrapped up in a small piece of paper, a kind of newspaper, which was rather dirty—I missed my purse about a minute after the prisoners had left the shop—a customer came in immediately they had gone, and wanted change, and I found my purse was gone—I informed my husband of my loss, and he went to the station, and returned with the police, and they went in pursuit of the prisoners about ten minutes after they had left the shop—I should know the piece of paper again in which the half sovereign was wrapped—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, and this is my purse—I only know the paper from the wear—I had used it for the same purpose for perhaps three weeks or a month, and it had worn a hole.</p>

"Yes"—that was all she said—she said it was a piece of old newspaper—that was all the descrip<lb/>tion she gave of it—when she was at the station this piece of paper was lying on jthe desk, with several others, and she looked down, and said, "That is the piece of paper the half sovereign was wrapped up in; I have had it in my possession three or four weeks"—the other pieces were not like this, quite different—I believe all the prisoners live in one street, somewhere in Shoreditch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Munday's cousin, and assist him in his busi<lb/>ness; he is a butcher, at Woolwich. On Saturday night, 5th April, the pri<lb/>soner was in Mr. Munday's service—he and I were in the shop, and Mr. Mun<lb/>day was outside—the scales are about two feet six inches from the till, and the prisoner was between them—there had not been any customers for a few minutes, but about 11 o'clock, Mr. Munday told the prisoner to weigh a piece of fat—I went to get it from a quarter of beef which hung up, and heard a jingle of silver in the till; I turned round, gave the prisoner the fat, he took it from me with his right hand, and I saw him drawing his left hand from the till, with silver in it; his fore finger was not clenched, as he had a bandage on the tip of it—I believe his hand came out of the till—I did not see him literally take it out—on Saturday evenings we take the till and put it near the scale quite open—I whistled, made a signal to Mr. Munday, and pointed to the prisoner's hand—whistling is a general custom of ours, but it had not been agreed upon—Mr. Munday came in, and as he came in the prisoner took out his handkerchief, wiped his nose, or pretended to do so, and as he returned his handkerchief to his pocket, I heard the jingle of silver—he had put the fat on the scale—Mr. Munday said, "George, what have you put in your pocket?"—he said, "Nothing"—he drew his handkerchief out, and there was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the prisoner took a slight glance at the money, and then Mr. Munday asked him how much he had, and he said, "About 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—and then, I believe, he put it into his side pocket, from which he had taken it—the pocket was loose; it was a round frock—there was no occasion to go to the till; there was a customer in the shop, but no money was exchanged.</p>

On Saturday, 12th April, I was there—the prisoner came at near 10 o'clock at night—she asked for a quarter of a pound of pork and a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of potatoes—they came to 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she laid down a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—my little boy said, "Mother, I will go for change"—he went over the way to Mr. Broadhurst and brought the change back—I gave it to her, and she left—soon after Mr. Broadhurst came and said the crown was bad—on Saturday, 3rd May, the pri<lb/>soner came again about the same time in the evening—I was in the parlour—I heard her talking to my husband—I recognised her voice, and went into the shop—I said to her, "You are the same woman that was here this night three weeks"—she said, "I think you are mistaken, ma'am."</p>

                  </hi>. I am eight years old. On Saturday evening, 12th April, I saw the prisoner in my mother's shop—I was sent for change to Mr. Broadhurst—I got it, and gave it to my mother—on Saturday, 3rd May, about 10 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came for a quarter of a pound of roast pork and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of potatoes—she asked my father for them, and put down a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, which was given to my mother—I was in the shop when she came in, and heard my mother say something about her having been there before, and then I saw she was the same person.</p>

On Saturday night, 12th April, this little boy came with a crown—I gave him change, and after he was gone I found the crown piece was bad—I put it away in a drawer by itself—on Saturday, 3rd May, Mrs. Graham came to tell me the woman was there—I went, and found the prisoner in the shop—I fetched a constable—I gave him the crown which I had received on 12th April.</p>
