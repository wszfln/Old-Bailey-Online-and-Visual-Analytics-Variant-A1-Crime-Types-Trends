I sat upon the fore-board of my cart, with my horses double; there was a man in the cart with me; his name, I believe, is Minew, he is a weaver: as I was driving along, he said, Mr. Farrow your things give way. I turned my head and saw the tail of the cart open; it was a tilted cart, with a sacking cover, and was tied behind with a strong hempen rope. Seeing my cart open behind, I was stopping my horses; when a man came up on foot to the near side of my cart, and said, halloa! I said halloa! said he, what is the matter? I said matter enough; then he said, stop this minute or I will blow your brains out; I stopped. Then he put a cutlass to my breast, and said, if you stir or move I will cut your bloody head off. I did not see any pistol: as soon as he had said that, he halloed out, come on, come on; then Thomas Bright came on the off side of my cart, and another came up into the hind part of my cart, and one went to the horses heads; when he came to the horses heads, he said, what is the matter? the other said, go along, what is that to you, or I will blow your brains out; he replied, don't you know me, blast you come round, you are stupid, you don't know what you are about, and I have a good mind to blow your brains out; it was the man who stood over me that said that to the other that came on the off side of the cart; then that man came round to the hind part of the cart; then they called to one another, ship off, ship off. The man that stood over me kept threatening me that if I offered to look or turn my head he would cut my bloody head off. They then took a trunk containing ladies wearing apparel, a basket of earthen ware, a deal box of gingerbread, and an empty sack.</p>

               <p>How long did they stay with you? - Full a quarter of an hour; they came off for London. After they had ransacked the cart the first time, when they did not take the bag of grocery, they did not seem to be satisfied with what they had got; the man that stood over me said, have you nothing else? I said no; he then put his foot over the foot-board of my cart and felt the bag; he said, this is a bag of grocery? I said it was, and that I had forgot to tell them of it. Then he called out to one of them, come on and get this out, here is a bag of grocery; upon that Grant came up into the cart, Bright came up on the off side, and then the others called out, come on. Grant could not get the bag of grocery out himself, he blasted my eyes, and said, if I did not help him out with it he would cut my bloody head off. I assisted them, and the man that stood over me helped it down. Grant continued in the cart and searched it a second time; he swore, if he found a box or any thing in it more than they had got, they would cut my bloody head off. I begged hard for my life: I told them I had a large family, and I told them I had nothing but paper and half a hogshead of ale, and I begged them not to throw that out; they blasted me and the ale too; then I thought they would have let me go. Bright said, now the man may go on; the man that stood over me replied no, d - n him, he shall not; he bid Bright come and take a pistol. Bright came towards me and took something, but whether a pistol or what I cannot tell; the other bid him go to the horses heads, and said, if he offers to stir or move blow his brains out, and I will go behind and see if they have got all off; Bright went accordingly and stood at my horses heads, and he went behind my cart; I believe he might be gone a full minute; then he came up again, and said they have got all off, all is clear; Bright said, now he may go on; no, said the other, d - n him, he shall not go; then I was afraid they were going to use me ill. I begged for mercy; they said d - n you we will cut your reins. I begged hard that they would not; yes, blast you, said the man that stood over me with a culass, we will cut your reins, or people will say you have not been robbed, this will convince them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290004"/> that you have. Then the man that stood over me with a cutlass cut my near horse's rein, and

             cut the rein of the off horse; after they had done that they said I might go on. I said, gentlemen, pray don't use me ill, for I cannot go on without I tye my horses together, for my horse in the shafts is blind; the man with the cutlass said, you may get down and tye your horses together, but if you offer to come behind your cart or look back, we will blow your brains out; and they said, if I met any body and made any alarm, they would follow me and cut my head off. I said I would not. I was obliged to lead my horses all the way home.</p>

               <p>Before they spoke? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you know them by any thing else besides their persons; their voices for instance? - I could not swear to their voices; but their voices answer their persons; there were four in the gang; but one of them never came in sight, though I heard his voice.</p>

               <p>Where was the empty bag found? - In Sullen's stable.</p>

               <p>Where is that bag? - It is not here; the man who was along with me, said he was so frightened, that he could not say any thing.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker in Prince's street, Leicesterfields. On the 21st of March the prisoner brought a watch to my house between nine and ten in the evening, he offered it to pawn; I stopt it; he wanted two guineas upon it; I asked him what it was made of; he said it was gold. I asked him the maker's name; he said he could not tell. I asked him whose it was; he said it belonged to an acquaintance of his in Russel Street, Covent Garden, and that he lived but a little way off, and he could soon fetch him. He went away: presently after a woman came and claimed the watch; I detained her, and she would not tell me where the man was who brought the watch; but said, if I would let her go, she would soon bring him. I would not let her go; I went out and saw the prisoner on the other side of the street, and went and secured him; he came quietly to the door, but then attempted to make his escape.</p>

               <p>ANN BROWN sworn.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of March I met the prisoner in the Hay-market; I believe it was between eight and nine at night; he asked me to go and drink something; I had been to tea in Swallow Street; we went in and had a glass of something to drink, and he asked me to lend him a guinea.</p>

               <p>Where did you go in to drink? - I am unacquainted with that part of the town. He asked me to lend him a guinea; I said I had not got a guinea, but I had picked up a watch in the Hay-market, I would lend him that to raise a guinea on, and if it was advertised I could fetch it out. I afterwards saw the advertisement of it; he went to pawn it, and the pawnbroker stopped it, and he came and told me; I said they had no right to stop the watch I had found, and I went and claimed it, which I would not have done if I had stole it.</p>

               <p>Court. What time did you find it? - I believe between eight and nine at night, near Panton Street on the pavement.</p>

At about half after three the watchman knocked at the door; the other maid went down, and I went down after her; I was not down till they had untied the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; my box is in Queen-street; not ten yards as I imagine from Mr. Edmondes's house. At three o'clock I heard a pistol discharged in Mr. Edmondes's house; I turned back and rattled with my stick against the iron bars of the area where the prisoner lay, and knocked at the door; but there was no answer made; I stood there a few minutes, and then went and cried the hour; when I returned I leaned over the rails, but could hear no noise nor disturbance at all; at half past three, going my rounds, when I had got some few yards from the door; I heard the prisoner cry out; O Lord I shall be dead; I called out what is the matter; why do not you open the door; he said there were rogues, villains in the house; and he should be dead; I said why do not you open the door; he said he could not, that he was tied; I knocked hard at the door; and the maid servant came down with only her under petticoat on, and that untied; I asked her to show me the way into the kitchen where the prisoner lay; I went down and found him tied with a cord round his legs; and a garter tied loosely round his hands, and one end tied to the cord that was round his legs; I untied the cord, but cut the garter.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the pistol? - I cannot say I did; he said three villains had been in the house, and robbed the house; and he was afraid his lady was killed; he said they came in at the area over the rails.</p>

               <p>Repeat as particularly as you remember the description that he gave of the manner they came in; and what they did? - He told me that on the first man's entering his room, he discharged a pistol at him; we searched, but could find no dent of any ball in the wall.</p>

               <p>What other particulars did he give you? - I cannot recollect any other particulars. We went up stairs and searched every room in the house; there were a great many clothes thrown about the dining room; on the terrass wall, on the outside of the house, there was a gold laced waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Was the window of that room open? - Yes, in the inside.</p>

               <p>Did you observe any plate missing at that time? - There was some plate, some trifling things dropped in different places.</p>

               <p>Did the servants make any observation that a quantity of plate had been taken? - No, they did not.</p>

               <p>Were the places where the things were dropped in the inside or outside of the house? - Inside.</p>

               <p>The clothes were dropped on the terrass as if they were dropped as they were going into the park? - Yes.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. Did I say any thing to you, how the thieves came in? - Yes; you did.</p>

               <p>Court. Were his hands tied in such a way that he could get them out without any trouble? - Very easily; I cut the garter in my hurry.</p>

               <p>Did you observe how they were tied, whether tight or loose? - I was so frightened, I did not observe.</p>

               <p>Did he give any account to you and the watchman in what manner the house was broke open? - I do not remember that he said how the house was broke open; but he described three men that he said had broke into the house; he said there were three men came in; that the age of two of them was from thirty to six and thirty; and the other from twenty to four and twenty; that they had great coats on, and flapped hats; that one held a knife to him, and stood over him all the time; while the other two robbed my mistress.</p>

               <p>When you came down stairs, how did you observe the area door? - I did not observe the door; I saw the shutter open; I was not the first that came to the door; the plate which was kept in his room in the closet with two folding doors was gone; the prisoner said he believed they had taken all the plate in general; but I found a spoon on the stairs and some trifling things.</p>

               <p>From what place did he say they had taken it? - From out of the place where it was kept; I looked in the closet, and it was all gone.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. As I was tied, whether she did not see the marks of the string in my legs and hands? - I believe I did on his legs, but none on his hands.</p>

               <p>To the watchman. Did you observe the mark? - Yes, upon his legs, but none upon his hands.</p>

               <p>Did you make any observation on the area door? - Some time after I was in the room. I was so alarmed with the thieves being in the house, and his hands being tied. I said I would go and see how they came in; he said three men came in; and he fired a pistol at one, and then they tied his hands and legs; and asked where his mistress's jewels were; and where his mistress lay; that then they took the plate out of the closet. I went and looked at the area door, and saw there was a pane of glass broke; and the bar taken down; and the door carelesly put to; it was neither shut nor open; I asked how they came in; he said, I thought at first it was you, when they came to my door; he said, the plate was all carried away; that they insisted on having the key; and he gave it to them out of his coat; that they doubled a silver tea board together, and tied it up in a table cloth, and carried it away. I went up stairs into the dining room; the house-maid found a silver sauce spoon dropped on the stairs, and some wearing apparel of little value strewed on the dining room floor; the shutter was half shut; and the door not latched that goes on the terrass; there was a waistcoat and pair of breeches of my master's on the terrass; I then went to my mistress.</p>

               <p>From the prisoner. Was the window broke on the outside or the inside? - I cannot say how it was broke, but the glass was in the area.</p>

            's house was broke open, it struck me that it must be done by somebody in the house; I went and saw the prisoner sitting by the fire, seemingly in very great pain, for he had two marks as if cut with a knife; I took him to the area with me, and on the outside there was a brick on which they were supposed to have stepped, which was a little broke. I got the cook to put the shutters up the same as they were on the night of the robbery; she did; and I asked if it was bolted or barred; she said both. I asked her if she would swear before a justice it was bolted and barred; she said she would not swear she bolted it, but she would swear that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290010"/> she barred it. The bar was a little broke; it went into a tenter-hook, which must have been wrenched had it been forced open; there was a pane of glass broke, and on the inside a cobweb, which must have been broke had any body got in there, and the tenter-hook was not forced, upon which I was sure it must have been done by somebody in the inside. I examined the door, and found that what force had been used, had been on the inside, and none on the outside; the box that receives the bolt was broke on the inside, but not on the outside. I told my suspicions to the major; and then I told Mrs. Edmondes I was sure it was somebody in the house; she was unwilling to admit any suspicion against the prisoner. I took her and shewed her the place, and asked her if she had given the prisoner leave to go out that night; she said yes, she gave him leave to go and see his wife. I said, is he married? she said yes; I said depend on it then the things are at his wife's. I got a direction from the Major and gave it to Jealous and another person, and they went and searched his wife's lodging, and there they found the things. I then told him there was enough to injure his liberty, and begged he would tell me where the rest of the plate was, that there might be no imputation on any of the servants; he said, if I would not take him to his mistress, he would tell me where the rest of the plate was; he said, he had thrown it into the cistern at his master's house. I went there and found it in the cistern; I was obliged to get a ladder to get at it, it is behind the area door, where he said they got in. I believe it is nine feet and a half from the ground, and a yard and a half deep. I found in the cistern, among some other plate, the large waiter bent double; it is in court.</p>

               <p>Did you make any promises to him to induce him to tell you where the plate was? - No; God forbid that I should.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I beg you will describe how that cobweb is situated by the window? - I examined the glass of the window; the cobweb was so across the glass, that it was impossible to get in without breaking it.</p>

He bid Freeman break the door open, and let in the whores to see how she lay in the straw.

             was murthering Peg Lane: we went down the court directly, but we could not hear any noise at all; upon which we went to our own lodgings, and then I heard the deceased make a great shriek; we went to the stable; the prisoner would not open the door to us.</p>

               <p>Did you hear the prisoner make use of any expressions? - I heard him d - n his eyes!</p>

               <p>Did you hear him say any thing more about her? - Not till he put the fork through the place to break open the door; then the prisoner said, here take the fork and let the bloody mares come in and see whether she is dead or not. When the stable door was broke open, she lay in her gore; we washed her and her brains were boiling out of her head like the scum of a pot.</p>

               <p>Did you hear him say any thing with respect to the manner of her death? - I heard him say that night in the stable, that she sell off the tub.</p>

               <p>You are the coroner who held the inquisition upon the body of the deceased? - I am.</p>

               <p>Is Mr. Hunter the surgeon here? - No; he is appointed surgeon to a man of war, and is gone abroad; he told me before he went, that Mr. Hawkins, one of the surgeons to the hospital, had examined the wound: Mr. Hawkins was subpaened to attend before the Grand Jury at Hicks's-Hall, as I understand by the father of the deceased; but Mr. Hawkins did not attend.</p>

            , his son. I called upon Mr. Hawkins, and told him that this court would require his attendance here. Mr. Hawkins said it was not his business to attend, but the business of the house surgeon, who always attended upon these occasions.</p>

               <p>You saw the head of the deceased I suppose when you held your inquisition? - I did.</p>

               <p>What did you observe? - A small wound; the scull was fractured.</p>

               <p>Did it appear as if broke with a sharp or a blunt instrument? - It appeared to me to have been done with a sharp instrument.</p>

               <p>The prisoner has declared that the wound was occasioned by the deceased's falling upon a sharp flint; was it such a wound as might be occasioned by falling upon a sharp flint? - I cannot say; the skull was violently factured, and was quite open, so that the brain came out.</p>

               <p>Did the wound run length-ways or round? - Round, about as big as a shilling I should suppose.</p>

               <p>I was drinking with Margaret Lane; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290015"/> was a girl I had lived with between three and four years; she wanted to go up into the hay loft to lie; I listed her up into the hay loft, there was neither hay nor straw there; I would make her go down, because there was clean straw in the stable, and two sacks; she was not agreeable to go down into the stable, because if my master should come in the morning and should see her, she was afraid that it would come to my wife's ears, because she had got a warrant for her before to send her to Bridewell for cohabiting with me. I said she should come down, and hit her several times with my open hand: she said, pray don't lick me, pray don't lick me, and I will go down. I listed her then upon the butt, there is another butt near it; she over swayed me, and I fell with my knees in the other tub, and dashed her down with her head upon the stones with all my weight upon her; she cried out, O Lord! I helped her up, and she never spoke afterwards. I had been beating her in the lost; they heard her; I was taking her into the stable when they went to call the people at the alehouse; they listed her on the straw;

             came to the door, and asked what was the matter; I made answer, nothing; but she and I had had some words, and I had let her fall; Davy said, we will break the door open; I said, no, I believed she was very well. She spewed all over me; I asked Turner for a light, he said, he would not give a light for fear we should burn the stable; for a stable in the neighbourhood had been lately set on fire. I found her head wet; I said, Freeman bring a light; a light was brought me by him or Turner. Freeman got up into the loft again; I was looking to see whether her head was cut; the wick of the candle was but a little bit, the tallow was broke off the wick, and it slipt through my fingers and went out; and upon that I called out to Freeman, for God's sake come in with a light, for I believe her brains are out!</p>

I followed them, it being my way home; but I was not over solicitous to follow them quick, not wishing for more of their company. I was desired afterwards to go to the office in Litchfield street; there I saw the prisoners; as soon as I saw them I challenged them; I am sure Saul is one of the men; I am not certain to Hyams; the evening was tolerably light; there was a moon of a week old; and I had an opportunity to observe Saul's face; and therefore I can swear positively to his person.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I live very near the prosecutor in Hoxton fields; I can be of little utility for or against the prisoner; only the lady said she was robbed of either 7 s. &amp; 3 d. or 7 s. and 4 d.</p>

               <p>Was you at the tabernacle with her? - Yes; and came home a little before her.</p>

               <p>What time did she complain to you of it? - I saw her the next day; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>

               <p>You did not see either of the men on the road that night? - It was moon light, but the moon was intercepted.</p>



               <p>But did you see either of these men that night upon the road? - I could not swear to them, but I have seen them before.</p>

               <p>DENNIS Mc DONALD sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; one Rogers confined in the Savoy Gaol sent up to the office that he could inform us of some robberies in Hoxton fields; I know nothing of the matter, but taking up the prisoners, and bringing them before the justice.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutrix. What kind of a night was it? - So light that I could clearly discern them; the moon was about a week old.</p>

               <p>Was any lamp near? - It was but a few yards to a lamp.</p>

               <p>An Information coming to Sir John Fielding's office of this burglary, and some robberies; the prisoner Massey and another were taken into custody, as they passed up Bow-street, and were carried into the office and examined; the other prisoner followed them in; and having followed them in, and being in their company, something having been found upon Massey, which led us to believe that Massey might have been concerned in this robbery; Kelly was also searched; and we found upon Massey two parcels of ribbands; and upon Kelly a pair of cotton gloves; (the ribbands and gloves were produced in court).</p>

               <p>MASSEY's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>If the ribband be measured, it will be found they have each a yard less than the lady says. I bought these six yards of ribband of a pedlar in my own lodging that very morning; when my wife died I had a young woman to make my bed and clean my room; I told her I would make her a present of a ribband or two, and I bought these to give her. I bought it for six yards, and gave him half a crown for it, at the sign of the Queen's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290018"/> Head in the Strand, about eight o'clock in the morning; there was nobody in the house but a little boy that is gone away. I have not any body here; the landlord and his wife are very ill; I have been formerly a gentleman's servant, after I was out of place I learned to dress hair; I have been lately down to my own town; I have no friends here at all.</p>


               <p>KELLY's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I lodge likewise at the Queen's Head in the Strand with my wife and family, and have for about a year and a half. I came down stairs at about eight in the morning to read the news-paper; a woman came in with a large bundle, she seemed like an old clothes woman; she offered me some stockings and handkerchiefs to sell. I told her I wanted no such things; then she shewed me a pair of gloves. I said I never wore such things: the boy said your wife does. I asked the price; she said 2 s. I bid her one as I did not want them. I at last said I would give her 18 d. for them; she said if she took my money she would drink with me. I said she might drink the beer I left; I went out, going along Covent Garden I met this young man that stands by me and the other; we were going to Lincoln's-Inn-Fields to see a match that was going to be played at fives. Going up Bow-street, Massey said this was the nearest way; when we came to the Brown-Bear door, Jealous came out and stopped Massey; I was thirty or forty yards behind; he said there was an information of a robbery, and by the description he was one; and he said to the other young man, I believe you to be another. I said, do you want me? Jealous said no; we have no notice of you, nor description of you. I said I may go about my business then I suppose; he said yes, I might; but I said I would stop and see what was their fate; I was afterwards stopped and searched. If I had been conscious of having any stolen goods upon me, I should not have gone there: there was a person who was present at the time I bought these mittens, who sat in a box opposite me, but I never could find him out; the landlord and landlady would appear, but they are both lying at the point of death. I am now a waiter, I have been mostly in the tea gardens lately.</p>

I offered to carry them on board his ship myself, but I had not a doll so large as he wanted; he perswaded me to go to Broad-street to see if I could not purchase one to his mind, he said he would go to about half a crown or 3 s. in the price; I called a neighbour, Isabella Mersin to mind my shop, and to accompany the prisoner till I came back; when I returned, the prisoner was gone, and I missed my cloak.</p>

I had seen Mrs. Bulford's cloak hanging there that morning, but I did not observe it at that time.</p>

               <p>I happened to be at the next door to the prosecutrix, and I heard the prisoner give orders<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290019"/> to have this small beer made very hot for him while he went on a message; I threw up the sash and saw him come out of the house, he stood hesitating in the street sometime which way he should go; at last he went Rosemary-lane way: when the cloak was missed I went in pursuit of the prisoner. I went and looked into all the shops in Rosemary-lane, but did not see the prisoner till I was coming back, then I met him going into Rosemary-lane, I watched him till I saw him go into a cloath's shop; he took out the cloak and offered to sell it; I ran into the shop and collared him and charged him with stealing the cloak, he then said it was his wife's cloak, after that he said he found it; the mob rose about us; there was no constable to be got, so I took him myself before a justice.</p>

               <p>[The cloak was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.]</p>

               <p>Having a suspicion of the prisoner, I stopped him in Tottenham Court-Road on the 28th of February: I found a bundle upon him. I asked him how he came by it; he said he found them in the street; it was a wet dirty night, and it was not dirty; upon examining the bundle I found it contained shifts wet as just from the wash. I took him into custody.</p>

I did not see the place fastened over night from whence the plate was stole; nor did I see it when it was discovered the next morning. After my servant had found out that the house had been robbed I saw the marks by which some persons had got over the walls and had got into this scullery in order to get the plate out of it. I had a very fierce dog in the yard, but one of them who is admitted an evidence for the crown, had lived three years ago in my service; he used to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290024"/> the dog, and the dog knew him again and was more grateful to him than he was to me, or he would have torn him to pieces.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Hockley; the spoons were lost out of the scullery; they are usually kept in a cupboard in this scullery. I saw the door bolted the night before, and the window shut at ten in the evening. I saw the spoons in the cupboard, there were seventeen spoons in all, three large soup spoons, nine desert spoons, and five table spoons. I know nothing of the situation in which it was found the next morning, for the maid opened it, and she is not here. I did not see it till nine in the morning; I then saw some marks of some mortar which had fell down where somebody had climbed over the wall and got into the scullery window; they must have got over four or five walls, for it is an enclosure backwards; the garden walls must be climbed over; it must have been committed by some person pretty well acquainted with the situation of the house, and they must have got in at the window.</p>

On the 3d of February, between three and four in the morning, all the prisoners, and Griffiths who is the evidence, came in and laid down upon the bed in their clothes. Hosier had the property wrapped up in a blue apron. I heard there was something of value there; it gingled as he laid it down in the chair by the bedside; I wondered what it was; I did not enquire that night, but the next morning at seven, when the prisoners got up, I asked them what the bundle contained, Hosier and Griffiths said that they were spoons that they had got the night before. Hosier and Griffiths went down to

Griffiths, in the presence of all the rest of the prisoners, desired me to go down to Mrs. Keeling, and desire her to send up half a guinea upon them, for they wanted half a guinea; I found Mrs. Keeling there with this plate, she had got some leaden weights and weighed the spoons; she said she had no money of her own, that she could send them up, but she would go to Whitechapel and sell the spoons, and bring the money there: if I would go along with her, she would treat me with a coach; we took a coach from St. Giles's to Whitechapel; there we sold the spoons for 5 l. 12 s. when we came back again, Mrs. Keeling gave the prisoner three guineas; I don't recollect whether she said that was the whole she got for them, or whether she endeavoured to cheat them out of part of it. I was by when she gave them the three guineas; there were three very large spoons; and the remainder seemed to be table spoons. I had nothing for my trouble.</p>

               <p>I was servant to Mr. Hockley three years ago last Bartholomew tide; I have been at sea since; and worked about in Gardens; and at last of all entered into a gang with these people; all the prisoners went out with me, with an intention to do this fact. The night of the 3d of February we went to a place called the New Ale-house, in Buckingham street, St. Giles's, about nine or ten in the evening. The reason of pitching upon this particular house was from my knowing that the plate was usually kept in that cupboard. We went along, and came to Parson's Green about one o'clock, but

When we came to Parson's Green, we got over three or four walls by my directions; at last we got to the top of Mr. Hockley's wall; there are pales fixed upon the wall which have tender hooks in them; I attempted to get over, and I tore my leg in two places with these tenter hooks; I was the only person that got over, because I knew the house better than the rest; and also because of the dog which was very large and fierce; Knight was at top of the pales with me, but did not dare to get down. When I got down the dog knew me perfectly well and fondled upon me; I had never seen the dog since I left the service of Mr. Hockley; I chained him up; the dog readily submitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290025"/> to it; Knight still stood at the top of the pales; and Hosier stood in the garden behind, in order to help us two up; when I got to the scullery I lifted up the sash window and put in my hand, and I found I could reach the cupboard without getting into the scullery; so I never was in the scullery, but put in my hand and took the plate out, and handed it up to Knight, who stood upon the pales; I remember particularly I took a soup ladle and two wooden spoons, which are used for the young gentlemen who are scholars there, and about fifteen others; if there were any more, they concealed them from me; I handed them up to them, they put them into a blue apron; Knight was upon the wall, and Hosier below; when this was done, I unchained the dog, and turned him loose; and then got over the wall back again; then we all set forward for London; and at Little Chelsea we called upon Major again, who was got something more sober than he was, and came home along with us; then we all went to Mrs. Keeling's house, and laid down upon the bed in our clothes.

               <p>I am a master carman, I contract with the Victualling Office to carry whatsoever they shall want, and employ my men under me with several carts. I employed the prisoner, as I have done several times before, to carry from Tower Whan night butts to the Victualling Office. I helped to load them up the same day as laid in the indictment; soon after I had an information that he had carried them off; I met him and asked him what was become of those butts; he at the first stoutly denied that he knew any thing of the master; then he burst out a crying, and said, he would tell where they were; he said, they were in a place in Virginia Street, I went with him to this house; I looked through the crevice of the door, the door was partly open, there I saw the butts. I got assistance and forced open the doors and examined them, and saw the broad R, which is the mark upon all the king's stores stamped upon the hoops, and also upon the casks themselves near the bunghole; therefore I had no doubt that these were the same butts that were loaded up by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am a carman. I saw in Church-Lane, Spitalfields, one of my master's carts with a load of butts upon it, and Ratford driving it: this place is out of the road from Tower Wharf to the Victualling Office. I met some other people, we drank some gin together: after we had finished the conversation the prisoner desired me, for God sake! not to say that I had seen him, for he would tell my master a story that the horses ran away, and so he was going round to the Victualling Office. I went and discovered the whole matter to my master.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I just overtook the cart as he and this little lad came with the pitch-forks and shovels upon their shoulders; they said don't take notice to my master, I will go round Well-Close Square with them, and then to the office with them. Young Will Lane wrenched the whip out of my hand and drove the cart away, and he paid 6 d. at the bar; the butts were in the cart then.</p>

               <p>[The prisoner called a witness who gave him a good character.]</p>

On the 19th of February I missed eight pigs out of the back part of my premises; on the Saturday following the constable came and said there were some pigs lay dead in a stable in Caroline Court, Saffron Hill, and desired me to come and look at them. I went; there were four of them; they were stuck. I went down and looked at them, and swore to them by the marks and colour, it was a particular mark that they had wrung in their nose. I never had any other pigs with such a mark.</p>

               <p>I and the two prisoners, Edwards and Dockham, were the persons concerned in stealing these pigs: we were at a loss when we got them where to put them; we met Hodge, who said he would help us to a place to put them in, and went with us, and we put them in a stable in Caroline Court. On Friday Hodge told us he could help us to a customer for some of the pigs; he said, his brother would buy two or three of them; and we hired an ass of one Fennell to carry two of them to Hodge's brother, two of them were killed in the stable, and removed to Boiling-Alley, and the next day were removed to Hodge's house, in Crown Court, Grubb Street. Hodge had part of the two guineas: he received of his brother for the two pigs, and helped in carrying the others; the pigs that were owned by Mr. Sebbon were never at Hodge's, they were in the stable.</p>

               <p>I have a stable in Caroline Court: I came to the stable on Wednesday morning, and found eight pigs in it. I asked a man who has part of the stable with me, how they came there: he said, Edwards, Williams, Dockham and Hodge brought them there over night. I went to seek after them: I found Williams and Dockham in Smithfield, and told them to come and take the pigs away, or I would turn them out of the stable; they all four came down after me, when I went to the stable; I saw Hodge and Edwards with a sack and an axe, and I told them they had no occasion to bring them there, for nothing should be done to them in my stable; then Dockham and Edwards turned them into the next stable, and they all went in after them: that is the stable where the four pigs were found afterwards; they wanted to hire my ass; I would not lend it them; they hired Fennell's ass.</p>

I went into the shop to serve a customer, and then went into the parlour again; and the shop being near shut up, I left the door unbolted: just as I had got in I heard the latch move; I went into the shop to see if any body was come in, and saw the door latched: just as I had returned into the parlour, I heard the latch move again; I turned quick about and saw a man go out of the shop in a hurry, with something under his arm; I ran out and pursued him: I ran as far as Brownlow-street, and found I had out-run my strength, and could not catch him. I called, stop thief! and then heard somebody else cry stop thief! I then recollected I had left the shop with nobody in it, and if there were any more of them they might strip the shop; so I ran immediately back. The things were dropped and brought back; they have our mark upon them.</p>

               <p>I heard the cry of stop thief. I went to stop the prisoner, and he threw down two bundles: I took them up, and called, stop thief! and he was taken in less than two hundred yards, and brought back to the shop. I am positive the prisoner is the man that dropped the bundles. I delivered them to the last witness.</p>

               <p>I was going down Holborn: I stopped and was looking in at a toy-shop next door to Mrs. Thompson's: the prisoner and another man walked by me two or three times, and looked full in my face. I was afraid they were going to say something to me, and I went away. I looked back and saw the prisoner come out at Mrs. Thompson's door with something under his arm. I heard the cry of stop thief! he was taken. I saw him when he was brought back, and knew him again directly.</p>

On Sunday the 26th of March my wife and I went out about five o'clock: I locked up the house; we returned soon after nine: when we came near the house I saw a light up stairs; I left my wife and went and alarmed a neighbour; on my return my wife had stopped two gentlemen and told them there were thieves in the house. I desired them to help me, and then went and opened the door, and cried, holloa! who is there; then the people behind me told me the candle was put out. I then heard somebody running down stairs very fast: being afraid they might have some weapon concealed to do me a mischief, I went from the door about the length of my stick to strike at them as they came out. I struck at them, and I believe hit one; they ran off, but were pursued, and the prisoner was taken. I found the locks of my bureau broke open; there were six of my shirts packed up, but not taken away. I lost two spoons that I have never found again.</p>

I had retreated into a little corner, not a yard from the shop, with the door opening into a passage; the shop door was shut, and a bell to it. I believe the windows were shut, but they were not fastened; I did not hear any noise at all. I don't know when these things were taken away. I went into the shop about eight in the evening, and then, to my great surprise, saw the glass-case, the show-glass that used to stand in the window, was gone; that the window was then standing open, not put down; the cases used to stand in the window. This glass-case contained a great number of articles which I cannot give an account of exactly, because I left it at the office when the indictment was drawn up. I am sure there were more than ten snuff-boxes, and fifty or sixty paper snuffboxes in the show-glass; the show-glass was taken with them. I informed the neighbours of my having been robbed, and

We were carried before Justice Durden, where I told the truth, and was admitted an evidence.</p>

             and I saw Bonwick brought as a prisoner to Justice Durden's. We went upon his information to search Vaux's lodgings, in Mitre street; there we found a parcel of buckles and other things, and Vaux himself whom we secured; afterwards we went to Allen's lodgings, in Duck Lane; he got upon the bed and secreted himself; in the next room we found a parcel of snuff-boxes, besides one which he had given to a woman in the house; then we went to Lattimore's lodgings, and found him in bed; we did not find any thing in his lodgings; but he acknowledged he had two snuff-boxes which he had hid among some ruins for fear of a discovery. He went with us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290031"/> and showed us where he had dug a hole; we opened the hole and found the snuff-boxes.</p>

I had not been home above half an hour, before a person came and told me my sister was in fits, and as I was going along with her, she said she thought my sister had lost all the clothes out of the house, but that the thief was in the house.

I went down again, and somebody pushed the stair-foot door against me, and pushed me down; I found the door open, and the things gone, and called Mrs. Stevens down; she went into fits; Thompson and I were both taken to prison together; the justice discharged me the next day when I went again: he would not discharge me without bail.

I went with him; he put them on my head; he said they were his own property. The next morning I went to see if he had been for them; I found he had not; I went to his lodgings, and heard he was in New Prison. I went to her again, and asked her to go with me to see what he was there for, and they detained me. My brother when he gave them me, said he was afraid they would open them, and bid me say I was a gentleman's servant in St. Martin's Lane, and was carrying them to wash.</p>

My servants went to bed over night by ten o' clock; I was in bed myself by twelve, the waiter secured the out doors. I fastened the door at the bottom of the stair case; I always make it a rule to fasten that; there are two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290034"/> bolts in the inside. At about one o'clock (I believe it was) in the morning I heard a noise in my kitchen, which was repeated; I then got up and found that people were in my house, I hoped to have driven them away by calling to my servants by several fictitious names in order to give them the idea of my having a large family about me, but the door upon the stair case was soon forced open, and the door of my room, which is upon the first landing place; the lower pannel was broke through, and the lock was forced off; the first person that made his appearance, had his face blacked, or a crape over it, and a round frock over his clothes; the next had a handkerchief tied up to his eyes, and a taller man had a dark lanthorn. I myself had fire arms in my room, which they immediately seized; the tall man d - d me, and asked me if that was my guard? they took them from me; then they broke open my bureau, in which were writings; I gave them my pokets; they broke the front of a chest of drawers, and they took my clothes and linen; my money, which I kept in a purse in one of the drawers, I had taken and concealed upon the first alarm, between the bed and the sacking; a wainscot desk, containing my plate, I had thrown under the bed on the first alarm, in hopes they might have escaped their search; one, that they called captain, said, he was certain that I had plate, and in my fright I was obliged to tell them where it was; they broke open the desk in which the plate was and took the plate; among other things they took a pair of buckles, set with stone. I begged for my clothes, but they took them all; they went down stairs and after some time three returned and threatened my life; one, which I take to be the tallest, had a cutlass; the second a pocket pistol; and the third, a shorter man, stood at the foot of the bed, they demanded my money, and said, they were well informed I had money: I heard a fourth voice upon the landing place, saying, don't ask her questions, cut her throat! I had a child of seven years old in the bed with me, very much frightened; I endeavoured to pacify the child, they threatened to dash the child's brains out if it made a noise; in the end I told them where the money was, and they took it and my watch which hung at the bed's head; there was about fifty guineas, and there was some money taken from my pocket, and some that lay loose in the drawer; they went down stairs very merry, and sung; there were bottles of wine found upon the table next day, from which it appeared they had been drinking; after some time one came half way up the stairs and asked how I did, and said, the beef was exceeding good, and they should call again in half an hour. I had a cold buttock of beef which they had been eating, and cold mince pies. Just as they went away, I heard a pistol fired off, I heard one say, you did not think it was me when you shot, I am wounded, I am afraid I shall be lame; this was repeated twice. They came into the house at about one o'clock, I think they staid till about four o'clock, there were some shot sticking in the mantle-piece.</p>

               <p>I am a waiter at Copenhagen House. I made fast the doors and windows, I was waked in the night by my mistress calling to me between one and two; two persons came into my room, and asked me who was in the house; they said that they would blow my brains out if I did not tell the truth. I told them; they went into the maid's room, but she was not to be found; they said they would cut her to pieces. She called from the top of the house, and said she had hid herself, because she was frightened; she came down stairs upon their bidding her, and got into her bed; they tied me on my bed and left me so. I got up about seven in the morning, and found the doors of the kitchen, the cellar, and the street doors, and the windows were all open; it appeared that the thieves got in at the kitchen window, for there were the marks of iron crows there, and the bolts were bent double. Upon the first alarm, before they came up into my room, I had put a gun out at the window, and had threatened to fire. I was answered by one from below, d - n you, fire away! if you don't I will, and upon that I heard the report of a pistol, and they were up stairs instantly. I found upon examination the next morning, that there were swan-shot and cut lead sticking in the chimney-piece, the contents, as I supposed, of that pistol which was fired into the kitchen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290035"/> and there were appearances of a pistol having burst, for there were pieces of the barrel of a pistol, and some of the guard there: there was a light near my room, if not brought into it; but I did not see any body; for the first thing they ordered me was, not to look at them, threatening to blow my brains out; they bid me lie on my face, and then they tied me.</p>

               <p>All the three prisoners were concerned with me in committing this burglary. We met in the Borough in the morning, and we met at my lodging in the evening in Feather-bed-lane, Cold-Bath-Fields; we set out and went the back way to Copenhagen-house. Turner had the crow; Davis and I broke the kitchen window; Turner and Jordan got in first; then a man called out from the house that he would fire. Davis said, if you don't put your head in I will shoot you; they who were got in called to us without to come in: I jumped with my two hands upon the window in order to get in, and in so doing an old horse pistol I had in my hand went off and burst, and cut my finger sadly; it jarred my arm so as quite to benumb it: we all went up stairs; I suppose the stair-foot door, which had been bolted on the inside, must have been forced before I got in, for I found no impediment; we all got in; Turner forced a pannel of the mistress's room; Turner bid me stay there and take care of her, and to shoot her if she offered to move. I objected to going higher up stairs, because the waiter knew me; therefore I was left in the room, while they went up and secured the waiter. Turner opened the doors. I and Davis had waggoners frocks on; Davis had a brown masque on, the others had black crapes on; I had a handkerchief across my face; I think Davis had a dark lanthorn; we found a box under the bed; Turner said, take the things out one by one. I answered, yes, Captain, I will. After we had taken the things out, we went down and got some beer, mince pies and beef: then Turner said, I will go up and pinch her again; he went up with Davis, and Jordan went up half way; soon after I heard money rattle, and Turner came down singing with a purse with thirty-two guineas in it, which we divided immediately. Davis and Jordan then tried their pistols whether they would go off or not, not meaning to do any mischief with them, and two of them went off. I made a complaint of my arm, and said that I was afraid I should be lame: we returned by a back way, (having lost our way in the fields) to my lodgings: the three prisoners took the things away to the other side of the water, because I did not care to have them in my lodgings. Turner said he would let the two women at the Dolphin in Red-Cross-street, in the Borough, have the two gowns; we had been at that house in the morning before we went upon this expedition; we met again on the Sunday, I and Turner went up stairs and bargained with the woman, while the other two staid below. Turner made them a present of the stone-buckles into the bargain: we sold the gowns for three guineas; there was a blue gown, a black gown, and an old fashioned gown, with white flowers. I was not taken up for this robbery, nor indeed any other. I was in company with some persons, and Sir

               <p>I keep a public house in Red-Cross-street, in the Borough. I know these three prisoners and Carleton who passed by the name of Andrews. I bought three gowns of them on the Sunday morning following Christmas Day; they were all in the house, but whether they came all in together on that day, I cannot say. There was a blue gown, a black gown, and a grey gown, with white flowers. They had a pair of stone buckles, which they asked half a guinea for. I gave three guineas for the gowns, and had the buckles into the bargain. They passed for smugglers; they all had used my house before, and all seemed acquainted with each other; the bargain was made in the club room, up one pair of stairs; Turner and Carleton only were present, but I saw the others afterwards in the house.</p>

               <p>Can you recollect whether they were at your house a few days before they made this bargain? - I cannot recollect the little man Jordan, they used to call Little Harry; he and Davis were with Turner that Sunday at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290036"/> my house after this bargain; Carleton, I think, went away, I afterwards delivered the gowns and buckles to Mr. Clarke. I agreed with Carleton for the gowns; I cannot say whether Turner had any thing to do with them or not; he did not say any thing while they were making the bargain. Turner brought the gowns to me a day or two before this bargain for them was made; he represented that there was a person who had three gowns to dispose of, and he would leave them with me to see if I should like to buy them.</p>

They had cutlasses, or pistols, or something of that sort, in their hands, and a dark lanthorn slipped half over the light. The first that came into the room, pushed me down in the bed, and covered me up; they told me to lie still, or else they would shoot me. They covered the rest up in bed; I could not see them, but I heard them cover them up. They asked my fellow-servant his name; he told them it was

               <p>I am the son of the prosecutor, who is a farmer at Finchley. On Sunday night, the 1st of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a terrible noise; I got up in my bed directly; my room door stood open; it generally stands open all night; three men came in at first; the first of them I have never seen since; the second man that I saw I think was Fryer; I believe he was one of the three; then there was one came up to the farther side of the bed, who flung the clothes over my head, and struck me across the back with something that I took to be a little iron bar; then two of them went out of the room into another room, where my father lay, and some went into all the rooms on that floor; two of them came back again, and told me I must get out of bed, which I did; they made me hold my hands over my eyes all the while they took me into my father's room, and I went to bed to him; I lay about half an hour, while they rifled my room.</p>

               <p>Did any of the people stay in the room with you? - Yes; I believe two were in the room all the while; there were three in the room afterwards; one of them bid me go to bed again; they said, I need not hold my hand over my eyes, for there was nobody in the room they were afraid of my seeing. I went into the room, and turning myself to get into bed, I saw one between my father's room door and mine, which I believe to be Fryer. They had several lights; he had a red and white handkerchief over his eyes; sometimes he twisted it on one side, and I could then see part of his face; he was just about the size of Fryer, and had such a coloured great coat on as I have now.</p>

               <p>How many lights were there? - Three or four. The first, I believe, was a large candle, at the end of a stick; they were all candles, I believe; I did not see any lanthorn. I believe Horner was one of the persons that came in afterwards; they came to take my breeches from under my pillow; they had before taken my watch out of my pocket, and laid it in the chair by my bed side; one came in, which I believe was Horner, after I was in my own bed again, and said, if I would tell where all the money was, he would not take my watch; but I afterwards looked, and the watch was gone. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after they left the house, I came down and found the stair-foot door fastened up; they had drove a staple in over the latch. The servants and I broke it open; we found all the other doors open; there were the marks of instruments which had been made use of to open the doors. They got in at the back door, which was bolted and barred, I believe; the staple of the bolt was wrenched out, and lay at a distance from the door. They took away money, and plate, and a watch, and about thirteen or fourteen guineas of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290038"/> mine, and a 30 l. and 20 l. bank note. There was a silver cup and silver pint mug taken, and several other things, (but I don't rightly know how many of the drawers were broke open) and some boxes opened, and the things taken out.</p>

               <p>Did any body sleep in the room with you? - Yes; my mistress. I observed Condon; I know him to be one of the men; they came up together side by side; they went up stairs; they did not come into my room. Condon said, If I made any noise, he would blow my brains out.</p>

               <p>Did you take so much notice of his face as to be certain that he is the man? - I am sure of it, he had the pistol; the man in the middle had the light; he had his own hair tied up behind.</p>

               <p>I am waiter at the Half Moon in Aldersgate Street. Clark and Fryer came there on the 1st of March, between eight and nine in the evening; they stayed the last company in the house; we shut up at eleven; they had a pint of liquor after we had shut the shutters; they went about half after eleven. I knew them both.</p>

               <p>On his cross-examination he said that Fryer was dressed in brown clothes, that his hair was not turned up, but combed down; that he had a Tyburn top; that he had his hat sometimes off and sometimes on.</p>

               <p>I am a pen-cutter in Golden Lane. On the first of March I had been to Whitechapel; I stayed there till about eleven o'clock; coming back about twelve I met Fryer and Clark in Chisswel-street.</p>

               <p>On his cross-examination he said, he believed Fryer was dressed in brown clothes, that he never heard that Fryer was taken up till he was subpoened; that he knew it was Sunday the first of March, because he wanted to see Clarke to get him to appraise some goods for him on Monday the 2d.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of February Condon came to lodge with me in New-Market-Street; he lay in my room up two pair of stairs with a little boy of mine; he always came in about ten o'clock; I used to call my boy up about six in the morning, because he goes to a charity-school, and I always found Condon in bed. I don't know that he was ever any night out of the house; he lodged there till he was taken; he sometimes went out after breakfast, sometimes before.</p>

               <p>I let a lodging to the prisoner at three and six-pence a week; he was with me a month; he began another week, but left me in the middle of it without any notice. His long absence created a suspicion, the prisoner had put a padlock upon his room, which he did every day, and the key hole was filled up with paper. I took out the paper and looked into the room and missed the sender. I told my suspicions to a person in the house, who said he thought it was proper to break the door open. I had it opened and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)</p>

               <p>I am a broker. The prisoner applied to me to take these things out of pawn. I agreed to take them out; he said they were his own property.

I pulled my clothes off and laid them on a stall in the stable to go up into the hay-loft to take in some straw; there was nobody in the stable while I was in the lost; I saw a man go from the stable with some clothes on his arm. I called out to know who he was; he made no answer. I went down and missed my things, and pursued him, but he was got out of sight; he was pursued and taken, and the two knives, gloves and hat were found upon him. I never got my clothes again; the hat hung up in the stable; he left one in the room of it.</p>

I gave Crawley a fresh caution to take care. I let the passengers out, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290044"/> Crawley gave some of the parcels out of the basket to the porter of the inn. Crawley had a side of pork on the wheel to deliver to the porter; and I observed a man pulling at it. I went and asked him what business he had with the pork, and put my elbow against his breast, and pushed him away, and Crawley pulled it in. I then saw the prisoner on the other side with his hands in the basket. I went round to see what he was about; he jumped down; I followed him and took him by the collar and brought him on the pavement; he struck me, and three or four more fell upon me at the same time: I defended myself as well as I could; I knocked one of them down under the coach; the prisoner struck me on my breast and several parts of my face: I had scarce a free part but what was cut or bruised. We dispersed them a little, and I believe the prisoner was knocked down; after they were a little dispersed I went to look into the boot to see if I had lost any thing; the prisoner came and caught me by the leg and pulled me down, and intangled my leg in the wheel of the coach: a neighbour came to my assistance, and we secured him. Since he has been in confinement, he says, he will never leave me nor my coach while he lives; so that if he is at liberty I shall not only be in danger of my property but my life.</p>

I found this pewter upon her; I saw the direction upon the back part of the plate; I detained her and sent to the prosecutor's house; the man came and said the house had been broke open in the night.</p>

The deceased was at my house on a Monday soon after Christmas (I don't recollect the day) between eleven and twelve o'clock at night he came in, and several with him. The prisoner and one Greenland sat down in a box by themselves. The deceased was a very quarrelsome man, but was very quiet, and, I believe, sober that night. He was in a box that was very full, and left he should quarrel with the people in it, I desired him to come out, and sit in the box where the prisoner and Greenland were, which he did very quietly. The prisoner said something to Greenland; what it was I don't know, but I thought it was to shove him out of the box. Greenland did not take notice of what he said; they were sitting on the same side; the prisoner came by Greenland to try to shove him out himself; I told him to let him alone, for he had not offended him. The prisoner then came out of the box, and struck the deceased in the face, without any provocation on the side of the deceased or moving off his seat; the deceased did not strike him again. I interfered, and shoved the prisoner, and desired him to sit on the other side from Brown, which he did; I then went about my business. I did not hear what words passed between them, but I heard Brown say, keep off, I am rather afraid; if you come nearer to me I will strike you. I was in my bar or room, I cannot say which. I came out and saw them both fighting; I took Spikes under the chin, and pulled him back, to prevent their fighting, and as I thought him the aggressor, I was for putting him out of doors. The company desired I would not, and said there should be no more of it. The prisoner went out some time after, and the deceased stayed in the house for some minutes. The deceased said to my wife, give your Billy (meaning himself) a glass of gin, and I will go home. She served him with a glass; after that the deceased went out, and some of the company told me that the prisoner was stripped, waiting at the door against he came out, and that the prisoner struck him as soon as he got out. I did not see the beginning of it; I saw several blows on both sides afterwards. While they were in the house, I did not hear any appointment or challenge to fight; I did not care to leave the house, so I did not see the end of it. Brown was not stripped while I was out. The deceased called three or four days afterwards, and said he was much hurt, and was afraid he should not get over it; he said he had two cuts in his head, but he did not mind that so much as a pain he had in his side.</p>



               <p>[On his cross-examination he said the prisoner poured some beer on Greenland, who was asleep; that the witness said he would suffer no such usage in his house, but that he did not see the deceased interfere, but that afterwards the prisoner said Brown had struck him over the nose.]</p>

I lived in the same house with the deceased; I was with him about an hour and an half on the Thursday evening before he went into the hospital, which was the Thursday se'nnight after the fray happened. He told me, that as he was coming home, he called in at Powell's to have a pint of beer; that the prisoner came in, and attempted to quarrel with him; that he did not know why he wanted to quarrel with him; for he had not given him any provocation, unless some words which passed at some place where they had met before. He said that the prisoner after he had aggravated him some time with words, struck him, but still he refrained from quarrelling with him; that some time after this, the prisoner, and two men that were with him, went out of doors, and that he supposed them to be quite gone; that he stayed some little time in the house after the prisoner went out, and then went up to the bar, and had a glass of gin; that he then wished<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290049"/> them a good night, and then went out of doors, where he found the prisoner stripped; that as soon as he came out, the prisoner struck him and knocked him down; that before he could recover his feet, the prisoner struck him again, and knocked him down a second time; that he was so much stunned with the fall, that he could not recollect any thing afterwards. I asked him, whether the stunning was by the blow or fall? He said he believed it was by the fall; that he thought his head hit against an iron bar or scraper. I did not see the wounds, because I was afraid to undo the bandage which was done up by the surgeon of the hospital. He complained that when he coughed he had a pain in his side. The next day he was very bad, and the day after he went into the hospital, and then I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>[On his cross-examination he said that the prisoner did not tell him any thing of his taking up the quarrel of another man, not that he struck the prisoner; that the deceased was rather chearful that night, and that he believed the deceased was rather in hopes of recovery.]</p>

             came to the hospital on the 14th of January, and continued as an out-patient about ten days. He had a contused wound on the left side of the fore part of his head; the wound did not appear to be dangerous; it got better the first four or five days, and after that got worse till the 24th, when he was taken into the Middlesex hospital, and made an in-patient. He continued there till the 20th, when he died. I opened his head after he was dead, and there was a great quantity of matter on the left side of the brain, spread all over the surface, between the membranes; the inflamation that came on the brain in consequence of the blow, was the occasion of the man's death; it was entirely from the blow. He was trapanned on the 26th or 27th, and a great quantity of matter came from the apperture that was made in his skull. I asked him how he came by the wound? He told me, he fell against the scraper of a door. He did not say any thing more.</p>

               <p>I had been to a meeting of Plaisterers, where they meet every Monday night, at the Black Horse in Oxford Road; I got pretty forward in liquor. When we broke up, we called at the Plaisterers' Arms, intending to have a pot of beer, this Greenland, and I, and several more. Greenland fell asleep, and in order to wake him, I poured a little drop of beer down his neck. Powell said, I will be d - n'd if I will have any such usage in my house. Brown made answer, d - n the bloody dog, kick him out of doors. Upon that words arose between us, and he struck me on the nose, and made my nose bleed; a scuffle ensued between us. Mr. Powell came and laid hold of me by the back part of my neck, and pulled me down; he cut my head, and dragged me along the floor. His wife said he was wrong, for that Brown struck first; then he let me go. The company told him it was not my fault. I said to Brown, if you are a man, come out and fight like a man; I went out, and some men with me, and we went to fighting.</p>

               <p>I was at Powell's house on the 12th of January. The prisoner and the deceased were in the house when I went in; they were all in peace; Greenland fell asleep; the prisoner was in company with him; there was no other in company but them. The prisoner threw some beer over Greenland to wake him; Powell on that said that he should not use a dog of his so. The deceased took it up, and had them turn him out of the house. The prisoner called him a dog, and said he could not turn him out. The deceased said, if he was to hit him he should kill him; the prisoner said he could hit as hard as he; the deceased said he could swell his head as big as a pumpkin, and hit him on the nose, and made it bleed; then the prisoner hit him again, and a skirmish began. Powell came and pulled the prisoner away; I told Powell it was not the prisoner, but the deceased that was the aggressor. The prisoner then said to the deceased, if you are a man, come out and fight like a man. Brown buttoned up his coat, and said, d - n the dog, I will go out and link him. Jonas lles made answer, calling him by his name. Billy, if you will go out, I will go out and second you, and do all I can. Accordingly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290050"/> he did, and there were two seconds on both sides, and they went out and fought till the watchman came and parted them.</p>

On the 20th of April the prisoner came to our shop, and desired to look at some Manchester moreens, as we sometimes call them. I showed her about a dozen pieces; she described a pattern which I had not got. I suspected her by her motions; I watched her, and saw her take a piece. She bid me much less for a piece than it cost me, She left my shop; I followed her into the piazzas; she had this piece in her hand, (producing it); she was looking at it; it is my property.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>It is true I went to this man's shop. About five or six months ago I bought a piece of Manchester, which was of a doe colour, striped with pink. I had this in my hand, and a tambour worked waistcoat, and a new pair of shoes; when I went into his shop I meant to change that, and give the gentleman 5 s. or 6 s. in lieu. I said I wanted a pink stripe; another gentleman brought a number of pieces, and put them on the counter, and said, will they do? I said, no; I was set to a pattern, and wanted doe colour, striped with silk; I said I bought one of you; this gentleman said, I remember you did. The gentleman pushed them aside to the bottom of the compter, and asked me to turn round and look at some hanging loose upon chairs; I said it was needless, as they had not the pattern I wanted. I had in my hand a pair of shoes and a half piece of a tambour waistcoat. I went out of the shop; the gentleman came after me, and charged a constable with me. I went into his shop again; I laid this piece out of my hand, and told him it was my property. I went on my knees, and begged he would send for my friends; he said no, he had been often robbed, and would make me pay for all.</p>

               <p>On the 12th of March, about seven in the evening, I fastened up the shutters of my parlour, as usual; I went into the kitchen to look at the children; then I went out; I locked the street door and the parlour door, and took the keys with me; I was out about twenty minutes. When I returned, I found the shutters of the parlour window open, and the sash thrown up. I looked through, and missed my linen from a chest of drawers in the parlour. Without going into the house, I ran for my husband; we came home together, and then we missed the things mentioned in the indictment. We examined, but could not find how the people got into the house, there was no appearance of any force having been used. I am sure I fastened the door.</p>

One struck me upon the nose, and said, d - n your eyes stop! I said, no, no, not to-night. Then I felt a blow upon my forehead, which knocked me down; when I lay upon the ground, I said they should not rob me, and I kept my hand on my breeches pocket. The prisoner held a pistol to me, and the other snatched his hand from my breeches pocket, and tore my breeches pocket out, with the contents of it. I had my hand on the outside of my pocket; I told them they should not rob me. They took from me 2 s. in silver and 9 d. I had a half guinea and also a half crown in my other pocket, but somebody coming, they ran away and did not take that. I positively swear that the prisoner was the man who held the pistol; I was afraid the pistol would go off every minute, and kept looking at him. I thought if any body came I would make a little more resistance. I saw him at the Rotation Office, and knew him directly.</p>

               <p>I was at the taking of the prisoner. At the Rotation Office the prosecutor picked him out as soon as he saw him.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor said at the Justice's that he knew me by a scar in my cheek. Dixon, who was in the Office, came up and looked in my face, and said there was no scar in my cheek, and then the prosecutor said he knew me by my shock head of hair. The Justice asked him if he knew me by any thing else? He said no.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I did say that as I lay on the ground I thought he had a scar in his cheek, but I said that I could pick him out from a thousand. I might be mistaken as to the mark, but I can positively swear to the man, I did think, and I think now there might be a scar in his cheek; I said I knew him by the scar and his hair. He had the same clothes on he has now; I took notice of him, and the pistol particularly, because I thought it would go off every minute; I did not take notice of the other. At the time I was robbed it was so light that I could see a man coming from the top of the field.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Knowles, who keeps the Black Boy in St. Catherine's lane. On Sunday the 29th of March, a little after two in the afternoon, Hart came to our house with another man and stayed till dark; I made them two bowls of liquor, a bowl of rum and water, and a bowl of gin and water, I believe Hart had a brown coat on, they paid a shilling; we charge nothing for fire.</p>

               <p>Do you remember any thing about the fire? - Yes, I made it up twice.</p>

               <p>BINGHAM sworn.</p>


               <p>I saw Hart that day at his father's about one o'clock, he stayed till about two; then he said he was going to St. Catherine's.</p>

               <p>I met the prisoner accidentally on the 29th of March, between two and three o'clock, at the Black Boy in St. Catherine's Lane; I was in company with him about two hours and an half; there was no other company except the maid of the house, he seemed to know her pretty well; I drank about three pints of beer, he drank part of one pint with me.</p>

               <p>Was he in company with any body else besides you? - There was a young woman and two young men, I don't know who they were.</p>

               <p>Had they any other liquor, wine, or punch? - I cannot say; I did not see what liquor they had.</p>

               <p>I am bar-keeper to the prosecutor. There was 28 l. 11 s. 6 d. in the drawer in the bureau; I counted it the night before, and put it in the drawer in the morning. I did not leave the bar till ten or eleven o'clock; during the time I was in and out, I had the bar constantly in my eye; nobody entered the bar, but the prisoner, who went there to cut some bread and cheese; he had an opportunity, if he thought proper, to take it, of opening the bureau, and taking the money out without my seeing him. The gold was in a green silk purse, the silver in a bag; the sum consisted mostly of gold; there was about 50 s. in silver, all the rest was in guineas and half guineas. The prisoner went out, and I missed it, about ten minutes after; he ran away, and never returned again.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher. I pursued the prisoner and found him at Waterfield, in Hampshire. I took him to the sign of the Drum, and asked him what he had done with the money he took out of Mr. Walker's bar; he immediately acknowledged that he had made away with all of it, but 1 l. 14 s. I found a watch and trinkets, and other things upon him, which he confessed he bought with part of the money. I made use of neither promises nor threats to induce him to confess. I said afterwards on the road, that if he behaved well I would do the best I could for him; but I did not say any thing before he confessed.</p>

Upon the 6th of March, which was on a Friday morning, Roach and I went down into this vault and unscrewed the screws of Mr. Thornton's coffin all but two, and returned again to our work; afterwards we, together with Elliott, agreed to go to work again upon this coffin. On the Saturday morning we went to the church; about five in the morning a watchman followed us in and desired us to plane a board, which I did; we unscrewed the other two screws, and turned the coffin bottom upwards, and so took off the outside coffin from off the coffin; we left nothing but the shell; we cut the leaden coffin to pieces, and then replaced the other upon the shell, and screwed it down again; by this time it was pretty near eight o'clock; we carried the pieces of coffin, and concealed it under the children's gallery; we proposed then to go and sell it; Elliott mentioned Parker, in Grubb-street. There were two pieces, one was put in a bag which was taken by myself, the other was put in a basket. When we got to London-Wall, Elliott beckoned to me, and we went to a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290059"/> shop first, where they refused to buy it. We then went to Parker's he immediately weighed the lead; he asked no questions; he said it was forty-two pounds, and he paid us three shillings and six-pence, reckoning it at a penny a pound. I was going away with the empty bag, Mr. Augur's apprentice came in and seized me, and desired Parker, who is a constable, to assist in conveying me and Elliott to his master Mr. Augurs, Parker said, you had better go to your master and try to make the matter up; we went and were all three charged; Parker said, give them a trevalle for it.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by that? - I did not know exactly what it meant, but supposed it meant that we should try to get away; accordingly we made a run for it; Parker ran too; we did not get far; we were soon stopped and secured.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Augurs: upon the 7th of March, in the morning, as I was going up London-Wall, about eight o'clock, I saw Roach coming down Wood-street with a basket upon his back; he seeing me crossed over the way. I said what have you here; he said his tools. I looked at the basket. Roach turned round as if to avoid my looking into the basket. I looked in and saw there was lead; I seized Roach and sent for my master. I sent for a constable to take Roach into custody; that was the occasion of my going to Parker, for Parker was a constable. When I came to Parker's, I met the evidence Gould and Elliott coming out of Parker's shop with empty sacks, I supposed they had sold something there. I charged Parker with them: he said you had better go to your master quietly and make the affair up. I went and told my master what I had seen; my master charged them all, Parker amongst the rest. As they were going to the Compter they endeavoured to make off; but they were secured; after this we went and searched and found the leaden coffin removed from its place.</p>

               <p>- REYNOLDS sworn.</p>

               <p>I am an undertaker. I buried Mr. Thornton in a leaden coffin. I surveyed the vault the 7th of March, and the coffin was missing. I compared the pieces that were found at Parker's with the rest of the coffin that was found under the gallery of the church, and they were all beat up together again into the same from, they made out together the quantity and form of Mr. Thornton's coffin; we found the plate of the leaden coffin with Mr. Thornton's name upon it in Roache's chest, the lead which Gould said was sold at Parker's, was found afterwards under the counter in Parker's shop, it weighed fifty-two pounds weight, there is the folder now upon those two pieces which were sold to Parker; it is a sort of lead worked in a fashion peculiar to coffins; people in the trade know very well that it is coffin lead.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 7th of March the evidence came into my shop with some lead to sell; I did not know it was stole: I weighed it and was paying them for it, and Mr. Augurs's apprentice came in and gave me charge of them; when I came to his master's he gave charge of me with them. I told immediately where the two pieces were that I had bought, and they went and found them.</p>

               <p>[Each of the prisoners called several witnesses who gave them a good character.]</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, before I enter upon my trial, I shall beg leave to inform your Lordship that several articles, my property, are now in the hands of the constable. At my examination before the magistrate, who is I see sitting upon the bench, when I requested they might be restored, he assured me that after they had been advertised a few days I should certainly have them. They have been repeatedly advertised for these six weeks past, and they are now detained. Your Lordship will, I hope, previous to my trial, order them to be returned; they are my own property, and they cannot be produced as evidence against me.</p>

               <p>Court. If you are entitled to them, you will have them again. We must wait the event of this prosecution.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. No man, however innocent, can answer for the event of a trial.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. With your Lordship's permission, and with all the respect and reverence due to a Court distinguished for its justice and humanity, I will humbly beg leave to offer a few words which I trust will deserve the attention of my jury. I believe it will be almost unnecessary to mention, what the news-papers themselves sufficiently witness, that every possible endeavour has been made use of, which the channel of a news paper can afford, to represent me to the public in a most infamous point of a view. The facts have been misrepresented and exaggerated, but I trust that sensible and impartial minds, such as I hope my jury are composed of, will not be influenced by news-paper invectives. They cannot but know that it is both cruel and unjust to from an opinion of a man by the character given him by mercenary hirelings; they cannot be ignorant that news-papers in general are white and black and black and white.</p>

               <p>Court. This may be proper for you to say when called upon your defence; at present you must suffer the witnesses to go on; you will afterwards be heard as amply as you please when you come to make your defence.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I beg the witnesses may be examined separately.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to call? because if you have, they must go out of court likewise.</p>

               <p>Did any thing happen to you in that crowd? - Nothing in particular.</p>

               <p>Did you miss any thing from your person? - I missed my watch in the evening. I did not miss it before.</p>

               <p>Did you see any person near you that you had reason to suspect? - There was a strange man near me, very attentive and very civil; but that man was not Mr. Barrington; but I did not find any thing particular from him; I never saw the prisoner in my life till he was at the bar before the justice's. I did not see him at the church, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290063"/>Are you sure you had your watch when you went to church? - I had it in my pocket on Saturday night; I don't recollect any thing of seeing it on Sunday morning.</p>

               <p>So you might, or night not have it at church that day? - I cannot say; I might or I might not. I keep it usually in my pocket; I don't wear it hanging loose by my side.</p>

               <p>Did you wind it up over night? - No; I wound it up on the Friday night, but not on the Saturday night.</p>

               <p>The watch only goes twenty four hours, I suppose? - Only twenty four hours. I looked at it on the Saturday but did not wind up.</p>

               <p>Why did you not wind it up? - Because it was an hour too fast; it was to be regulated. I looked at it on Saturday night; I did not, to the best of my knowledge, see it on Sunday morning; I am not positive that I had it at church, though I believe I had. It was a metal watch, with a tortoise shell case, and it had a striped silk ribband to it, and a common seal; I believe the seal is white glass.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>I understand that you had this watch loose in your pocket with your handkerchief and other things? - I might; I cannot say what I had in my pocket.</p>

               <p>This church you went to I understand was extremely crowded? - It was.</p>

               <p>Had you occasion oftentimes when in the church in the crowd, to put your hand into your pocket to pull out your handkerchief or any thing else? - I don't recollect particulars; I know I was very much crowded.</p>

               <p>Whether in your judgement it was not very possible that in putting your hand into your pocket to pull out your handkerchief, you may not have dropped this watch? - I cannot disprove it; I don't know how I lost it.</p>

               <p>It is possible you may have lost it in that manner? - I cannot say that it is impossible; I cannot say how I lost it.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I was at St. Sepulchre's church on the 15th of March.</p>

               <p>Who preached there? - Dr. Mylne, I believe his name is. The church was very much crowded; I believe I was there about eleven o'clock, or rather before. In a quarter of an hour after I had been there, a person came up to me, and told me that Barrington was in the church; I looked about from place to place; I could not see him; presently another told me; in short, not less than four different people told me that he was in the church; in about a quarter of an hour I found him, and I followed him I believe for three quarters of an hour from one door to the other, and kept watching him; I hid my face from him when he happened to turn his head towards me, because I supposed he knew me as well as I did him. I saw him with his hand in a lady's pocket in the south aisle, but I could not see that he took any thing out.</p>

               <p>Is the lady here? - I believe not.</p>

               <p>Court. Confine your evidence to this fact. - My Lord, I had a man along with me, with the key of the watch-house, expecting that I should catch somebody, the place being crowded. He was with me all the time; he was watching the prisoner, and saw him as well as I did. In about half an hour, or near three quarters of an hour, I saw Mr. Barrington had got sight of me, he was pointing me out to another person that was along with him. I endeavoured to shun the other, that he should not see me; the prisoner took that opportunity, and got out at a different door of the church. I did not see him at that time; the man that was with me told me that the man I was watching was gone out of the church; I asked which way; he said down Snow Hill. I immediately went out, and just as I turned the corner to turn-down Snow Hill, I saw the prisoner; I pursued him, and catched him just at the end of Cock Lane. I determined to take him upon the attempt I saw him make upon the gentlewoman's pocket. I talked with that gentlewoman afterwards; she said she had not lost any thing, for she had not any thing in her pocket. When I came up to him, I took hold of the cuff of his coat sleeve, and said, Mr. Barrington, you must go along with me; he turned back and came with me to St. Sepulchre's watch-house, where I put him in, without any resistance. I don't remember that he spoke a word. I brought him up to the watch-house in company with that man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290064"/> saw him go out of the church. After I got him into the watch-house, I searched him; the first thing I saw was a gold watch, which I took out of his fob. He said it was his own, I could not contradict him. I put him up stairs, where there is a place on purpose to lock up prisoners for safety. I went back to the church, and staved about half an hour; I came back again; I left Fletcher in care of him; I was in the room when somebody either bid him pull off his hat, or they pulled it off; Fletcher immediately said, here is a watch has fallen from his head; he picked it up, and instantly gave it to me.</p>

               <p>You did not see the watch fall down? - No; I did not see it till Fletcher picked it up, and gave it into my hand.</p>

               <p>Payne. When I found that this watch had dropped from his head, I concluded he had robbed somebody; then I searched him; I made him pull off his breeches; I believe he had three pair of breeches on, and somewhere about his breeches I found a purse with thirteen guineas, and a 10 l. bank note, and several other things, which are in a paper in court.</p>

               <p>Did you ask him how he came by this watch? - I don't remember that he gave any answer at all. I think he said be should leave his defence till be came before a magistrate; I believe that was all he said.</p>

               <p>How came Mrs. Ironmonger to know any thing of it? - I carried three advertisements on the Sunday, and they were all three inserted in different papers on Monday morning, and on the Monday morning, I think it was, Mrs. Ironmonger came to my house at about eleven o'clock. I advertised the other watch and other things three times after in other papers.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>Is the story that you tell to-day the same story that you told on your examination before the magistrate? - I believe exactly; I don't know that I have missed a word.</p>

               <p>Did you tell before the magistrate what you have introduced to-day, (knowing very well that it is not evidence) about this other lady? - I don't know that I did; I don't remember that I did.</p>

               <p>[The watch was produced in court by

               <p>Had you meddled with his head? - Somebody there said, pull his hat off; whether he pulled his hat off, or somebody else, I cannot tell; but then the watch fell while I was stooping.</p>

               <p>Do you know who the man was that said that? - I believe one Bethell.</p>

               <p>Is that the watch? - I believe it is; it is very much like it. I did not take particular notice; I don't remember any particular mark.</p>

               <p>I am an undertaker. On the Sunday the Humane Society had the sermon preached at St. Sepulchre's church; the prisoner was about the church; Payne informed me that he had an information of such a person; I watched him from post to pillar; at last he went out of the church; I informed Payne of it; Payne followed him, and secured him, and took him to the watch-house; from thence he carried him into the upper room, and searched him. In about a quarter of an hour, a lady came in and said she had lost two guineas and two dollars. A gentleman desired that the prisoner might have his shoes pulled off and be searched, which 
               <persName id="t17780429-103-person841">
                  Fletcher

             the constable did; during that interval I desired him to pull off his hat while Fletcher was searching his shoes; he pulled his hat off with his left hand, and a watch dropp'd down at his left foot; I did not see it drop, but I heard it drop.</p>

               <p>You did not see any thing come from under the hat? - I cannot say I did; it fell down at his left foot; the watch fell at the same time that he pulled off his hat; the watch was in a tortoise shell case; I delivered it, I believe, to Mr. Hawes afterwards. This is the watch.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I have no occasion to mention that every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290065"/> possible art has been made use of to draw me before the public eye. The daily papers have been filled with paragraphs against me; they have loaded me with a liberality bordering on profusion, with the epithets of notorious, infamous, and abandoned; yet infamous and abandoned as they would have me appear, this is the second time of my being tried in any court, while offenders more attrocious, that have visited this and other bars often, have escaped without even these epithets so plentifully cast upon me. If hitherto I have unhappily fallen into the commission of a crime, it is not to be inferred from thence that I am now guilty, or must always be so; and I beg of you to consider, gentlemen, if I have offended the laws, I have likewise suffered the punishment they have inflicted, nor would they have been mitigated, if signs of reformation had not marked the unhappy object; good men will charitably suppose it to have been genuine; and not withstanding the present charge alledged against me, it is very possible that it might have been entirely so; some I know have put the worst construction upon it; yet surely it would be but consistent with their duty, as Christains and fellow-creatures, to have refrained from infamously prejudging a trial. I flatter myself their designs will be frustrated; nor would I think, even for a moment, that my life will be paragraphed away, or that my jury would cast me before I came into court. I have been visited since I have been in consinement by a variety of persons, some led through curiosity, others from feeling and compassion. I was informed that Payne the constable had boasted in his convivial hours that I could not fall into worse hands(alluding to himself); that he would certainly hang me, and boasting his influence with the citizens of London. You, gentlemen, are the best judges whether he has endeavoured to prejudice your minds against me. I am firmly persuaded that there is not a man among you but what will lay his hand upon his heart, and say, he is unprejudiced and uninfluenced. Gentlemen, I am convinced, from many circumstances, that this man would pursue me with the utmost rigour; however you will be guided with candor, and will determine agreeable to the language of your oath, according to the evidence before you.</p>

               <p>My profession of a surgeon occasioned me a visit on Sunday morning from a person then under my care. In the course of our conversation he informed me that several eminent performers, and particularly two ladies, famed for their musical skill, were that morning to perform at St. Sepulchre's church, for the benefit of the Humane Socie ty. As I had from my infancy a taste for musick, I went thither; I found the church so full that I could not get a seat. In leaving the church I found the article in the indictment, a metal watch; I put it in my pocket, intending to advertise it. I then left the church; I had scarce reached Snow Hill, when two men, who were behind me, and who might have seen me pick up the article, insisted upon my accompanying them to the watch-house; a search ensued; Payne took my gold watch, and left the other; he also took from me a bank note, made payable to myself. I reflected that how innocently soever I might have obtained the article in question, that yet it might cause some censure, and no man would wonder, considering the unhappy predicament I stood in, that I should conceal it as much as possible. I did not put it into my hair, as has been insinuated. While he left me there, I reflected as I have told your Lordship. Payne came up in a short space of time, and brought a person who professed losing a considerable number of articles; I was searched afresh, and then the watch and purse were taken; I was that evening committed to the Compter; the next morning I was brought before a magistrate, where a lady deposed that the watch I had found was her property; her evidence was in effect the same which she has now given; I therefore think it unnecessary to animadvert upon it, but beg to make a remark or two upon the consistency of the evidence.</p>

               <p>Payne deposes, that he found upon me the watch in question; so far he is right; but the other circumstances he has related slow from a black and cruel imagination: he thinks that the reputation of the Little English Carpenter, as he is pleased to stile himself, will not be complete, without he follows<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290066"/> it with my conviction. His frequent appearance upon these occasions will not, I hope, entitle him to any degree of credit. Lost to every just and tender feeling, destitute of any means of sensibility, and destitute of any knowledge of the nature and the consequence of an oath; he kisses the book with as much apathy and unconcern as he would do any indifferent thing whatsoever. Little credit will be paid to a man noticed as a common informer: swearing has for many years been his practice and profession; but of these matters you, gentlemen, are certainly the best judges.</p>

               <p>My Jury, I doubt not, will keep in mind that maxim of the English law, whose humanity would spare the lives of ten guilty persons, rather than run the risk that one innocent man should suffer: our laws permit a man to avail himself of a good character, but will not let him suffer by a bad one.</p>

               <p>If I have said any thing improper, my situation, I hope, will plead my excuse. I have not falsely or maliciously endeavoured to depreciate the character of any man: I have confined myself to a notorious truth. I shall desist trespassing any longer upon the patience of your Lordship and the Jury, with a sincere hope that prejudice will be entirely laid aside, and that I shall enjoy the benefit of a candid, cool, and deliberate judgement.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, permit me, before I leave this place, humbly to appeal to the feelings and humanity of your Lordship; after conviction it is not my intention to arraign the justice or impartiality of the Jury; but, my Lord, I am a young man, there was a time when I had as little reason to expect the distress and misery that I now suffer as any man's son in this place? nor need I to inform your Lordship that mercy has always been considered as the darling attribute of Heaven. I am a young man, I am by profession a surgeon, let me be permitted to enter into his majesty's service, and I will endeavour to discharge my trust with affiduity and attention: if that favour cannot be granted, let me be banished his majesty's dominions during my life.</p>



               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will second my petition, and may your children and children's children, never experience the misery I now suffer.</p>

               <p>Court. You very well know where to make your application for a mitigation of your sentence, if you think the circumstances will deserve it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I humbly request that what trifling property has been taken from me may be restored to me: I had not the opportunity of enjoying the benefit of an act by which a person is enabled to dispose of his property previous to his trial. I hope that will be no impediment to my having it.</p>
