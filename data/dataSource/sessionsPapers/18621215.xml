                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at 6, Catherine-street, Stepney—on Wednesday, 12th November, I was at the York Minster public-house, before 8 o'clock in the evening—I had some refreshment there—after leaving there I proceeded on my way home, through Philpot-street—when I got a little way up Philpot-street I received a blow on my hat—I was then seized round the neck by somebody; I don't know who it was—I then felt a pull at my watch-chain—I found it gone—I turned round, and saw the watch in Buckley's hands—I am sure he is the man—I saw him distinctly—they all ran away—I saw Buckley again the same night, when he was taken up to the Thames police-court—he was with Mason, in custody—I recognised him again at once, and I am sure he is the man—I received no injury to hurt me—I was alarmed, and returned to the York Minster—whilst there police-constable Venables came to me, and I went with him towards Arbour-square station, when we met the two witnesses, Wilks and Stout—from what they said, I went back to the York Minster, and there I saw Mason playing at billiards or bagatelle, and gave him in charge—I went next morning to the York Minster with Legg, and saw a woman—in conse<lb/>quence of what she said, I went to the Bedford Arms—she said she was Buckley's wife—I was there introduced to some stranger, and afterwards went to 46, Baker-street, Stepney—that was Percival's house, so I was told—he said himself it was his house—at the Bedford Arms he said, "Come to my house and wait till the man Walter comes back with the watch"—I waited in the house about an hour and a half—the watch was then brought back by a man they called "Walter"—it was shown to me, and a woman, a stranger to me, who was down iu the kitchen, asked me to give them a sovereign for it, which I would not do—I did not get it—it was taken away again—they did not give it into my hand at all—I am sure it was my watch—I then left the house, and went to the Thames police-court.</p>

Q.</hi> Was the prisoner examined before the Magistrate the day he was taken in custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The next day—I was examined on that occasion—I gave evidence then, merely enough for a remand, and it was taken in full some days afterwards—Mr. Freund only missed eleven boxes first of all, till he took stock, and then he found it was twenty—the prisoner said his bell was rung at 6 in the morning by the persons who brought the tin—he told me it was not his pony and cart that it was brought in—he said a man called in two or three days before, and asked him to buy some tin—he did not tell me that he represented himself as a tradesman who was obliged to raise money for a special purpose, and that he wanted to sell some tin; I thought he said a traveller—he said a traveller called to see him res<lb/>pecting some tin, and said he would sell him some cheap—he did not tell me that the man said he was in want of money, and had to make up an amount; I don't remember his saying so; he said the man called two or three times, and on the last occasion arranged that he would bring it to him on the Tuesday, in the morning—he told me on the following day that he was surprised when he heard his bell rung at that hour in the morning, and the tin being brought at that hour—he also said he was going to pay for it that evening—he never said anything about the invoice—he said the men were to come in the evening, and he was to pay for it—he gave me a des<lb/>cription of some person who he said was the man with whom he had been dealing—he has been on bail ever since—he came to the station with his solicitor, and told the inspector he was willing to go with us anywhere—that was after he was out on bail—to the best of my recollection what he said about not knowing it was stolen property, was this, "If I had known it was stolen property, Mr. Deeble, I would not have allowed it to be in my house"—I have since been told that it was not the prisoner's horse and cart that conveyed the tin—I have seen his horse and cart, and the witnesses have all seen it, some say it was his cart, and some say it was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—on the morning of the 18th, about five minutes before 6, I saw a pony and cart standing against Mr. Freund's gate; there was one man in the cart and one against the gate, I did not see what they were doing—they went direct down Fuller-street—I have since been shown a pony and cart by Deeble—that was not the description of pony and cart that I saw at Mr. Freund's—the cart I saw there had got no wings to it, and the one Deeble showed me had wings—I don't know whether they were moveable wings, that was the only difference I saw.</p>

I am a plasterer, and live at 36, Hare-street, Bethnal-green—on the morning of the 18th, I saw a pony and cart opposite Quail's shop; I can't say who was with it—there was one party with a hat on rubbing his hands, and another one carrying a box on his back, like that produced, and another man was in the cart—there were three altogether—they were carry<lb/>ing the box across the pavement into Quail's shop—I have since been shown two ponies and carte, but I could not swear to the pony and cart, it being dark, and I being in a hurry.</p>

On 18th November I was sent for to the prisoner's house—I went into a room at the rear of the shop, and saw the prisoner and Deeble there, and thirteen or fourteen boxes of tin-plate—knowing that twenty boxes had been stolen, I said, "There are not twenty boxes here, we must find the rest"—the prisoner said that he would show me where they were—I went with him into the shop, and he pointed to some plates on the floor, out of the boxes, and said, "There they are, sir"—there were other sheets of tin-plate standing by the side, and I said, "Here is more"—he said, "That is no portion, sir, that is my own," and that was not identified—seventeen boxes and a half have been found out of the twenty; that is two and a half short—I counted the loose plates, and I be<lb/>lieve there were 843 sheets—he did not tell me at all where he got it from—I asked him if he had an invoice, or any entry in his book—he said, "No"—I showed him an entry in his book as late back as 16th October—there was no entry later than that date.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor in this case, and a merchant carrying on business at Great Tower-street—I was formerly at 14, Little Tower-street—I have known the prisoner for about three or four months; I think I saw him first in August or September last—he called several times at my office; the first time he requested me to give him a commission for the sale of tea in the west of England—I told him I was not then wishing to extend my business—he either at that time, or on one or two subsequent occasions, mentioned the names of several London grocers and tea-dealers, and asked if I did business with them—with some I said I did,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150024"/>
               <p>with others not—he said they were friends of his, and if he should get orders from them, would I pay him for them—I said I had no objection provided I approved the names—he mentioned the names of several he said were friends of his; he said that he had got some Chancery business, and that his wife was near her confinement, so that he did not care much about going out into the country; he was not entirely dependent on it, but if he made a little money it would help him on—I said, "If you get orders from names that I approve, those that you mention particularly I shall be most happy to execute them, and will pay you for your trouble"—he called several times between that and entering the order on which I am prose<lb/>cuting—he called on the 23rd October, and entered an order for two half-chests of tea, to be sent to Grainger Brothers, in the Walworth-road—he made an entry in a book; that book was produced before the Magistrate, but it has since been burnt in the fire which took place at my premises in Little Tower-street—he did not make an entry in my order book; every one had a book specially for himself—a book was given to the prisoner which belonged to a traveller who had left us; it was a book that was kept at our office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the cloth department at Messrs. Pawson's—we have missed property from the stock in that department—these trousers are of the description we missed—I know them by the make—they were part of our stock—they have never been sold—the prisoner has been in Messrs. Pawgon's service—he was there about twelve months, this last time—he was a traveller about town, calling on shippers and merchants—he had an occasional account with our firm—when he wanted to purchase things he might do so for ready money—I can state positively that the trousers were not sold to him at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Mr. Pawson or either of the partners here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I have had the management of this case—I am not a member of the Society for the Prevention of Shoplifters—the case is prosecuted by a society—I am only toting as a witness—I don't know who the attorney is—I have not seen him about it—I gave him no authority to act for me—these would be sailor's trousers if a sailor had them—they are made for a sailor—I can't say how long the prisoner had been in Mr. Person's service—he was in the service some time ago—he was town traveller—he took out samples of things, similar to these which I have here, to get orders.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner take out samples similar to those you have there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was allowed to go and offer them to merchants, and return them the same day—be was allowed to take out two or three things, and leave them if necessary at the buyers; supposing he had taken out some shirts and had not returned them that day, I should have inquired where he had left them; if he said, "I have left them with a merchant; "I should let it off for a day or two, and then inquire again—in his former employment he did not fail to return anything that I am aware of—he had no account with the house that I am aware of—supposing he had taken out a coat and not returned it, and said that he had put it ou because it was a wet day, and he would keep it, in that case he would have to get a ticket signed by one of the partners, and make a ready money account of it.</p>

I am a detective police-sergeant—on 26th November, I saw the prisoner—1 told her I was a police-officer, and was going to ask her some questions about the cheque, but she need not answer unless she liked, as it might be given in evidence against her—I then asked her where she got the cheque from—she said that a woman gave it to her in Dorset-place, Pall-mall, to get it cashed, on Friday, and she had taken it to Mr. Johnson, who could not do it, and she took it to Mr. Stevenson, who cashed it for her—I asked her what she had done with the money—she said that she gave it to the woman, who was tall, and dressed in black, and who gave her sixpence for her trouble.</p>

I am a jeweller's assistant, and live at 17, Holles-street, Haverstock-hill—on the night of 12th November I was returning home, a little after 11—I had to go through Maitland-park—as I was going, the prisoner spoke to me, and asked if I would please to relieve a poor distressed fellow—I told him I had no money to give him—at the same moment he clasped me by the neck with both hands—I also received a blow from behind at the back of my neck, and my arms ware pinioned from behind—the man behind placed both his hands over my arms, and in my pockets, and took out a purse, containing two sovereigns and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a pair of coral earrings, and some coral ornament—the prisoner caught hold of my chain with one hand—he still kept one hand at my throat, and with the other he clasped my watch-chain—the chain broke—there was a struggle—I saw something glisten in the prisoner's hand, but I could not say what it was—he drew it across my throat—it cut my collar through, and just grazed my neck—it did not out me seriously; it bled a little—I called out, "Police! police! murder!"—I called loudly—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the collar I had on—it is cut through—it was under my neckcloth—I struggled before I could get released from them, and called out, and they both ran away—the prisoner kept in front of me all the time—this happened close under a lamp-post—he kept one hand hold of my throat all the time this was going on—when I began to struggle he released one hand—I had an opportunity of seeing his face the whole of the time—I gave information of this to the police the same night—the prisoner appeared to have on a fustian jacket or coat, from what I could see of him, and a smock-frock underneath it—it was not a dark frock-coat; I should call it a fustian coat—I was not quite certain whether it was a fustian coat or not; it had all the appearance of one—I gave a description of the man, as soon as I was able, at the police-station—on the 25th I went to Kilburn with Mr. Thurlow, a builder, and saw the prisoner at work there, with from ten to a dozen other men—I pointed him out, and said, "That is the man that attacked me"—I have since seen my</p>

I am servant to Mr. Manning, of Maitland-park-villas—On the night of 12th November, about half-past 11 or a quarter to 12, I heard cries of "Police!" three or four times—I was in bed at the time—I got up, opened my window, and looked out—I was awoke by the cry—I saw the prosecutor going by, crying for the police—I still looked out a little while longer, and I then saw two men, one ran one way and one the other—the one I saw was just underneath the lamp-post, right opposite my bedroom window—I can see by that any one that goes past—the prisoner is in the same dress that the man had, that I saw run past the lamp-post, but I cannot swear to his face; it is only by his clothes—I did not see his face—he is about the height of the man—I had no light in my room—next morning when I got up I found this purse in the garden on the pathway.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>are the identical clothes—my window is four stories high—I was no nearer to the person than that—I had no light in my bedroom—the light showed sufficiently from the gas; my room is quite light from the gas—our's is a twelve-roomed house—the kitchen and breakfast-parlour are partly sunk below the ground—I include that in the four stories—I can't tell the height of the house—there is only one window to my room—there is a very thin curtain to it, and a Venetian blind, but I always have it drawn up to let the light in—I saw the police-inspector next day—I gave up the purse to my master as soon as I picked it up, and told him what had happened—he asked me if I should know the person, and I said I should know him by his clothes, but I could not see by his face—I did not tell my master what clothes he wore, I said he looked to me like a working man—I have always said I could not swear to his face.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 20). On 23d November, after the prisoners were apprehended, Sergeant Ryan gave me this small crow-bar (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I took it to Mr. Pitman's house, and compared it with some marks on the window-cill as of a crow-bar forcing up the window—it fitted the marks,</p>

               <p>and I found a groove in the paint corresponding with this notch in the crow-bar—there was only one mark on the window, but several on the shutters—this crow-bar exactly fitted them—the shutters had been broken off, but when I saw them they had been put up again—the notches in the crow-bar exactly corresponded with some notches in the paint—the window was outside the shutters, and had been, I imagine, forced up by the crow-bar—I found no marks inside the house.</p>

I live at 5, Little Chapel-street, Westminster—on the 19th November, 1861, I was in Mr. Cowen's surgery, Rochester-row—Mr. Cowen, Mr. Baldock, Mr. Rikey and the defendant were present—Mr. Cowan said that he had been fleeced by various lawyers, and that he hoped Mr. Pounds was a regular certificated attorney—Mr. Pounds replied that he was of forty years' standing or practice—Mr. Rikey said, "Yes; and his opinion is looked up to with deference by various members of the Bar, and his name in the profession is termed the walking book of statutes—I saw Mr. Cowen take a receipt which was written by Mr. Pounds—Mr. Cowen then went into the back surgery and brought out some money, which he gave to Mr. Pounds—I do not know the amount—I did not see the receipt that evening—that was all that passed to my recollection.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to be there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was attending Mr. Cowen as a patient—I was suffering from rheumatic gout—I was there simply as a patient on that occasion—I have been there in another capacity—I am very often there; not every day—I am a near neighbour and an invalid, and I go in there occasionally—I do not assist him in his business, I am no doctor—I write letters for him occasionally—he occasionally has a quantity of placards in front of his shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And has had for the last ten years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has not for the last three months, not during these proceedings, but up to that time he had—they are announcements of his opinions—I am not a judge of whether he has announced his opinions of the Queen and Prince Albert and the rest of the Royal Family pretty strongly—I write the papers for him, decidedly—I ought not to answer whether they reflect upon Prince Albert—he lives at the corner of Rochester-row, very near the Grey-coat School.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Large placards and pretty little pictures? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not particularly large—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph of one—it is a reflection on the Medical Bill—I cannot say whether there is something about procuring abortion for Lord John Russell—it is a photograph of one of my drawings—I have been acquainted with Mr. Cowen fourteen years—I have not been drawing these things all that time—it may be eight years since I tried my hand at it, but very few things have been done during those eight years—Mr. Cowen was not prosecuted by Government for the pictures or for the writing, but for giving away 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of food on the fast day—the indictment was for breaking the peace on the fast day—he had fifteen months—I do not know how long ago that was; he was in prison for twelve months, but I do not recollect the date—he pleaded guilty to exhibiting this paper, under Mr. Serjeant Parry's advice, but the merits of the thing were not gone into—I decline to answer whether I drew up the paper which he pleaded guilty to exhibiting—it will not incriminate me—I do not know the paper he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150049"/>
               <p>indicted for, but I object to answer the question—I remained at Mr. Cowen's after Mr. Rikey and Mr. Pounds left—they were there when I arrived, and they remained about three-quarters of an hour, because we went over the way and had a little refreshment—I have seen Mr. Morriss, the attorney, there, but never before this transaction—I think the first time he came was after last Christmas—I am speaking of the 19th November; I think he came shortly after that, but I will not be certain, because Mr. Cowen, after finding that a person named Morriss was entered on the brief, got me to write to every person named Morriss in the Directory of 1859, and Mr. Morriss of Beaufort-buildings, was not in the Directory, and had no letter sent to him—I received a letter from Serjeant Pigott's clerk, in consequence of which I found out Mr. Morriss, and he has since that been there frequently—he is, I believe, the attorney for the prosecution—I do not know it—I appear on recognizances from the police-court—Mr. Cowen came for me to go there—Morriss was there—I went to the Sheriffs' Court—I do not think Pound or Rikey were there—I went there as a witness for Mr. Cowen against Mr. Pound—I was not aware that Serjeant Pigott's name was on any trial of that sort—I was not aware that Serjeant Pigott was a defendant, but I am now, because Serjeant Pigott sent a distress into Mr. Cowan's house for costs—Mr. Morriss was present, but I do not know whether he was the attorney—I went to Lambeth Police-court—Mr. Morriss was not the attorney there—no one was attorney—an application was made there for a summons against Mr. Pounds, and it was granted—a second application was made there, and Mr. Elliott dismissed it, and Mr. Pound was taken in custody—these envelopes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And you say you did not know that Serjeant Pigott was a defendant; did not you send these through the Post-office with this inscription upon them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was after the trial at the Sheriffs' Court, and after the distress was put in (<hi rend="italic">One of these was addressed, Mr. Serjeant Piggott, M.P. and superscribed "Cowen v. Serjeant Piggott and other</hi>")—I did that under Mr. Cowen's instructions, for the letters to be more readily taken up and looked at—I do not mean to deny that it was for the purpose of calling public attention to the fact that there was an action against Serjeant Pigott—a report of the proceedings has been stuck up in the garden in front of the house—there is also, I believe, a placard about Commissioner Kerr, who tried the case at the Sheriffs' Court—I do not know whether it spells his name rather differently—I did not assist Mr. Cowen in bringing an action against the Judge of the Westminster Court—I had no means of assisting him—I was not a witness, I was present—I wrote no part of the proceedings for him—I very likely stuck up the Judge of the Westminster County Court in the garden—I do not know Mr. Ribton, or whether he was instructed to prosecute at the police court—I have not stuck up Mr. Ribton and Mr. Daley, who is now my counsel, in the garden, nor have I seen them up there, but there are a great many gentlemen of the bar up, and one may be mistaken for another—they are caricatures—perhaps my Lord and you will go up in the garden afterwards—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, of 3, Great C—street, Westminster—in 1859 I became acquainted with Rikey in prison, and when he came out of prison he called on me; that was about December, 1861, as near as I can recollect—that was a week or ten days, I think, before I paid Mr. Pounds—he was very kind to me when I lost the use of my arms in prison, and I told him if he came to me when he came out I would put him right—he found out that I had something to do with Government, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150050"/>
               <p>said, "I can recommend you to a first-rate lawyer, a walking statute "—it is no laughing matter, for I have been fleeced out of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it—he after<lb/>wards came, accompanied by Pounds, and I said, "Is this the man you recommend to me? is he a certificated lawyer?"—the prisoner said, "Forty years standing"—and the other said, "A walking statute, and a good many counsellors in the Court take his opinion"—I said, "Who is your counsel?"—he said, "Serjeant Pigott"—I said, "I have two objections to him, one is, that he is a Government man, and this is a Government prosecution; and the next is, he is too high for my pocket"—he said, "I will take that in hand; it was me that got him in for Reading, and got him his silk gown at <hi rend="italic">Cadgers Hall"</hi>—he said he should require 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

John Rikey.")—I afterwards paid him various other sums, about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—no proceedings at law were taken to my knowledge, but they said that Serjeant Pigott moved something—I never got a mandamus or anything for the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it cost me—I make it 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I have had every obstacle that could possibly be made to prevent justice being done to me—I paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for fees in the Sheriffs' Court, and then they told me that I was in the wrong shop, and I do blame Government for not taking it up, for they have sold the bed from under me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In the Sheriffs' Court you did not claim 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; because they told me I could only claim 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but they took 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of me—I was forced to make up a bill in some way or other—I claimed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. including loss of time and drink—I could not go further—the goods supplied to Pounds and Rikey were drugs, and scents, and soaps; it came expensive, I can tell you; but I do not blame this man, I blame Serjeant Pigott for it all—I should not have given this man 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I could have put in more than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the Sheriffs' Court, but I had a parcel of swindlers to deal with: you have got a man before you now who has done the greatest service to his country—I cannot recollect how much I claimed in the Sheriffs' Court as cash paid—a great deal of that 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for loss of time, and goods supplied, and drink—there was another bill at Westminster, besides the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the summons, and there was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides—there were two summonses, one for false pretences, and one for conspiracy—the Judge told me that I could not make any more claim, because I had got no more receipts; but you have got a claim for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—they said that I could not charge 12 guineas, because it was not receipted—I made a charge of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the police court; but they told me that as I had no receipt but for 5 guineas, I could not claim any more—there was then a second summons; that police court cost me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get that man there—I do not include that in the 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a summons at the Lambeth Police-court, and what was the result? when I went in they all fell laughing at me—I have a good many of you lawyers in my little garden: it pleases me, and I do like to please people—I got into prison for it nine times, not for these little placards; that was for looking to the rights of the people—they never could give me a trial, it has cost me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get this trial—Serjeant Pigott charged me 45 guineas, and then wanted me to plead guilty—I took Mr. Ribton to the Police-court; he deserves it: Mr. Daley knows all the case; I paid 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Daley got well up in the case; and then I understand Mr. Ribton said, that if he took</p>

               <p>it he would never give him another brief, and that cost me another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and here is the receipt—I did not go to Mr. Ribton and Mr. Daley, and threaten to indict them, but I do say that Mr. Ribton is no gentleman—I had to pawn everything to pay him—he said that if he took my case up on account of Serjeant Pigott, he would never give him another brief—this is what Smith tells me—I told the Judge, who tried the case at the Sheriff's Court, that it was the greatest rascality that ever was—Sir George Grey is an old woman—the Government is not worth that (<hi rend="italic">Snapping his fingers</hi>)—I told them I had to pawn and pledge everything, to my very bed I laid on, and they would not assist me—I was going to indict Sir George Grey, and he deserves it; I do my duty, and he ought to do his—I work fourteen hours a day, and I thrive on it—I am not very bad—I lost my pension at Chelsea Hospital, but it never did me any good; I gave it away, and more that, I gave 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. away on the fast-day, and they locked me up for fifteen months—Serjeant Pigott got his 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for telling me to plead guilty—I went down to the Bail Court, and directly Serjeant Pigott saw me, he packed up his papers and went to another Court—I did not go to the Bail Court to see the brief given to Serjeant Pigott; I saw him in his chambers with this man, who calls himself a lawyer (there are eight warrants out Against him now), but I never saw the brief—I had a conversation with Serjeant Pigott about moving for a mandamus, and he said that he would do his best for me—he told me that it would be discharged with costs if he did move, but that was not his busi<lb/>ness—there is a man behind you who says he will produce Rikey, but it is a mob of swindlers throughout—I have heard that Serjeant Pigott did move; I do not know it—I had such a handful of swindlers I did all I could to get out of their hands, but they threatened me with eight yards of letters, and I thought it was time to give it up—they wanted 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give up the papers—if I was a bad man, Palmerston would not have written me these letters, but I told him, though he was a Lord, he was a long way from heaven, (<hi rend="italic">Exhibiting several yards of letters pasted together</hi>)—I put all the letters into this bill, and sent it to Lord Palmerston, saying, "Now, my earthly lord, put that into your pipe and smoke it"—that was after my spending 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in trying to put an end to the war—I did not indict Lord Palmerston; who could touch him?—I issued the affidavits, and paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for eight of them, and they were no use at all—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them; this is my signature—Mr. Morris's name was torn off this brief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the police-court, and a man has signed his name here whom I never saw in my life—I cannot read, but I can spell pretty well—I do not think I had a second lawyer—I had great expense to find him out—he is not my attorney now; he cannot be, because he is a witness, and I have had to pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for another man—he is a man in Rochester-row, Mr. Smyth—Mr. Morriss was the attorney at the Sheriff's Court, where the Judge behaved so had to me, and also at the Lambeth Police-court—Mr. Smyth advised me to take out pro<lb/>ceedings for the conspiracy, and Morriss took out the other—Morriss instructed Mr. Ribton and Mr. Daley; Mr. Ribton got well into the case, and if he had been allowed to go on, it would have been better for my pocket.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that this man never acted as your clerk, here is, "Johnson <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Burridge, notice has been delivered; I shall be at the Queen's Bench at 11 o'clock; do not fail to be there at that hour;" and again, "Self at suit of Edwards.

               <p>

F. Morriss on it, at Westminster—I repudiated it—Hyatt was acting for the defendant; I was not—Hyatt was not a certifi<lb/>cated attorney for that year—he did not use my name—he deceived me—he took money of me as a certificated attorney, and I found that he was not certificated—I was not the attorney on the record: Hyatt was—a good many have their names on records who are not certificated—I do not know why it was delivered in the name of Morriss—I walked into Guildhall on the trial—I suppose it was quite accidental, I am down there every day—I did not wait during the whole of the trial, but I was in and out all day long for about two hours—I have explained to you that I met Pounds in Chancery-lane—he talked about various matters, and was kind enough to say that he would look through the papers; if I say to you, "If you will kindly look at these," you would do it—if I met Pound in Fleet-street and he wanted a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave it to him—I am a certificated attorney, and he is a better lawyer than me—I remember Walter Pratt Nine, who was convicted here, and had six months—I got into the box and repudiated him at my clerk—he was my paid clerk, but he left my office in June, and in July he received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at one place, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at another; and in August, September, November, and December the same, and I said to the parties, "If you do not pay me, I shall have to put you in court,"—I repudiated him because he was not my clerk then—he was an attorney who had not money to pay for his certificate.</p>

I live at 27, Upper Chapman-street, St. George's—the prisoner came to lodge at my house about 8th August last—she had a child with her—it was called Margaret Jackson—it was very nearly twelve months old when it came to my place—it was her only child—her husband did not come with her—no one came with her—the child was at the breast—the prisoner had one back room, for which she paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she told me her husband was a sailor, employed in the <hi rend="italic">David Milton,</hi> and she was receiving 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a month—besides that she used to work with Mrs. Johnson, who lived in the front room—when the child first came it was a nice healthy looking baby—the prisoner behaved very kindly to it for the first month—she was very much given to drink—about November last she used to go out and leave it for hours together, and the baby was always crying—I have known her to leave it for four or five hours at a time—I can't say how often I have known that, but I have known her to leave it a great many times—three times I have noticed that the door was locked, and the baby in the room—on some occasions I have found the door open—I have gone into the room, and seen the child there—I found it very dirty—it wanted food, and I often took it up food such as I have had for my own children; I am only a poor person, and cannot afford to give them very good food; a little bread and butter and broth, and things like that—every Sunday that it was in my place, except the last four Sundays, I took it food—when the prisoner was sober she used to keep the baby very clean, but when she was tipsy she used to keep it very dirty—when I have gone into the room, and found the child as I have mentioned, it was dressed, except the last day, then it was quite naked, on the bed—that was on the Saturday, as she went to the workhouse in the evening—I had spoken to her about the baby twice during the last two months that she was in the place—I told her she ought to stop at home and mind the baby, and not go out drinking so much; I thought it would become her much more—she told me to mind my own business—on the Thursday before she went to the workhouse she fetched the doctor to the child; because I told her so many times if she did not have some advice for the baby I was sure the child would not live—its ears were sore at that time, but the first of its ears being sore was, I think, from its not being properly cleansed—she went to the workhouse on Saturday night about 8 o'clock, and took the child with her—I got the order for her ad<lb/>mission—she was not than sober.</p>

I am waiter at the Somerset-hotel, in the Strand—on Thursday evening, 20th November, the deceased, Edward Lee, and the prisoner after ordering dinner, came there to dine—no liquor was supplied to them during dinner—at the end of the dinner, after partaking of cheese, the prisoner and Mr. Lee began to play with the cheese knives—Mr. Lee began by tapping his plate with the point of the knife he had been using for his cheese—the prisoner cautioned him not to play with knives, it being dangerous—upon that a conversation ensued respecting the difference be<lb/>tween <hi rend="italic">carte</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tierce</hi>—the prisoner endeavoured to show Mr. Lee the difference with the cheese knife; he could not explain it satisfactorily to Mr. Lee, so they rose and stood in the middle of the room, each with a knife in his hand—Mr. Lee held his knife with the blade pointing towards the prisoner's shoulder, and the prisoner held his knife underneath towards the belly of Mr. Lee—they both stepped forward together and made a blow simultaneously, Mr. Lee over the prisoner's shoulder, and the prisoner at the belly of Mr. Lee—Mr. Lee was much taller than the prisoner; he stood over six foot—Mr. Lee immediately put his hand to his side, and sat down—I asked him if he was hurt—he said no—the prisoner then said, "My God, I am sure I have cut you"—Mr. Lee said, "I will show you"—he unbuttoned his trousers, and I saw a wound a little above the groin, on the right side—the blood was flowing, but not very freely—I took him into a private room, and went for a surgeon—Mr. Dunn came and saw the wound, and advised that he should be taken to a bedroom—that was done, and he remained there until the 30th, when he died—both the prisoner and the deceased had been drinking prior to coming to the hotel—they were drunk—this occurred between half-past 7 and 8 o'clock.</p>

He said, "You b—, I have got you here, and I mean to pay you;" and he stood up to fight me. I laughed at him, and went into the back yard. My father came with a poker, and my brother with a dagger-knife eight inches long, and said, "If you attempt to touch my father I will run it into you." I went to a man who keeps a butter shop and said, "What am I to do?" He said, "It is a family affair; I will have nothing to do with it" I went in, and was struck a blow with the poker, and then I struck him with my fist in my own defence, not with a stick; and my brother made a hit at me, but instead of hitting me, as we were struggling, he hit my father. Two men saw the blow struck, and I asked them to come as witnesses; they said "No," but the policeman saw me talking to them. This is not the second or third time my father has ill-used me. One morning, when I lived at Ely-place, because I was a little late he struck me with a ginger-beer bottle, and I laid in a pool of blood. I am driven into the streets by him and my sister.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Adams, of 87, Oxford-street—on Tuesday night, 18th November, about half-past 10 o'clock, I made the premises fast—the glass-case was safe at that time—when I went down in the morning at a few minutes past 8, the shop-door was standing wide open, and the glass case was open, and the things strewn about the floor—there was a quantity of straw and a knife, the door was unbolted; it was bolted when I went to bed—a quantity of plated goods were taken from the premises.</p>

Between 10 and 11 o'clock on the night of 18th November I was passing Queen-street, and saw the five prisoners come out of No. 9, the prisoner Donovan occupies No. 9—I saw Burnes carrying a wicker basket, which appeared to be very heavy, and there was something shining at the top of it like silver, and Osborn and Robson were carrying another basket—I saw them turn round, they caught tight of me, and then went into No. 10, which is also occupied by Donovan—I afterwards went to No. 10 with Sergeants Holmes and Cole, and in a cellar of that house we found two baskets full of plated articles; the baskets were of exactly the same description as those I had seen them carrying before; they were both quite full, piled up—the articles have been identified by the prosecutor—we then went to No. 9, and in the front parlour found Burnes and Donovan—I told Burnes I should take him into custody for stealing a quantity of plated goods; he said, "All right;" we then took him to the station—the houses are lodging-houses.</p>

Now, if I do not receive part of the money tonight, I will pay you a visit when you least expect it; so you had better send it to-night to me, at a place I shall name, or I will make you keep your bed for a few days. You only pretend religion to suit your own avaricious nature, and I consider that you are nothing better than a swindler. You do not like to let me have the money, and you never intend to pay Hester—the same as you have swindled others. I am quite aware what you think of me, but I do not care one pin for that. I can't fall lower than I am at present; so if you know when you are safe, you had better send the money, or you will not do much work next week, and I will take care you do not derive much profit from your shop. P.S. You had better send the money to me, at No. 4, King's Head-court, Shoreditch, to-night, between 8 and half-past, as I shall be waiting for it, and I am resolved to have it.

                  </hi>. I am at present residing at Greenwich—I was chief mate of the <hi rend="italic">James Dixon</hi> screw collier, trading between Newcastle and London; Mitchell was second mate, and Hewitt was cook and seaman—on Monday night, 24th November, I was spending some little time at the Robert Stephenson beer-shop—I left there about 11 or after, with Brown—we went past the Dock-house tavern—we walked past three men first, they were coming past, and when we had gone by them about eight or ten yards we heard a disturbance—we turned back and saw Mitchell in the road in a fighting attitude; he had his coat off, and had on a red flannel shirt—he was fighting with some man in the road—I saw Melton at that time stand<lb/>ing on the pathway by himself, not far from a lamp-post—Mitchell ran up to him, and delivered him a blow with his left fist in the face—could not tell whether it was light or a heavy blow; it knocked him down to the</p>

               <p>ground—he fell on his back, on the back of his head; he went right back—there were gravelly stones there—the ground was pretty hard, as far as I can remember—after Mitchell had knocked him down, he rose his left leg in the attitude of kicking, and I called to him, "My God, George, what has that poor man done to you?" and he then put his foot down to the ground—he said, "You are one of the b—s"—I then went to my ship—he did not strike him again while I was present—I saw Hewitt there—he was not far from Mitchell when they began their row—I did not see him after that—I did not hear him say a word.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Dock-house Tavern, in Victoria Dock-road—on Monday night, 24th November, I saw Melton, Dyson, and Low there—they went out about half-past 11—from three to four minutes afterwards, at most, my attention was attracted by a noise—I did not take any notice of it for two or three minutes, but hearing it continue, I went upstairs and looked out of the window—just as I got to the window I saw Mitchell make a rush at Melton and knock him down, and he threw him round the corner—my house being a corner house, he was then out of my sight; but I distinctly heard two or three heavy blows follow—as soon as he had knocked Melton down, he ran to Dyson and deliberately knocked him down with his left hand—he was on the opposite side of the way—he then rushed back to where Melton was lying, and I heard a heavy groan—Dyson got up as soon as Mitchell had left him, and got across the Eastern Counties Railway—Mitchell rushed after him, and said, "I have settled one b—, and now I will settle you"—I then went downstairs and found the deceased lying with his feet towards my door.</p>

I am a police-constable on the Great Eastern Railway, stationed at Lower Wharf, Blackwall—on the night of 24th November, I was on duty there in plain clothes—about half-past 11, or a quarter to 12, I heard a disturbance about 150 yards from where I was, towards the Dock-house Tavern—there was a cry of "Police" and "Murder"—I ran in that direction, and saw Melton lying on the foot pavement, between the door of the tavern and the lamp-post—I saw Mitchell with his coat off; he was in the act of kicking Melton in the head when I got up—I did not notice whether he had boots or shoes on—I heard the sound of the kicking—I saw him deliberately kick him twice—I then saw Mitchell knock Low down, and he got up and ran away—Mitchell then struck at Dyson with his fist; Dyson ran and got over a fence—Mitchell was following him, and he slipped down in a ditch—he got up, and I followed him up the road, and detained him till a policeman came up—when I came up and saw Melton on the ground, and Mitchell kicking him, I saw Hewitt there; he was in the middle of the road, and he said, "Go it, George, let the b—have it"—at the time he said that, Mitchell was kicking Melton in the head—Hewitt was</p>

               <p>about six or seven yards from Mitchell when he used those words; I could not say exactly the distance—Hewitt was very drunk, quite drunk—he was not staggering; he was able to walk—Mitchell was a little the worse for liquor, but not so bad as Hewitt—when I came back Melton was in the Dock-house; he was not sensible—I saw him again on Tuesday morning at half-past 8; he died at twenty minutes to 11 next day.</p>

               <p>bruises along the course of the fracture—the scar of the fracture had a star-like appearance, as if a more violent blow had been struck on that part than the other—I have no doubt that his death was caused by violence of some kind—the injuries could be caused by kicks as well as a fall.</p>

Two of the crew of the vessel pointed out the bunks where the prisoners slept to me, and their chests—these two knives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were sticking in the ceiling, and I found this pair of trousers which had been washed; they had been wet, and were rolled up and put under one of the bunks—there were no marks on the knives.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—on 18th November, Erichson and Lawson were admitted there—Erichson had two wounds, one on the right collar bone, and one under the left collar bone towards the front, and a stab over the right shoulder—they could have been inflicted by a knife—that over the left collar bone was a severe stab; it was in a very dangerous situation, but it healed satisfactorily—Lawson had six or seven wounds; he had a long gash on the right side of his face, from the angle of his mouth into his whiskers, dividing the arteries of the face; a stab an inch below the right nipple, which was stopped by a rib, and four stabs on his back—I cannot say whether they were all inflicted by the same knife—Erickson remained till 29th November, and Lawson till 5th Decem<lb/>ber—they lost a great deal of blood—the wounds were dangerous.</p>

I live at 6, Melbourne-place, Plumstead, and am time-keeper at the Royal Arsenal—on 15th November, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was in High-street, Woolwich, and was accosted by the female prisoners—directly after they came up, the male prisoner and another one, not in custody, came up; Collins struck me in the stomach, and then again in the chest—he and the other one then laid hold of me, and the female prisoners tore open my coat, stole my watch, silver guard, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and ran away—Collins, before he left, kicked me on the knee which brought me to the ground and lamed me, and I was not able to pursue them—I could see their faces—I have known them by sight for the last three or four months, up and down the High-street—the watch has not yet been found.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 77, High street, Wool<lb/>wich, which is a lodging-house kept by Mrs. Flynn—I know her son—on Saturday night, 15th November, I was sitting in the kitchen, and he was present—the prisoner Collins and two more <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> were also there, some women, and some lodgers—they were having a game at cards—some of them began playing at 7 o'clock, or a little before—Collins was there then—he stopped in the kitchen till 9 o'clock, when he was called out—somebody came in, and said two men at the door wanted to speak to him—I am sure he was there till 9 o'clock—it was five Saturdays ago from last Saturday—I was in the house on the following Monday night when he was taken into custody, and I am quite sure that it was the previous Saturday to that that he was there playing at cards.</p>

Mrs. Flynn is my mother—I live with her and keep a lodging-house—there are two sitting rooms there—one is a common room for the lodgers to resort to—I generally stop with my mother in her room—on Saturday night, the 15th, the Saturday before Collins was taken on the Monday, I was in the kitchen at 7 o'clock—Collins was there, and a man named Donovan, and some other persons—we were playing at cards—I should think it was about half-past 7 when we began—Collins played up till 9 o'clock—I then went outside to change a sixpence, and saw two men, who asked me if Collins was in—on my return Collins went out to them—that was about 9 o'clock—I am certain it was about 9 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I occupied the front room downstairs at 12, Wood's-buildings, on 22d November last, and had done so over twenty years—the prisoner occupied the front room upstairs, immediately above mine—he had lived there between six and seven weeks with his wife and three children; Johanna, the eldest, was between eight and nine years of age—on the evening of 22d November, my attention was first attracted by singing in the prisoner's room, between 9 and 10 o'clock—I don't know how long that continued—the next thing I heard was the little girl Johanna come down stairs; she went out and returned with some beer in a can—I saw her go up<lb/>stairs again, and not many minutes afterwards I heard quarrelling—I could not distinguish the voices of the persons; I should say there were more than one—the next thing I heard was the deceased man say" Give me my change"—I know it was him by it being a much gruffer voice than those occupying the room—he made use of an oath and said, "I will punch it out of you if you do not;" the next I heard was a heavy fall and a table fall over with crockery upon it—I then left my room and went half-way up<lb/>stairs—they opened the door and I saw the little boy with a light in his hand; that was all—they then shut the door again—I then came downstairs.—I heard screaming and went half-way up again—before that I went to the door and called "Police," and the neighbours came in—I then called up the stairs to know what was the matter; the prisoner's wife opened the door and said, "For God's sake, fetch a policeman, for he is chopping his brains out"—she then came out and the prisoner came out and pushed her—I came downstairs and she followed; I don't know whether the prisoner followed—I said, "Whatever is the matter? be quiet, or I will fetch a policeman"—he said, "You may," and he went back into the room—I came down stairs and I think I went into my own room, but I have not a recollection—the next thing I heard was a dragging sound as if something was being dragged, and</p>

On 22d November, I was on duty at the station in Carter-street, Walworth-road—the prisoner was brought there about a quarter to 11—Brewer charged him with violently assaulting a man named Searle—I asked Brewer if there were any witnesses to the assault—the prisoner immediately replied, "No, there are no witnesses; I did it"—I told him to consider what he was saying, that it was a very serious charge against him—he replied, "I should not care for my own carcass, but for the sake of my poor children"—he said, "The old b—should have kept away from under my nose"—I afterwards saw the deceased at St. Thomas' Hospital, and he told me his name was Thomas Searle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas' Hospital—on 22d November, Searle was brought there—he had received several injuries about the head, and two of his ribs were broken on the left side—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186212150119"/>
               <p>there were several lacerated wounds about the right side of the head and forehead; the face itself was much swollen and contused—over the right eye there were two cuts parallel, extending about 2 1/2 inches in length, from the temple towards the nose, and there were injuries to the bones about the right eye—I should think the wound over the right eye was caused by some blunt instrument—he was under my care and that or another house<lb/>surgeon during the time he remained in the hospital—I believe he died on the Tuesday night—I subsequently examined the body; on the Tuesday week afterwards—the swelling had then very much subsided, and I was enabled to discover a fracture of the bones of the nose—the bone over the left eye was also fractured, and the seventh and eighth ribs were fractured—I have no doubt that those injuries caused his death—I believe those injuries might have been inflicted by this boot.</p>

About seven months ago; he took her away for three months, she then asked me to forgive her, and I took her back. I moved away from where I then lived, and Searle used to go to my house while I was at work. He decoyed her away two days and two nights while I was there. She came back, and I forgave her again. I took another room so that he should not know where I was, and last Saturday three weeks, I made an appointment with my wife, but when I got home she was not there. I went out and got rather intoxicated, and met her and him together. They went into a public-house, and I went in with them, and I have no recollection of what followed till I saw him at the bottom of the stairs. He had twice challenged me to fight before this.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 320 P). On Saturday afternoon, 22d November, I was in St. George's-road, near the Elephant and Castle—I was about thirty yards from the prisoner, whom I knew, and saw him looking at me, and then at a turning, as if to know whether he would go down it or not—I stopped him, and said, "Hallo! what is your game now here?"—he turned round and said, "It is very fine"—I said, "Yes, it is; have you any</p>

               <p>counterfeit money about you?"—he turned round very quick, and said, "I will d—d soon let you know;" put his hand in his right-hand trousers' pocket, and took out a little brown paper parcel, done up with worsted, which he threw over a house—I took him in custody, and handed him over to Camp—I then went to the top of the house, but could not find it—I afterwards found it at the back of a house in the garden of an adjoining house—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it contained three crowns and three half-crowns, wrapped up in separate pieces of paper—I found it where he could have thrown it, as the house laid very low—I took it to the station, and told him I had found it, and should charge him with having it in his possession—he said, "I know nothing about it."</p>

On Saturday afternoon, 22d November, I saw the prisoner talking to Ham—I was in uniform, and was twenty yards off—I saw the prisoner take something from his right-hand trousers' pocket like a brown-paper parcel, and throw it over the house—Ham took hold of his collar, and not knowing him to be a constable, I went over, but he said, "I am a constable; he has thrown some bad money over that house"—I took the prisoner to the station, and found on him a crown-piece and one shilling, both good.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I am a shoemaker—I had an appointment to meet a man named Bradbury, at the Elephant and Castle, at 2 o'clock; he gave me this parcel, and I had not walked fifty yards when the constable came up to me face to face. I had only had it three or four minutes. I did not know he was a constable, and I told him to come to the station and see. I certainly threw it over the house. I asked the policeman if he knew the man he had seen me with. He said, "No." He says now that he knows the house where he lived. He admitted to me that he had never seen me before, but took me for another man. The man has now gone away.</p>
