I am a bricklayer, living at 67, Thorpedale Road—I have known the prisoner five or six years—on 20th September, between 11 and 12 p.m., I was in Cottenham Road—I saw two men fighting, and I stood and looked on—the prisoner was looking on; to one of the men he said, "I will give him something"—I said, "There is only one man to one, let them alone, and let them fight"—he said, "What has it got to do with you?"—I said, "What has it got to do with you?"—then we said we had had little differences, and the prisoner said, "Let us fight"—we fought for about five minutes, and then policemen came, and the prisoner went away—he came back in about five minutes, and said, "Do you want to fight me?"—I thought he meant to finish it out—I went into the road and got my coat off, when he made a rush at me with this chopper—I warded off the blow with my coat, and a lot of people got in between us, and he went away—I stood talking at the corner, and twenty minutes afterwards the prisoner came before I could hardly see him coming; I just saw the chopper, and he hit me on the head with it—before he struck me he said, "That is for you, Jack Peachey"—I was taken to the doctor's, but he was not at home, and I was taken to the station—I charged him there—I was bleeding—I was sober, and I thought he was sober.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was drawn by C. Guy C.

On September 25th I was assisting my brother, and went out with a pony and cart to sell vegetables—the prisoner purchased four pounds of potatoes and some vegetables, which came to fivepence—he gave me a shilling; I gave him sevenpence change, and put the shilling in my pocket—I had no other shilling thereabout twenty minutes after, a lady purchased some potatoes, and I gave her the shilling in change—she went away, and returned with it—I tried it, and it was had—this is it—five days afterwards the prisoner came up to me in the street, purchased a pennyworth of wood, paid with a penny, and went away—I recognised him, but did not tell Mm so—he then came back and purchased another pennyworth of wood, and gave me a shilling; I put it between my teeth, found it was bad, and gave it back to him, and told him it was bad; he said he would go and get change; I followed him on my van, and when I got round a corner I saw him running—I drove down twelve streets after him—he went into a post-office and got change, and came out, and gave me the penny for the wood—I told him I should lock him up for passing bad money on September 25th he asked how much it was—I said that he gave me a shilling on the 25th he put a shilling on the van; I picked it up, and he went away—I went after him—he ran to the Sixth Avenue—I overtook him there, and he said, "There is two more shillings; I would rather give you a sovereign than you should lock me up, and disgrace my character"—Hughes then came up, and I told him what had happened,—the prisoner ran away again, and Hughes jumped up in my van and drove after him—I left my pony and followed him; he said, "Come to my house," and I went with him to 118, Kensal Road—he went in, shut the door, and left me outside—I called a constable, who refused to have anything to do with it—another constable came up, but did not take him—I went to the station, and a constable went to his house late at night and took him—I am sure he is the man that bought the turnips on. the first occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Hartington Street, Marylebone—I have known the prisoner about six years—when I first knew him I was in employment as a dressmaker; I was introduced to his relations, and knew them—on 10th December, 1887,1 had a child by him; after the birth of that child I did not see him for some few months—I took out an affiliation summons against him, and an order was made on him to pay me three shillings a week; that order was made in January—under that order he paid me the money from time to time—after that I was in the habit of seeing him from time to time, and connection took place between us—in August this year I became pregnant again—I spoke to the prisoner about it on different, occasions; the child was not living with me after the order was made; I had sent it out to be nursed—in August and September this year it was with me at 11, Hartington Street—it is a boy, and was christened Harry—at this time he was two years and seven or eight months old—when I first knew the prisoner he was employed as an assistant to a veterinary surgeon, and latterly as a clerk or agent, employed by the Prudential Assurance Company—I think I saw him on the Wednesday previous to 20th August—he visited me at Hartington Street on the 20th he then brought some stuff for me to take—he did not come on the Thursday, and I wrote to him—he brought it on the Wednesday, and took it away again, and brought it again on the Monday evening—I had written to him in the morning, to where he lived, in Filmer Road—I found him at my house when I came home, sitting in a chair by the fireplace; that was about ten minutes to ten—he had the stuff in his pocket, but I did not see it for some time afterwards—I asked him why he had not come on the Thursday; he said, "Well, I was so annoyed at your not taking it;" and he asked if I was willing to take it then—I consented to do so—about twelve o'clock he took from his pocket a bottle containing a mixture—he did not tell me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189010200016"/>
               <p>what it was; he poured some of it into a tumbler, laid it on the table, and I took it up and drank it; there were four doses he poured into the tumbler—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle, it has the doses marked in the glass—he said I was to take another four doses half an hour afterwards—I was up and dressed at this time, and he was also dressed—he was to stay the night in order to give me the other in the morning; there were eleven doses in the bottle; I was to take four doses at twelve, four about half-past, and the rest in the morning—about half-past twelve he poured the other four doses into the tumbler, and I drank it—I was with my boy in bed—after I had taken the second dose I felt awfully sleepy, nothing else—he advised me to undress and get into bed—I went to bed and went to sleep for about three hours, as well as I can remember; the boy was in bed with me, sleeping inside next the wall—when I roused up I missed the boy from my side—I heard the prisoner say to the boy, "Drink it, Harry, have something to drink," and I heard that the child was drinking—I did not see the child at the time—he put him back into the bed into the same place where he had been before, and I could smell that he had been drinking something; it smelt like the stuff I had been taking—I said to the prisoner, "Have you given Harry any of that stuff which you have given me?"—he said no, he had not—I asked him if he had taken any himself, as I could smell it so strongly; it smelt like laudanum—he said he had not given anything to the boy—I asked him why he did not come to bed—he said he had to go home; that he had important business to attend to—I said, "No, you will not go home, for I feel positive you have given something to my child"—I then got out of bed, locked the door, and took possession of the key—he then undressed and came to bed—after that the child became very restless and grating its teeth—I again accused the prisoner of having given something to the child; that I felt sure of it, as it was so restless, and I said, "If you gave the stuff tome, why did you give it to the child?" and I told him then that I had heard the child drinking—he said he had only given it some water when I went to bed first there were three doses left in the bottle—when I got out of bed I told him I would call my landlady—he begged me not to do so—when I looked round I noticed that the bottle was empty—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the three remaining doses that were in the bottle when I went to bed—he said he had emptied it into the chamber, as he thought I had had sufficient—I went and looked at the chambers, one was empty, and I had been vomiting in the other through the stuff I had taken—I did not vomit till after I had been asleep three hours; it was rousing up that made me feel so sick; I felt very bad—there was no sign of laudanum in the chambers; I said I should have to dress and go to a doctor or call the landlady's daughter; he said I had no need to call any one; if I was not able to go for a doctor he would go for one himself; I told him to go for Dr. Kerr, in Princes Road—he said, "I swear to my God that I will go and bring the doctor back with me," and he then left—I waited about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; it would not take more than about ten minutes to get to the doctor's place—finding he did not come back, I called my landlady's daughter—I left the child in her charge, while I went for a doctor—I think that was about a little after four—I first went to Dr. Harris; he said he would come round; I went back, and fetched my baby,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189010200017"/>
               <p>and dressed it, and took the child, and met Dr. Harris at the door—he gave the child an emetic, and advised me to take it to St. Mary's Hospital—I did so—I had left the bottle on the washing-stand—I went back and fetched it, and took it to the hospital; I think it had about a teaspoonful of the mixture in it then—I was frequently sick afterwards; I was vomiting at the hospital.</p>
               <p>

               <p>two grains of opium were in that bottle; it was an eight-ounce bottle, divided into sixteen equal parts—that, if distributed over the whole in proportion, would contain 120 grains—I also analysed the contents of the other bottle containing the washing of the child's stomach; I found' there about two and a half grains of opium—more than that must have been taken into the stomach; I should say at lease four or five grains; possibly between five and six—the spoonful was in an eight-ounce bottle, divided into sixteen parts; each dose would be a teaspoonful the smallest dose of opium that has ever proved fatal was the 90th part of a grain; that was in the case of an infant four weeks old; that would be exceptionally small—a child aged four and a half has been killed by two fifths of a grain, and within my own experience I have known of about forty grains of opium being taken, the patient some hours afterwards being able to speak, but eventually dying—I have known of enormous quantities taken by confirmed opium eaters—the largest dose that has come within my own knowledge from which a person has recovered has been between two and three teaspoonsful of laudanum; that would contain between eight and ten grains of opium; apart from my own experience five ounces have been taken and recovered from; that was in the case of an adult—there would be 160 grains in five ounces.</p>

Will you kindly send by my boy a pair of stays, 29 inches, a white petticoat, a wool one, large, and a good chemise—Yours faithfully, M. P. Graham—send me four things, the best, to<lb/>morrow")Richard Graham said, "Do you know me?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "We have been away from Tottenham, but have come back there to live at Tynemouth House. Tynemouth Road, Tottenham"—I gave him three petticoats, four chemises, and a pair of stays—I went the same day to Tynemouth House, but did not see Mrs. Graham there—I parted with the goods because I knew his mother as a previous customer when she lived at The Grove, Tottenham—I believed from the boy's words that she was living at Tynemouth House, which is a large double-fronted house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Ernest Wood, an engraver, and the daughter of the prisoner—when my father and mother separated in 1880 I remained for two years with my father at 70, Mina Road—my brother and sister were living there too—my mother was in service at Poplar as cook, and in 1883 I went into the same service as housemaid—I remained there till May, 1884 from 1883 till 1884 I was in the habit of seeing my father, brother and sister—in 18841 asked my father if I could leave the situation and come home, because my mother drank so, and he gave me leave, and I came home to 70, Mina Road at the beginning of May, 18841 remained there a few weeks, and then my brother, sister and myself went into apartments, and my father left the place—that was about the end of May—I don't know where he went to; we always wrote to his place of business—he used to come and see us—at first we saw him every night, and up to the present time I have seen him continually—after I left the service where my mother was cook I went to see her once—she used to come to see us at our apartments, but we never told our father she came—she never saw our father—she remained in the same situation till August, 1884 she continued to visit us until about a month before this case was brought—my father had seen me continually up to the present time—I did not know my father was married a second time until this case.</p>

The prisoner is my husband—I live at 4, St. Katherine's Road, Notting Hill—on September 21st I took out a summons against him at the Police-court; he was not aware that I had done so—before September 29th he was aware of it—early on Sunday morning, the 28th, I returned home; I could see that my husband had just woke up out of a very drunken, mad sleep; he was getting out of bed—he then shut the door and said, "I have got you"—he rushed about the room, and then rushed to the fender, where the chopper was; that was the first thing he could take up, and he hit me with it on the head—I could not say with what part of it—this is the chopper—I said to him, "Oh, Jack, what have you done?"—he said, "Oh, Alice, come to the station with me"—I ran out of the room, and ran to the station, and I believe he ran after me; he was at the station when I got there</p>

I am a clerk in the confidential inquiry branch of the Post Office—I make inquiries in cases of suspected or ascertained fraud, and especially with regard to persons employed in the Post Office—on 4th October I was communicated with about this matter—I made inquiries—on 7th October I went to the prisoner's house with Scott—I had a conservation with, the prisoner—I told him who I was, and said I had been instructed to see him concerning a number of telegrams which had been irregularly treated in course of transmission through the Central Telegraph office and that I was informed on Saturday, just about two o'clock, he handed in a telegram at the East-cheap branch office; would he furnish me with particulars of it—he said, "I have handed in no message; I did not hand in any message on Saturday—"I wrote down my questions and his answers at the time—it was not a continuous conversation, but occasionally during the day I asked some questions of him these are my notes. (<hi rend="italic">These notes were then read as follows:</hi> "I said, 'You were followed by this detective officer and another person from your own home to East-cheap on Saturday, and you were seen to hand in a telegram there, one of the persons who had followed you being inside the office with you, let me caution you that I shall take down your statement in writing. Scott interposed and said, 'And it may be used in evidence against you. He said, 'I don't think I went to East-cheap on Saturday.' I asked if he objected to be searched; he said, 'No.' He was searched by Scott, who handed me a number of papers taken from the prisoner's coat pocket; among them I found the two pieces of paper and card produced. I showed these to Ives, and said I should take possession of them. We then went to the General Post Office. After we arrived there I said to Ives, 'You see this paper found in your possession, on which is written, "Jackson, High Street, Su. "I may tell you that the telegram which you handed in on Saturday afternoon was so addressed. The text read "Faust good, am writing," but after the telegram reached the Central Telegraph office the message was delayed by some one until after the result of the October Handicap at Kempton Park was known (say about 2.10). All your original message was then erased, and a fresh message written out on the same form addressed to "Pratt, Spitalfields," and which read thus, "Five pounds each way on Ormuz; Miller. "Ormuz won the race. The message was not signalled to Norton Folgate for delivery until 2.20. Amongst other papers found upon you is this, on which appears the address, "Pratt, Spitalfields," and also the business card</p>

               <p>of Mr. A. B. Miller, tailor; what do you say to this?' He said, 'I have nothing to say only what I said before. 'I said, 'Do you know a man named Pratt, a bookmaker of Spitalfields?' He said 'No.' I said, 'Do you know this Mr. A. B. Miller, whose card was found upon you?' He said 'Yes.' I said, 'What is your connection with him?' 'None.' 'How do you come to be in possession of his card?' 'I need not answer unless I like, I suppose?' 'Certainly not. When did you last see Mr. Miller?' Yesterday.' 'What business did you have with him?' 'I didn't have any business with him.' 'What time did you see him?' 'Yesterday evening about nine. "Where?'" Mile End Road. I didn't speak to him. I saw him with a friend of his.' 'Who was the friend?' 'I don't know. I was with his friend afterwards. I spoke to him, but I don't know who he is.' 'Now, Ives, you are an old telegraphist. I put it to you whether you ever knew a telegram to be altered as this one has been by any accident or mischance, allowing for every possible error in transmission?' 'No; I have never known a message to be so altered.' 'Then what explanation do you offer?' 'I have no explanation at all. I simply say I know nothing at all about it.' Miller then identified him as one of three persons who had been in communication with him respecting the sending of telegrams to Mr. Pratt. I read over to him the statement which I had taken down in writing from Mr. Miller, and said, 'Do you dispute that?' He said, 'No; not so far as that goes. I don't dispute that.' I said, 'Who is Saunders?' He said, 'I don't know; he is an ostler, or something of the sort in the City.' I said, 'Who's Harry?' He said, 'I don't know, but if you can find him he can tell you more about how this is done than I can.' I said, 'You must know who he is?' He said, "I don't; all I know is, that I was to hand in this message, and I was to get a sovereign for doing it")that is a full substantial note of the conversation.</p>

I live at Preston, near Harrow, and am a blacklead manufacturer—I hold a lease of 78, Stamford Street, Black friars—in February, 1889, I was seeking for a tenant, there was a notice in the window, and the prisoner Day called on me and said that he wanted the house for his wife and family and himself to live in; that he had a large family grown up, who worked in the City, and it would be handy for them to come home to dinner at midday—he said he was living at 16, Trinity Square, with his family, but said nothing about his wife—I let him the house for three years; he sent me three references by this letter: J. Sharp, Bow Social and Literary Club; Mr. Stevens, 30, Furnival Street, Holborn; and C. Mortimer, 34, Blackman Street, Borough—I wrote to them and received answers, this is Mr. Stevens' answer. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had known Mr. Day some gears as a respectable man, and thought he would make a good tenant. Mr. Sharp's letter was to the same effect</hi>)I have mislaid Mr. Mortimer's letter—in consequence of those replies I executed this agreement, dated March 26th, to let the house unfurnished, at the yearly rent of £85 Stevens' letter influenced me in doing so—I did not get the first quarter's rent, though I asked for it repeatedly—Day said that his wife and family objected to come and live in the house, and he had let some of the rooms in unfurnished apartments—I got £10 from him at the beginning of October, when there were two quarters due—I called at the house every week; he was frequently there, although he did not live there—he had a lad in charge—three or four lodgers occupied the house, who had furnished their apartments—in October I received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From H. Day, stating that he would pay some day when his luck turned, and had left the key in the kitchen cupboard</hi>)I got the key from the lad shortly afterwards—Day left no address, and I did not see him again till he was arrested—more than £40 was due, and I only received £10, though he was taking money weekly from the lodgers; they showed me their receipts in his writing.</p>

I went with Inspector Marshall to the Perseverance—what he has said is correct-when Stevens was told the charge he said, "What is the fraud?"—I said that Day took houses without paying the rent, and he, Stevens, was a reference for him—he said, "What I said about Day I believe to be true. I do not know where he is living now"—Mrs. Stevens said, "Do you want Day's address?"—I said, "Yes"—she said, "My little boy has it in his pocket-book," which she handed to me—this is it: "33, South Lambeth Road'—I found this card on Stevens: "H. C. Day, Elm Tree Lodge, Vauxhall Park, S. W. "going to the station Day said, "I must confess my wife went to lodge in the house at Pimlico soon after Day took it, but she paid rent"—when the warrant was read, he said what he had said about Day he believed to be true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer—before that I was in the Metropolitan Police—I am the prisoner Stevens' eldest son, and am acquainted with his movements for the last four or five years—he went from the Mitre to the Blue Lion, Fetter Lane, and stayed there about eighteen months—I am not sure whether he went direct from the Blue Lion to the Red Lion, but he went there afterwards—that is about three years ago—when he sold the Red Lion I believe he went to Furnival Street—he was about taking the Artichoke, in Clare Market, to open it as a publichouse, but sold it at a better price, and never moved in—he communicated with Reid's, the brewers—it is not unusual to take houses which are not open; the licence would be transferred to a respectable person.</p>

I am a commission and public-house broker, of 105, Great Russell Street—I negotiated the Perseverance public-house, Stephen Street, Lisson Grove, with Mr. Capon, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Chambers—Stevens gave Mr. Capon, I think, £20 for his interest; he was merely a quarterly tenant, and he arranged with Mr. Chambers as to the arrears of rent due from Capon—the licence was £25; Mr. Stevens had to pay the whole of that, and it was paid to my knowledge, and transferred to Stevens—I have since sold it to Mr. Scott, a builder, for £25 as a going concern—Mr. Scott guaranteed an extension of lease, and they had near upon £2,000 on rebuilding, and he paid £250 to the freeholder for dilapidations, which will make the property worth about</p>

               <p>£4,000 when rebuilt—when Mr. Stevens took the house it was closed, and there was no business there; it was in consequence of his efforts that he was able to sell it at that price—it is not true that shortly previous to September this year the house was worth nothing; it was dilapidated, but not to that extent—it is a common practice to get such houses, work up a business, and sell them at a profit; shut<lb/>up houses are very much sought after for that purpose; it requires trouble and expense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It had been shut up about two months—the previous tenant was there about nine months; I cannot tell why he shut it up—Stevens went there on 3rd April, and remained till September—it was sold about 11th August to the present speculator—I never saw Stevens' books; I have been in the house and seen the trade he was doing, people drinking beer and spirits—I went there thirty or forty times, and sometimes saw nine or ten people there, and sometimes only two or three; from that I tell you that he worked up a trade, and yet the trade was not taken into consideration at all—I have known Stevens five or six years.</p>

I live at 10, Laystall Street, and work in the kitchen of the club, and wait on people—on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday I go upstairs and play the organ—I have known the prisoner for the last three months as a member of the club—he bears the reputation of being a respectable good young man, who makes no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with anybody—from twelve o'clock on this night till two I was on the stage—there were about one hundred people there; the room is nearly the same size as this Court—I saw the prosecutor when he came from downstairs; I knew he had a knife in his pocket, because I saw him make a motion to his friend—he went towards a form and got</p>

               <p>a glass, which he put in his pocket—I. got off the stage and said to him, "What are you going to do with that glass?"—he said, "Nothing; I have nothing"—when I went to him to get the glass the glass dropped on the floor, and when I put my hand behind him I found a knife and a bottle underneath his coat—I got hold of the knife, which has now disappeared; in the struggle my arm was cut—I saw the prisoner there, but he was close to the door talking to another man—he was in no way connected with this row—if he had been in this quarrel I should have seen him—I remained upstairs after the prosecutor was carried down—I did not afterwards have a drink with the prisoner—we danced no more after this—the confusion kept me there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prosecutor lying on the floor bleeding a little—I saw no one strike him with a knife—I did not see him tread on a girl's toe—I was grinding the organ—I remained in the room to. put things straight when the people ran out—I did not see anyone kick the prosecutor while he was lying on the ground—I swear the prisoner gave no blow at all—I had no time to go to the Police-court, because my master was ill.

Paget is intended to be in a different hand, but I believe it is all written by one hand—I believe these two pencil documents to have been written by the same individual—the name of Paget appears on one, and "Please deliver my letters to bearer" on the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been an expert forty-five years—I attended at the offices of the Solicitor to the Treasury, and was shown these documents and an admitted letter of Allen's, dated Great Scotland Yard; I compared them with it, and in my opinion they are two distinct writings, the Mr. Allen who wrote the two letters is not the man who wrote the letters in this case—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same letter; it is from the convict establishment—all these documents are written by one hand, but not by Allen, and I am prepared to give my reasons—I agree with Mr. Inglish that the signature to this letter is the same as the body. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing out dissimilarities to the Jury</hi>) this is not an uncommon flourish, especially when a person writes a very free hand—what I noticed most was the letter "D" after examining the documents, I had a letter from a brewer next morning, and he made a "D" exactly like it——we always find something alike in different writings, millions of people write alike—I have been a witness in a very great many celebrated cases; and in the Parnell case the moment I saw them I said they were forgeries, and I went</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are two or three resemblances in these letters, but they are not the same—the similarities are such as might be found in other people's writing—I should not say that the signatures of the payee of these post-office orders, Henry Bright and James Carter, are in a disguised hand; I think it is the natural writing of someone—the James Carter slopes the wrong way, but many people write like that—I am not prepared to say that it is not Allen's writing, but my opinion is that it is not—all the letters in Allen's writing slope—I have been an expert forty-five years, and have not made any mistakes, but the Jury sometimes thought so—the Jury did not agree with me at the beginning of this year when Miss Harrison was prosecuted for libel; I was certain she wrote the letters—Mr. Inglis was on the other side for the defence, and the Jury believed him and disagreed with me—I believe the girl perjured herself in this box—I do not know whether the Jury stopped the case; I was not present; I left as soon as I had given my evidence.

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, of Copenhagen Street, Islington—at 9.40 p.m., Saturday, September 27th, I was against my street door in the garden—I had put out a drunken lodger—a policeman had started her away, and I was talking to my wife, when the prisoner and two others came up—one of them hit me on my face, another got hold of my privates, and the prisoner took my watch and chain out of my waistcoat pocket—I held the prisoner, who had my watch and chain in his hand, for a good time—they kicked me on my legs; I have wounds there now—I don't think the prisoner kicked me; I held him too tightly, and he was too close to me—we went on the ground together; they kicked me on the ground—I got up when I could, and my wife called for assistance—we struggled about the garden; they tried to throw me down the area—a policeman came; I then, had the prisoner in my arms—my gold watch was worth £18 and the gold chain 30s., and there was a seal as well.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a merchant of Honduras—I am now residing in London—in August, 1889, while I was in Honduras, I received this circular purporting to come from Elder, Rorke, and Co.; it is in Spanish—in consequence of receiving it I wrote to Elder, Rorke, and Co.—I received a reply, dated 28th November—on 12th January I wrote again—after that I went to New York—while there I wrote this letter of 7th June—I then came to London, and arrived here on 10th July, and on the 11th I wrote to Elder, Rorke, and Co. from the Hotel des Etrangers, and on the 12th the prisoner called on me at the hotel; Mr. Vello came in to assist in the conversation—when I noticed that the prisoner could not talk Spanish, I asked Mr. Vello to translate to him—at the beginning of the conversation he asked the prisoner if he had received my letter—he said, "Yes"—I afterwards asked him if he was conversant with the terms contained in the letter—he replied yes, he well understood—after that he gave the letter to Mr. Vello to translate it—to prevent mistakes, Mr. Vello interpreted it—the prisoner said he had a clerk, but he used not to leave the office—I then asked what conditions could we come to in business together if. I would give him £800 to £1,000 the prisoner said if I would give him from £800 to £1,000 he would open a credit to an equal amount—I then asked him under what conditions—he said anything bought with that money he would not charge any commission for—he was to charge a commission of 3 per cent, on all the goods he would buy on credit—I then told him that he had come to England to transact business with some safe, respectable firms—the prisoner said that his house was a very honourable house, that he had credit in the Bank of England, also in the house of Messrs. Rylands, and other well-known houses—all this was said to me through the interpreter—I believed his statement—she said the following day was Sunday, and he would take me for a drive—the interpreter was to go with us, but he did not come—I went with the prisoner alone—in the course of the drive ho said that he had a great business, and that he had a balance account in the Bank of England for more than £5,000he said that he had credit at Rylands, and that he could ask for what he wanted, and he explained what goods he could get there—next day the prisoner came to my hotel to fetch me, and we went to the house of De Pass and Co.—I had with me a cheque for £1,200, and afterwards a draft for £100 I saw the prisoner receive at De Pass's office a cheque on an English bank for £1,200, and we went to the bank and cashed it—I endorsed the cheque, and I saw the prisoner receive bank notes for it—before the cheque was cashed I had given</p>

Wontner—I caused inquiries to be made at the Bank of England and at Messrs. Rylands—I received only £248 out of the £1,300.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in business at Honduras near ten years—I was alone in the business—I have brothers also in business there—I have been doing business in English goods during the ten years through an agent, Arthur Levy and Co.—I left them because their commission was too high—they did not refuse to continue business relations with me—I did not write to them to say I was going to leave them—when I received the printed circular I did not make inquiries at Honduras about Elder, Rorke, and Co.; I only showed it to my father-in-law—I never asked for any information—when I selected the goods at Rylands' many of them had to be manufactured, and also at Fox's—those goods were still unfinished about four weeks ago—those at Manchester were ready, they had only to bale them—the goods at Rylands' and Fox's were entered as invoiced to the prisoner—I received the bill of lading, but not the invoice—the goods I selected altogether at Rylands' and Fox's amounted to from £700 to £8001 am not sure of the day that I first asked the prisoner to return a portion of the money; it was before the 12th August—I consulted Mr. Hans, a solicitor, the same day that I did not find the prisoner—I never saw the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Hans—I saw him several times afterwards; I saw him in the street and spoke to him; he said he was going to look for a solicitor—all he said was that he would cancel the order—she told me that he would hand me the balance of the money as soon as I got Rylands' and the other firms to free him from liability—Mr. Vallance did not tell me the same; he told me that he could not safely pay over any money to me until Rylands and the others had freed him from liability—I cancelled the orders in Manchester—I showed him the order cancelled—Mr. Vallance told me that when I had cancelled the orders the prisoner would make out an account showing the balance due to me, I paying him his commission; ho told me lie had written to the prisoner to ask him for</p>

               <p>the documents and the balance of the account—Mr. Vallance said we had better have an interview, but the prisoner did not come—I went to another firm of solicitors, Messrs.

Elder, Rorke, and Co., at 31, Great St. Helens—I saw the prisoner, showed him this invoice, and asked him for a cheque for £415, the amount of the goods that had been purchased—he said, "My client is at Manchester, and as soon as he returns he will let you have a cheque"—I mentioned no less sum to him—I left the invoice with him—no money afterwards came—I called there more than once—it was a cash transaction entirely.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The terms were half cash down and half cash on delivery, or completion of the invoice—the prisoner did not tell me he had instructions from his client not to pay for our goods at present, or anything like it—I am sure he merely said he was in Manchester—the goods when invoiced would be entered in the journal under the name of the firm to whom they were invoiced, and a ledger account would be opened—the journal entry and the ledger account would be in the name of Elder, Rorke, and Co., and we looked to them, and to them only—some of the goods were ready for delivery when I took the order, out others he wanted cut and stamped—we have this parcel of goods still in hand, and they are still entered in our books to Elder, Rorke, and Co. £416 is the full amount of the order—I did not see the prosecutor at all—there is not an item of another lot of goods selected by Valenzuella in addition to the £415.</p>

I have not completed yet, but, so far, it is something under £400" he said it was a very reasonable request, and if we were to make out an approximate amount of what he had bought he would pay half down—I think I spoke to him on the 22nd, and he said we should receive half the amount on the 24th this account was taken a few days afterwards by Skee, who brought</p>

I am a foreign correspondent living at Manchester—I was present on Saturday, 12th July, at an interview between Mr. Valenzuella and the prisoner at the hotel in Gerard Street—I was asked to interpret what took place—Mr. Valenzuella asked the prisoner if he had read the letter he had written from the hotel, and he asked me to translate it again—I translated it; in it Mr. Valenzuella asked Mr. Rorke the conditions under which he did business with him, if he should deposit £1,800 with him to buy the goods and ship them——Mr. Rorke said he was agreeable to do so, and that he would charge him five per cent, on the goods bought on credit, and no commission on the goods bought for cash—MR. Valenzuella wanted to buy £1,000 in cash, and give credit for the balance—while I was translating this to him, the prisoner reduced the commission from five to three per cent., and said he would allow him six months credit on the goods bought on credit; Mr. Valenzuella was to pay three per cent, for that and nothing for the goods bought on cash—he said he was agreeable, that he wished to do business with a respectable house, and Mr. Rorke said his house was very respectable and well known; that they had credit at the Bank of England, and that they had credit also with Rylands and Sons, and other firms which were not mentioned—I interpreted that to the prosecutor—the prisoner asked him to write out a list of the goods he required, and that list was given to me to translate, and I did so—the prisoner asked the prosecutor to take a drive on the Sunday, and I was to be with them—I went to the hotel at three on the Sunday, and when the prisoner came he said he thought he could well understand the prosecutor, and he told me to stop at the hotel because he would pay me for the day's engagement, and he also engaged me till the following Friday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have told you the whole of the conversation—the prosecutor spoke several words in English; I don't remember what they were—I was called by the prosecutor to translate—the prisoner said in English," "We have credit at the Bank of England "I am positive those words were used.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner took me to see the prosecutor on July 15th I saw them in the prisoner's office—the prisoner showed the prosecutor some samples of stuff, and I translated the prices—when we came from several houses, the prosecutor said he had got a cheque for £100 the prisoner said, "If you do not give it to me very possibly you will lose it; it is not well to go round London with 60 much money in your pocket; you had better give it <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me"—I was afterwards in the prisoner's office when the prosecutor told Kim he had cancelled the orders for the goods from Manchester, and that he had employed another agent—the prosecutor asked for £500 the prisoner said, "Come to-morrow, I can give it to you "I went next day and the following day; the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am Spanish—I have been in England over a year—the prisoner said as to the £500, "I cannot give it to you to-day, I will give it to you to-morrow; come up to-morrow morning "I live in the Name house as the prosecutor, and I have done so ever since these criminal proceedings began—I am a student of English.</p>

               <p>office on the third floor of 31, Great St. Helens—I told him I was a police officer, and said I had a warrant for a man named Rorke, and that I believed he was that person—I read the warrant, and said, "Are you the person referred to in that warrant?" he said, "Yes," and asked to see the warrant—I showed it to him—some time afterwards a man who he said was his clerk came in—the prisoner said he wished to consult with his solicitors—I said, "Who are your solicitors?" he said, "Mr. George Lewis" he took a blank cheque from his pocket, and wrote in the date and signed it, and handed it to his clerk—I said, "What is that?" he said, "I have very little cash in my pocket, and I must have my solicitors—"I said, "You clearly understand that if you are going to give that cheque to your clerk it is for your solicitor, you having no money in your pocket"—he wrote the address of Mr. George Lewis on a piece of paper, and handed it to the clerk, and said, "When you get there you can fill it in "I had not knowledge that it was to be filled in for £510.</p>

               <p>had made allowances to customers; he did not give me the names; hero is the list—I see here "five bales of bacon refused by Mr. Wootton"—he left the list in the office with my clerk; I went away at my usual time—he did give me names, but it was not the truth—Knight is a name to whom allowances were made, but I knew nothing of him, or Austin—the only statement he made was that he had made some allowances, and that would account for a portion of his deficiency—this document came under my notice the following week—then the arrangement was made to repay me £1 a week—I always paid him his salary in full every Saturday, and he handed me back the £1 the record of this stands in my ledger—at the end of April the account does not stand with £35 against the prisoner, it is a great deal more—the ledger-keeper will tell you about that; he and the cashier are here—the prisoner produced two books before the Magistrate; this is one of them—on 19th February, 1889, it is here recorded that a balance of £9 7s. was against the prisoner, and is carried forward to 3rd April, 1890, with a balance of £36 5s. 10d. against him—I cannot say whether the discussion with the prisoner was after 3rd April; I don't know that it was in April—I have not looked up the matter—the sums put down as allowances are the amounts of the goods supplied—it was not with my consent that the allowances were repaid by £1 a week; I accepted the £1 a week on the deficiency up to the time of his leaving—the week ending 9th August I did not pay him—he would not be entitled to keep any money back—he could not very well remit coin, so it was permissible to him to hold that till he returned—on the 9th August a policeman was at my premises, I can't say at what time he arrived, I was there at ten minutes past nine, he was there then, and the prisoner also—he was called into my room after I had spoken to my cashier, and it was after my conversation with him that I gave him into custody; I was with him a very few minutes—I went to the station, and left him there in custody—the officer in charge gave him the particulars, and on what grounds I had given him in charge—I did not make any charge against him that was entered on the charge-sheet—he was released that day, I don't know at what time, there was no need for me to stay—he was discharged because we had not the proofs—the following Monday morning, the 11th, Mr. Tudd, the prisoner's brother-in-law, came to me—he did not ask for an explanation of my conduct to the prisoner—he asked me what was the matter, he told me the prisoner had been in difficulties before; that he had been a source of annoyance, and he had had to pay moneys for him—I told him the full particulars, I cannot say in what words—I very likely told him that I was going before the Magistrate next morning—he said he would produce the prisoner at any moment he was wanted, and gave me his name and address, and said there was no need to take out a warrant, that the prisoner would be forthcoming at any time to answer anything I had to bring against him—I knew that his address was St. Albans—I presumed he was living there—I did not know—I did not take out the warrant till the 31st August—I heard that he was arrested on Sunday night as he was coming from church—I believe he had been acting as organist there for some time—the prisoner was entitled to make allowances to my customers, but I must qualify that, if a customer had a fair claim, a small one, of half a crown or five shillings, he might allow it, but in a matter of pounds I should not allow him to</p>

               <p>make it without submitting it to the house—my goods are not all of a perishable condition—I have customers named Painter, Doherty, Eyres and Wootton—unfortunately the prisoner has made large allowances to Painter without my knowledge; I think to somewhere about £20, but £130 is the amount he was deficient—I don't know of an allowance to Mr. Bingham of £16 in July, 1889, or of £30 to Mr. Doherty, or of £9 odd to Mr. Eyres, in July, 1890my cashier can explain these matters—I think we took some hams back from Mr. Eyres; I don't remember what the conditions were—I did not say that the only allowance I could make would be a diminution of eight shillings per cwt., but I should not dispute it if it was a fair claim—I remember we took some back from him; whether we sold them on his account I can't say—if the prisoner was in want of money while on his journey he need not have been—I should think he would fortify himself before starting out of the £7 that he was paid every Saturday; we do not pay weekly servants in advance as a rule—he would not be likely to go to a place without funds; if he had coin in his possession which he had not been able to forward he might use that, because he does not pay up till Saturday—I do not know that since these proceedings were taken he has found other employment; I did hear that he had made an application to a house whilst he was out on bail—I do not know that he is at this moment in the employment of Messrs. Taylor and Co., of Leicester; I should certainly be surprised at it; of course I should conclude that they did not know the facts of the case; they did not apply to me for his character; I should not go out of my way to tell Mr. Taylor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner in one week would take places grouped together—he could make his own arrangements—it would be very exceptional for him to go to Scarborough, only in the season—if he had to use money of mine it would be his duty to account on the following Saturday when he returned—he might make certain allowances, but I don't believe these were ever made—I know nothing of them, but they seem about the amount of the bulk of goods—they would not come within the scale of allowance he was entitled to make—it would be his duty to enter all allowances in his daily sheets, and there are plenty of instances where he has allowed a trifle—there was no such entry in the prisoner's books for either of these three sums; he has made no remark about them; he never suggested they were allowances till after I asked him for an explanation—the amount he suggested for allowances did not cover the amount at all—I said I had nothing to do with them—he gave his theory of allowances as an excuse for deficiency to some extent—this paper is fictitious—I do not ratify these allowances now, and I did not then—he agreed to pay back the whole deficiency by £1 a week; that included the allowances—on Saturday any loose money he had received or that had been paid on his behalf he should have paid in or accounted for—the charge preferred on August 9th was distinct from this; it was for obtaining a cheque for £37 from Mr. Painter, for which the prisoner has not accounted to me—it is the subject of another indictment with two other charges—after 9th August Mr. Judd, the prisoner's brother-in-law, came to see me, and told me he had had previous difficulties with the prisoner—I did not ask him for particulars.</p>

               <p>—I know nothing of the allowances—it was after there had been an inquiry about certain moneys short in the account—when he showed me this list of allowances I said, "I have nothing to do with allowances, because you have not had authority to do them; it is quite on account of yourself you have done it"—the way he did business was by sending on goods without orders—I repudiated all knowledge and sanction of allowances—he expressed his regret, and I thought it might be overlooked, and I allowed him to goon—I distinctly told him if he committed himself in that way again I should have to prosecute him—at the end of July I received this cheque for £37 4s., drawn by Mr. Painter, who is a customer at Worcester—on the following Saturday I said to the prisoner that I noticed a cheque had been received from Painter Brothers, but no account was given of it in his sheet—he said, "I gave them coin in exchange for it"—something was afterwards said to me about it—Mr. Charles Hastings, grocer at Leighton Buzzard, is one of the people on whom the prisoner would call—this is a cheque made payable to Cutting by Hastings—it was an unusual practice for cheques to be made out to him and not to me—I think I received this cheque on 2nd August, the Saturday of the account—I had no conversation with the prisoner about it—I have no knowledge what it was paid in respect of—Kirby is a grocer at Abingdon—I remember this cheque being paid in; as it was sent up, and there was no account on the contra side, and as he had given me information on the Saturday previous that he had given coin in exchange for the cheque for Painter, I telegraphed to Kirby, and received a telegram back—I am not sure if I said anything to the prisoner or what he said to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The charge on which the prisoner was arrested was the embezzlement of £32 4s., made up of the sums named in the last indictment, and had nothing to do with this—I believe my evidence before the Magistrate was confined to those two charges; I don't know whether these were introduced—I forget if Mr. Painter was called before the Magistrate—Mr. Hastings and Mr. Kirby were not called think no charge of any description relating to these matters was then preferred against the prisoner—Mr. Painter was present before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the other facts came to my knowledge I charged him with the three, embezzlements we have inquired into—the present charges have been found out since the inquiry at the Police-court.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">TROWELL</hi>. This cheque for £37 4s. I received on 1st August (Friday)on the next (Saturday) morning I saw the prisoner and gave him his book, which he made up—there is no entry in his book of his having received any money from Painter Brothers that week; it should appear there if money had been paid by them in respect of goods supplied by the firm—I drew Mr. Painter's attention to the cheque—this £10 cheque from Mr. Hastings was brought up by the prisoner on the Saturday morning—MR. Hastings is not credited in this book with anything in respect of that £10; his name is not mentioned—it is not usual for the prisoner to present cheques payable to himself—I have only known him do it two or three times—there is no mark against the cheque showing what it is paid in respect of—it is included in the general body of money received from customers other than Hastings—on the two occasions when the sums of £37 4s. and £10 were entered, the money tallied with the book—if the cheques for £37 4s. and £10 had not been there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189010200095"/>
               <p>there would have been a deficiency on each occasion to that extent—I got this cheque of Kirby's for £20 on Friday morning, 8th August, I think—on the 9th, the prisoner made up his book, which tallied with the amount in mine, because it included the cheque for £20, which was not credited in any way to Mr. Kirby—on those three occasions Mr. Painter, Mr. Hastings, and Mr. Kirby have not been credited with the money which they paid into the firm, but the money with which they ought to have been credited was used by the prisoner to make up his book so as to make it tally with the account in my book.</p>

                  </hi>, J. P. I am a solicitor, practising in Dublin, ad am Chairman of the Briton Life Association, formed under the deed of settlement of February 1st, 1854 there are two deeds; this is the first, the second was on January 3rd, 1861 they are both herein 1862 the new Companies Act came into operation, and on November 3rd, 1862, it was registered under that Acton 5th March, 1863, the name was changed to the Briton Medical and General Life Association, and on 17th August, 1863, it was incorporated—the original capital was £50,000, and on 6th February, 1856, there was a second issue of another £50,000on 5th March, 1863, there was another issue of £100,000in 1857 and 1862 the Equitable and the Brunswick Life were amalgamated with it—in 1885 Mr. Messent, the secretary, died, and it was discovered that he had committed robberies to the extent of over £100,000on 8th January, 1886, a petition was presented to the Court of Chancery for the winding up of the company, or the reduction of the contracts—on the 13th a liquidator was appointed: Mr. Henry Dever, of Lothbury—the object was to remodel it in consequence of Messent's frauds—Mr. Justice Kay made the order, and reports were obtained on the assets and liabilities, and sent to every policyholder and shareholder—on 11th August there was a meeting, when it was decided to reconstruct, and not to wind upon 19th July the scheme was affirmed by the Court of Appeal—before that was done a committee of nine</p>

               <p>policyholders was appointed to consider what course should be taken—Mr. Webb and Mr. Brown were the two remaining directors of the old board—seven policyholders were appointed to act for the new company, more as trustees than directors—the company" was being carried on for the benefit of the policyholders and the shareholders, if the thing turned out, as it has turned out—there were resolutions altering the qualifications of the directors under the Order of the Court—on 18th February, 1887, the resolution as to the qualification of directors was passed, and the new board was appointed: Mr. Broadhurst, of Grosvenor Street, London; Mr. Holman, a solicitor, of Lewes; Dr. Gale, of Plymouth; Mr. Smith, of Birmingham; myself, and Mr. Henry Hudson, and we received instructions to elect the late Member for Holborn, who remained chairman till 16th November, when he died, and I was elected chairman afterwards—these resolutions were submitted by the liquidator to Mr. Justice Stirling, and approved of by him, and on 19th July, 1887, the company was handed over to the new directors—there has been a great deal of litigation with Boaler, but he has no status whatever in the company—his right to search our books is under the Act of 1862, that any one can do so on payment of one shilling—there have been a very large number of orders for costs against him amounting to over £1,000, and I think the policyholders at the end of the year will have lost £12,000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> A committee was formed, called the London Central Committee of Policyholders; Mr. Hudson was the first chairman; I attended its meeting in 1886I was a policyholder; I gave £500 in 1872; this policy was on O'Brien's life; it was my money; I handed it to O'Brien, and it was assigned to me absolutely, but I shall only get back about £300I bought the policy in the Bankruptcy Court,. Dublin, when he was declared bankrupt—I have also purchased another policy, as my life was not insured; it was necessary to hold two policies to be a director, and I have been re-elected this year on my two policies, which stood in my name long before—I have a £1,000 policy now, and you libelled me as a director of 1890, not as a director of 1887I was appointed on 18th February, 1887, which was confirmed on September 9th and 10th, 1887; I was re-elected in 1888 and 1890; the association was in liquidation up to the time Justice Kay decided that it should be reconstructed—you commenced an action in the High Court of Justice in 1888 to test the legality of my appointment, and it has been decided over and over again; all your charges went to impugn the second deed of settlement; you abandoned the charges; that action is not pending now—an action was commenced by Mr. George Norley, of Manchester, contesting the validity of my appointment; he was put up by you, he has no means of payment—I am not aware whether it is set down for trial—one share is the qualification required for a director, but before the order was made 2,000 shares was the qualification, upon which £2 had been paid up—the qualification was reduced by this special resolution of the shareholders.

                  <hi rend="italic">informed him that unless he proceeded with his justification, the witness would be ordered to leave the box</hi>)I believe the balance-sheet of December 31st, 1889, does not include the £674 14s. lid.—that applies also to the previous balance-sheets—I do not put all the onus on Mr. Dever, I put it on the auditors and on the policyholders auditors—you have no right to say that a balance-sheet is a fraud, we have committed no fraud; the accounts are not untrue.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">RECORDER</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">ordered the witness to stand down. This closed the case for the Prosecution, but the prisoner claimed that Mr. Hardy should be called, his name being on the indictment.</hi>)</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner was again several times cautioned to keep to the point</hi>) The whole of this question was discussed before Mr. Vaughan, and the two accounts put into Mr. Clay's hands were shown to agree exactly—it is not a fact that with regard to form E there was a conviction at Bow Street on one item only, it was long before that, eighteen months ago—you took out a summons under form D, and I applied to have you examined in Court in consequence of the enormous costs you had put us <hi rend="italic">to</hi>, and we did get an examination before an examiner, who you defied.</p>

               <p>our sole object has been to stop the litigation, and as I believe not one member of the board has any vindictive feeling against Mr. Boaler, I thought, if he was prepared to do that, we might possibly come to terms and put an end to this litigation, and I did agree to meet Mr. Boaler at a director's house (Major Isaacs), where I happened to be on a visit that evening, when Mr. Boaler came in it was arranged that whatever took place was to be in solemn confidence between us, not to be divulged, and I am sorry he has divulged it—the directors knew nothing about it, I simply took this upon myself with a view of stopping the litigation, and if I had found it could be done I would then have called a special board meeting for the following Monday morning, placed my views before them, and if they agreed, and the Court agreed, we would have carried it out; but to my surprise, after we had discussed the matter a little, Mr. Boaler demanded £10,000 for pleading guilty—I said, "How can you make such a claim? what is it based upon? you know that as to the shares you hold, the first thing you would have to do would be to pay £2,500 as mortgage debt, apart from disputed calls; you would have to pay up all the calls; every person has paid the calls except yourself and Morley, your friend"—he said, "Those are my terms"—we had a long discussion; I could not get him out of that, he would not be got from that point—if he had succeeded in any of these actions the £10,000 would go back and follow every shareholder for thirty years, and mike them pay back the dividends which he said had been improperly paid to them for thirty years, so that it was not only against law but common sense, and it resulted in our parting company—the persons injured would not be myself and the directors, but the widows and children of the policyholders—we have about 30,000 policyholders.</p>

I told him—he said that if I could make it any less for him he might be a customer another time—the mixture was £4, the hay 75s., and straw 34st here were to be two loads of each—I asked his address; he said, "Mr. Smith, Park Street, Upton Park, carman"—he gave no christian name—the prisoner said that Smith could pay for anything, he thought he was all right—I asked Smith the way from our place to his; he said, "By the Woolwich Ferry," and we parted—on Friday evening, the 26th, about nine o'clock, I was at home, and the prisoner came with Quinton, a carman, who said, "There is something wrong about the delivery of those sacks; will you come and see about it?"—I got up in the empty cart which the man brought with him, and rode to Upton Park—the prisoner said, "It will be all right, George, I have money, and can pay for it"—the carman told me it was all unloaded—I asked the prisoner if he would pay for it—he said, "Yes, if you will come inside "he did not pay me—Smith was the purchaser—I saw the stuff in the garden of 4, Seymour Street, Upton Park—it is a little cottage—it had been unloaded—I recognised it—I asked the prisoner to take me to find Smith; he said he would, but that Smith would not get out of bed to speak to me if I went to his place—we went up one street and down another for a considerable time, but he could not or would not show me Smith—he went back to his place, and in the meantime the Pascalls had arrived, father and son—Mr. Hawkins and I decided to give the prisoner in charge, and I went for a constable, who went to his house and took him.</p>

I am carman to the prosecutor—on 26th September I received two loads of hay to deliver—Howard and Hills wero with me; they had their own loads to look after—I started off to look for Mr. Smith, of Park Street, Upton Park—we wont over Woolwich Ferry, and the prisoner came out of the Denmark Tavern, and said to Howard, "Pull up here"—Howard, who was in front, asked who he was—he said, "This stuff is for Mr. Smith, is it not?"—Howard said, "Yes"—he said, "I am Smith, the man who bought this stuff; I have been here since 9.30 this morning waiting for it; you have been a long time coming"—it was then about 12.30he walked round the stuff, and picked out the middle load, and said, "This stuff is not so good as what I bought"—I said, "What is the matter with it?" he pointed to one or two trusses, and said, "There is a dirty one, there is one so burnt I have a good mind not to take it in; I suppose you <hi rend="italic">gents</hi> can do with half a pint of beer"—I said that we could, and he put down threepence on the counter for three half-pints of ale between three men, and went out, but walked in again and said, "Are you men nearly ready to come and take the stuff round?" we said, "Yes"—he said, "Fetch your horses round to the Denmark, and wait there till I come; go up the road till you come to the Bowling Tavern; I will go across the field and tell my men what to do, and then I will come across the field and help you to unload"—a minute after we got there the prisoner was there, and another man came, who taxed the prisoner about some money—there was a dispute between them; the other man said something about robbing—when he left, the prisoner said, "Come on, I will show you where to unload this stuff"—I said to Howard, "This sort of thing don't seem to be exactly right; I should like to wire the governor, and see what he thinks about it"—Howard said, in the prisoner's presence, "How are we going to wire if we have not got any money to wire with?" the prisoner said, "You don't want to take any notice of what the other man says; I will pay your telegram if you wish to wire the governor"—I then telegraphed to Martin and Sons, and the prisoner paid for it—we waited four hours for an answer, and about five o'clock Pascall, an office-boy, was sent—the other two men came and asked how long we were going to be—the prisoner said, "Why won't you unload this stuff?"—I said, "We don't care about unloading it; if you can't pay £5 you can't pay" £20 he said, "What are you frightened of? what is the reason you won't unload this stuff? is it because that man just taxed me over that little affair just now? do you hear? did you not take ten loads of barley-straw to Flower Road, Rotherhithe? when that ten loads were sent was not five shillings sent by one of the carmen to give to the men who unloaded the straw, and he brought it back again? did you not also take out a load of clover, for which a cheque was received? and as soon as your employer arrives there is the money to pay;" and ho showed me a bag—I said, "Yes, I believe there were ten loads of barley-straw sent, also a load of clover"—as to the money-bag, I had to take my best belief whether there was money or nothe said, "If you don't</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house painter, now living at 13, Somerville Street, Leeds—on 12th September I was lodging at 32, Conway Road, Plumstead—Mrs. Lyons was the landlady—she lived in the house, also her two sons, the prisoner and William Lyons, and Mr. Wood—I occupied the front room upstairs, Mrs. Lyons occupied the back parlour ownstairs—on Friday evening, 12th September, I went to bed about twenty minutes to eleven—Mr. Wood and William Lyons were in the house at that time—I woke up about half-past twelve and heard a noise downstairs, and the prisoner shouting—the sounds came from Mrs. Lyons bedroom—I heard the prisoner say, "I will not go out of the room"—he spoke as though he was very wild—I heard his mother say, "You will nave to go out"—the prisoner then screamed out, "I will not go out of the room till that man goes out of the house "she said, "I shall please myself when he goes"—then he turned as if to someone else, and said, "If you do not go out of the house I will bash your b——brains in"—after that I heard someone rush to the kitchen at the back of the house, and then heard him run back to the bedroom very quickly—I then heard a struggle as though between two persons; it lasted a very short time, a very few minutes—after that they seemed a little quieter—I think the prisoner asked his mother to send the man out of the houses—he said, "I shall please myself about him"—he called his mother a b——cow and a b——whore, and I heard him say to the other person, "Would you like to come home and find a man in bed with your mother?" and another voice said, "No"—that was the first time I heard the third voice—the prisoner then said, "Why don't you go out of the house, you know you have no business here"—his mother said, "He shall go when I choose to let him "I think it was then that he called his mother the names, and she replied, "Thank you"—the prisoner said, "Have I not got it in front of my eyes?"—his mother said, "We are going to get married to-morrow. "the prisoner said, "If I can only find one thing in the house, I will cut your b——head off and mine too with one swing"—the next thing was the prisoner said to the man, "If you don't go out of the house I will throw you out, and I will fight you fair fight"—the man said, "I am acting as a man not to hit you; I have fought in battles, and can fight again, and could kill you with one blow"—the man spoke two or three times in a gruff voice, I could not understand what he said; he spoke at different times as things were said between the mother and son—at the finish of the row I think the soldier said he would go—I then heard two persons walk towards the front door—the mother came back from the door into the passage and asked her son for her hat; he said, "You shall not have it"—all then seemed quiet for a little while, and then I heard some<lb/>one</p>

               <p>rush upstairs to the little back room where the prisoner and his brother slept; I could not hear what he did—I heard no more then till I heard voices in the street; that was between ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after the remark about the hat—I jumped out of bed and opened the window, and I then heard Mrs. Lyons say in a very loud voice, "Take him away or he will murder me"—the prisoner screamed out, "Get out of my way, or I will serve you the same"—I then called Wood, my fellow lodger, and we both went out into the street—I saw a female, and, in consequence of what she said, I ran to the corner of Griffin Road, where I saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand, and I said, "Oh, Walter, what have you done?"—he turned round and looked on the ground, and said, "I have done it, look," and I saw a soldier lying there—the prisoner said, "Fetch a policeman, I will give myself up"—Mrs. Lyons was kneeling down, kissing the soldier j she said, "Oh, Walter, you have killed him"—the prisoner was not a yard from her when she said that—he made no answer—two policemen then came up, and the prisoner walked up to them and said, "Here is the knife, I give myself up; there is the man I have killed; take me, for I know my doom"—he gave the large knife to the constable, and then putting; his hand in his pocket, he pulled out a clasp knife, saying, "If I had not done it with that one I should have done it with this"—at this time a doctor came up—the prisoner was dressed in his working clothes—he had not got his boots on or his hat; he asked for them, and I went home and got his boots from under the kitchen table, and Wood fetched his hat—I went to the police-station, and afterwards went back to Conway Road with Mrs. Lyons—she there showed me a small riveting-hammer, which she said was broken in the struggle; this is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been lodging in this house from the second week after the Easter holidays—I was not there when the prisoner's father died, I never saw him—the prisoner worked in the Arsenal—I never heard any quarrel or disturbance in the house before this—the prisoner appeared a steady, quiet young fellow—this disturbance lasted about half or three-quarters of an hour—the first words the prisoner spoke he shouted out, as if mad with passion—when I saw him up Griffin Road he seemed even worse—as far as I could see he was quite sober, though greatly excited—when he saw the man lying dead on the ground he seemed to sink—on the road to the station he burst out crying—he said, "I am sorry for what I have done"—when I got to the spot I only saw the soldier, the mother, the prisoner, and one girl, Johnson—the soldier did not leave the house till a quarter of an hour after this hammer was said to have been broken—in spite of the prisoner's threats the soldier remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As the dispute went on the prisoner seemed to get more wild; it was more screaming than speaking—when his mother asked for her hat, he said in rather a sharp way, "You shall not have it"—he seemed to be quieter then, when the soldier was going—when I opened the window and looked out he was speaking in a very screaming voice—he seemed very calm when he said, "I have done it, look"—he was quite calm when the constables came up—when his mother came to sneak to him he pushed out his hand and said, "Go away, I will not talk to you; you ought to be ashamed of yourself," and from that time he seemed comparatively calm—I took his shoes to him at the corner of</p>

I am a widow, living at 32, Conway Road, Plumstead—I have been a widow seven months—the prisoner is my son; he is twenty years old, and was living with me—he and his brother occupied a bedroom together—I occupied a bedroom on the ground floor—Phillimore slept in the first floor fronton Friday, 1st September, I went to some military sports on Woolwich Common—I was there introduced to John Stewart, a quartermaster sergeant in the Royal Artillery, about four in the afternoon—I had never met him before, he was quite a stranger to me—I remained in his company for the rest of the afternoon and evening, and with my consent he accompanied me home about twelve—we went together to my bedroom on the ground floor, and went to bed together; that was about half-past twelve—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner entered the room—there was no light when he came in; he brought a lamp in his hand—he spoke to me, and I answered him—high words passed between us—I could not say whether the soldier was awake during the quarrel between me and my son; he was not awake when my son came into the room—he was awake afterwards—he did not get out of bed to dress himself till my son told him he would have to clear out of the house; he said he was not going to be frightened by a brat like him, and he asked if he was master of the house—my son said, "I am master as far as this goes, I am not going to have this sort of thing here"—he left the room before the soldier got up—I was up and dressed when he came back, he then had his small riveting-hammer in his hand—he again told the soldier to leave the house—he said he was not going for a brat like him—my son said, "I am as good a man as you"—I was afraid they were going to fight, and I struggled with my son; I took hold of his coat—the soldier used filthy language to him—my son said he would put him out of the house; I daresay he would have got to him if I had not been there, I was struggling with him at the time—the hammer got broken in our struggle; a piece came off the bottom of the handle, as it is now—my son said, "Are you going?" the soldier said, "I will please myself whether I go or not"—I begged of him to go—then there were high words between them in the passage; the soldier had dressed himself and said he would go; my son left the room first, he stood for a moment at the foot of the stairs, immediately outside the bedroom door—the soldier swore at him again and said, "I am acting like a man not to hit you, I could kill you in one blow "my son then went into the kitchen—I knew there was a knife in the dresser-drawer there which had been used for cutting bread that day—I and the soldier went to the street door, and I told him to go—we remained there two or three minutes—I left him at the gate and went back for my hat—I met my son in the passage, he was standing by the bedroom door—he begged me not to go out—I said, "I want my hat"—he said, "You shall not have it"—I went along the passage—he said, "I don't see what you want to go out for "I said I would please myself, and I went to the gate and joined the soldier, and walked away with him down Conway Road to the corner of Griffin Road, where there was a hoarding; we went through that. whilst we were there my son came to the opening—he said, "I</p>

               <p>have caught you, what can you say to this now?" the soldier swore at him for following—I got up immediately and caught hold of my son—the soldier said he would knock him down—Walter said, "Come out into the road"—Stewart said he had fought in battles, and fought with fire and steel, and was not afraid of a brat like him—I could see as though they were going to fight, and I caught hold of my son; he was quite out of temper, he seemed to be screaming with passion—he was not near Stewart then, he was two or three yards from him—I begged of Ste wart to go away—he said, "Don't mind me, mind yourself"—he stood—I struggled with my son—the soldier came towards him, but I was between them—we were then in the road—my son went out first, I next, and the soldier last—they were going to fight, when I stood between them; they were both in a fighting attitude—I caught hold of both sides of my son's coat, at the top part, the breast part—he screamed, "Go away, go away, I have got a knife"—I had not seen the knife at that time—I left go of one side of his coat, and asked Stewart for God's sake to go away—my son's coat pocket got ripped or torn, and he threw me to the ground; I don't know whether he threw me or whether I tripped and fell; then he was free from me—when I got up again I saw Stewart stagger and fall—my son was then standing a little distance from me, two or three yards, and six or seven yards from Stewart—seeing Stewart fall, I said, "Oh, Walter, Walter, what have you done?" I do not remember if he answered—I ran up to Stewart, knelt down, and put my arms round his head—he looked up at me, sighed, and immediately afterwards expired—he did not speak after he fell—after that I think a witness came up and the police constable—the witness was standing there a good part of the time.; I screamed for him to come to my help, but he would not—I believe when Stewart saw me fall he was coming to my assistance, thinking that I was hurt, and my son and he must have closed, but I did not see them close—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife; it was used in the house as a bread-knife; it had been in use that day at one o'clock, the dinner hour—the prisoner was at home to dinner that day—it was put away in the knife-box in the dresser-drawer.</p>

               <p>with one blow, my son seemed to take it as ft threat—he made a step towards my son, as if to strike him—it was after that that my son went for the hammer—he seemed to be absolutely maddened with passion; he shouted at the pitch of his voice; he burst out crying in the bedroom, and implored the soldier to go out of the house, that he had no business there—from the time we came out from the hoarding till the soldier lay dead it was two or three minutes at the very most—during the whole of that time my son seemed almost mad with passion; he could not control himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He is passionate at times—he was very passionate that night, because he had never seen the like before, and it drove him to madness—in the bedroom, before he went for the hammer, Stewart made a step towards him when he was dressing—he made a step towards the foot of the bed where my son was standing; I thought they were going to fight then—I did not notice whether he raised his hand, I was too much fixed on my son—when we were inside the hoarding the soldier said, "Here comes the b——again," and used very bad language—I did not see him raise his hand against my son inside the hoarding; there must have been something, for my son to say, "Come out into the road"—in the road I did not see them get nearer to each other than two or three yards—I did not see the soldier raise his hand against my son—he had his hands up as though he was going to fight, his hands were clenched in front of him—he did not raise his arm up high.</p>

I live at 52, Griffin Road, Plumstead—I am principal foreman in the Royal Arsenal—about half-past one on the morning of 18th September I heard a noise outside my house, and in consequence I went out into the road, and found a man lying on the ground—I saw the prisoner there, and said to him, "I think you work for me"—he said, "No, Mr. Revel, I worked over your office for Mr. Williams, I now</p>

I am a medical practitioner, of 26, Conway Road, Plumstead—on the morning of 13th September, about half-past one, I was called to the corner of Griffin Road, and saw the deceased lying in the road dead—I partially examined him and had him removed to the mortuary, where I made a more careful examination—I found an incised wound in the chest, penetrating through the chest-bone to the sternum—I afterwards made a post-mortem; I found that the wound had penetrated through the sternum straight down, penetrating the right auricle of the heart, causing almost instantaneous death from hemorrhage—a blow from a knife like this would cause such a wound; it must have been a most severe blow.</p>

I said I would not buy it—I said, "You had better take it with you;". he said, "I cannot take it now, surely you can do with it"—I said, "No, but you can leave it if you like, and I will try and sell it for you"—he left it and went away—I kept it for a day, and then gave information to Sergeant Gill—on 2nd September the prisoner came early in the morning with another horse and van, and said, "Have you sold my harness?"

                  </hi>. I live at 173, Brook Street, Newington Butts, and am a wheelwright—about half-past ten on the night of 15th September I was in the Standard beer-house—Ray and the prisoner came in there together—Ray said to me, "You are a cunning,"—and came over and made a kick at me—the prisoner touched Ray on the shoulder and said, "Don't hit a boy; why don't you hit a man?—"Ray said, "If you don't get away I will hit you," and he deliberately spat or blew in the prisoner's face three times, and wanted to fight him—the prisoner said, "I won't fight you to-night, I will fight you in the morning"—Ray said, "I won't fight you in the morning; if we leave it till the morning we won't fight at all; we have been going to fight a long while"—the prisoner said, "If you want to fight me bad, I will fight you one hand," and then he asked to have one hand tied behind him, but Ray said, "No, I will fight you with the two," and pulled him outside the beer-shop—I went to see the fight—they went about twenty yards round the corner to a little court—the prisoner took off his waistcoat—they both sparred up together, and Ray made a hit at the prisoner, and the prisoner made a hit at Ray; they both got together—Ray got away and made a hit at the prisoner, who hit him on the chest—he staggered back, made another hit at the prisoner, and then fell down, and that was the end of the fight—it lasted two minutes—Ray never got up—the prisoner said nothing, but walked</p>

               <p>away and stood outside the Standard, and then fetched a barrow, on which I helped to put Ray—the prisoner and another man were there—Ray was taken off on the barrow; I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>). Ray and the prisoner were quite friendly at the regatta that afternoon—they had known each other a considerable time Ray was as near the prisoner's size as possible—they wore not exactly an equal match; Ray was supposed to be a fighting man—the prisoner refused for some time when Ray asked him to come outside; he was very reluctant to go out, and Ray had to pull him out—the prisoner struck Ray on the chest, he staggered back, made another hit at the prisoner, who went on one side, and Ray fell down and lay there; it was immediately after striking at the prisoner he fell down—he lunged with some force; the blow would have been of considerable force if it had struck the prisoner, but it missed him, and Ray fell to the ground—the prisoner went to get the barrow about two minutes afterward—she did not kick Ray or make any attempt to kick him—I was not there when the police came up—I did not think Ray was dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had seen them together at the regatta by Blackfriars Bridge, and in a public-house drinking together—the blow Ray received was on the left hand side of his chest—he fell on his face, and never moved afterwards.</p>

I am manager of the Standard beer-house, Friar Street, Blackfriars—I had seen Ray and the prisoner in my house on different occasions—they knew each other—on 15th September they came in about twenty minutes past ten—I daresay eight or nine people were in my bar—the prisoner and Ray were larking about and sparring, and getting violent, and I told them to get outside—Ray became very violent, and wanted to fight, and wanted to kick Pickett—the prisoner told him not to kick the boy, but to fight a man, and they went outside, and I saw no more—before they went out they were very violent, and I heard a lot of bad language—the prisoner wanted to put off fighting till next morning—Ray insisted on making him fight that night, and blew filth in his face two or three times, pretending to spit—they left the house about half-past ten—Ray had no coat or hat on—the prisoner took off his coat in the doorway—when they went out all the customers went out to see the fight I remained in the house, as I had no one else the—ret—he prisoner and Pickett came back in three or five minutes—Pickett said, "Bog Tray is knocked out "the prisoner said nothing; ho seemed to be very sorry, and was very excited—he went out, and I saw no more of him—I afterwards saw Ray dead at the hospital.</p>

Ray said, "Yes"—they began to fight—several people were standing round—the men struck two or three blows—the prisoner struck Ray a blow on the chest which glanced upwards—it knocked Ray down—he staggered to his feet and put his hands in a fighting attitude, but ho fell forwards; he had not the strength—he was picked up—I did not move—after a few seconds I saw he was insensible—I went and got a jug of water, and it was thrown over him—the prisoner came back from somewhere, and took hold of Ray's head and said, "Oh, he is out, isn't he?" in a sorrowful way, as if he was sorry.</p>

I am a wire worker, of 12, Surrey Street, Blackfriars—just before eleven on this night I was passing the Standard on the other side of the road—the door was open, and I saw the prisoner and Ray inside quarrelling together, shaking their heads about—about a quarter past eleven I went to Friars Place and saw Ray lying on the ground—a constable came up at the same time as I did, and I said to the constable, "It is all right, I will get him home, he is a neighbour of mine"—the prisoner was there—I did not notice what he was doing—someone was holding Ray's head; I could not say if it was the prisoner—I said something to the constable about a barrow, and someone got a barrow, and the constable put Ray on, and I wheeled him away—the prisoner helped me along with the barrow—two constables were there; they had a doubt that something was wrong, and came running along to know where I was taking Ray to—I said, "To his father's place"—when the policemen came after us, the prisoner ran away, he said, "The police is after me"—I took Ray to his father's door, and there the police said, "He is a dead 'un," and I ran him off to the hospital as quick as I could—before the prisoner ran away, he said to me, as we were going across Blackfriars Road, "Do you think he is dead?" I said "No, dead be blowed, he is only in a drunken sleep"—he said, "Shove up and get away from the police on that side, or else they might <hi rend="italic">pinch</hi> me; "that meant lock him up—he said, "Do you think you had better take him to the hospital, or take him off home?" and I said, "I am going to take him off home, as the police have allowed him in my hands.

About eleven on this night I was in the Blackfriars Road, and from something I heard I went to Friar's Place, where I saw Ray on the ground with several people round him—another constable followed me, about two yards behind—the prisoner was not there then, he came up afterwards—Ray was put on to a barrow, and Millen said he would take him home to his father's house; that he was his brother-in-law—I had no knowledge of the fight—when they had started with Ray on the barrow I went after them, but the prisoner had gone when I got up to the barrow—I took Bay to the hospital, where the doctor pronounced him dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Thomas'—sat half-past eleven on the night of the 15th September I saw Ray at the hospital—he had apparently been dead about a quarter of an hour or rather more—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found the stomach distended, with an excessive amount of unmasticated food that had apparently boon bolted without chewing—with the exception of a bruise on the right side of the face, and a slight scratch, there was no external mark of injury—having regard to the extended condition of the man's body, a blow on the left side of the chest over the heart might cause death—I found nothing internally that would cause death; the condition of the organs was healthy—a blow on the lower part of the chest, on the loft side over the stomach or heart, or a blow on the head might cause death, without leaving any external mark; a blow on the lower part of the chest would cause death, by stopping the heart's action through nervous shock; that would be more likely to occur through the condition of the stomach—the stoppage of the heart's action was the cause of death—there was nothing to account for it except such a blow as has been described; it might have been caused by a blow on the head, but that is not so likely a cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not account for death in the post-mortem examination—it would be probable that if a man received a blow over the heart of sufficient severity to cause death there would be some indication on the flesh a quarter of an hour afterwards, but it would be by no means necessary—I stripped and examined him directly he came to the hospital—I saw no indication of the blow—I don't think it would be possible for stoppage of the heart's action to be caused by a man striking out and missing his mark, even if a man were in drink and his stomach distended—if a man fell, and his chest came in contact with some hard substance which caused a violent blow, it would have the effect of a blow; he would have to fall on a projection.</p>

I live at 2, Queen Anne's Cottages, Smithem Bottom, Coulsdon—I am relieving signalman in the service of the South-Eastern Railway at Coulsdon—on the evening of 31st July I was in the goods yard of that station—Mason was near me—about 200 yards from the station was a rick of hay in a field, the hay of which was bought by Mr. Howick—I know the rick—you can see it from the goods yard—about a quarter to eight in the evening my attention was called to the rick I and Mason thought we saw a man and a woman round the rick; we saw someone there standing, and he continued to stand till we crossed the yard and got on to the line—we went round by the embankment to opposite the hayrick; we were then nearer the rick than when we were in the goods yard; we were about sixty yards from it—looking from the embankment to the rick we saw the prisoner strike a match and light his pipe with it, and then hold the match to the stack—we saw the smoke coming from his mouth and pipe—his back was towards us—when he put the match to the rick the match went out; the hay did not catch fire—he stood straight, and had a good look round then—on the top of the embankment, where Mason and I were, there is a quickset hedge five or six feet high—we were crouching down behind the hedge and looking through it—having had a good look round, he knelt down and struck a second match, and put that to the stack—the stack did not catch fire; the match went out—he stood up and had another good look round, knelt down again, and as he was kneeling down he had another look round—he knelt down, and struck another match and put it to the stack, with the result that the stack caught alight—when he turned round the three times and had a good look round I could see his pipe in his mouth, and it was alight—the stack having caught alight the flames leapt up at once—the stack was fifteen yards in the field from the gate leading into the field from the main road—the prisoner, after it caught alight, picked up his hat and umbrella and brown-paper parcel, which had been on the ground, and walked away from the stack towards the road—I and Mason got through the hedge and walked after him—just as he got into the road I tapped him on the shoulder and said, "You had better come round with me"—he said, "What for?"—I was in a uniform of corduroy trousers and jacket; I had no initials on me—Mason does not wear uniform—I said, "Have not you just lit that stack in the field?" he said, "No, I think you have made a grand mistake" and he said, "Mind who you are handling of, for I am a real gentleman"—we told him he had better come back with us—he started to come back, and as we were walking by he said to me and Mason, "Can we not £0 and put it out, and say no more about it?"—we said, "No, we will get the fire engines to put that out "when we got down a bit further we called the signalman in the box, and asked him to telegraph for the fire engines, which he did—we came with the prisoner, and met Police Constable Eli Hammond, who was in plain clothes, in the roadway, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We got to New Cross Station about ten—we caught the half-past ten train—I live at Waterloo Road, Clapham Common—I got home about twelve—I am one of the brothers who had an account at this bank—it is not closed; I have had no notice from the bank—I had a cheque-book—I could not say whether the cheque in question was from my book; I have not seen it—I have not my cheque-book with me—no one had access to it but myself; I generally carried it in my pocket—the prisoner sometimes worked with meat times I take off my coat when I work, not very often—I never carried my cheque-book in my overcoat—at that time I was employing men; I did not do anything myself—I could not say whether I have taken off my coat and put it down with my cheque-book in it; I possibly might have done—I remember this night of 26th July, because my eldest brother started moving at the end of that week—we amused ourselves with a game of cards in the evening—it was after ten when we got to New Cross Station—I am not aware that there is a train at 9.51; it was after that, I am positive—I have not got any cheques now, and have not for some considerable time—this cheque is No. 23790; I do not know what has become of the others; I used all my cheques—I cannot recognise this cheque at all—I have not had any cheques for the last twelve months—my account was in the name of William Saxby, not Saxby Brothers(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Reed.</hi> That was a separate account. This cheque is not out of that book)I signed my own cheques—I was in partnership with one of my brother—she signed all the cheques in the name of Saxby Brothers, and I signed mine as William Saxby, a separate account—the prisoner never worked for me during the time the business was Saxby Brothers.</p>

               <p>Cross Road—on the Saturday we left off work about eight—the elder brother was out, and we waited till he came home, between eight and nine; we then had some supper, and after supper we walked to the station together to see him and his brother off—we had a glass of ale at the Rose previous to parting; it was as near as I could guess ten o'clock, it might be a little later; I returned home to 348, where I occupy apartments.</p>

I am the prisoner's eldest brother—it was my workshop that they were building—they assisted me to move on the 21st and 22nd July, and also on the 25th and 26th I went out about half-past eleven on the 26th to Norwood, and I returned by the seventeen minutes past seven from Norwood Junction; I got home a little eight, and I found there my brothers John, William, and James, and Mr. Wright—they were waiting for me to pay their wages for the work they had been doing—after I had paid them they had some supper, some coffee, and I walked with them to the Brighton New Cross Station—I think we got there about a few minutes before ten—we went into the Rose, as they had to wait some few minutes for the train, and I think we each had a glass of bitter—they caught the train something after ten, which went round to Victoria and to Clapham Junction, and then I walked home, and got home about eleven.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had no particular reason for noticing the time—I think Wright was in my house when my brother William came to me to see if I could bail the prisoner out; that was the day after he was taken before he was before the Magistrate—I had Mr. Haynes, the solicitor, there—none of us were called as witnesses.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I live at Clapham Junction—I was at the Falcon that night; I and my wife walked down there, and I had a glass of beer—I had been waiting for the prisoner for about an hour—I am one of the brothers who had an account at the Wandsworth branch; it was William and I—we had one cheque-book for the firm, and my brother had his own private account—the cheque-book of the firm was kept in the desk at the shop, 40, Northcote Road—the prisoner came there occasionally, very seldom, not as he chose, because the shop door was kept locked; He only came on a casual visit—I did not take notice of what he did when he was there, I was about my business—I swear he has never been in the shop alone; I did not distrust him, but I did not leave anyone there—I kept the cheque-book locked up and the door locked—I signed the cheques "A. G. Saxby Brothers;" I was the only one that signed—I only carried the cheque-book in my pocket when I went to the bank—I heard of this charge against the prisoner when the detective took him into custody, I can't remember the date; he was charged before the Magistrate the next morning—I was there, I did not give evidence</p>

               <p>I could not say whether this cheque came from our book unless I had it here—I did not miss a cheque—at the end of September, 1888, our premises were levied, they belonged to Mr. Turtle, who went bankrupt—an execution was put in, and they cleared us out at once, and took all our papers; I cannot even produce a receipt—they took everything out of my desk; the execution was for a quarter's rent, they said that if that was paid we could have our papers—they took the cheque-book among other things—I know a builder named Nicholls, but his name is not spelt the same as on the cheque.</p>
