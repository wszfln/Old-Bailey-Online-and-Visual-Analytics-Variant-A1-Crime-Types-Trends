I followed about three yards behind, went into the shop, and said, "What is the matter?" Mrs. Nicholls said "This man obtained refreshment, aud tendered this bad half-crown"—I asked the prisoner where he got it; he said that he received it for labour which he had done in Fleet Street, and did not know it was bad. I asked prisoner if he could tell me who he received it from or show me the place. He said "No"—Mrs. Nicholls refused to charge him, but I took him to the station, the charge was read over to him; he made no reply, but said he had no address. I found nothing on him.</p>

I now live at Sutton-on-Sea, Lincolnshire—until May of the present year I lived at The Poplars, Gunnersbury—my husband was a medical man in practice there—he died in December last—before that I knew the prisoner slightly—I knew a Mrs. Roe, his cousin by marriage—she lived at Gunnersbury—at the commencement of the year I was desirous of removing into a smaller house, and getting rid of my furniture—the prisoner acted for me in those matters—I then moved to 38, Heathfield Gardens, a smaller house at</p>

               <p>Gunnersbury—amongst other property which I inherited from my husband there was a sum of about £1,000, £500 of which was in the Commercial Bank of Scotland, partly on a deposit account and partly on an account on which I could draw—I do not remember telling the prisoner that I had this money in the bank—on 5th May I received a letter from him—I did not keep it—in it he said he had found a good investment for £50 or £100 if I would send him a cheque by return of post—I had perfect confidence in him at that time, and believing what he said I forwarded him a cheque for £100; this is the counterfoil of it, the cheque I never could fined; it is the practice of the bank to return me my cheques when they have been used—I sent the cheque to Hugh Street, Pimlico; I usually sent all letters there—on 7th May the prisoner came and saw me at Gunnersbury—he said he wanted my deposit receipt for £100, as I could make the bank pay the money twice if I did not send it—I gave him one of my deposit notes—I was under the impression it was for £100; I afterwards found it was for £400—I asked him what the investment was—he said it was to lend to a farmer to buy seed wheat—he did not say where the farmer resided, but he said he had to go to Chester about the business that afternoon—he said I was to have ten per cent. interest, and a good piece of land as security—I believed him—he then left, taking the deposit note with him—he returned on the 11th, and brought me a £10 note as the interest in advance on my £100—I believe I took that note to my grocer, Mr. Suter, of Chiswick—the prisoner also said, "I can get you 10 per cent. for the rest of your money now if you will allow me"—I said, "But should I do it?"—he said, "That is for you to decide"—I do not remember whether he said what the investment was, but I believed it to be the same as the other, because he said at the time he would likely have the same opportunity of doing the same for me again"—I said, "You know I know nothing about such things; do you advise me to do it?" He said, "Mrs. Roe has £1,000 lying idle in the Bank, and she would be very glad if I would do it for her, but you need it more." I then gave him these two cheques for £200 each—I filled in everything except the date—they are endorsed by him—one is dated 11th May, and the other the 19th—these are the two counterfoils filled up in the prisoner's handwriting:—"May 11, '88; for investment with E. Roe"—he went away with those two cheques—I implicitly believed at the time that he had invested the other £100 for me with the farmer at 10 per cent.—I should not have given him any more money if I had not believed that—I can't remember seeing him again till he was in custody—I have not received any interest for the other money—he wrote to me saying that he had invested the £500 in my name, which would bring me £50 a year for some time—I can't remember the date of that letter; it was some time in May—I wrote to him in Hugh Street, where he was usually to be found; these are the letters; they came back through the Dead Letter Office—on or about 2nd August I received this letter from him—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)."Albemarle Hotel, Brighton. Dear Mrs. McConachy,—By some question you asked me, either some of my letters never reached you, or you forget. I remember distinctly writing to you. The money was put in with the other money, and at your request invested. Of course I invested in my own name and in security for you. If you prefer your brother acting for you I will send you the items. I am so</p>

I hope the little ones are all well, and yourself included.—I remain, yours sincerely, J. E. Roe." That was the first idea I had that he had invested the money in his own name—he never came to see me or my solicitor, or even gave me the account he speaks of in that letter—by the advice of my solicitor I ultimately applied for a warrant for his apprehension.</p>

I am a jeweller, and live at 46, Essex Street, Islington—on the night of 7th November, between twelve and one, I was in a beer-shop in Clerkenwell—Davis was in there; I was having drinks with him—he put his hand into my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I said, "Please keep your hand out of my pocket"—when we left the house together Davis said to me, "Do you accuse me of putting my hand into your pocket?"—I did not answer—he pushed me about; I tried to get</p>

               <p>away; he put his hand in the same pocket, and took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from it; there was nothing but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there—I ran ten or twelve yards, when he overtook me; he struck me in the eye with his fist; I fell to the ground, with him on the top of me—White came up and pushed me in the side, as I was partly on the ground—I had seen him that evening in the house with Davis; we had had drinks together—while I was on the ground Davis put his hand into my coat pocket, and took these two pieces of metal chain—he also put his hand into my left-hand trousers pocket, from which I afterwards missed two half-crowns, a florin, and a penny—I had the case of one watch and a watch in my pocket—a constable came up when I was on the ground; he took White in charge—Davis ran away; I ran after him, and he was eventually stopped by another constable.</p>

About half-past twelve on 7th November I was on duty in Myddelton Street, Clerkenwell—I heard cries of "Police" coming from Garnault Place—I went in the direction, and when I got there I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and White just rising off him, and Davis standing up—White looked round, saw me, and started, and ran away—Davis went in the other direction—I stopped White; he said, "I have not done anything"—I said, "Well, I saw you in the road there together, and I shall detain you to see who the other man is"—I detained him about five minutes, and saw no sign of the prosecutor, and thought he had gone away, and I let White go—two or three minutes after<lb/>wards the prosecutor came back with Davis in custody of another constable—White had not gone then—I was going to the station with the prosecutor, and on the way I took White, who was one of a small crowd following, into custody—the prosecutor charged him at the station with pushing him down—White said he did not; he had not done anything—I searched him, and found on him in one of his pockets this small piece of chain, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, four cigars, and a wooden pipe—no charge but that of pushing was made against White.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor, of 129, Victoria Dwellings, Farringdon Road—on the evening of 6th November I was at the Champion Arms beer-house—about twenty minutes to nine I saw the prosecutor there—I know him as a man who goes about selling watches—I was at the beer-house till half-past twelve, when it was turning-out time—there were fifteen or twenty people there—the prosecutor was playing <hi rend="italic">coddam</hi> and dominoes, and drinks and cigars were tossed for; the prosecutor took a very prominent part in it all—only White played at <hi rend="italic">coddam</hi> with him—at closing-time, half-past twelve, the prosecutor was drunk—there were twelve or fifteen people outside—I heard the prosecutor accuse Davis of having put his hand into his pocket—Davis was arguing with him—the prosecutor said, "You have put your hands into my pocket," and he began to spar up to Davis—they got to high words, and then Davis apologised, and the police came on the spot, and I left—the prisoners were about half drunk—I did not see Davis give the prosecutor a black eye—I went to the station and told the inspector what I saw of the occurrence—I attended the Court next morning, and gave evidence to the effect I have now done—the police have known my name and address since then, and have had every opportunity of making inquiry about me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was talking to people for the three and a half hours I was in the beer-house—I was mostly having teetotal drink, ginger ale—I was sober when I left—the prosecutor was drunk, and the prisoners about half drunk—the prosecutor could walk, but not steadily—they all came out of the house together—the prosecutor went to the end of the pavement—the prisoners went the opposite way to what I did—the prosecutor was not on the ground when the constable came up—I was there then—three other people were fighting, and several people were there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Three or four people were within a few yards of the prosecutor—if the constable says the disturbance was forty yards away he is not correct—if the prosecutor says twelve yards he is correct.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the Jury.</hi> I did not know the prosecutor's name before this; I had spoken to him previously about politics and other matters—he uses this beer-house—a night or two before he offered me watches in the house, and he said he was taken up and taken to the station at Deptford for offering a pawn-ticket in a public-house—I have seen him frequenting public-houses.</p>

On Sunday night, 18th November, at half-past twelve, I was on duty in Fish Street Hill; very few people were about—a man passed and attracted my suspicion, and I tried the doors—I found the side door of the Monument Tavern unfastened—it is approached by three steps from the pavement; it was very dark there,</p>

               <p>there was a shadow right across the door—I spoke to a police sergeant, and watched the door, and immediately I saw the two prisoners appear at the step of the door just by the entrance—I and the sergeant followed them a short distance; no one else was about then—we went up to them, brought them back to the tavern, and roused the house, and Mr. Preston came down—we found the office had been robbed—I said to the prisoners, "Where do you come from?"—Edwards said, "I come from Soho way"—Rogers said, "I have been to a funeral, and I have just met him at the corner of Fenchurch Street"—I turned out their pockets; Edwards had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a half-crown, three sixpences, a shilling and a foreign coin, and one cigar—I asked him where he got the coppers from—he said, "I got them by gambling"—I said, "Were you gambling with cards, or what?"—he said, "No, tossing in the street"—I found nothing on Rogers relating to the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to George Taylor, who trades as A. and G. Taylor, photographers—the prisoner became their canvasser and collector for the Thames Valley district at the end of March—his duty was to canvass for orders for people to have their photographs taken at our place, and to collect the money weekly—he had previously travelled in the same district for drapery on his own account—our system is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and when half is paid we allow a sitting, but do not deliver the photograph till the whole amount is paid up—he had a book of forms like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each set of three has a distinct number; one receipt is given to the customer, the other is the order which is sent to us, and the inner counterfoil he had for his own information—we paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on each good 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. order, and 10 per cent. on the cash he collected—for 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders he had 15 per cent., and 10 per cent. for collection—he sent us orders up</p>

               <p>to the end of August—Mr. Lee made a discovery, and went down, and a few days after that the prisoner was dismissed—he had up to that time sent out 575 forms—he accounted to me the first week for 13 orders, and afterwards to Mr. Lee—one was a 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and all the others 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders—Lupton, of the Waterman's Arms, Richmond, was the 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. order, on which he represented that Mr. Lupton had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the same time he presented an order of Mrs. Mala, of Tapestry House, Mortlake, and represented that she had paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and when it was wholly collected he would be entitled to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I believed the other orders were genuine, and paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each on them on 21st July—here is a 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. order from Mr. Brown, of 6, Carlton Street Road, Richmond, and another order from Mr. Warren, of 4, Cambridge Park Mews, Richmond, and another from Mr. Burk, care of Mr. Bullock, Railway Hotel, Twickenham—there are four orders all purporting to be Warner's, and two from Mr. and Mrs. Batt, of Heath field Road, Twickenham; one from James Cross, 6, Rosedale Cottages, Richmond; four from George Conquest, 5, High Street, Handcroft—there are several orders in the same name, because if I had a family and wanted my daughters photographed, I should give them in their own names—here are three orders in the name of F. Barr, Catherine Road, Twickenham; and three for another Barr, of Twickenham; two for Braithwaite, 10, Charlotte Road, Twickenham; eight for Margaret Spanwich, of Mortlake; two from James Potter, of Mortlake, and two for James Slater, Potter's Cottages, Mortlake, all in the prisoner's writing—he handed them to us—about fifty of them were genuine—on 11th August here are two orders purporting to be Blay's, a baker of Twickenham, and six in different names to the care of Blay; two to George Driver, Slater's Gardens, Twickenham; and eleven others at George Driver's address—I have eight orders to the care of Cheap, and two to Cheap himself—here is one order to J. Marlow, and two to Mrs. Marlow, of Tapestry House, Mortlake—one is for Bright, to the care of Blay, and a collecting-card was sent for that—when I got the orders I gave a collecting-card, which Ginger initialed when he took the money, and on this card he has accounted for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he got the value of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. order, either in money or account—when he came on Saturday I handed him over to Mr. Lee, after which I scrutinised the account, but not always, and allowed him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each new order, and in that way he has obtained from me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each of the orders proved—I wondered to see so many orders in the name of Blay—he said Blay was a baker, and allowed him to go round in his cart, and introduced him to his customers, and after that the collecting-cards were sent to Blay's address; that was considered a good idea of his, and I advised him to keep it up, as he was known in the neighbourhood, and could do that with many of the tradesmen—when he was putting his own address for the cards to be sent to, he said that they were his own friends, or persons who did not like a collector to call, who were to pay at his house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At least £1,663 of the debts set out are disputed by Mrs. Levy—£1,363 is on the promissory notes, and, in addition to that, there is £300 alleged to be due to Mrs. Armedix; that is disputed altogether—the total amount of trade debts, apart from these liabilities, is £149, out of which Cottee appears as a creditor for £30 for money lent, and Mr. Sear as a creditor for £84; he is a partner of the trustee—Mr. Buck is a creditor for £20; Sear's debt is for goods released; I cannot tell how that was contracted—the two defendants were examined on 11th July—the bankrupt passed her public examination on 26th July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, of 28, Pentonville Road—in 1887 I was in the service of Louis Levy at 265, Pentonville Road—Miss Levy, the defendant, succeeded to the business in 1887, I believe; it was a clothing and outfitting business; they dealt in ready-made suits of clothes—there was another business carried on by Louis Levy in Upper East Smithfield—when Miss Levy succeeded to the business I entered their employment—before that she managed the business for Louis—Cottee was in their employ as a cutter—Solomon Levy was engaged in the business at East Smithfield, and a boy named Evans—I remember a writ being served on Miss Levy—she said she should not pay a penny of it—on Saturday, 22nd April, Cottee asked me to go to Pentonville Road on the Sunday—I did not go there as a rule on Sunday, but I arrived there at nine—the shop was not open—Cottee let me in—Miss Levy was there during the day—I had my breakfast—I was in the cutting-room with Cottee some time at the back part of the shop—he told me to pack up goods—he took a piece of chalk and marked a lot of them—some were</p>

               <p>in the cutting-room and some in the shop—I had to carefully brush them and pack them—while I was doing so I saw both Cottee and Miss Levy—I packed up ready-made suits and all the best black morning coats and waistcoats and overcoats—they made five parcels; it took me all day to do it, from nine till nine—I packed them in brown paper—the value of them was about £100—Cottee told me to get a four-wheeled cab and take the things to his mother's—I did so—I put the five parcels I had packed in the cab roughly, and they filled it—I rode on the box to 28, Pentonville Road, where I live with Mrs. Young; I went up to my room—a young man and young woman were sitting there, the woman was a servant of Miss Levy's—we then went to 15, Greenwood Street, Mile End, where Mrs. Cottee, the prisoner's mother, lived—Miss Levy heard Cottee tell me to take them there—we got there about 9.30—it is a private house—I saw Mrs. Cottee—I took the goods out of the cab to the first floor back, and then went back home—I paid the cabman; Miss Levy gave me the money—next day I saw Cottee at the shop, he asked me if it was all right last night, I said, "Yes"—he said, "Hold your noise, and take no notice"—I had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages from Miss Levy, and my board; I had to find my own lodging—a few days after this, the goods which I had taken to Mrs. Cottee's were removed to Johnson's, "The Little Wonder"—Cottee sent me there; it is a chandler's shop—Cottee was with me—he slept at King's Cross that night—I went with him one night and slept at Mrs. Cottee's, and next day I removed the things from Johnson's—I went to the Sovereign Hotel, Mile End, that night with Cottee—he hired Godfrey, a cabman, and told him to be round at Greenwood Street at seven next morning—he did not get there till about eight—I was there when he arrived, but Cottee was not—the goods had then been removed to Johnson's—I directed the cabman to go to Johnson's; he drove there, I walked—I went up stairs, fetched the things, and filled the cab—I had directions to go to Cottee's, and to get off the cab on the hill before I got to the shop—Johnson went in the cab with the packages—I got off the cab on Pentonville Hill—the cab went to the shop, and I walked up and found Cottee and Johnson unloading it; that was about three weeks after the things were first taken away—the goods were taken to the first floor—Cottee went up and down, and used them as he wanted them—I do not know whether he had bought the business at that time—at the end of June Cottee asked me if I should like a holiday—I said, "Yes," and I went to Ipswich, where my home is—during that time I received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages—I was there not quite five weeks; all that time my room at Mrs. Young's was going on—no claim has been made upon me for that; the rent has been paid by somebody—prior to April it had never been paid by anybody but myself—I came back from Ipswich on the Wednesday before the August Bank Holiday—I wrote this letter to Miss Levy at 265, Pentonville Road. (<hi rend="italic">This requested Miss Levy to send him his last week's money, and a week for notice; it was signed "Walter</hi> ")—my name is not Walter, but they used to call me Walter—I wrote that letter on the Friday or Saturday before Bank Holiday—I only wrote that one letter to her—this is the envelope (<hi rend="italic">This was stamped</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th August.</hi>)—I got no answer, and on Saturday night I called—Winton, the doorsman, sent me my wages while I was at Ipswich—on my return from Ipswich I went to Miss Levy, and she said, "Keep yourself quiet; not that you can do me any harm"—she also told</p>

               <p>me to get a place for a week or two, if I could, because things were not exactly settled, and she would write and let me know when to come back—I saw Cottee the same night—one of Mr. Buck's men was there; he is a creditor—I went away, and later on in the same week I saw Cottee at the shop door—he said, "Get it"—I did not get my wages—before I went to Ipswich Cottee said to me, in the cutting-room, "If you get asked about our business you must swear white is black, and black is white," and he told me not to say anything about the removal of the goods, but if I was asked, to say they were his boxes—I know Peacock, a clothier in Commercial Road—I was sent there sometimes—Cottee sent me there on 14th April to fetch either the clothing or the money; I fetched six parcels of clothing; they formed part of the goods which were afterwards removed to Mrs. Cottee's—they were taken upstairs and re-packed, and some more put with them, and they were taken away in a cab by Cottee and Miss Levy—that was before 22nd April—on that day I saw the goods in the back room—they were removed to Johnson's with the other goods, and they were all taken back to Pentonville Road—when I came back from Ipswich the name of Cottee was on the door as the proprietor of the business—Mrs. Young has a little boy named John—I gave a statement to Mr. Hasluck before I gave my evidence at the Police-court—I have seen Cottee in the possession of money—he showed me about £50 one morning, which he had in a bag—that was before the 22nd April—he said, "That is the money I am going to buy the business with"—I said he was lucky—he said he could not see any luck attached to it; it was Miss Levy's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never had any feeling towards Cottee except one of regard—I have always liked him—I have been angry with him for the way in which he treated me—he sometimes treated me badly—when I came from Ipswich he was the master of the place—I did not ask him to continue me as servant—I asked him for my wages, and he refused to pay me, and sent for a policeman—he asked me to walk out, and I did—I was not particularly angry with him for that; several things made me angry when I was working with him—he used to treat me shabbily sometimes—he has not threatened to discharge me, or to get me discharged for drunkenness, nor has he complained about drunkenness—I have never been drunk when there—I did get drunk through him; but there was no complaint—that did not make me bear any ill-feeling towards him—William Flowers went with me in the cab—I have seen him since—I did not tell him that I would not mind doing six months if I could get Cottee locked up—he is a friend of mine—I have had no quarrel with him since this—I was in Louis Levy's service, and his sister's—I heard that he was in difficulties, and knew that she was going to have the business; there were executions on the premises—I did not know that Messrs. Lewis and Lewis were her solicitors—after she took over the business, Louis Levy never came there; I swear that—I have seen him about King's Cross, over against the bank—he did not come there every day; I very rarely saw him—I never heard a disturbance between him and his sister—I never heard of his coming there and asking her to pay him money; I know they were not good friends, because I heard her say so—I do not do anything now—I have seen Louis Levy lately—I have not been in constant communication with him from the moment this charge was first made—I have not been in any employment since I left Pentonville Road—my landlady, Mrs. Young, has been keeping me; Louis</p>

               <p>Levy has not given me any assistance—I have seen him, and talked to him—I have not been with him frequently—I have more than once; it may be two or three times—I have not been with him trying to get up evidence against the prisoner—I knew Charles Morris; he was stock keeper and salesman—he knew all about the premises—I have seen him with Louis Levy—I stood outside, and did not hear what they said—I did not know that I was going there to see whether Morris would give evidence—I went with Louis Levy to help to find a cabman; he said he wanted me to identify him for this case—I did not ask Winton before I went to Ipswich to send me money—I had not borrowed money of him before I left—I did not ask him to pay the rent of my lodging, or ask him for money, promising to pay him back when I got a situation—I had been to the premises before on a Sunday—Miss Levy is a Jewess; Cottee is not a Jew—I had never before assisted Cottee the cutting-room on a Sunday, I helped him to do a bit of carpentering one Sunday—I got there about nine on this Sunday morning; he let me in; Ellen Pearson did not; I swear she did not—it was not between ten and eleven before I arrived—I had breakfast in the kitchen after I arrived—I had not been there earlier in the morning for breakfast—I did not tell Ellen Pearson that I was going to pack Cottee's things out of the way of the whitewashers who were expected to come next day—I went to the Bell public-house in the middle of the day—I did not remain away many minutes; not till three o'clock—I was not the worse for drink when I got back—I had dinner in the kitchen—I did not lie down there—I told Pearson that I was going to take some goods from the shop, and offered to take her with me, and I called for her at my lodging at a few minutes past nine—I will swear it was not seven—it is not the fact that some parcels were put outside the cab when we went away; they completely filled the cab—when I got to my lodgings I repacked them, and that enabled me and two others to get in—I piled them to the top of the cab inside, and the cabman told me to be careful of his windows—we could not all three sit, there was not room; we did not stand, we squeezed—Flowers was there, and he was squeezing too—none of us were sitting; we all three stood on the bottom of the cab, and the parcels were all round us—I did not say anything at the Police-court at the first hearing about any person riding inside the cab—I said, "I sat outside with the driver, the cab being full, and we drove to Cottee's mother's house," I sat inside as far as my lodging—when I delivered the parcels, I did not say anything about the whitewashers coming; they were not coming; I never saw them, and I never heard of their coming after the things were removed—they had been there before, but had not finished—I did not know that they were expected back—I said at the Police-court, "Cottee did not tell me to say that the whitewashers were coming next day; they were Barr's workmen; I did not remark any whitewashers at the shop next day, Monday; I will not swear there were not whitewashers there on Tuesday"—Cottee had a number of cutter's patterns belonging to him; he resided on the premises, and had his things there; he worked in the cutting-room—when I took the things to Johnson's, Cottee was there—I did not tell Johnson at any time that the parcels were Cottee's wardrobe—since the prisoners were committed, I did not get drunk, and go to the premises and make a disturbance—I was brought up at the Police-court for making a disturbance, but I was</p>

               <p>quite sober—Cottee was standing on the path as I went by, and he came behind me and struck me unawares, and two policemen took me, and the Magistrate fined me for being drunk—my landlady paid the fine; Louis Levy did not; he was in Court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never been examined in this case before—the articles were furniture and ornaments, some loosely packed in a room upstairs, and some scattered in different rooms—I believe Cottee was living there; his name was up on the shop.</p>

               <p>she was not present when Solomon Levy was examined, it is not allowed—she puts the date down as March this year—there is no statement of the sale to Solomon Levy; she ought to have put it into the cash account—until her examination I did not know that stock had been sold to Valentine for over £200, but I had my suspicions; I know it now—I heard Cottee examined—no stock or fixtures at Upper East Smith<lb/>field was delivered over to the Official Receiver—from first to last, except what is disclosed on the Official Receiver's statement of affairs, nothing was disclosed by the bankrupt—there was no disclosure of any furniture other than that valued by Mr. Biner—I have never had any account of the stock removed to Mrs. Cottee's, Miss Levy denied that it had been removed—the assets realised £240—I know that a number of executions were put in on the Pentonville property, just subsequent to the sale at Bed<lb/>ford Place, on March 7th, 1888; they amounted to about £680—there is an affidavit; she had to swear to her statement—Louis Levy would have to prove for the amount of his debt, but he has made no proof at all—Mrs. louis Levy has proved for £1,344 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is within £19 of the amount of Louis Levy's and her own debt together—that is the reason no claim was put in by him—I have not allowed him to interfere with my duties; on the contrary, I have kept myself aloof from him, knowing the question might be raised, and I have myself taken the statements of the witnesses—Arthur Cottee proves for £30, and Miss Levy said in her examination that that was money lent to her by Cottee—he describes himself as a tailor's cutter, of 265, Pentonville Road—that was sworn on 23rd May; and on that day John Sears is returned as a creditor for £84; he was my partner, but we dissolved partnership in 1887—I never saw this agreement till yesterday, but it ought to have been handed over to me; we have never had a copy of it, though the other side say that we have; I do not believe my solicitor ever saw it till yesterday—Messrs. Smith, Fawdon, and Low are the solicitors representing the defendant to-day; they never represented Louis Levy—Miss Levy said in her examination that she was introduced to them by Mr. Appleby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Miss Levy swore positively that she knew of no removal of any stock on the Saturday or Sunday prior to her petition—she swore "There were some personal <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> of Cottee's own that had nothing to do with me"—she said that if anything went out it was Cottee's wearing apparel and personal effects—Cottee was examined, and said in my hearing that the things removed on Saturday or Sunday were his own wardrobe—he said, "Everything removed is clothes; there were some paper patterns in an old desk I used to use when I was in India"—Solomon Lewis, the brother of Jane, was included in the charge, but the Magistrate dismissed the case against him—Miss Lewis said. in her examination that the whole of the stock in Smithfield was sold to Solomon Levy soon after the transfer from Louis Levy to her—I gather from her statement that there was a dispute between Solomon Levy and her—an action was brought by Louis Levy's wife against her on an agreement to indemnify her—the Bankruptcy Court used to stay an action against a bankrupt, but it does not now, and I don't know whether it has gone on—although Louis Levy did not actually prove, Mrs. Levy has proved for £1,300, but there is more than that; that is the amount she paid on the failure of Jane Levy—these composition bills were given to pay Louis Levy's debts, and the money from the furniture of Bedford</p>

               <p>Place was applied to paying out the executions put in at Pentonville, but I don't know that the furniture was sold for that purpose—the whole of Miss Levy's liabilities were in respect of Louis Levy's debts, which she took over—she has never alleged to me that the arrangement was not carried out between them, but she said so in the statement of affairs—Mr. Sears is the only creditor of any amount on sheet A; his debt, £84, was for professional charges as an accountant in investigating Louis Levy's affairs; I have no doubt that he has been actively assisting in this prosecution, but I don't believe he has served subpoenas on all the witnesses—I have rejected Cottee's offer for £80, as it has been before the Judge, whose decision is not yet public.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no motive on one side or the other; I have been ordered by the Court to prosecute, and the Treasury have taken it up—I am the nominal prosecutor—Louis Levy being in difficulties, and making the composition, he entered into a writing to pay the composition which was £1,800—after money had been paid to get Mrs. Levy free, she took an assignment of her brother's effects in full, and became liable for £800 or £900—if she had not received enough, instead of being a creditor for £1,300 she would have been a creditor for nothing or a debtor; she would have a claim against her brother—the composition was 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound for about £5,000, in instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the first instalment was paid without Miss Levy's intervention—she signed her name as well as the wife to part of the composition; the two ladies were not security for the whole, only for £900—being jointly liable, instead of Mrs. Louis Levy having to pay her half and the other her half, the whole of the assets were assigned to her, and she undertook the full liability, and if she had performed her part there would have been no bankruptcy—£1,300 is due to Mrs. Louis Levy.

                  </hi>. I am traveller to Messrs. Lyons and Co., of Liverpool and London—I am the brother of Jane and Louis Levy—up to about five years ago I resided with them at Upper East Smithfield, where Louis Levy carried on business as a clothier—about that time he took a house at 39, Bedford Place, Russell Square—Jane Levy really was proprietress; she furnished it—we all three lived. there, and the business was carried on at Upper East Smithfield—about the middle of 1886 a shop was taken at 265, Pentonville Road—I went there in March, 1887—in July, 1887, Cottee was engaged as cutter by Louis Levy; I was present at the time—he brought to Bedford Place proper references from London and country people, and from India—he brought a large quantity of paper patterns to Pentonville Road—Louis had been in difficulties for many years—in January, 1887, there was a meeting of his creditors—Lewis and Lewis, of Ely Place, were his solicitors—a composition was agreed to—after that some executions were put in at Pentonville Road and Upper East Smithfield; and there had been several before that—shortly after, an arrangement was made, by which Jane Levy took over his liabilities; she went to live at Pentonville Road—at the sale of the furniture at Bedford Place Jane Levy bought £169 worth; I was there the second day of the sale—I bid for two lots for her—I cleared that furniture; I saw it packed in the van, and it was taken direct to Pentonville Road—after that I and Jane Levy were on very bad terms with Louis—before she took over the liabilities the bad terms began, because he seemed dissatisfied and was creating disturbances whenever he could; there was a dispute of some kind, I believe as to the terms on which the liabilities were taken over—after Jane Levy went to Pentonville Road Louis came there often, walking by the door, standing about and looking in and trying to taunt them, one way and another, in order to create, some disturbance, it seemed to me—I have seen lads taking his part, and I thought there was going to be a breach of the peace—he sent for me once, and I went out, he had a message; on another occasion I went over to him he began to create a disturbance, the policeman moved him on—Cottee came to live in the house about August or September, 1887, I think; after I had been attacked by rheumatism—on the Sunday before Jane Levy filed her petition some whitewashes had stripped the walls, and were coming on the Monday to water wash and whitewash—on the Saturday before I was away all day, but I came in at night; I passed through the shop and saw, generally, the stock there—I was there again on the Monday—there was no appreciable alteration in the appearance of the stock on Monday morning—I think if £10 worth had been removed I must have noticed it; I have been accustomed to stock all my life; there was no such alteration that I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188812100048"/>
               <p>see—I was there on Sunday, I was very bad with rheumatic gout all day, and was on the sofa in the first floor back from the time I got up, I did not see Mills all day—I bought the stock at East Smithfield and paid £80 for it; I had sold a pair of trousers the day before for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave Jane Levy 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and £80—of the stock I sold two or three small lots to Mr. Valentine first, and then cleared them out to him; it was in frightful condition, moth-eaten, mildewed, rotten, damp, as bad as could be—I had hard work pressing it, getting it into condition, and throwing some of it out—I was about a month getting it into condition—Evans came to help me—if I had not done what I did no doubt I should not have got half what I did for the stock—£100 worth of best black coats and overcoats, if packed up, would fill a good-sized cart I should think, a large-sized cart; if they were second-class goods they would have filled a van—I am certain that £100 worth of first-class goods could not have been removed without my knowledge.</p>

               <p>nominally for Mr. Cottee; the conditions of sale were that the lease should be sold, and that the purchaser was entitled to the stock and fixtures; the valuation was fixed by the Court; the Official Receiver promised me I should have the first offer—Cottee asked me to buy them for him, and I did so, with his money—he had bought the lease, and he was in the Official Receiver's employ and received salary—I cannot say if Cottee has got a banking account—I don't know out of what bank the money came—I never had a banking account, nor had either of the defendants, but Louis Levy had—I have only been traveller for Mr. Lyon a few weeks; I was not in his service when I bought nominally—I do not know what Cottee paid my sister a week—from the beginning of May till I was taken into custody I was sleeping at Pentonville Road, and Cottee also, and my sister—I cannot tell when Buck, the gas-fitter, was there; I was away all day—no whitewashing is done yet, the paper is pulled off the walls, and so it remains to the present day—I paid the £80 in cash, I had had it nursed up for some time—there might have been gold and notes; it had been gradually accumulating; it might have been part of my salary at Mr. Sears—I do not know what my sister did with the £80; I got no receipt for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I took the whole thing as it stood—before the transfer of the business by Louis Levy, my sister had become jointly liable on the promissory notes, long before she had any stock transferred to her; as far as I know she had no consideration for that—he had money from me all through; the whole of what was left me by my father—my father was bankrupt, and I proved for £700-under his estate, and my brother Louis has had every penny of it, and has shown his gratitude by giving me in custody, and I was eight weeks before the Magistrate and eleven days in Holloway Gaol—they opposed my being let out on bail, that was repeated on every occasion—they tried to get me locked up.</p>

I live at 15, Greenwood Street, Mile End, with my mother—I am Cottee's sister—I am employed at the London Hospital—on Sunday evening Mills brought five parcels of the house—he told me what they were—he gave them to Mr. Peck at the door of the house; Mr. Peck deposited them in the passage outside the parlour door—I and my mother occupy three rooms, parlour, kitchen, and upstairs bedroom; they are all very small rooms; you can touch the walls if you stand in the centre—the parlour is a little larger—the parcels remained in the passage till next morning; a few days after they were removed to Johnson's, because they were in my mother's way—I complained of there being in the way chiefly—my brother has had a considerable amount of patterns and other things a great many years—he has been in very good situations, and had a splendid appointment in India.</p>

Cavender, is marked "Effects not cleared;" that was subsequently paid—the account was closed by our manager's request, because it was unsatisfactory—I do not know that on the day the account was closed a detective was in and out of the bank, trying to get the manager to close the account, or that Mr. Ring, who has an account there, brought influence to bear on the manager to close it—I cannot say that the last four cheques were given after the account was closed—it is customary for a person to return all unused cheques to the bank when his account is closed—we should not close the account unless that were done—I don't know if you handed all your unused cheques to the manager when the account was closed—on the day the account was closed you drew out £3 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-of the four returned on that day one is Machin £1, and another Gromont £2 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was enough with a few shillings to pay those two.</p>

On 31st October Strong came to the station and made a complaint, and on 2nd November a warrant was issued for the prisoner's arrest for obtaining furniture by means of a false cheque—on 3rd November I went with Inspector Reed to 6, Bethnal Green Road—we found the prisoner there, and read the warrant to him—he said, "That man Strong take a warrant for me?"—I said, "Yes, for obtaining two suites of furniture on the dates, and cheques were given which have not been paid"—he said, "One of the cheques has been paid; Fox had the money for that; I only had one suite"—French came in and Fox afterwards—Reed had a conversation with them in the prisoner's presence.</p>

Adams" was up there—I said to French, "What are you doing here?" he was very ill; we had to send for brandy for him—I said to Fox, "Are you mixed up in this?"—he said, "I came for some money"—I left them there while I went to the station with the prisoner, and when I came back Fox was gone, French remained there—Fox heard the charge against the prisoner—he did not say anything to Strong—the prisoner said nothing to Fox as to Strong—the police-station is 400 or 500 yards away—here are the occurrence books of the station for October and November—there is no entry in them of the prisoner having been robbed or his premises being broken open, or anything taken from them—he has never made any complaint of any outrage of that sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 74, Victoria Dock Road, Canning Town—on Saturday, 1st December, about 11. 15, I was in the Barking Road, and saw a disturbance between a man, a woman, and two young fellows—I crossed to see what it was, and stood looking at the row, and the prisoner walked up to me and took my watch and chain from my pocket—I caught hold of him—he put his hands behind him—I put my arms round him and my hands behind him, and tried to get the watch—he had several <hi rend="italic">pals,</hi> one of whom took the watch—I broke three pieces of the chain from his hand—they tried to get him away, and one of them hit me very severely on my ear—he tried to get away; one of his mates threw my arm from his neck, and he ran across the road—I caught him again—I did not lose sight of him from the time he took the watch till a constable took, him—during the disturbance Pearson came up and laid his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, and one of his mates hit Pearson on the head and knocked him down—my watch and chain were worth £2—I have not seen the watch since—I knew the prisoner before by seeing him about Canning Town—the constable picked up these bits of my chain on Monday morning:—these two other bits I broke from his hand during the struggle—the chain is metal, the seal is gold, and the watch an English lever—it happened in front of a lamp—my hands were round him, and his face towards me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine driver, and live at 250, Rotherhithe Street—on the night of 23rd October I was at my own door and saw a woman screaming—I did not know who she was at the time, I now know it was Mrs. Spicer—her husband was near her—I went to the Bull and Half Moon for assistance, that is 25 or 30 yards from my house—Cheal, Perkins, and two other men came out—the four prisoners were surrounding Mr. and Mrs. Spicer, they had knives in their right hands, the blade was something like 5 or 6 inches long—I had not done anything to them before I saw the knives—they started to use the knives, and of course I used my fists—Sarrabe drew his knife and made a go for me, he attempted to stab me—I struck him, and they ran away—I afterwards found that Cheal had been stabbed—Haynes, Perkins, and I then ran after the prisoners, they ran towards the dock gates, they could not get in, the gate being closed—they ran on and used the knives again, but in the <hi rend="italic">mêlée</hi> I could not say distinctly which, I know that Sarrabé stabbed me in the left shoulder—the police came up at the time, and he was taken in charge—I was prevented from working just on a fortnight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was after I heard the screams that I went to the Bull—I was not in the house when I heard the screams—if Walters says I was there it is not true—when the men could not get in at the dock gates some of them ran back—if I said at the Police-court that they were driven back it must have been a mistake, it was at the side of the dock gates that Sarrabé stabbed me—I had hold of him at the time—I did not strike the prisoners before I saw the knives.</p>
