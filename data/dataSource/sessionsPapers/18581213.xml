                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Hird, an upholsterer, of 143, Tottenham-court-road. On 5th October the female prisoner came to our shop—she drove up in a four-wheeled pony-chaise—she said that she had taken a house, 24, Grosvenor-road, St. John's wood, and she wished some person to come there and look at the house, to see what furniture she required—she said that her name was Chesterfield—next day I went to look at the house to see what furniture Mrs. Chesterfield required—she said, "Now you see what rooms there are, you see what furniture is required?"—I said, "Yes,"—she then said, "What are your terms?" I said, "Cash"—she said it was not convenient to pay the whole of the money, but she would pay half of it down, and the other half on the 1st or 2d of November—she then told me her husband was a retired maltster, and she had an in<lb/>come of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I agreed to those terms, upon having a respectable reference—she said her husband had been a maltster at Wey<lb/>mouth—I then left the house—she came the following day to the shop</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130002"/>
               <p>and selected goods; a mahogany couch, six chairs, a loo table, some carpeting, and a large chimney-glass—the value of the first goods we delivered was 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; altogether they amounted to 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she gave me a reference to a Mr. Scott of 48, Alma-street, Hoxton—I went there the next day and saw the prisoner Elsom, who answered to the name of Scott—I said I had come respecting a reference of Mr. Chesterfield—he said he was a highly respect<lb/>able man, and a retired maltster from Weymouth, and Mrs. Chesterfield had an income of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—at that time Elsom had whiskers—I went back to Mr. Hird, and told him that the reference was satisfactory, and he said, "Send the goods;" and they were sent to 24, Grosvenor-road, St. John's-wood—I went there about a week after—I saw the prisoner Stacey—he opened the door to me—I asked if Mrs. Chesterfield was at home—he said, "No;" she had gone down to Mr. Hird's to select some mote goods; that his name was Chesterfield—I went back to the shop, and found Mrs. Chesterfield there, and I served her myself with the goods—the goods were supplied in two parts; that was the second part—I went again to Grosvenor-road on 2d November, and found that the goods were gone—I found no one in the house—I traced the goods from there to Lyndhurst villa, Lyndhurst-road, Peckham, and I saw Stacey and asked him for the goods—that was the first place I went to after I found the house shut up—Stacey came to the door to me, and he shut the door in my face—the following morning we went over to Lyndhurst-villa, and found the goods were gone from there—they were in the house the previous day; I did not see them there—we followed them to Dane-street, Islington, and I waited there all night—I did not see any one there—I saw Stacey come to the house in the morning, and as soon as he saw me he turned away, he did not go into the house—I went from there to the police-station in Old-street, and identified some goods that the female prisoner had been offering to pledge—on Saturday, 6th, Mr. Hird and I went to 7, Copenhagen-street, with a police-constable, and took the three prisoners into custody—Elsom and Stacey were in bed—I was induced to part with the goods through the reference.</p>

               <p>about a week or a little more after the first one, as near as I can guess—the female prisoner took them away in the chaise—I have told you all the inter<lb/>view I had with Elsom—I did not say anything to him about some of them being to be paid for—I did not tell him that half was to be paid for—there was an arrangement between me and Mrs. Chesterfield that half was to be paid for—the arrangement was, that half was to be paid when the first goods came in, and the other half the 1st or 2d of November—half the money was to be paid on delivery—it was not paid—our carman took the goods.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, L</hi> 9). I know Stacey and the woman—I have known them eleven or twelve years—during the whole of the time I have known him, I never knew him to carry on the business of a maltster—I cannot exactly mention the names I have known him under during that time, but I have known him under several different names, such as Layton, Stacey, Chesterfield, but so many different names I cannot recollect all of them—I have known him to be living in more than one residence during this eleven or twelve years—I cannot say how many besides the one I took him from, at least three—I have for some period lost sight of him—at one time he kept a stationer's shop, and at another time a beer-shop—sometimes he appeared to be pretty well off, sometimes badly off; sometimes he was in a horse and chaise, at other times walking; he had several horses and chaises—on 6th November, I went to 7, Copenhagen-street, Clerkenwell, with Mr. Hird—I there found the three prisoners—the woman was up-stairs, and Elsom was in bed, down-stairs—I took them all three into custody—I told them that Mr. Hird charged them with obtaining goods from him by false pretences—the elder prisoner said, "Oh, it is only a debt"—he said after a bit, if they would let him go he would give the property up; but Mr. Hird said he should do nothing of the sort—at the station, he gave the name of Peter Stacey—I had known him under the name of Stacey previously—previous to taking them into custody I saw the female prisoner at Mr. Hawes, in Old-street, a pawnbroker's—she was attempting to pledge a very large looking-glass, and an easy arm-chair—I took possession of them—the chair is here; but the looking-glass was too big to bring, I was afraid of breaking it—I found some property at Copenhagen-street, which I sub<lb/>sequently conveyed to the police-station—it has been shown by me to the witness Smith, and also to Roberts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

(<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bill was here read, dated 1st September</hi>, 1858, <hi rend="italic">drawn by James Bayliss upon Mr. J. B.

               <p>Hampstead-road—a little after 6 o'clock in the evening of 15th November, I was in Russell-square, and was accosted by the female prisoner and a boy—they both stopped me, and asked me the way to Tottenham-court-road—I directed them, they were a long time before they could understand me—during that time the woman and the boy were close to me—I had before this a purse in my pocket containing 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had felt it in my pocket the moment before they accosted me—they were some minutes close to me—I had my purse in a pocket attached to my dress under the top flounce—it was easily <hi rend="italic">come-at-able</hi>; I generally carry it in my hand, but being early in the evening I was not afraid—the instant they left me, before they had got above a yard, I felt for my purse and found it was gone—at the same time a gentleman came up and asked me if I missed anything—I said I missed my purse—I cannot say whether the female heard what passed—the gentleman and I went after her and overtook her—the boy ran through a turning facing us, and ran away—just after the boy ran away, a man came up and asked what was the matter—I believe the male prisoner to be that man—he asked what was the matter—I told him that I had been robbed, and would he fetch a policeman?—he said, "I think we had better walk on, we shall see one presently," and we walked on—the gentleman, and I, and the prisoners—the prisoners walked very close to each other—I said something to the gentleman, and he said to the male prisoner, "Don't go so close to that woman;" the man directly turned round and took hold of the gentleman's collar, and punched him in the face on each side severely, and got him down on the ground—I turned round to see what they were about—the gentleman said, "Never mind, you keep your eye upon the woman—she began to run—I followed her leaving the man and the gentleman—as I was running after her, some one behind me knocked me down—I could not see whether it was a man or a woman, but I believe it to have been a man—I fell down—I got up again and still ran after the woman, crying out "Stop thief!"—after she had run some distance, a gentleman stopped her—we stood a few minutes together—the prisoner said, "We had better walk on, we shall see a policeman presently"—I said, "No, I have had one run, I wish you to remain here until a policeman comes"—I am sure she is the woman—I never lost sight of her.</p>

On Monday evening, 15th November, about 6 o'clock, I was passing through Russell square on my way to Tottenham-court-road—I was running across the road being in a great hurry—I heard the prosecutrix say to the female prisoner, either that they were going in quite the right direction or coming in the wrong direction—this excited my suspicion, and I stopped—I saw the female prisoner screening a young lad who was in the act of fumbling at the prosecutrix's dress—I cannot say whether he was abstracting the purse from her pocket, but it looked very much like it; at that moment the female and the lad left—I directly asked the proeecutrix if she had lost anything—she felt, and said yes—I turned round—the female prisoner was not more than three or four yards from us at that time—the lad ran on round the square—I held the female—she said, it was not her—I said I knew it was her, and I should detain her—at that moment the male prisoner came up and asked, "What is the matter?"—the proeecutrix told him that she had lost her purse—he advised her to walk towards King-street to a police-station which he said was there, and he would find a policeman—I told him there was no station there, but there was one in George-street—he said, the best way was to walk through Keppel-street—I said, "Very well then, have it your own way and walk on"—I and the prosecutrix walked behind—the prisoners walked towards Montague-street, and when they got to the corner they were very close together—I stepped between them—the male prisoner turned round and asked what I meant, and tried to knock me down—I caught bold of him and he put his foot behind me, threw roe down, and fell upon me—there was another man in company with them, standing close by at the time, and when I was on the ground he came and held me down, saying at the same time, "Don't hurt the man while he is down"—the male prisoner got up and they both ran away—I ran after them up Montague-street—I am positive that the male prisoner is the man that threw me down—the lamps were lighted—it was immediately under a lamp that he turned round and asked me what I meant, and I had a full view of him, and also when I caught hold of him—I am quite positive he is the man—I got up, got my hat, and followed him, and as I was running I found that the other party who had had hold of me while the prisoner got away, had knocked down the prosecutrix—I saw him do it—I overtook the female prisoner as she was running, detained her, and gave her in charge.</p>

My father keeps the Bell at Ealing—on 19th November, I saw the prisoner in company with another man—the other man came in and called for half-a-pint of ale—the prisoner did not come in—the price of the ale was 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I served the man, and he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till by itself, and gave him change, and he went out of the house, and joined the prisoner who was about thirty yards off in the yard—they re<lb/>mained together, and went away together—when the man went out of the house, I looked at the shilling, bent it, and gave it to the ostler, he gave it to the policeman—when I first saw the prisoner and the other man, they were about thirty yards from our house.</p>

On Sunday evening, 28th November, about twenty minutes past 7, I was on duty in the Hackney-road, and saw the pri<lb/>soner with a bundle on his back—I asked him what he had there—he said that the things belonged to him—I asked him to show them to me—he said that he would do nothing of the kind, but if I would take him to the station he would give me satisfaction—I told him that there was no occasion to go there if he would tell me or show me what the goods were—he said that he would not, and walked with me some way to the station; he then dropped the bundle and ran off—I went after him, but could not catch him—I saw him on the Tuesday week afterwards at Worship-street police-court, and identified him—I picked up the bundle; it contained two sheets, three counterpanes, one jacket, two bonnets, and one cape—Mrs. Bowers saw them at the station about a quarter of an hour after I had stopped the prisoner.</p>

On Sunday, 28th November, I was at tea in the back-room on the ground floor with my husband and family—I had left the front room about twenty minutes or a quarter to 6; the window was then shut, but not fastened—I returned at twenty minutes after 7, and found the window open and the curtains torn down—I missed from the bed the articles which the policeman has shown me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all mine.</p>

On Sunday morning, 21st November, I was in Salisbury-street, and heard a rattle springing and the cry of "Stop thief"—I saw Welch running down Salisbury-street and two others after him—I could not see the others plainly so as to identify them—Welch went down Salisbury-street, into Devonshire-street, into William-street, through a passage into 14, George-street—he went up-stairs and I had to wait there to get a lamp—I went up-stairs and could not find him at first—I went into the back room and found him in bed with all his clothes on—I said, "Come out of there"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "What did you run away for?"—he said, "Because the policeman ran after us; I am sorry I have run away now"—I took him to the station—I saw the other two but could not recognise them—I did not see them in 14, George-street—I do not know whether these two are those who were with him—I believe that Hoare and Kimpton were the two because they are about the size—I knew them before—the two that I saw where such as they might have been.</p>

               <p>before; it was almost the last day of my tenure of Mr. Meyer's position—he returned on Monday, 25th, and this occurred about Saturday, the 23d, or a few days before—on that day Mr. Guernsey called upon me, and we conversed together as usual, in a general way—I left the room for a few minutes, to go to the binder—I believe Mr. Guernsey was near the fire when I left—I was absent about four or five minutes—I believe I left to go to the binder—when I returned, Mr. Guernsey was near the desk where these despatches were lying; he was moving away from the table—as I came into the room he remarked to me, "I am not prying into your secrets"—he said that, as he was moving away from the table—I paid that I did not for a moment suppose that he was—he had been standing near the fire-place when I left the room-after saying this, he moved partly towards the window, and then towards the fire-place again—he remained some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that—we dined together that day, the 23d October, or whatever day it was—I left the office on 30th October—I was absent fifteen days—my leave was for a fortnight, Sunday supervened; I should correct myself, I was at the office again on 15th November—I received a note from Mr. Meyer on Saturday, the 13th, desiring me to come and speak with him about these despatches, and although I did not remain in the office all that day, I was there for a few hours; but I attended regularly on the 15th—I returned permenantly on the 15th—Mr. Guernsey called upon me in the middle part of the day, on the 15to, about 1 or 2 o'clock—I remember his conversation with me had regard to a letter that he had received from the War Department, which was rather of a favourable character, in answer to his application—he then spoke of the hope of his being gazetted as paymaster, and then drew from his pocket some pamphlet on South American matters, and a portrait of General Lopez—after talking on this subject, I changed the conversation to another subject—I was very anxious to do so—I had at that time learnt that these two despatches had been published in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>—they had been published on the 12th, three days before the day of which I am speaking, and I was in great anxiety about it—it was that which led me to change the conver<lb/>sation from the rambling talk about General Lopez and others, to the subject of the despatches—I said to Mr. Guernsey that he must excuse me, that I must leave him; that I was in great trouble and anxiety about the publication of these despatches, and I looked him in the face and said, that the man that could have done such a thing must have been a d—d scoundrel—he said, "He must, indeed, be a dirty blackguard"—and he said to me, "It might cost you your situation"—I had not, down to that moment, said anything whatever to him, or made any communication to him at all, which could have given him to understand that I had had charge of those documents or was any more connected with them than any of the other persons in the Colonial Office.</p>

               <p>pressed me earnestly not to give any further information, and I said I would not, if it was possible to help it—I did withhold his name and all the information I could, until I was summoned before the magistrate—I cut the address off the envelope because I had refused the name, and I thought that giving up the handwriting would be giving up the name.</p>

I am one of the detective department of the Metropolitan police—I was desired to endeavour to apprehend the prisoner—I saw him on the night of 26th November in Great Russell-street, coming out of a shop—I went up to him and said, "I believe your name is Wellington Guernsey," he said, "Yes"—I told him I was a police-officer and I held a warrant for his apprehension, and if he would go with me to the station-house which was close by, I would read the warrant to him, it being dark at the time—on the way to the station he said he should like to know the charge—I then told him he was charged with stealing some printed despatches from the Colonial Office, forwarded by Sir John Young—after a few seconds he said, "They have made a mistake—they have gone the wrong way to work—they should have written to me"—we then proceeded to the station-house—the warrant was there read—when I was reading that part of it that related to the month of October, he said, "I know nothing about it, I can prove I was in Dublin at the time"—he said that he had not been to the Colonial Office for some time—he afterwards recollected himself and said, "Yes, once"—I have the warrant here—the prisoner is described in it as "Wellington Guernsey"—when the Serjeant was taking the charge at the King-street station, he asked him his name—his back was towards the serjeaut at the time, and I answered for him, and said, "Colonel Guernsey"—he said, "No"—I said, "Then Major Guernsey"—he said, "No" that he never belonged to the army in his life.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no cast to go to the Jury; assuming that the prisoner had taken the despatch in question from the Colonial Office, he contended that he had not taken it in the sense of stealing it; not animus furandi, or lucri causa, but that he had taken it merely for the purpose of having it published in a newspaper; he very much doubted whether it was even a trespass, but it was certainly not a felony; the essence of stealing was fraud, not a mere wrongful act; but there must be a fraudulent purpose of appro<lb/>priating the property of another to the use of the taker in a fraudulent sense, he referred to the cases of Reg. v. Godfrey</hi>, 8 <hi rend="italic">Carrington and Payne, p.</hi> 563; <hi rend="italic">Reg. v. Holloway, I Denison's Crown Cases</hi>, 370; <hi rend="italic">Rex. v.

Strange</hi>, 18 <hi rend="italic">Law Journal</hi>, 120; <hi rend="italic">and upon the authority of those cases, he contended that this amounted simply to a wrongful taking, such as the taking the book of another person to use without his authority, and omitting to return it; and that to hold it to be a stealing would be carrying the law of larceny to an extent hitherto unknown.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">on the same side</hi>) <hi rend="italic">supported the objection—the fallacy on the part of the Prosecution was this, they confused the paper itself with the matter that was impressed upon it, and the real offence which the prisoner had committed, if it was any offence, was not the taking of </hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">the paper, but the despatch which was impressed upon the paper; his object merely was to have the matter published; as to what became of the paper itself, he was careless—if a person took a booh from the table of another without the owner's consent, intending to copy a portion, and return the book, that would be no larceny, and the mere omission to return it would not make it a larceny; the animus at the time of the taking was the important matter—see Rex. v. Trump, 1 Car. and Payne</hi>, 658; <hi rend="italic">and he contended that if it was clear that the intention was not to steal the paper, but only the matter impressed upon it, that could not be the subject of larceny, and there would be no case for the Jury.</hi>

I took him in custody for wilful damage—I asked him to come along with me to the station—he said he wished to have his cap, and the female took the candle to look for his cap, but could not find it—I told him to go along with me, and they would find his cap, and let him have it—he did not attempt to come with me, and I took hold of him on the left arm with my right hand—I said, "You had better come quietly; it will be all the better for you"—the female that was with him then assaulted me—he did not move his feet, and I took hold of him behind with both hands—I wished him to go quietly, and almost immediately, I felt something in my right thigh, and I saw his right hand there—he took it away from my right thigh and turned round to me, and I felt I was also stabbed in my left leg just below my knee—the prisoner stabbed me; I saw him draw his hand from my leg with the knife in his hand—I seized his wrist, and he had the knife in his hand, and he attempted to make a third stab at me—the female was violent during the whole time, and finding that I could not take the prisoner by myself, I got down stairs and sprung my rattle in the street—I then saw the prisoner on the roof of the house—two officers came to my assistance</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James William Benson, a jeweller in Cornhill. On the 10th December, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop—he asked me to show him some scarf pins—I closed the shop door, and produced from the window some pins on a tray—I put them on the counter—I turned to close the window, and when I turned round again the prisoner had two pins in his fingers, and three pins were on the counter off the tray—there were no pins lying on the counter before—the prisoner asked the price of several of the pins, and having done that he produced from his pocket a common seal stamp, something like brass; it had a sort of ivory handle—he asked me what I could make him three like that for, with three letters on each—I told him the price—he said he thought it was rather high—I said probably I might be able to do them for a little less—he said, "However, what is the price of this pin?" pointing to one in the tray—I told him, and he said it was a light common pin—after that he picked up one of those he had had in his fingers previously, and said it was the prettiest one of all—he asked the price, and I told him 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was rather more than he thought of going to, and he asked if I had one with red stones in it instead of blue ones—I told him "No," and I then offered to take 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that one he had—he said, "I am rather short of cash, I will call to-morrow and buy the pin"—I missed one of the pins off the counter—I stepped round to the front of the counter, and looked on the counter and on the floor to see if the pin might have dropped—I then said, "I miss a pin"—the prisoner said, "I have not got it"—he threw off his coat and asked me to search him, and he asked me to send for a policeman and have him searched—I said I should do so, and I said I must have the pin found before he left the shop—I knocked on the floor for assistance; and as the man was coming up from the back of the shop the prisoner, who had got one hand against the wrist of his other hand, made a motion of his hand towards the counter, and the pin fell on the counter—I did not see the pin in his hand, but I distinctly saw it fall on the counter from the direction of his hand—I said, "You thief," and I told the man to fetch a policeman; and as he was passing through the door the prisoner said, "Pray let me go, consider my character, I will give you half a sovereign to let me go"—the policeman came, and I gave him into custody—I gave the policeman the pin off the counter—the prisoner's coat was then on the chair; it was a body coat—the pin that I heard drop was not on the counter at all when the prisoner took off his coat—he took off his coat after I said I missed the pin—it was worth 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was a stranger to me.</p>

Castle and Co—he said, It is not due this week, I will pay it next week—I said, Your business will not permit you to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., how shall you get the money?—he said Mr. Cooper, of Albert-square, who was trustee and executor to his grandfather, Mr. Charles Cartwright, who died in 1848, had money to pay him—I asked him how it was he had not received the money before now—he said his sister was not of age—he said his grandfather was a silversmith and watchmaker at Cheltenham, that Mr. Cooper had sold the property at a better price than was expected, and that he should receive about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that he would pay Messrs. Castle the whole of their debt, and close the account—that was all the conversation we had—I was in the habit of passing that house every morning and evening—it was shut up about ten days afterwards.</p>

I am secretary and manager to the Albert Loan Society—I know the prisoners—they came to me on Tuesday, 23d of last month, I think—I had received this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from our office keeper, who is not here—it did not come by post—I was not present when it came—after I had received it I saw Walker on the 23d November at his own residence—I went there—I learnt where his residence was from this paper—I was satisfied with reference to him as a proposed borrower—I produced that paper at our interview—he saw it—we conversed about it and likewise about the surety—I don't think he read it—I read it to him; in the first instance to Walker, and afterwards to Walker and Heatheridge—(<hi rend="italic"> This paper was a printed form of the rules of Albert Loan Society, with regard to proposed borrowers and their securities</hi>)—I made an arrangement to pay the money to Walker between 9 and 10 o'clock the same evening—I said, "I have been to your surety, Mr. Richards of Marylebone-lane, and have seen Mrs. Richards, and if you will come to night with Mr. Richards I will give you the money"—he said he would, and he did so—between 6 and 7 o'clock of the 23d, Mr. Richards of Marylebone-lane, the person whom I believed we were to have for a surety, applied to me and inquired of me whether I had an application for a loan in that name—I told him that I had, and I produced the paper—Mr. Richards is here—neither of the prisoners were present when this took place—they were present afterwards—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

On Tuesday, 30th November, I was in the dining-room of the prison, about 2 o'clock—the prisoner and the two last witnesses were there—the prisoner was sitting about 2 yards to the left of me, and about 12 yards from Goodwin—I saw him quit his seat with the pannikin is his left hand—as he passed me I took particular notice of the way that he held it; he was holding the pannikin in his left hand, the cuff of his jacket over the right hand, and his finger extended down the pannikin—he then passed on to Goodwin—the next thing that drew my attention was the sound of a blow, and one of the prisoners calling out "He has got a knife, sir"—upon looking in that direction, I saw Goodwin staggering, and bleeding from the mouth, and Morris rushing towards the prisoner, and exclaiming "What would you do, man?"—I saw the prisoner brandishing the knife over his head, holding it in his right hand like a dagger—on my way towards them I saw the knife descend twice on Morris—on pushing the prisoner on one side to get at him, I saw Morris was bleeding profusely from a wound in the neck—I then seized hold of the prisoner, and told some of them to take Morris away—while holding the prisoner, I said, "You silly man, what have you done?"—he said, "I hope to God he is dead, and there is two or three more of you want settling"—another warder then came in and took him away—he said, "I will go quietly now"—I then went for the governor, and the surgeon.</p>

               <p>on his hearing the word "knife," he turned his head again, and in turning his head, instead of its striking him on the neck, it struck him on the mouth; if he had not turned, the blow would have fallen on his neck—Morris was close by; he tried to lay hold of the prisoner; he tried to stop him from striking Mr. Goodwin again—I saw the prisoner strike Morris twice or three times with the knife, and he was in the act of striking him again, when I laid hold of him by the right hand, in which he had the knife; he had the knife up then, going to strike Mr. Morris again—I do not know whether the knife was taken out of his hand, or whether it dropped down; another prisoner laid hold of his other arm—when I laid hold of him, he said that there were two or three wanted doing for there; and then Mr. Morley laid hold of him as well, and said that he must be a foolish fellow, to do a thing like that—the prisoner said that he would put their lights out for them in about a minute—he was then seized and taken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster hospital—the prosecutrix was brought to the hospital—I found on the left side of her throat, a wound about two inches long, and about an eighth of an inch deep—it exposed a main artery, but the artery was not out—it is very probable such a knife as this might have caused the wound—she was under my care about ten days—the wound itself was slight.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If a person were going to cut their own throat, they would cut from left to right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In general they do, unless they are left-handed—I could not say positively, but I think it was from left to right, because there were a few scratches by the side of it, but I could not say positively—it could not so well have been done by a person standing on the left side—but if it were cut from behind it might.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person intending to inflict a wound had drawn that knife violently across the throat, would it have been a heavier wound than this was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend on how it was done—I have known many a per<lb/>son cut another, and cut as lightly as this, but not on the throat—it is improbable that such a wound could have been inflicted by a person on the left side, if the person were right-handed.</p>

I was quarter-master on board the <hi rend="italic">Commodore Perry</hi> on the voyage from Calcutta to London—a good many hands were shipped on board at Calcutta—there was a <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> at the head—I have seen the mate flog the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> with a rope several times with his clothes on—I have seen him use a harpoon-staff—I don't know that I have seen him strike the serang; I have seen him strike Hassan Ali—he did it very often—it is past my counting to tell how often it was done; sometimes two, or three, or four, or five times a day—it was done very often when I could not see it—I have seen pig's guts knocked about them, and pig's tail shoved down their throats by the mate and captain too—I have seen that done to the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> several times, as long as the guts lasted, and seen the mate beat him—he was sitting on the boat, and he has come behind him; if he saw him, he would run away—one went over; whether he fell over or jumped over, I can't tell; I did not see him go—I was aft and he was forward—it was at that time blowing a fresh breeze—directly he went over there was a report, "Man overboard!"—I saw a bayonet used by the mate; he used to</p>

               <p>prick the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> with it—I law a boy sharpen it before I cleaned it; I was sent for to clean it for that purpose—the <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> was kept sitting on the keel of the boats, and he would go and ask him if he was cold; sometimes he was afraid to say he was—if he said he was, he would come down, and was made to ran fore and aft till he got warm—if he did not run fast enough, he would prick him with the bayonet—I heard there was blood; I did not see it myself—when that was done with the pork, I have seen the men go down on their knees and beg that it might not be done.</p>

J. B. Examined, Henry Newman, store 3010, Frederick Waddy.)—if goods had been supplied as stores, the invoice would have been sent down to the Store keeper's department at Stratford, and another invoice would have been sent to me—the invoices are made to the prisoner—it was the duty of Mr. Bullivant, the store-keeper at Stratford, to see that the quantities mentioned in the invoice were correct, and upon that being certified, the invoice would be sent up to my office in London, and exchanged for the one I hold—it would be the prisoner's duty to examine it on its arrival at my office, to see that the sum charged was carried out accurately, and to see that it was</p>

               <p>posted into the invoice book—he would calculate it, so much per foot—it was not my duty to sign it after that, but at the end of the month the party sends an account for all the goods—my name is to this invoice—I should put that in consequence of finding the name of Newman on it—this "Frederick Waddy" is my signature—this invoice would go before the Directors, and a cheque would be drawn for this amount—this receipt marked "D" is in the prisoner's writing—<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "November 16th, 1858; received of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

B." are not my writing—I know nothing of the transaction—if this had been a genuine transaction it would have been my duty to have certified the invoice, and passed it to the accountant for payment—I should have transmitted the actual invoice to the London department, certified as this purports to be—in August, 1857, I had a small quantity of wood from Mr. Barnes, about three fathoms per diem—I have got his account here—it is not kept by myself, but I know that there was not 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due to him in August, 1857.</p>

Mr. Sinclair is the chief superintendent for distant depots, but he has half a dozen under him—Mr. Brown would certify at Stratford, and sombody else at Norwich—the office at Stratford is at the same building as mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 54). On Wednesday morning, 1st December, a little after 7 o'clock, I went, with Sharpe, another constable, to Mr. Brom<lb/>ley's house on Stratford-green, and saw distinct footmarks in the garden in front of the house, which had been freshly dug—from there I went to the "Good Intent," in Stratford, kept by Ann Dugard, the prisoner's grandmother, about half or three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Bromley's house—I saw Mrs. Dugard in the bar—she said, looking at the prisoners, "Oh, here comes a policeman" (I was in uniform)—they would hear that, as the middle door was open, but I could not see them, as the position of the door-way is askew—she spoke in a sorrowful voice, but it was loud and distinct—I said, "Yes, you will hear all about it," rushed into the back par'our, and found the three prisoners there, and this clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was standing on the sideboard, with this handkerchief over it: it was at Rooter's elbow, and at Goddard's back—this was at half-past 7 or twenty-five minutes to eight—Watson was sitting further away from it, but he could see it—there were no other persons in the room—Goddard's shoes were off, and lying on the ground, very wet and dirty—he put them on, and I said. "Consider your-selves all in custody, for stealing this clock from Mr. Bromley's"—Goddard said, "You have no right to take me; I have only been up a quarter of an hour, and have only been in the back yard to see to my grandmother's water"—I called Sharpe in, and we took the prisoners to the station—I afterwards went back to Mr. Bromley's house, and took with me three shoes, belonging to the three prisoners—I examined them with the marks—the impression was very fresh and perfect—I found that Goddard's corresponded</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130076"/>
               <p>with the marks; there is not the least doubt about that—the marks were in a direction from the back towards the front; the toes were towards the front—a person coming from the back to the front might have made those marks—I only saw one impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the impression of one foot or of two feet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of the two feet of one man—they were wide apart—the faster the man ran, the wider they would be—they were more than the ordinary width, but I suppose he walked, because it was a <hi rend="italic">zig-zag</hi> in the midst of the shrubbery—Goddard's boots were wet, and he told me that there was some water in the yard—he did not say that he had been dabbling there—I cannot say whether he said that he had been turning the water off, or turning it on—I examined his boots, and I should say that he could not have got that dirt in his grandmother's back yard, but I did not go there; they were very wet for three-quarters of an inch up the sole—I took the boots of all the prisoners, and tried them—I tried Rooter's boot first, then Watson's, and then Goddard's: his was the largest boot—the impressions were so plain that I had no occasion to be long over it—it was not raining; it was about the same weather as it is now—I did not make an impression by the side, but put Rooter's boot into the mark first—it was so small that it did not interfere with the impression—I did not ram them down—I did not make the impression with Goddard's boots: it was already made.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you let the boot out of your hand. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I put it lightly into the impression.</p>

               <p>was one of those who were inside, and as I passed, I heard him say, "He ought to he there by 7 o'clock; he said he would, and he is not there yet" I went on to Mr. Bromley's, and the prisoners followed me—I went in at the stable gates, and saw no more of them—I am certain they are the men—they followed me within thirty yards of my master's gate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police—from information that I received, I watched a house in Brompton, 10, Upper Queen's-buildiugs, on the evening of 30th September—that was a house where Barnard was a servant—I saw him go in and out of that house—on the eveniug of that day I saw him go to the Pakenham Arms public-house on Knightsbridge Green, and join two men there—on Monday, 5th October, I accompanied several officers to 4, Portland-street, Walworth Common, about 10 o'clock in the evening—the house was occupied by Richard Webster—we remained about 30 yards from the house for about three quarters of an hour, or more—I saw Barnard go into the house and come out again; he returned with a cab, and stood by the outer door of the house—at that time, I, with the other officers, rushed into the house—on going in, another officer was ahead of me; he laid hold of Webster, and was having a violent struggle with him—Webster was in a back room, and I saw him and Holmes, another officer, struggling violently—I saw Holmes with two plates in his hands; he said, "Here, I have got them, sir," and handed to me these two copper plates (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we apprehended, at the same moment, Barnard and John Webster, a brother of the prisoner—Webster's brother said, turning round to Barnard, "This is all through you;" that was in the hearing of Richard Webster-John Webster was subsequently discharged by the Magistrate—Barnard made no reply to that—I did not observe Richard Webster say anything at that time—I took the whole of them to Carter-street station—in the station, when the charge was entered, Richard Webster said, "Other parties are more guilty than we are;" that was alluding to himself and his brother—I had not seen Richard Webster go into that house that evening; John, I had—I saw Barnard and Richard Webster in company together, on 1st October, at the Pakenham Arms, Knightsbridge Green; I saw Barnard join Webster in the parlour of that house—I saw Richard Webster at the station-house on the following morning, Wednesday 6 th—he told me that he had received the plates from Woolley and that Woolley was an artisan or a workman at the Woolwich Arsenal—he said that he had called the previous morning on Barnard, and had left the back plate (that is the counterpart of these other two) with Barnard at his lodgings, in Queen's buildings, Brompton—in consequence of what he told me, I went to Woolwich on 8th October—I found Woolley at 33, Spray's-buildings, Woolwich; he was sitting in the front parlour—I asked him to step into the back yard with me to speak to me and I asked him if he knew the man that accompanied me, a policeman who belonged to the neighbourhood; he said that he did not—I told him that he was a police officer; I said, "I have come to ask you about some dealings you have had with plates"—he said, "Yes, I have had some dealings with plates"—I said, "Copper plates?"—he said, "Yes, copper plates"—I took him into custody, and brought him to Lon<lb/>don—he said, before I brought him to London, that he was to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the plates, but had only received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, from Webster—when at Bow street, I read the charge to him—he was charged with engraving copper plates, for the manufacture of forged ten-rouble Russian notes—I had, at that time, the two plates that I had found on Richard Webster—he said, "No, I have not engraved them"—nothing further passed on that occasion—Webster and Woolley were confronted together on 9th October—I said to Webster, "Is this the man whom you say you had the plates of?"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130081"/>
               <p>said, "Yes, that is the man"—I said to Woolley, "Do you hear that?"—he said, "Yes, it is all right"—afterwards at the police court, Woolley said that he had engraved them, but they were not complete—that was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Webster say anything at all about Woolley having engraved the plates? Did not he say that he had them from Woolley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the expression was, that he had got them from Woolley; nothing about Woolley engraving them—the 5th October was the day upon which we went to Portland-street, Walworth Common—I took two policemen with me on that occasion, and three or four came in subse<lb/>quently, belonging to the neighbourhood—three or four persons went in at the same time, or about the same time—Webster and John Webster were in the back room—Barnard was there, and Webster's wife—she was on the staircase leading up to the bedroom—she was dragged down by the cons<lb/>stable—she and her husband were dragged down together—I did not observe that she was coming down the stairs just about the time we went in—she came down when the constable pulled her and her husband down; he pulled them down together—Webster's foot was on the staircase that leads into the back room, and his wife was on the stairs—I cannot tell you whether she had been recently confined; I saw an infant, in her arms, or rather I found an infant in the bed—I think it was a very young infant—there were not any other persons there at the time we went in—there was one cab outside—two did not come up—a cab came up to a public-house about a dozen doors from Richard Webster's dwelling—I do not know that two persons who were there went away, and got into one of the cabs—at the time we went into the house there was an old man and a young man there, respectable looking persons—they were outside the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And did not one of these two, the old man or the young man, give you a signal to come on the premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A certain signal was given—I daresay it was given by one of them—I know it was given by one of them—they were not very respectably dressed persons—they were decently dressed—I do not know that they were foreigners, nor do I think they were—I do not know that one of those two persons went away in a cab; I would have answered you in a moment if I did—they disappeared from the scene—I did not see any cab go away besides one—I took one cab away with the prisoners, and that was the only cab that I saw go away—when I saw Webster with Barnard, on 1st October, at the Pakenham Arms, Boll, the witness, and the other two persons I have spoken of, were there.</p>

               <p>to the house in Portland-street, on Tuesday night, 5th October, when two of these persons were taken—I saw Barnard and another man at the foot of Westminster-bridge—I saw them go to the house No. 4, Portland-street, Walworth—one remained outside—it was Webster's house—after they had been in some time Barnard came out to the man that was waiting outside, and they both returned back to Webster's; Barnard and the other man went for a cab, and returned with a cab—before the cab arrived which John Webster fetched, there was one came, which stopped at the public-house a short distance off—John went into the house—Barnard and the other man followed to go into the house—at that time Barnard was standing at the door—when I went into the house with Mr. Mackenzie the two Websters were in the passage—as soon as I entered the door they ran into the back room, or back parlour, and tried to get out at the back door, which led into a yard—Richard Webster finding he could not get out at the door, tried to get up stairs—I laid hold of him, and at that time I saw he had a paper parcel in his hand—his wife was coming down stairs at the time—I pulled him down and took the plates from him—these are the plates-they were wrapped up in paper—there was paper between them—they were wrapped up very carefully—there was nothing else in the paper but the plates—Richard Webster fainted away—John tried to get out, but there were other officers, who took him—I detained Richard Webster, he sat down, he wanted something to drink—I took him into custody—I put handcuffs on him myself and conveyed him to the station—on Friday, 8th October, I accompanied Mr. Mackenzie to Woolwich—I was present when he took Woolley into custody—Mr. Mackenzie had occasion to leave him in my charge a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he remained for some time without speaking; at last he said, "Can they do anything with me if the plates are not perfect?" said, "I don't know"—he said, "They are not correct; what a fool I should have been to have made them correct—I am glad they have got into it; they asked me to make them." I was present on the 9th, the following Saturday, when Woolley was confronted with Richard Webster, by the Inspector—I saw the plates produced—Mackenzie said to Richard Webster, "Was this the man you received the plates from?" producing the plates—Webster said, "Yes"—Woolley replied, "That is right," or "All right"—on the following Tuesday, in consequence of instructions which were conveyed to me, I went to 10, Queen's-buildings, Brompton, the place where Barnard lived, and made a search—I went into the cellar and found a plate there—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the plate—I was in company with Franklin there; we had to remove a great quantity of wood in the cellar, under the stairs, and between two joints we could just discern the edge of this; we pulled it out from the back part, and it was this plate—that is a third one—we pulled it out from between two joints—it was very tight, only just room to get it in—I had previously searched that house, and been unable to find any plate; it was such a mass of rubbish, it was impossible; we were obliged to have a regular search or we should not have found it then.</p>

               <p>not know whether it was a shop or a parlour, or what it was—I did not examine that part of the premises—I examined up stairs in the back room where I apprehended him—I did not examine the ground floor entirely; others did—it was not examined in my presence, not that part—others went in, but I did not; I remained with the prisoners—I do not know that he is a shoemaker, except that I saw his card—I found the card on the premises—there is a passage there; I went through one; it leads into the back room where they were—I had not my uniform on, on that occasion—I, Mr. Mackenzie, and another one, went in somewhere about the same time—I was the first one that was in—others came in after they were apprehended, three or four policemen—I believe it to be at least five minutes before other police came in—there was but one civilian in the house—I and Mr. Mackenzie were the only two policemen that went in until they were apprehended—it might be about five minutes after, that other persons came—it was not very much less, for they were apprehended, and I believe we had the handcuffs on them before they came in—there were no other police<lb/>men inside for five minutes—I do not know whether there were any outside—there were other persons in the room besides me and Mr. Mackenzie—there was Barnard, and Webster and his wife; others were at the door—I know who you are alluding to; the others were at the door—I do not believe they went away in a cab, because I believe the cabman would not take them—he said they were lunatics, and would not go; I did not see them go away in a cab—the old man and the young man disappeared—those are the other persons whose names I have not mentioned—I left Franklin with Barnard at the door in custody—he brought Barnard in <hi rend="italic">momently</hi>—he pushed him into the passage, and brought him in to us—there were no other policemen there until some minutes afterwards, and them I did not know, either the numbers or names—I do not believe that Webster fainted several times; not more than once, I think, before he reached the station—he did not faint after he reached the station that I am aware of; if he did, it was in the cell—I was present with him the whole time—his wife came down stairs with him screaming and pulling—she was coming down the stairs, and Webster was holding his arm out for her to take it; and I pushed myself underneath and got it, and then she clung to him—I am sure I do not know where the baby was at that time; I saw a baby somewhere about the house—Mrs. Webster was crying—she did not seem to be falling down "the stairs at the time he held out his hand—he did not put out his hand to support her; he put out his hand for her to take the plates—I would not venture to swear how old the infant was that I saw lying about</p>

The prisoner Barnard was employed by me—he lodged there along with my young man—I was not there at the time he was taken into custody—some time after he was taken into custody I had a message from him to go and see him, and likewise the police wished me to go; I went—previously to my going I heard of the house having been searched to see if a plate could be found—I went to Horsemonger-lane gaol to see him—I told him that the police were coming there to search the place again; they had been there two or three times and were pulling the place all to pieces, and if he knew where it was, to say: upon which he said that it was down stairs in the cellar, under the stairs—he did not tell me whether he</p>

On Saturday night, 27th, November, I was at home about 12 o'clock in my coffee-room up stairs with some friends—I heard the door open and Inglish came in—I told him it was a private room, and he could not be admitted there—the word was hardly uttered when I received a blow from Inglish with a stick or his fist, and directly afterwards I received a blow from Marno, who was behind him, and he repeated it several times—I got them out of the room and shut the door, but soon afterwards they returned reinforced, and with sticks, and other weapons, broke the door open and made a general attack with belts, life-preservers, and other things—I was very much hurt—I was fixed in a corner by them—while I was holding Marno I received several blows from the life-preserver, and some one called out, "Murder him!"—a number of others were in the room, and they attacked everyone there—I was smothered in blood; I had several cuts on my head and was much bruised—I had no quarrel with them before; I had not known them—they were not drunk, that I am aware of—there was such confusion I can't tell—it</p>

I saw the prisoners going—I followed them up stairs—the waiter said they could not have anything to drink, it was time to close the doors—they pushed him on one side and got on the landing—Mr. Murry was at the coffee-room door, and he told them it was a private room; he could not admit them—they rushed forward and the serjeant struck him on the head with his hand the first time—I then saw he drew a life-preserver from behind him, and knocked him senseless on the head, and Marno rushed forward—Mr. Murry staggered back and Inglish struck him with his list—they then rushed on every one—after a little time they were got out of the room on the landing and the door was shut, and then one rushed down and set up a shout, and directly several of them returned, and they broke the coffee-room door with pots and pokers, struck everybody, and knocked the tables over and the chairs about, and broke everything.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, P</hi> 15). I received information of this robbery on the morning of 12th December, 1856. On the 20th December I went to the Old Bell-yard, Westminster; I searched the whole of the buildings there, the stables, cellars, cottages, and every place—the Old Bell was not at that time occupied, and the place was in a very dilapidated state—a man named Lush, and his wife, occupied one of the cottages—it was in consequence of a statement made by Lush at the Marlborough-street police-court, that I went to the Bell-yard—some carts and horses were standing in the stable there, belonging to different tradespeople in the neighbourhood—I saw the prisoner that same evening—at that time he kept a beer-shop in Regent street, Westminster—I went there and saw him—I told him that a man of the name of Lush had told me that there had been a large quantity of boots nailed up in a cupboard in a cottage in the Bell-yard, and that I had two pairs of them, which Lush had been taken up for—he sat himself down in a chair in the bar-parlour—I told him I should have to search his house—I don't know that he made any remark—I did search the house, but found nothing in reference to the boots—I did not take him into custody then—he went with me to the Bell-yard—I requested him to do so—(I left two officers to watch the house while we were gone)—we searched the place at the Bell-yard—my attention was directed to a cup<lb/>board in a cottage there—I saw a place where there had been a nail, but the door was then open—there was a nail sticking in a hole, and I pulled it out—I don't know that the prisoner said anything particular on that occasion—he said something to Mrs. Lush about holding her tongue, but I could not exactly catch it—in consequence of not finding anything, I ordered the prisoner and a person named Hyde both to appear at the police-court—I think that was on the 27th of December—I told him that a statement had been made, and he had better come and explain, and answer for himself; and if he did not, I should come for him—he did appear on that occasion, and the case was heard, and the magistrate ordered him into custody—he was bailed out that day, to appear on the 2d of January, but he did not do so—I never saw him again until the 29th of November last—he left his beer-shop; the place was deserted, and I was informed that he was gone to America—I inquired hundreds of times altogether to find out where he was; we were told he was gone to America in a ship which was lost—on 29th November he was brought over to the Marlborough station by one of the B division—he is not here—I said to the prisoner, "Well, Reuben, we must detain you now, upon this certificate which I hold in my hand, granted by the Court, for being coucerned in this robbery of Mr. Rabbits' in 1856"—he said, "Yes, I understand"—I said, "Therefore you will be locked up now"—he said, "It is a bad job; it has been the ruin of me"—an observation was made about these boots which I have produced—the prisoner said, "I suppose they are disposed of"—I said, to No; I have them locked up in the cupboard"—he said, "Do you mean to say you have taken care of them all this time?"—I said, "Yes, I have; they have been in my custody ever since."</p>

               <p>not here; he was examined here at the first trial—he was not considered necessary on the last trial, and I did not subpoena him—I know the circumstances under which Lush was taken into custody—I went to the police-court where he was in charge, for having these two pair of boots in his possession, and not giving a satisfactory account—he was taken into custody while pawning them—the pawnbroker was at the police-court; he is not here, and never has been examined here—Lush's wife was not in custody—a woman named Ann Sage was taken—her husband has absconded up to the present moment—there is a true bill against him now—Lush was taken into custody on 13th December; and was examined that day before the magistrate—I was not present then—he made a statement to me—I went to the Marlborough police-court, where he was in custody, and saw these boots—I made a statement to the magistrate in reference to the robbery, and the magistrate then told me to take Lush and the boots to my own court, at Lambeth—it was not on the way there that Lush made the statement—he made it there and then—he said, "I did not know it was a robbery," and then he told me ail-about it—I was taking him to the police court at Lambeth, upon the charge of being concerned in it—the case was remanded several times at Lambeth; I think more than seven or eight times—Lush was not detained in custody the whole-of that time—I think he was in custody during five or six of the examinations—he had given hit evidence before, but he was remanded for safety, he being a witness, and a poor man—he was then let out, and bound over to appear here.</p>

               <p>that locked the door up; I was not close enough to see—Watts and Hyde were in company—they took the key with them, I believe—I did not have the key after that, nor yet my wife—I believe Mr. Watts asked my wife for the key before the things were moved—that same evening Watts asked me to carry a bundle up to his house—he gave me the bundle in the yard—I cannot say that I recollect what colour the wrapper of the bundle was—I was to have a pint of beer for carrying it—I cannot swear to what was in the bundle; I never untied it to see—it appeared hard; but I could not say what it was—the last time I was here I said I saw a hole in one of the sacks, not in the wrapper—I saw the impression of the bottom of the sole of a boot in the sack—I could not see what was in the bundle; it felt hard, as I shifted it from one shoulder to the other; but I could not say whether it contained boots, or what it was—it was a kind of a round bundle; lumpy—it was a goodish-sized bundle—I should say 40 or 501bs. weight; it was tied tightly—I don't know whether my wife saw the bundle; she knew I went with it—I took it to Mr. Watts's house, and had my beer—when I came back from Mr. Watts's I came into the yard—it is a very dark yard, and I nearly fell over the shafts of a cart, and as I was pushing back the cart, I kicked up against something—it was these boots, which I believe are here now—they were tied up; not loose—I don't know whether they were pairs—I afterwards went to pawn these boots—the pawnbroker detained me, and I was given into custody—I did not tell exactly where I lived at the time—I told Sergeant Coppiu about it afterwards at Marl<lb/>borough-street—I made a statement before the magistrate—I then told the truth of the matter—I was in trouble about fifteen years ago; it was a very trifling matter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Ellis Lush. In December, 1856, we occupied a cottage in the Old Bell-yard, Westminster—the Old Bell was not occupied when we first went there; we had the key of it; there were things in it; Mr. Watts gave us the key—one night in the middle of December, I recollect Johnson's coming into the yard with a cab, which he drove; it was the evening before my husband was taken into custody, which was the 13th; it was dark at the time; I cannot say what time it was—I did not see anything on the cab; my attention was not drawn to Johnson, or to what he did, any more than seeing something come in—Johnson went into a cottage; there were some goods there; Hyde was there also—I was in my own cottage I suppose that was about twenty yards from the other cottage—Johnson went out again—in about an hour, or it might have been more, Mr. Watts came and asked me for a light, and the key of the Old Bell; I gave it to him—Hyde was with him; they went from the cottage into the Bell—I could see that there were parcels carried, but I could not tell what they were—the key was brought back to me on the Saturday night by Miss Watts, the prisoners daughter—I had seen Watts and Hyde go away that evening, after the goods were moved—I saw my husband with a bundle that night; Mr. Watts gave it him to take up to his house—I saw him go out of the yard with it—he was taken into custody next day—I saw the police at the place next Saturday; they were searching about—at the time they were searching the house. Watts came down and came into the cottage—I asked him what was the matter—he gave me some answer, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185812130100"/>
               <p>I cannot recollect what it was—I think it was, that it was nothing to me, or something like that—I did not see him with anything on the night of the 12th, except the bundle that he gave to my husband—on the Saturday morning I saw him go out with something, it was like a boot in a silk handkerchief—I don't know when I saw Johnson again; I saw him that week—I never saw him after the police came and searched; he never came into the yard till a long time after that, not till the summer, a little time before he was brought up here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe the Bell belonged to Watts, did it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was collector for it—he let it to a starch-maker about that time—I have been examined here on two previous occasions—I did not know of my husband's being in custody until the next Saturday—he was away for a week, and I did not know where he was; I inquired of Johnson and all of them, and they said perhaps he was gone down to the cattle show—he did not show me the boots that he found that night; I did not know that he had them.</p>

               <p>would occasion death—the cause of his death was the crushing of the spinal cord—I should imagine that a person falling on his neck, and another person falling over him, might have occasioned such an injury—I was present a few minutes before his death—he died at a quarter before 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Buttesland-street, Hoxton. On Wednesday night, 1st December, about half-past 4 or quarter to 5 o'clock, I went to Mr. Winters, a cheesemonger, in Suffolk-street, Borough—the prisoner was there, and when he saw Mr. Winter pay me some money, he said, "Are you not going to stand something to drink?"—Mr. Winter said, You ought to"—I said, "Well, I will give you whatever you like"—Mr. Winter said, "I will have the order ready for you when you come back"—I am a ticket writer; I had taken him home some tickets and he paid me and gave the another order—I went and got a cup of tea and treated the prisoner to a glass of ale—I asked for the convenience of the house—the publican said that it was locked up, and the prisoner said that I could step across the road to his place, and before I had done what I went for, the prisoner said, "What are you going to stand to drink?"—he did not go into the necessary with me—I went first into his parlour—I told him that I did not come for that purpose, and I should stand no more drink with him—he said, "I will show you about that"—he shut the door, knocked the candle over, and came to collar me—I knocked his arm off several times, and kept him at bay some time—I stood in my own defence and got the upper hand of him—he took something from the sideboard struck me on the forehead with it and stunned me—I fell into a chair senseless and he put his hand in my pocket and took my money—it was something hard that he hit me with, not his fist—I asked him to let me go, and when he saw the blood running down my face he said that he was very sorry—I said that I wanted no sympathy from him, and when he opened the door, I collared him and halloed out—he fell with me into the road and then shut the door in my face—I stood on one side of the door till I saw it open and the prisoner come out, and when I saw that he was as far from the door as</p>

               <p>I was, I collared him and called "Police"—I told him he had robbed me, and I should give him in charge—he threw me down and got away—I mentioned before the Magistrate that he pushed me out of the house, but we had a struggle first—I do not know the name of the street this was in—it is a turning out of Suffolk-street, the next street to where the police-station is, but I did not know that there was a station there, and went all the way to the Bermondsey station—I followed him across the road to a beer shop, he went in—there were about six people there, I should say—he went right through the beer shop into the sitting-room and I followed him—he sat down to play a game at cards with a man, and I told two people who were sitting there what he had done to me, and after staying there five minutes went away and left him playing at cards—when I went into the prisoner's house, I had 10 pence, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Winter—I got the 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from two customers after leaving home, but I had paid for two pints of ale—I spent 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I lost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as near as I can say—I had drank half a pint out of the first pint of ale, about a gill out of the next, and he poured the glass of ale back which I had poured him out of the pint pot, into my pint, and said that he did not like it, he must have mild ale—I drank out of the jug—I said, "If you wish to have more you must have it at your own expense"—there was an old lady lying on the outside of the bed when we first went into the prisoner's house, and when he called her she got up—she held my arm when I was going to strike him—she was a little obstruction to me, but I did not think it worth while to say anything about it before this time—my contention was with the prisoner—I do not think I said anything before the Magistrate about her holding my arm.</p>

On 2d December, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty at Stone's End station, and the last witness came and gave information to the Inspector that he had been robbed the night previously—I was directed to apprehend the prisoner—I went to his house with two other constables, and found him drunk in his own house—he was brought to the station, charged, and taken before a Magistrate, but he was too drunk for the Magistrate to deal with the case, and was remanded for three or four days, when he was committed for trial—he denied robbing the man, but said he had been drinking with him—the prosecutor had received a blow, but the blood had been washed off then—he did not say that he had been struck with an instrument, only that he had been knocked down and stunned—I found no instrument or weapon in the house—I did not see that the prisoner had had any blow—the prosecutor is rather the taller man of the two—he said that there was an old woman in the room, but did not say that she held his arms—I found the prisoner's wife there; she is not very young—I think a hard blow with a fist might have made the lump on the prosecutor's face; it was more like a bruise.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 26th November, I was returning home about 2 o'clock, and my attention was drawn to the smell of fire, as I was passing the row—I looked down, and saw smoke and a light issuing from the first-floor window of Mr. Cropper's house—knowing the house to be uninhabited, I went and hallooed to know whether there was anyone there—I received no answer—I immediately ran and knocked at my own door—my son came and opened it, and we returned to the place—as I got back to the honse, I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate of the house—he closed it behind him—I went up to him, placed my hand on his shoulder, and asked him if he had been in there to sleep, or whether he had been kindling a fire in the room (I knew him before)—he said, no, he had not—I drew his attention to the smoke, and so did my son, and I then said to my son, "Fetch a policeman directly"—the prisoner said he would go either for a policeman or an engine—I said, "No, Jack; you shall not budge an inch from where you are"—my son went, and returned with a policeman—I drew his attention to the smoke—he asked the way to get in—the prisoner took him to the door—I told the prisoner that he knew that door was fast—he then took the policeman to the gate, as if to open it, but he pressed his hand against it—the policeman put his hand to it, and opened it, and he said, "Why, these gates are open!"—that was the gate I had seen the prisoner come out of—we all went in, and I saw the staircase on fire, and likewise an accumulation of rags the full width of the staircase, burning, and the flames rushing up the stairs—I should say there were as many rags as you might take lightly in your arms—they were only on one stair—I ordered my son to fetch some water, and the prisoner followed him out, and the prisoner threw the water up the stairs—the fire was put out—there were two or three quantities of water fetched—I did not see any</p>
