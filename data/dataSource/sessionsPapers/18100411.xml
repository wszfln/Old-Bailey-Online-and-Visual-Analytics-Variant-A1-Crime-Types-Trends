On the 11th of January I was at work in my shop, about four o'clock in the afternoon; my wife observed two men make a halt before the door, she said there were some customers coming into the shop; I saw the prisoner at the same time take hold of the two umbrellas, he unhooked them off the hooks and walked away with them deliberately; I pursued him and brought him back to the shop door; he then threw the umbrellas down. He said he was going to look at them; he went away from my shop about thirty yards with them. My apprentice girl took the umbrellas up; these are them; they are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The crime I now stand indicted for I was led to believe I was totally clear of, as I was in custody for it in January sessions, and was discharged from the sessions house, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godwin. How came you not to prosecute last January - A. That was owing to the mistake of the officer; he got the bill of indictment the day before the sessions ended; he said if he was not tried that sessions, he would put a note in to detain him; I believe that was not attended to.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do. On the 10th of February, 1809, about a quarter past nine at night, she came into my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the last up in the house that night - A The prisoner was. I came home about a quarter on twenty minutes past eleven; the prisoner let me in. I secured the house, and at the same time I said young woman, I suppose your mistress has told you where to sleep, go down stairs and put the fire out, and then go to bed. We had no lodgers in the house, nobody but my wife, me, and her. I did not see her after; I went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was your wife in bed before you - A. Yes. On the next morning I got up about a quarter before seven, my wife was up first; when I came down the prisoner was gone; I missed a time piece and a basket of clothes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In consequence of the prisoner being gone, and you missing the property you set about making an enquiring - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How could the prisoner have got out of the house - A. She must have unfastened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten the door - 
               <persName id="t18100411-3-person66">A. </persName>
            Certainly; with a chain and a bolt at the top and bottom; the locked tried, I found it had been hampered.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the security of the door arose from the chain and two bolts - A Yes. There was no outer door to the house; the windows were all secured.</p>
               <p>MRS. DIGNAM. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came into my house on Friday night, about the 10th of February, 1809; my husband was gone out; he returned about a quarter past eleven; I went to bed about ten o'clock, leaving the prisoner up; there was no other person in the house but she and me; I gave her directions what she was to do in the morning, shewed her her sleeping place, and told her to stay up till her master came in, and I told her to come to me about a quarter before seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you went to bed did you observe the state of the windows - A. They were all fastened before she came.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door fastened before you went to bed - A. Only with a spring lock; there was a key in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try at that time, or before, whether it would lock - A. In the course of the day, when the servant maid went in and out, the door locked very well; I never found any difficulty in locking the door before that time. On the next morning I awoke about six o'clock; she was to call me about a quarter before seven; I waited till the time; I found she did not come and then I rang the bell; I got out of bed and called her several times, she did not answer me; I went up into her bed room, she was not there; I missed the sheets from her bed, and on my going down stairs to the kitchen I found the street door open; I went down into the kitchen, there was a candlestick on the table, the candle had burned down in the socket, and the grease had run about on the table; the fire was nearly out; it appeared as if there had been a fire all night; I missed a basket of small linen that had been standing on the table in the kitchen; I had been in the kitchen with the servant until I went to bed, and then I left that basket there; I missed same linen out of a pan, and a large counterpane from the kitchen, and two pair of boots, and a drawer was broken open in the kitchen; I missed out of that drawer, tea, sugar, soap and candles; I went up stairs and told my husband that the servant was gone, and the street door was open. He came down stairs and opened the shutters of the first floor; we missed a basket of linen from out of the dining room, it contained sheets and table linen; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110004"/>missed a silver punch ladle, three silver table spoons, four silver tea spoons, a silver caddie shell, and a pair of silver sugar tongs; I went from there up into the garret, and missed the curtains from off the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things put in the dining room - A. In the knife case; I had used them that very day.</p>

            . The two shifts are both mine, they are marked P. G. I am sure this red silk handkerchief is my mistress; it is my working.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Dignam. All these things that are found what value do you put upon them - A. I think they are worth more than forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the value of all the property that you lost - A. I value them at thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You described the candle to have been burned out - A. Yes; the candlestick stuck to the table with grease, apparently as if it had been burned out for three hours; it was quite cemented to the table with grease; it had ran over in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning - A. About a quarter before seven. I did not miss the curtains from the bed when I first went into the servant's room; it was not light enough to see without a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see any person out of doors - A. Yes, out of doors I could, but in doors I could not see any thing without a candle. We did not miss any thing out of the house until we opened the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went down was it light enough, supposing the shutters to have been down, to see what was missing without a candle - A. No; not when I first went down.</p>
               <p>Q. You described the door to be open - A. Yes, it was; it was put to but not shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the door to have been wide open would it have been light enough to distinguish the person of a man - A. Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. This property being taken by whom it would, must take a great deal of time - A. Yes; I suppose it must have taken the whole night; there were different drops of tallow grease at different parts of the house, where the property was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. You described the drawers which appeared to have been broken open - A. Yes; the wood work had been cut away at the top and bottom. On the dresser there was tallow grease dropped, and particularly where she broke the maid's box there was tallow grease dropped.</p>

               <p>COURT, to Mrs. Dignam. What makes you say it was a quarter before seven when you came down - A. I had a clock in the room; it was a quarter before seven, or rather earlier. I was awake at six, and heard the clock strike.</p>

He brought the property in question home, and made away with it as he thought proper. After that I left London; and after that I came back to London I went to the Waggon and Horses, Newington, where I saw Mr. Snow; he told me he would search me; I voluntary gave him the pocket book that he has got in his possession, there was the ticket of the gown and the tablecloth, but the handkerchief in question is not theirs; he told me if I confessed where any of the property was Mr. Dignam would forgive me, and let me go; I did as far as I know, as my husband had told me where it was.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mrs. Dignam. When you took this woman into your service did you understand her to be a married woman - A. Yes; she told me her husband was at sea, and he allowed her four shillings a week.</p>

On the 14th of October last we got a search warrant and went to the prisoner's husband's house in Stepney Green; the prisoner lived in it; the house is in Stepney Green, we found her there. On searching her house we found a coat and some flannel, and a duplicate of the shirts; the coat and the flannel were in a box in the bed-room, and the duplicate was in a small tin box, in a larger one, in the cupboard, in the bed room. She denied that the things were my father's, (his name is James Jackson) she said her husband bought them at Liverpool, and from there brought them to London. We took her with us to Mr. Dexters in Whitechapel-road, the pawnbrokers, we found the shirts marked James Jackson.</p>

            . The prisoner used to work for me last summer, at my house in David-street, Grosvenor-street; I sent her home with a gown to one of Mrs. Johnson's shop-women, in Union-row, Chelsea. The prisoner was in the hospital when I found her; when she came out she came to my house, I was then removed into Berwick-street, Soho; she was in a distressed state; I gave her a shilling and a pair of shoes. I had occasion to go to some of my duplicates in a tin box, she was very assiduous in looking over them; she said, I am very sorry for you now, I knew you when you had all these things about you. She went out with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any of the shops where these things were pawned - A. Yes, to one of them. and she wished me good night at the top of Davey-street, and told me she was going home. When I came home I asked my landlady for my key, she said, it was in my door; she said my husband's sister had come back and got the key of her, as she said she had left her key on my table. When I went into my room the first thing I missed was a piece of cotton, about four yards and a half, it was what had been left for me to make up, and a new pair of stockings that I had been shewing to her; the next thing I missed was a shirt and a shift; my duplicates I missed the next day; I went to the pawnbrokers and found all my things were redeemed; I never found any of these articles. When she was taken nothing was found upon her but two of my gowns, that had been in pledge. She stole the duplicates and the tin box.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost them, on what day - A. On the day after the Jubilee day. She came for the key the same night, Mrs. Bailey, my landlady, gave it her. I am sure I left the things in the apartment before I went out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110006"/>Mrs. BAILEY. Q. Do you remember the prisoner coming and getting a key at your house. - A. Yes; it was a very short time after Mrs. Thomson went out; she said she had left her key in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she was the husband's sister. - A. Yes, I understood her so; I gave her the key; I did not see what she brought out; nobody went up but her; she staid there but a short time.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. I belong to the Public Office, Queen-square. I searched the house where the prisoner was taken, and in the water-butt I found two gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not in this charge. - A. She owned to the tin-box; and the duplicates, she said, she had put in her bosom; but she was so drunk she did not know what had become of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. - When I first went to live with this person, she hired me, to work for her. She was a person on the town, and I went with her; she wore my gowns, and I wore her's; and part of these duplicates the clothes belonged to me. I asked her to give me the duplicates; she refused giving them me; she asked me to go out with her; she had another woman with her at the time I went out with her. I had left my key in her room on the table: I said, Mrs. Thompson, I forgot my key; she said, go and get it. I asked the landlady for the key; she saw me go out; I was very ill; I had lost the use of my limbs; I heard that she had a charge against me; I went and delivered myself; she has been the ruin of me entirely.</p>

On the first of March, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop; I was in my back-room; I came out immediately; she had her hands upon some japan tea pots; the tea pots were standing on a shelf; she asked me the price of one that she had in her hand. I told her the price was six shillings; she said it was a great deal of money; I told her it was very cheap for those who wanted to purchase. I immediately missed two out of the five that were placed there. I told her I could sell her one in her handkerchief for much less.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her handkerchief at the time. - A. She had it before her; it was a bundle handkerchief. She said what do you mean; I told her she had got my property in her handkerchief. I put my hand upon the handkerchief, and felt the tea-pots; I then attempted to take the handkerchief; she resisted; I took it from her, and sent for a constable; she was taken into custody; the tea pots were taken before a magistrate, and deposited in the constable's possession.</p>

Yes; some time before he went, he said there was a method of disposing of plate that had a crest upon it; he said there was a shop in the city; whoever made off with plate, there was a hole you put it down, and it was melted off; and when the plate was weighed you go in and receive the money. We missed the plate about three hours after he was gone; he went out on Thursday night, and came on Friday morning, and stopped till between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. You never told any body of this conversation between the prisoner and you till after he was taken up. - A. No, I never mentioned it till Mrs. Noble asked me if I had heard him mention any thing of disposing of things at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. He came again on the Friday morning. - A. Yes, on the morning he asked me to go into the pantry with him, to see that he took nothing but his own.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know then but that he was going away. - A. I did not know but what he was coming back again, as he had not received his wages. He took a pair of gloves out of the pantry, and his razors; he locked the cupboard-door and the door of the pantry, and left both the keys on the dressers of the kitchen; then he went out.</p>
               <p>MARTHA GREAVES. I brought the keys down from Mrs. Noble's dressing-room, to give them to Carey. I carried them up to my mistress the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you usually done so. - A. No, I have never done so before; I locked up the cupboard-door that night; I did not see whether there was any plate there. I saw a few dirty forks there the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Had he been paid his wages at the time that he eloped from your service. - No; he ran off to Bath, where he was apprehended about ten days after he eloped.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any plate in the cupboard in which the dirty plate was not kept. - A. He had a separate cupboard and a trunk with lock and key to keep the clean plate in, not in the pantry. It was in a cupboard in my dressing-room; he had always the key of that in his possession; he left that key behind him. In the morning when I got up, I made a search after the plate; I had an inventory of the plate that I gave to him when I hired him.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had you seen any of that plate which you found upon examination missing - A. About two months before they were in the house; I had a good deal of company; I found no defalcation then; about two months before I think the plate was all in the house; there was missing one dozen and eleven silver forks, worth twenty pounds at least, two dozen silver table spoons, two large gravy spoons, two sauce spoons, and two salts; I value them at thirty-one pounds; all was gone from that cupboard.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of the removal of any part of this place from the house of Mr. Gill - A. No; I thought it was in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know till the next morning that he had been out that night - A. The maid told me that night that he was then out; I believe it was about eleven o'clock; I intended to discharge him; he had been so beastly drunk that night. I expected him to return the next morning to receive his wages.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martha Greaves. Did your mistress discharge him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she threaten to discharge him - A. Yes. On the Thursday night Mrs Noble bid him go to bed: he said he would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds, to prosecutor. I think you say about two months ago you had this party, you saw all this plate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was all there you do not know - A. I saw salts and spoons sufficient for fourteen people.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one separate article of these silver things that is worth more than forty shillings - A. No, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he had been so of a mind he might take these things one at a time - A. He might; I cannot say he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Mr. Gill's house had you - A. The first floor, a drawing room, and a dressing room, and in the dressing room there was a closet, in which closet there was a chest that kept this place; this man had always the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gill and his wife keeps a fancy dress maker's shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you and Mrs. Noble went out you did not lock the door did you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. There was an opportunity if persons went to Mrs. Gill they might go up stairs - A. It was not impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the rest of the servants know that the plate was kept there - A. They might; both the women witnesses say they did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you looked at the lock did it appear to have been forced - A. No, not at all forced; it was locked and opened as usual. All the plate was not gone; a silver tea-pot was left, and a silver coffee-pot, and a plated tea-urn, and there were some spoons left; he had three dozen forks, he took one dozen and eleven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all of the plate that I am accused of. At half past eleven o'clock, when I took up Mr. Noble's supper I found Mrs. Noble in the pantry, she said, you wretch, I shall take the key away, you have broke all my china. The bottles that I am accused of, they did not belong to Mr. Noble, the bottles belonged to me and Mr. Gill's lodgers. I have lived there two years and a half, there were several bottles sent me while I was there, and a few of the bottles, some families that were there, they left them, and my friends sent me a bottle of rum and a bottle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110008"/>blacking.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you miss any bottles - A. I did; bottles and wine, and they were particular bottles; I had some port wine from Ireland; they are smaller than English bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. How many guineas were due to the prisoner - A. I suppose between five and six guineas.</p>

I went into the kitchen to fetch my master's boots to clean, I saw the prisoner take this copper from off the bench in the shop, he took it down in the cellar and hid it under the stove; after he came up I went into the cellar to look at what he had hid, I saw the copper, I told my master of it. At eight o'clock it was time for their breakfast; he went down in the cellar with a basket, he took the copper pipe away and hid it in his breeches, he said he should go to breakfast; he went out, my master went after him and brought him back, and the copper was found on him in his breeches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shears. I found the piece of copper partly under his trowsers, and partly under his waistcoat; he said it was the first time that he had done such a thing. This is the copper; it is the property of myself and partners.</p>

The prisoner went to Mr. North's shop, took a survey of the window; he then came back and had some conversation with the other two, then they all three went over to Mr. North's; the prisoner laid hold of the handle of the door while the other two stood round the door; he opened the door and went in, I, seeing that, instantly crossed the way, at the time I got up up to the door he was delivering this pair of decanters to one of them standing at the door; his companion was going to receive them; I I struck the man who was going to receive them over the arm with my stick, he ran away, and I seized the prisoner at the door with the decanters in his hand; I collared him and backed him into Mr. North's parlour; I then asked him what he was going to do with them; he begged that I would forgive him, he only came for a half quartern glass. By that time the master of the house was sent for, and with assistance we took him to the compter. I am sure when he went to the door it was shut, there is a latch you lay hold of the handle to lift it up.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out all day; I broke a glass; I wanted to buy a dram glass. I went into the shop and knocked with my foot, nobody answered; that gentleman ran in, he said, you rascal, you want to rob the shop. There was nobody along with me; the door was standing a jar, it was not upon the latch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LOOSE. On the 28th of March I was going along Golden-square; I met the prisoner with something wrapped up under her gown-tail; she seemed very much confused; I was close to her; I saw they were pots; I suspected she had stolen them. I spoke to Gregory, the officer; he apprehended her.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GREGORY. I received information from Loose. I took two pots from the prisoner; they were wrapped up in her gown-tail.</p>

I held the pots for a quarter of an hour; at last the old woman came; Gregory would not take her. I never stole any thing in my life.</p>

I went to the window; I perceived one of my panes of glass had been cut or starred. There was a hole sufficient to get them articles out, not sufficient to put any hand in; I perceived the tray where we put the things inside of the window had been pulled about; I missed a number of articles, but what at the moment I could not say. I was in the shop about half an hour before; then I saw the tray; it stood close to the glass; it contained gold seals and gold ear-rings, and gold things of different kinds; the articles all were safe in the tray at that time. In a very short time the prisoners were brought in by Mr. Swan, the constable, and a man of the name of Winter.

             I am a labouring man. On the 15th of March, about ten minutes after four, I was at the sign of the King and Queen, Kensington, it is nearly opposite of Mr. Acres's shop, I saw the prisoners they were standing against Mr. Acres's shop window; I saw Brown run his hand down the window, I could not see whether he had any thing in his hand; I then saw him give Stoker something twice, which appeared to me to come out of the window; upon seeing this I ran over too Mr. Swann, he came out of his house; we went up the gateway at the corner of Mr. Swann's house; both the prisoners were under the gateway, they were both stooping; I collared them both and took them into Mr. Acres's shop, and a watch was found upon Stoker. I went under the gateway to where the prisoners had been stooping, by the step of the back door, there I picked up two bits of tickets, they were in a puddle near the step.</p>
               <p>MR. SWANN. Q. We understand you are a constable of Kensington - A. Yes. Winter came over to me, we went under the gateway adjoining my house, we saw the two boys, they were by a back door under the gateway; they were searched in Mr. Acres's shop, nothing of his property was found upon them. I have the gold articles that were afterwards found, they were delivered to me by Mr. Acres; I put them altogether.</p>
               <p>- SHELDRICK. I am a waterman at Kensington. I was standing at the Marquis of Granby, directly opposite of Mr. Acres's. After the prisoners were taken I went into the shop, some person said the boys had been under the gateway, I and Pickett went under the gateway, and just by Mr. Billet's door, Pickett saw a piece of wire lay, and with that wire he pulled up a finger ring, a seal, and an earring, he took them into Mr. Acres's shop; after he was gone I searched in the same spot, and found a finger ring, a seal, and an ear-ring; I laid them on Mr. Acres's counter.</p>
               <p>Stoker said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Thomas Pickett was called, and not appearing in court, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.</p>

I went out about four o'clock, the watches were all safe in the window then, I had put them there in the morning. On my return I went to take the watches away, and found a bit of glass, and a great number of watches gone.</p>

He has lived with me about eight months in the capacity of a shopman; for some time I had reason to suspect that he had robbed me, having missed money several times. On Saturday morning, the 24th of March, I took two one pound notes to Mr. Gay, a friend of mine, in Chancery-lane, and desired him to give them to Mrs. Gay to lay them out at my shop, which she did.</p>

               <p>Q. Yes, it is, if you are talking about a book - A. I asked him if there was any thing to set down, he said there was nothing. I then returned to Mrs. Gay to ascertain if she had laid out the money, she told me she had, and shewed me the goods that she had purchased. I then examined the till and found that one of the notes was not in the till that she had paid; there was one note in the till, the other was not. The prisoner told me the till was right with the goods that were sold, that the money in the book did correspond to what he had sold, but he had omitted putting in the guinea for the six pair of cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why did not you bring the book with you - A. I did not think that book had any reference to the transaction.</p>

               <p>APSLEY PELLATT, Jun. On the 3d of March, at seven o'clock in the morning, on my coming down to let the men in to work as usual, I perceived both the burners of the street lanthorn gone, and there was a ladder there on the outside of the shop, and one of the panes of glass of the lanthorn was broken. I immediately went to the pawnbrokers round about, and informed them of the circumstance, and described the lamps. About ten o'clock the same morning Mr. Taylor, servant to Mr. Lock, brought the lamp, which I thought to be ours. I immediately called the man who trimmed it, and he swore to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the woman - A. I never saw her before; she seemed very much intoxicated when she was taken. The ladder that was left on the right side of our shop was not marked; we could not ascertain whose ladder it was; we have it still in our possession.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of March, between eight and nine in the evening, I stopped the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder in Petticoat-lane. I asked him what he had got; he told me glass, he had brought it from Mr. Green's, the other side of the water; he was going to take it to Mr. Hart's, Petticoat-lane. I told him, I did not like the firm of Mr. Hart's house, I must investigate the business a little further; he said, Mr. Hart was his master, begged me not to detain him, but he would go with me any where; he walked with me to about one hundred yards of the watch-house, and then he threw the basket on the pavement and ran away; he was stopped, and I took him to the watch-house. I searched him; I found his pockets full, and the inside of his hat full, of tumblers and wine glasses. I asked him who he worked for; he said, for Mr. Pellatt and Green. He informed me where his lodging was; I went to his lodging, and found more articles of the same description. I informed Mr. Pellatt and Green; they claimed the property.</p>

On the night of the 3d of March, I found that there was one of the spoons deficient; on Monday, the 5th, I found there were two spoons deficient; on Tuesday I had thorough search all over the house, and could not find them; on Wednesday I found one of the spoons in pledge at Mr. Flemmings, in Fleet-market. I then went home and told Mrs. Robinson.</p>

            John Robinson. The prisoner was cook there. We sent for an officer; the officer and I went into the kitchen, and told the cook, that she was the person that pledged the spoon in Fleet-market. At first she denied it; at last she confessed, that she had pledged in Aldersgate-street one, and the other in the City.</p>

On the 21st of March I was coming into his shop about two o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner with the baize on his arm. I asked him where he was going with it; he told me, that he was going to get it scoured. I told him he should not go till he told me who authorized him to get it scoured; he turned round in the shop, and wanted to go away; I would not let him; a scuffle ensued, he hit me two blows on the face, he got out in the street, I called for assistance, a gentleman came up, and he was secured.</p>

On Sunday morning the prisoner came as usual to take in a temporary watch-box which is at the door; I gave him the key of the shop for that purpose. After he had taken in the watch-box, I went into the shop and found a deficiency of the halfpence. I sent for a constable, the prisoner was searched, and there was found on him eleven shillings worth of halfpence. There was only eighteen shillings and eleven-pence remaining in the till; the money found on the prisoner and the money remaining in the till was all right but the deficiency of a penny. I do not account for the deficiency of the penny.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning the 25th of February, I searched the prisoner in Mr. Garrets' parlour; his waistcoat pockets were nearly full of half-pence, and in his breeches pockets were the remainder. I laid the half-pence on the table, Mr. Garret was present: he said the deficiency was about eleven shillings. Mr. Garret asked the prisoner how he came to do it, he went down upon his knees and begged for mercy, and said it was the first time he had ever robbed him; he begged of me to intercede with Mr. Garret to send him to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Garret, Is there any of the halfpence that you know - A. I do not know any of them myself, my servant knows them.</p>
               <p>FERNLEY. I know these two half-pence, they were counted on the Saturday, they are black and appear to have been much burnt.</p>

            . I am an officer of the ward of Cornhill. On the 2nd of March I was on the evening duty, I saw a man with a shutter on his shoulders; I came up to him, I asked him where he got that shutter; he replied, from Drury-lane, he had bought it there. it was his property, he was going to carry it to Rosemary-lane. I told him I thought he would not carry it there to night, immediately he broke away from me and ran down Finch-lane; he threw the shutter down; I pursued him and catched him just as he was turning into Spread-eagle-court. I never lost sight of him; my fellow servant had possession of the shutter at the time.</p>

               <p>JONATHAN DRAYTON, I am a servant to Mr. Mellish. On the 2d of April I missed some tare straw; I could not tell how much was gone, I had seen it there the night before. When Mr. Hewittson came down I told him, I missed it about half after six o'clock in the morning, it was tied up with hay-bands.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at work. - A. At Mr. Cobbett's. On Thursday I missed the straw, and on the Monday I saw it at Mr. Mons's the magistrate; the prisoner was then in custody; It was Mr. Mellish's straw.</p>
               <p>Jury. How do you know that be Mr. Mellish's straw - A. Because it was like the other, and tied up with hay-bands. We lost some straw from Mr. Mellish's barn, and the straw I found I believe it to be Mr. Mellish's</p>

            . I am Bailiff to Mr. Mellish. On Monday the 2nd of April I went to the barn. I saw there had been some straw tumbled about, I traced the straw across the yard over some hurdles, and across the next field adjoining the yard, and across the next field into the foot-path; I traced it into Enfield Town to the prisoner's door, and I found the straw in the back part of the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home - A. No, his wife was. I examined the straw, I believe it to be that taken from Mr. Mellish's barn. I saw the prisoner after he was taken; he said he found it under an elm tree, and he took it home, I went to the elm tree, and there was no appearance of straw having been there.</p>

            . Q. What countryman are you - A. I come from Riga, last Sunday week the ship arrived here, and then I came on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come from Riga, or from what other place - A. I came from Heligoland; I was in an accompting-house there. I came from there to London, thinking of finding some of my relations here, and then to go home to Riga.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did you come on shore - A. I landed at a bridge that took me to Wapping. I wanted to go to Mr. Warren's a publican in St. Catharine's. I enquired the way to that publican; on my going along the prisoner stood at a shop door I asked him to give me change for a guinea; I wanted to buy something if I could have got change.</p>
               <p>Q. What language did the prisoner speak to you in - A. English, I understood enough of English to know what he said. I took the louis'd'ors out of my pocket and picked out a guinea and gave it to the prisoner; the prisoner gave my guinea to a little girl in the shop where we stood; the girl brought it to me again and said they could not change it. I put it in my pocket and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pulled out any more than that guinea - A. I took them all out of my pocket, and knowing that the louis-d'ors would not go here. I picked out the guinea from the louis-d'ors which I had in my hand. I was walking away, the prisoner followed me, and after a good bit he took me by the hand and questioned me how I came by so much money. I told him the money was mine, what need he trouble himself about it. The prisoner told me that there was a million of guineas stolen from the crown (from the king), that he was an officer in search of it. I said I had not stolen the money, he could go with me to the ship and enquire of the captain whether I did not bring this money from Heligoland. He replied, if you have stolen the money tell me, and it shall be secreted. The prisoner took me by the hand and took me into a public-house; the prisoner questioned me whether I wanted change or no. I said yes, and gave him a guinea. The prisoner ordered a shillings worth of rum, he paid for it out of the guinea, and gave me four crown-pieces. We both went out of this public-house together. I told the prisoner that I intended to go on board again, and that the prisoner might go on board with me, to see whether I had stolen the money or brought it with me. The prisoner then took me by the hand, and said I should go with him to his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you where his lodging was. - A. The prisoner told me he lodged where I first produced the guinea, it was his shop. He went with me to the said shop, and ordered the girl to put the tea-kettle on the fire, and invited me to drink tea with him. I staid with him till about seven o'clock in the evening. I then said to the prisoner, I wish you would recommend me to a decent lodging, it is too late for me to go on board again, I shall go in the morning; the prisoner said I could remain with him that night. I was agreeable to that, and before I went to bed it was near nine o'clock. I gave the landlady of the house seven louis-d'ors and three guineas to save for me for my own security. I had in my pocket when I went to bed three crowns, two shillings, and some halfpence. The prisoner shewed me the room where I was to sleep; I went to bed very near nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner afterwards come to bed. - A. When I went to bed I took the three crowns and two shillings, and put them in my trowser's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. By crowns do you mean dollars. - A. English crowns, this is one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110016"/>Q. That is a dollar, were they what you had received in change of the prisoner at the other house. - A. Yes, I received four dollars of the prisoner at the other house, but one of the crowns I paid to the landlady for victuals and drink where I slept, and gave her my gold to keep for me. I had tea, bread and butter, and more things to eat, for which I paid two shillings and eight-pence. When I went to bed I folded my trowsers, and laid them on the chest in the same room where I slept. In the morning at two o'clock the prisoner came to bed; I do not know it myself, the prisoner himself said it was two o'clock, and the mistress of the house likewise. I did not hear any disturbance in the night. I got up in the morning at seven o'clock, my trowsers were on the chest where I laid them, in my jacket pocket; there were four pennyworth of coppers, but in my trowsers the silver was all gone. The prisoner slept in a pair of nankeen trowsers, he asked me, if I was going to get up: I said, I did not like to lay late of a morning. I got up first, and the prisoner immediately followed, the prisoner put his coat half on, and went down before he was dressed; I did not miss my money before the prisoner went down. I went down stairs to wash myself, and saw the prisoner in a little apartment backwards in the house. I spoke to the prisoner, I said, I had three crowns and two shillings in my pocket, and I did not know which way they had gone out of my pocket. The prisoner gave me no answer, he went up stairs, came down again, and gave me three crowns; he said, that he had took them to save them for me; I then did not say any thing about the two shillings any more. The prisoner asked me to go out; I told the prisoner I did not like to go out, I wanted a dish of tea, and then go on board again. The prisoner said, he had ordered breakfast, it would be ready in half an hour, and to go and take a little walk because the mistress of the house had to clean the place up. I went with him, he took me by the arm, and took me to a public-house; he ordered some brandy, and let me pay for it; the prisoner only drank of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Why were you to pay for the brandy - A. The prisoner said he had nothing but Bank notes. I asked the prisoner to take me to a hairdresser to have my hair cut; I paid for that; he took me to another public house, after the liquor was brought he desired me to pay for it, which I did. I did not drink of that liquor, he took me by the arm again, and said he would take me to a pretty girl, and went into another public house and called again for some rum; I paid for it, I did not partake of that. After I had paid for the liquor I said, this is the last liquor I shall pay for, I want my money to buy a hat, neither do I want a pretty girl, I wanted to buy something and to go home, I said to him, shew me where I can buy a hat, and let us go home again; the prisoner said, we shall go home and take out breakfast, and after that we will go and buy a hat. The prisoner ordered a coach immediately and got into the coach; he put his hand out to help me in, I thought he was going to ride home to where I had slept, but he did not; the coach stopped in a street. I do not know the place; we got out of the coach, the prisoner took me by the arm and desired me to lend him a shilling; which I did; he then took me to a house where one Serjeant King lived, the breakfast things were on the table, Serjeant King was in bed, the prisoner told the mistress of the house to call him up; when Serjeant King came down he desired me to stand against the door to see what size I was. The prisoner had spoken to Serjeant King before that, but I did not pay attention to it. After some time I said to the prisoner I wish you would go home with me, I want to go on board; the prisoner than told me to stop there a little while, he was going of an errand. I said, I will not wait here, I will go with you, and Serjeant King and his wife; I went out with the prisoner, Serjeant King and his wife to a shop; the prisoner desired me to stop outside, I remained at the door untill they came out, the prisoner had a handkerchief with clothes in it; I then desired the prisoner to go home with me, or to direct me my way to the place; the prisoner said, you shall first go with me to Serjeant King's, I will dress myself and then we shall go home together. We went together to Serjeant King's again, and after the prisoner had dressed himself, he went away for about an hour and then came back. I then said, I want to go home; he replied, I must first go and get married to a person with an hundred pound, he could not go home till four o'clock. I said, I cannot stop, I desired him to tell me the name of the street where the house was where I slept. The prisoner told me it was St. Thomas's-street, that I was to lend him a crown, he would give it me when he came home. I lent him the crown; I then went in search of St. Thomas's-street, I could not find the house in Thomas's-street. I desired a boy whom I met in the road to shew me back to Serjeant Kings; the boy brought me to Serjeant King's again, he was not at home at the time; I got a direction at Serjeant King's, and Serjeant King's son went with me, and I found out the house where I had slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in St. Thomas's-street. - A. No, it was in Wapping-street, I knew the house, I went into it, I saw the mistress of the house, but not the prisoner; her name is Mrs. Perry; I asked Mrs. Perry for my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What Mrs. Perry told you you are not to tell - A. By the desire of Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18100411-31-person282">Perry</persName>
             I concealed myself in a corner of the shop, that if the prisoner came in he might not see me. It was about four o'clock when I got back to Mr. Perry's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come into the shop while you were so concealed. - A. No, I slept that night at Mrs. Perry's, and the next morning I got up and went to Serjeant King. I left a messuage with him, that if the prisoner came there, for him to tell the prisoner that I was gone on board my own ship, because I could not find the house. I returned to Mrs. Perry's about twelve o'clock, I had the same boy with me, we went to several public-houses in search of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive any information of the prisoner being at any public-house. - A. When he had returned to Mrs. Perry about an hour, a woman called Mrs. Perry, and she ran out; Mrs. Perry sent a messuage from a public-house that I must come immediately; he went with the woman to the second public house from his lodging. I saw the prisoner there Mrs. Perry held him fast, I desired Mr. Wood to assist and hold him. Mrs. Perry went for an officer, the officer came and secured the prisoner. I never saw any of my louis-d'ors or guineas again.</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Wapping-street; I keep a chandler's-shop. The prisoner lodged in my house about three or four weeks; he is a labourer in the London Docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Sunday, the first of this month, seeing that boy, the prosecutor - A. The boy came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110017"/>my shop and wanted to buy something, and wanted change for a guinea. I was up stairs, the girl brought the guinea up to me, I had not change, I did not see the boy then, I sent it down by the girl. In about half an hour they came in together, the prisoner and the boy; I was down stairs then. The boy said, he wanted some tea if it was agreeable; the boy and the prisoner drank tea. Then the boy asked for a lodging; the prisoner said, he might sleep with him if it was agreeable. About nine o'clock the boy went up stairs to bed, and the prisoner went to bed about ten o'clock. In the morning the boy got up about seven o'clock; the prisoner had been out before I got up. When the boy went to bed he left with me seven louis-d'ors and three guineas: I was to take care of them for him till the morning. In the morning the prisoner said that in the night the boy had told him that he had taken the money he had left with me out of the captain's writing desk, and the boy was afraid of going to the captain without the prisoner going with him; with that I gave the prisoner the money to go with him to the captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you about giving him the money - A. Yes; he asked me to give it him to go with him to the captain with the boy. I gave the prisoner the seven louis-d'ors and three guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy was not there then -

            Not</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner and the boy together - A. Directly; they were down stairs then. The prisoner took the boy out between seven and eight; he said, he was going to take the boy to the captain.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you see the boy again - 
               <persName id="t18100411-31-person285">A. </persName>
            About four in the evening; he enquired for the money that he had left with me, I told him, that I had given it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what the prisoner said, of his having confessed that he had stolen it from the captain - A. Yes, and that he was going with it with him to the captain's.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, the boy denied that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He has told us, that he concealed himself by your desire in the shop - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that, I want to know whether, in the course of the day, the prisoner had been to your shop before you saw the boy - A. No, he had not; he did not come home that night.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy has told us, that he slept in your house that night - A. Yes On the next day, about seven o'clock, I was fetched to the Duke of Argyle public-house, it is two doors from my house; I there saw the prisoner; I sent for my husband, and sent a woman for the boy, and went for an officer; the boy came before the officer came.

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know what money I am indicted for.</p>
               <p>Court. Your indictment was read to you; you are indicted for stealing seven louis-d'ors and three guineas, two dollars and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a false indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. That is for the jury to say.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did you tell the prisoner in the night, that you had taken the money left with Mrs. Perry out of the captain's desk - A. I did not say it, nor did I steal it, therefore I could not say it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, that you was afraid of going back to the captain without the prisoner going with you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any authority to ask Mrs. Perry for the money - A. No, not a word.</p>

               <p>CHARLES THOMSON. On the 22nd of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18100411-32-crimeloc183">Old Bond-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that he purposed to do it, or that he was actually intoxicated. - A. He did it on purpose; four men then came up, two of them stood before me, and the other two were behind me, and picked my pocket of a pocket-book, a silk handkerchief, and a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them things to be in your pocket recently before. - A. I had my hand in my pocket upon them not two minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. And you felt their hand in your pocket, and you suppose they took them articles away. - A. Yes, I was so alarmed at the time that they picked my pocket, I let the men that picked my pocket run away; I let them leave me as if I took no notice. I then saw the other three. I went up to a watchman and related the case to him, and insisted upon him taking charge of the three; he said, yes, and acquainted them with the charge that I had made; they said, they were innocent of the crime and they would go without force; they then turned round as if to go to the watchhouse, and went down Stafford-street. I was behind them, and expected the watchman was following of me, instead of which, he had gone a hundred yards, to take the trouble to shut his watch-box door. The prisoner turned round, and finding me only behind, they run off, and separated different ways; I kept the prisoner in sight from first to last; he run; I pursued him and never lost sight of him; I came up to him and collared him; three gentlemen were by; I took him up to Mount-street watchhouse, there I gave charge of him to the constable of the night, Mr. Watson. I am positive the prisoner is the person that reeled up against me, and he is one of the three men that I gave charge to the watchman, who went back to his box, and he is the man that I seized when the three gentleman came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that his shoving of you in apparent drunkenness, was real or affected. - A. He was perfectly sober when I collared him the second time, and so he was at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you collar him the first time. - A. Yes, I collared him the first time, when he reeled against me; and the second time when the gentlemen came up. It was a moonlight night; I saw him when I collared him the first time, I never lost sight of him before I collared him the second time.</p>
               <p>MR. WATSON. I was constable of the night in the watchhouse; I received charge of the prisoner, as being one of the five that had robbed the prosecutor of his pocket book.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>RICHARD HIGLEY. On Saturday evening, the 3rd of March, I was in the New Inn, Shoreditch; about ten o'clock at night, I was walking along, I saw the prisoner before me, he passed on the right hand side of me and 
               <persName id="t18100411-33-person304">drew</persName>
             the watch of my pocket; he met me; I had my hand in my waistcoat pocket. He snatched the watch out of my fob; I felt the watch coming away; I took my hand out of my pocket and catched the watch as he was coming by me; I kept my hold, he broke the ring of the chain as he pulled, and turned round; I slipped down; I immediately called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch. - A. The watch I had in my hand; the steel chain was never found, nor the gold seal and key. The prisoner took to his heels and run away.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him again. - A. Not two minutes; I got up and saw him down a turning,

            . On Saturday evening, the 3d of March, I was returning out of Shoreditch, through New Inn yard, about a quarter past ten o'clock; I had nearly arrived at this turning that had no thoroughfare. I observed, by the light of this public-house, the prisoner and the last witness; I am sure it was the prisoner; I perceived a kind of a bustle between them; I was looking forward; the prisoner left the last witness; he cried, stop thief; I sprang forward; I rather think the prisoner perceived me coming: he turned up this turning; I came up to him and collared him; about the distance of two or three yards he struck me several severe blows in the face. I kept my hold till the last witness came up, we took him to the watchhouse; he resisted the whole of the way, and with great difficulty we conveyed him there.</p>

I met the prisoner at the Green man, in Westminster, being late in the evening he said he would conduct me there and get me a decent lodging. We had something to drink at the bar, I never saw the prisoner before, we proceeded from there to Charing-cross, but we agreed to have a pint of half and half at this said public house, he paid for the beer he represented to me that my knapsack was unbuckled, it was very full of things, I pulled my knapsack off, he pretended to buckle it he then hung the straps on his arm as being a friend to me as I thought. A young man spoke to me about our regiment, I turned myself round and talked with this young man, my back was to the prisoner and in about three or four minutes I missed the prisoner and my knapsack, my knapsack contained all the things mentioned in the indictment.

            . On the 17th of February I came to town in a fish cart, I got off the cart in Grace church-street, nigh seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up to me he said, you are very heavy loaded, I said, I was not heavy loaded I was cold hungry and dry; he said, I will get you into a house, I was going into a passage into Leadenhall-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before - A. No; we went into a house and he picked up a woman by the way, I called for a pot of beer and some bread and cheese, I had a glass of rum and so had they; I said, I would shift myself, after I had shifted myself I said, I would buy goose to take home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shift yourself in the tap room - A. I put on a shirt and another pair of trowsers; I differed about the goose I bought a leg of pork, he went with me to buy the leg of pork and the woman went and bought this pocket book for me. The prisoner seemed to be a friend of mine as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober to do all this - A. I was as sober as I am now, having bought this leg of pork I went back to drink at this same house. I had my money in a belt that went twice round me in what they call a comforter, I had thirty five one pound notes, I received them at Portsmouth, on the 16th, they were all one pound bank of England notes. I was discharged from the Haughty, gun-brig.</p>
               <p>Q. Having come back to this public house this comforter had these notes in it - A. Yes; it was over my shirt and my waistcoat over that. The prisoner saw I had the notes in it at the public house, I took one out on purpose to pay for what I wanted, I had another pot of beer I said, I will go now, I was going to my sister in Jane Shore-alley, Shoreditch. I called a coach and he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110020"/>along with me in it. The woman did not go in the coach with us she came out of the public house with us. The coach put me down at the corner of Union-street, the woman was there, she followed us in to buy a handkerchief there, I bought her a pair of gloves at the same time; the prisoner went into the shop with me, I made fast the belt in the linen drapers shop myself; I had the money then, I am sure, and I went along Norton Falgate to go to Shoreditch; I went past the turnpike between New Inn-yard, and Plumb-pudding-row; I missed the belt off me, I said, to the prisoner you have got my money; I got your money said he, and he run away from me directly; I sung out stop thief, and run after him, I could not get up to him. He was stopped and taken into the

            , public house, and searched and nothing was found upon him. When I came up to him he said, Bill what a fool you must be, go along with me you shall have every farthing again. I lost my belt and all the notes; the belt went round my body twice, and I fastened it with two knots.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let me understand how he could get at this belt which you describe went twice round your body and was tied - A. It was worsted, it was always slipping, it was made to put round the neck, there was a little hole in the middle you could put a sixpence in it, it could not come out easy.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MERCHANT. I am a watchman at New Inn, Shoreditch. On the 17th of Feb. last when I was on my beat I heard the cry of stop thief, I came up, I saw the sailor with a leg of pork, he said he had been robbed of 35 one pound Bank notes. The prisoner was taken and brought to me by Ashton. The prisoner said to the sailor, what are you making this piece of fuss about, come along with me, and you shall have every farthing of your money back.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how the prosecutor's dress was at that time. -

               <p>JAMES ASHTON. I was coming home on Saturday the 17th of February, near 10 o'clock at night. I live in William-street, Curtain Road, and just as I had rung the bell I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner running, he seemed to be a great distance from any body that was pursuing him. I sprang from the door, and seized him by the collar with both hands; he made resistance, and said, let me pass, I have done nothing amiss; I said, if you have done nothing amiss, you shall go when they come up: several people came up, and said that is the man, he has robbed the sailor of 50 pounds; a young man laid hold of him by the collar, and took hold of his right hand; I took him by the left hand, and held his collar with the other; we took him to the

The prisoner says to him, have I robbed you, and took out one or two dollars and a few shillings from his breeches pocket, and said, that is all the money I have; he said, if you have lost your money you know who it is with, and if she has got it you will have it again, it is very safe. He was conveyed to the watch-house. I told the officer of the night what he had said; I said, officer, if you like, I and you will go and see if we can get the money for the poor man. The prisoner then said, no, he would not go, he would see us all b - r, we might do as we pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. When you came out of this linen draper's shop, and went along Norton Falgate, who was with you. - A. The man, I never saw the woman after I came out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday last he came to me in Newgate; he said he had found no bill against me, if I would give him 2 l. he would make it up.</p>

On the night of the 18th of February, near one o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of James-street, Grovesnor-square, facing of Gee's-court, I saw the prosecutor crossing Oxford-street, he went near Gee's-court, there was a woman standing at the corner of Gee's-court, she came before the prosecutor, what words passed I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stand to talk with her. - A. No, he went one way and she the other, the prosecutor passed on, and near ten or eleven paces beyond Gee's-court, he called out watch; I ran across the street, he said, he was robbed by the woman that stopped him by Gee's-court; I went in search of her, he went with me, we could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who that woman was. - A. Yes, by sight, I have not seen her since,</p>
               <p>Q. Look round and see whether you know her. - A. That is the woman at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever any talk with him about the mare. - A. Yes, on the 12th of February he asked me if I was obliged to blindfold her because she was shy, I said, she is the better for it.</p>

               <p>JOHN JUDGE. I am a currier. I live at No. 6, Market-street St. George's.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at Bromley fair on Wednesday the 14th of February - A. I was, I got in there about half-past nine, I saw the mare between ten and eleven, I bought the mare, I gave 4 l. 3 s. for her.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dress'd from whom you bought it - A. He looked like a farmer's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner's person, what do you think about him - A. There is some resemblance, and more I cannot say; he had a snuff-colour'd coat on, he said he brought the mare from Chersey.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is it from Bromley to Chersey - A. They tell me it is twenty-two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse hot - A. No, there was not a hair sweating about it when I bought it, it seemed as if he had been somewhere to have refreshment.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold it again to one Newman I think - A. Yes, he stood by, he wanted to have it, I thought it was rather a broken-back'd one. Mr. Newman gave me 4 l. 10 s. I sold it for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you much talk with the prisoner - A. About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any talk with him since - A. No more than when we went down to the magistrate, we went in the public-house along with the officer before we went before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect the voice as the voice of the person that sold the horse - A. When I bought the mare I had about twenty people round me.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN. Q. You were by when Judge bought this horse - A. I was. I bought it again and gave him seven shillings for buying it. I saw the man that sold it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe his countenance - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is that the man - A. I have not a doubt of it, he has had his whiskers shaved off.</p>

I was alone, and when I got near Somerset-house I was attacked by the prisoner he was in the front of me when I first saw him, it was a star-light night and the lamps were a light; he took hold of my great coat and opened it; he laid hold of my under coat with one hand, and pulled at my watch with the other he did not get my watch out at this time. I then looked him in the face and said, you rascal, what do you want to rob me of my watch. He gave me no kind of answer whatever, but made a second pull at my watch, and gave me a blow which knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he struck you with - A. I believe with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. And you fell to the ground, did you - A. Yes, and I felt the watch go at the same moment; I felt him pull it out, he ran across the way towards the church, towards Drury-lane way; I immediately got up, crossed the way, and cried out stop thief, and pursued him; the watchman came up and ask'd me who had robbed me, I pointed the prisoner out to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner when you pointed him out A. Somewhere on the opposite side of the way where he had ran to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing still then or running - A. He was standing still, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near him when you pointed him out to the watchman - A. Yes, I was; I said, that is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near enough to hear you say that - A. Yes, he was; the watchman that I had pointed him out to took hold of him by the arm, upon which he gave him a push and ran away, the watchman pursued him and a number of other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he run. - A. Up into Little Drury-lane; I did not see him stopped until he was brought back again, it was not more than five minutes before he was brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when you saw him - A. At the bottom of Little Drury-lane, coming back to the watch-house, one of the witnesses bringing him back; he then went to the watch-house; I identified the prisoner at the bar, I have not the least doubt but the prisoner was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again. - A. The outside case was found about half an hour afterwards, I did not see it found, I saw it brought in the watch-house by one of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know it again. - A. I described it before ever I saw it; it was a silver gilt watch, horizontal, capped, jewelled, and seconds.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch itself you never saw again, did you. - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he was searched at the watchhouse. - A. Yes, and nothing found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has got the watch-case. - A. The watchman that picked it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon this night, between twelve and one o'clock, where did you happen to be. - A. I was going out of the Strand up Drury-lane; when I had passed what is called Little Drury-lane, I then heard a watchman's rattle; I did not notice it, it was behind me; I did not notice it till I heard it violent and incessant, and then I turned round, I saw a person advancing out of the Strand up Little Drury-lane, running very fast; I stood still for a moment when he was coming near where I was I made a slant crossing the way, he altered his pace, when I was within half a dozen yards, and walked; I sprang forward and laid hold of him; he told me that he had not done any thing, then I said I'll see justice done you, you must go with me, you shall not stir away. In a short time the watchman came up and a number of people behind him, I did not loose him till we got in the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose he charged the prisoner with having robbed him of his watch - A. He did, and shewed the marks in his face where the man knocked him down; his face was all dirt and his head was scarr'd, I left him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you consider Mr. Hodgson as drunk or sober - A. He was very correct in what he said he did not appear as sober as he would be in a morning, he said he had been drinking a glass, he gave as clear a statement as he now has done.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchman - A. Yes of St. Mary-le-strand. I heard the rattle spring, I was at the end of Catharine-street in the Strand; I ran to this side of the Church, and the prisoner ran up little Drury-lane; I saw nothing of the prisoner till he was brought to the watch-house. After Mr. Hodgson said he was knocked down I went to look if there was any thing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mr. Hodgson say he was knocked down A. At the lower part of Somerset-house gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the spot that he mentioned, or thereabouts, find any thing - A. As near as possible it could be mentioned I found this watch-case; it was just outside of the kennel in the coach road.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that watch-case, and see if you know any thing about it - A. This is the outside case that was on my watch at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not aware of its falling on the ground at all - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular that you know it by - A. Yes, there is a satrin paper at the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you that little Landscape in it - A. Yes, that was inside of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. to Linder. How long after the rattle sprang the first time did you find this - A. About half an hour, just upon the stroke of one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon the spring of the rattle there was a good many people about, was there not - A. I did not take notice of any more than another time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Hodgson. You admitted you had been drinking that evening - A. I had.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you your senses about you at that time - A. I believe I had as well as I have just at this moment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My prosecutor was drunk at the time he had me taken to the watch-house. That gentleman stopped me; my prosecutor said he was one of my companions, he thought he knew as much about it as I did; and when my prosecutor had me taken to the watch-house, I said, sir, if you are in liquor I am not, I was going home.</p>
               <p>MR. HILL. I said to this poor man I will have justice done, and so Mr. Hodgson concluded from that I was one of the party.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was nothing more than Mr. Hill saying that he would have justice done him, I conjectured that he might belong to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a chain was it - A. A gold chain, a gold seal and a gold key.</p>

I did not see the girl, the deceased fell upon his back, when he got up I lent him a handkerchief to wipe his mouth, his mouth was cut then, he said he would fight, they fought, Harris was knocked down several times, and the prisoner was knocked down two or three times, they fought about half an hour, the prisoner give in, they then shook hands with one another, the deceased walked to a public-house just by and he had part of a pint of mild beer.

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether your brother did or said any thing to the prisoner before he struck him - A. No. I was ten or twelve yards off him.</p>
               <p>DANIEL STENSON. I am a surgeon and man-midwife.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called in on this Saturday night - A. Yes, about nine o'clock at night, I found the deceased in a state of total insensibility.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it originate from - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any appearance of liquor upon him at all - A. None at all. I found him in a state of insensibility, with symptoms denoting concussion on the brain, the sensation of the pupils of the eye, sickness at the stomach, involuntary discharge of faces in the urine; notwithstanding the employment of every means he continued in a state of insensibility all Monday afternoon about four o'clock, when he expired. Upon examination of the head on Tuesday morning I found a considerable extraversation of blood on the left side of the brain, between the membrane of the brain, the dura pia mater, evidently arising from the rupture of the vessels at the back part of the brain; the brain was perfectly sound in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you form you opinion what caused those consequences - A. From a fall or falls.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether, if it had originated from any defect of the brain itself, would the brain have had that appearance - A. No, certainly the substance of the brain would have been alter'd, it would have been coagulated blood from the artery of the brain.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any external wound - A. The lip was cut through, and there was also a cut in the right eye-brow</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mr. Cooke, another surgeon, opened the brain with you - A. Yes, he is a medical man in the town.</p>

            . Q. You are a surgeon, I believe, at Brentford - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend and examine the deceased - A. Yes, I attended at the request of Mr. Stenson, the surgeon who opened the body. The appearance was extraversation of blood on the left side of the brain, and a preternatural distension of the membrane of the right side of the brain; that is all the unusual appearance that I observed; there was no external marks of violence on the scalp of the back of the head, no fracture of the scull, to the best of my recollection whatever. There was a lacerated wound over the eye-brow, and one on the lip without much contusion.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not have produced that effect upon the brain. - A. Upon my oath I could not declare that they would.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearances that you have described upon the brain, can you take upon yourself to say from what cause it could proceed. - A. Certainly not. I have opened a head, and I have seen others opened, in which blood has been extravasated upon the membrane of the brain as here, as well as in the substance of the brain, without any external violence, and for these reasons I would not positively say that a fall or blow occasioned it. My opinion is, in consequence of the knowledge I have acquired both from opening heads myself, seeing them opened, and from what I have read, that such appearances might have arisen from some particular internal cause as well as from an external cause.</p>
               <p>Q. If this rupture had taken place from any act during the fight, could the person have walked away from the place after the fight, in the manner as described, without any symptom of concussion of the brain. - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I will ask you whether if you thought the injury the boy received at that time, had caused his head to be in the state as you found on examination, whether if the vessel was ruptured at the time, he could have walked home without a symptom of concussion of the brain. - A. I do not think he could have walked home without a symptom.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the sickness at the public house was not a symptom.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The sickness has not been proved at the public house.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. to Smith. You accompanied the deceased to the public house. - A. Yes; he was very well at the public house; he drank beer with me there, then he walked home, about three hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that beer any effect upon the deceased, did it cause any sickness. - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him sick. - A. Yes; I asked him what it was; he said, he believed it was the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. By sickness do you mean that he vomited. - A. Yes, against the chemist's place; that was about ten minutes after he was gone from the public house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. to Mr. Gooke. Was not that symptom that you have just heard, almost a certain symptom of concussion of the brain. - A. Certainly, it is a usual symptom of concussion, but it might arise from another cause.</p>
               <p>Court. Might or might not such appearance as you have described about the brain, arise from a fall on the ground. - A. It might arise from that, I merely accompanied Mr. Stenson to examine the brain. I did not see him till he was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Stenson. Have you the means of knowing how long the lad had been home, before you saw him. - A. About ten minutes, I am not certain; one of the family came for me; when I saw him he was totally insensible, and I saw what he had vomited on the ground; he was in the act of vomiting when I came in; that was on the Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. How came you to accompany him to the public-house, instead of going home with him. - A. I asked him whether he would have any thing to drink, he said he would; he walked without help to the public-house, and also to his own home, and when he came out again he was taken to bed.</p>

On the 7th of March I first saw the prisoner at the Half Moon in Smithfield, he was sitting in the tap-room; a neighbour of mine asked him where he came from; the prisoner said he came from Wellington, he came away from there on account of a girl that his father would not let him marry; I asked him whether he would wish to go home; he replied, he had a great desire to do it, but he had no money; I told him if he would go home I would pay the coach-hire, which I did, and I told Mrs. Stokes, the landlady, that if there was any thing to pay I would see that it was paid.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day were you to go - A. I was not going with him; he was to go the next morning by ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner sleep - A. At the Half Moon; he did not sleep there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you retire to bed on the night of the 7th - A. Between eight and nine, I think.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18100411-40-person373">Q. </persName>
            Had you at the time that you went to bed, any money about you - A. Yes, a pocket book containing near three hundred pound bank of England notes. In all there was an hundred pound check, and two hundred and fifty nine pounds besides the check.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a five pound note amongst them besides the check - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed where did you put that pocket book containing that note, and the other notes - A. In my breeches pocket. I am sure I had it in my breeches pocket when I went to bed. I put my breeches under my pillow and went to bed</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again that night before you were called up - A. No, not after I went to bed, until I was called up; I was called up by Mr. Donn, near eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner some time afterwards at the watchhouse. When Mr. Donn called me I looked for my breeches; on my examining them my pocket book and notes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see your pocket book any where - A. In about half an hour after that I saw my pocket book at Mr. Donn's; it had got all the notes in it. Mr. Donn has that pocket book now.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom had you received that five pound note - A. From Mr. Cole in Smithfield. I can swear that I took it there, and I have no doubt it is my pocket book.</p>
               <p>MR. DONN. I am a butcher; I live in St. John-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor, Mr. Buswell - A. Yes; I had been in company with him about two or three hours before it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that night, on any occasion, see Mr. Buswell's pocket book - A I did; I saw his pocket book at the Half Moon. On that night the prisoner came to my house near nine o'clock, as I was shutting up my house, he came for some mutton chops; he had with him a pocket book, and a great deal of money in it; he was very tipsey; he paid for the mutton chops in silver; he asked me for something to drink, I told him he was not in a place to have any thing to drink. I I saw some companions with him, I did not think them of good character, I asked him in, and said I would send for some porter; he came in with me; I gave the mutton chops to the people that were with him, and told them to get them dressed, I would send him bye and bye. When he was in the parlour he took out the pocket book again, and began to pull out the notes; he asked whether one of the notes (a thirty pound note) was not a ten, which gave me suspicion; at last he gave me that bit of paper with Mr. Buswell's address on it. Then I questioned him about Mr. Buswell, and seeing that paper, and he having so much money, and hardly knowing what it was, it struck me that it was Mr. Buswell's. I slipped out and told our folks to see that he did not go out, and went to the Half Moon and spoke to Mr. Buswell, and when I came back, I said, young man, give me that pocket book, I know whose it is; he gave it me with the notes and every thing in it, just as it is. I saw Mr. Buswell's name in the pocket book: I sent for a constable, he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

On the evening of the 20th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I had just done supper, I had no company in the house, except one person that was at supper with me, and my wife; I heard a riot in the street, I went out and endeavoured to put my shutters up; there were a party of men fighting in the street, and before I could get the shutters up some of them pushed the tap-room door open and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How many came into your house - A. About eight or ten, the prisoner was one of them. On their coming in I left the shutters and returned into the house to endeavour to get them out; they were quarreling and fighting together; the prisoner was one that was fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the party been in your house that night - A. No, not one of them. In about five or ten minutes, by my persuading them not to fight, the prisoner and all his party, except the prisoner's wife, left my house; they were in two parties; three or four of the other party staid in the house, and the prisoner's wife. On Briant and his party, leaving the house I missed my hat, I went to the door and saw it on one of the men's head's, not the prisoner; they were on the threshold or the door just going out; I told the man it was my hat, and I took it off his head and gave it my wife, she put it in the bar; my wife put on the spring lock door and put it to; at this time the prisoner's wife was in the tap room, with three or four more; I persuaded her to go out of the house, she asked me to draw her a pint of beer; I told her I could not, if she would go home I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110026"/>send her some.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew her before - A. Yes, and him; they live within ten yards of my house. While I was talking to her, and persuading her to go out. I heard a pane of glass break in the tap-room, I opened the door to see who was breaking it; I saw the prisoner at the window, immediately I got out (the same instant) he turned from the window and struck me upon the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your hat on then - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he struck you with - A. No; I judged it to be some iron instrument; I could not see what it was. I turned into the house immediately; I found myself very badly wounded indeed in the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what manner you found yourself wounded - A. I felt the cut in my head, and the blood run very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner that gave you that blow - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there other people with him at the time - A. I saw no other; there was none near. When I got into the house, his wife then seeing me wounded, threw up one of the sashes and got out, and the other party that were left when Briant went out, went out at the back door. I then sent for a surgeon, Mr. Jackson,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of the prisoner that night - A. He continued twenty minutes or half an hour at the window, and broke the windows all to pieces; I saw him and spoke to him at the window; he said, through the window, he would massacre the first person that came out of the door. This was after I received the cut on my head, and after his wife got out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then go away, or was he taken in custody - A. He went away.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he lived near you - what is he - A. A coal-heaver.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the surgeon come - A. In half an hour, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you ever see any thing of the prisoner afterwards - A. The police officer brought him in my bed room about three o'clock in the morning, and the magistrate was with them. When the surgeon came to look at my wound he said it was dangerous, he wished to have further advice called in; he wished to have sir 
               <persName id="t18100411-41-person380">

            , and by the advice of sir William Blissard the magistrate was sent for to take my evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave your evidence about it - A. Yes. The prisoner denied it, and said it was not him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what instrument he had in his hand when he struck you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any instrument in his hand while he was in your house - A. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Was it not before you received the injury that the woman attempted to get out of the window - A. After I received the injury, it was. I persuaded her to go out of the door before, and she would not.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said it was only one blow that you received - A. Only one blow.</p>
               <p>MR. JACKSON. Q. You are a surgeon - A. Yes; on Wapping-wall. On the night of the 26th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was called upon to go to the prosecutor's house; I went there, he was bleeding when I saw him; he appeared to have lost a great deal of blood; the blood was proceeding from the side of his head; upon examining the wound I found a large wound through the bone; it had gone through the bone on the side of the head.</p>
               <p>Q. What breadth might it be - A. Very near a quarter of an inch, and it separated the membrane over the brain, not the one underneath that lines the scull.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, could you form a judgment what sort of an instrument it had been inflicted with - A. It appeared to have been done with an edged instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment what sort of an edged instrument - A. It appeared to have been done with a piece of iron that had been blunt.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean a broad piece of iron - A. It diverged from the edge to the back of it, whatever it had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not very deep this wound - A. It went through the bone; the membrane underneath it was not divided.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say it was inflicted with an instrument contrived for cutting - A. That I cannot exactly say; there was no contusion; it was an incised wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of a fracture of the scull at all - A. No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for saying it must have been an instrument with a blunt edge - 
               <persName id="t18100411-41-person381">A. </persName>
            Because the membrane underneath it, not being divided, must have been separated from the bone.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your distinction between not being divided, and its being separated - 
               <persName id="t18100411-41-person382">A. </persName>
            Because if the instrument had been sharp it would have cut through it, and, not being divided, but separated from the bone from being pressed down.</p>
               <p>Q. Then am I to understand you from being pressed down, a blunt bar of iron might have created such an appearance - A. If there had been an edge to it.</p>
               <p>Q. The edge of a blunt bar of iron might have done it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us the breadth of it was near a quarter of an inch, what was the length of it - A. About an inch and a half.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18100411-41-person383">Q. </persName>
            Would a cutlass produce a wound of that sort - I think it might if it was blunt.</p>

            But would there have been such an appearance, the breadth and length of it by a proper cutting instrument - A. No; I think it must have gone deeper, and and not have been so broad,</p>

               <p>Q. When you found him, was he in bed. - A. Yes, I got into the house the back way; I broke into his room, and found him and his wife in bed; I apprehended him. I found by his bed side this rusty old cutlass; it is in the same state now as when I found it. I could not see any appearance of blood upon it; I took him to the prosecutor's house, where the magistrate took the information. I have part of a window-frame<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110027"/>from the prosecutor's house; it appears to have been cut with the same sort of instrument; it is a part of a window-frame; it laid inside of the house, under the settle; there was a number of pieces; but none appeared to have any cut in it except that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, as I was coming home, I was surrounded by a parcel of men; I did not know who they were; they knocked me, and kicked me in the mud. I was taken home afterwards by some friends that came up and interfered; I know nothing further; I was speechless.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this horse that was lost by Curtis - A. Yes, I bought it of the prisoner at the bar on the Wednesday before Christmas; I gave him a guinea and a half for it. He was very poor when I bought him; I thought he might get a little better; I lit on him just at the corner of Worship-street; I asked him if he was going to sell this horse; he said, yes; he asked three guineas and a half; I bid him twenty-shillings five, and when he came to Sun-street, I gave him a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the horse you bought of Ingram the prisoner - A. I kept the horse about a week, and sold it to Mr. Mash for a guinea and a half again. Mr. Mash had it, and I had it again soon afterwards; he could not do any thing with it; he was going to knock it on the head; I bought it again; I had the horse at home about a week, and then I had it owned by Mr. Tomkins; he met me in the road; he said the horse belonged to Curtis; he would bring him down in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver the horse to Curtis. - A. Yes, they took me to Worship-street, and there they identified the horse to be Mr. Curtis.</p>

On the 24th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Gay, in Chancery-lane, and gave him two one-pound notes. I took the number and date of them, and requested him to give them to Mrs. Gay, and for Mrs. Gay to go and lay them out at my shop. I returned home at about half past eleven in the morning. When I came in, I asked the prisoner what he had sold. He gave me an account of different articles which I set down in this book, as we always do of the money that we put in the till. He gave me an account of one pair of silk stockings, having sold them for fifteen shillings, and several articles that I cannot enumerate, to the amount of about five pound; he told me there was nothing else to set down. I returned to Mrs. Gay, to know what articles she had bought with the two one-pound notes, and then I returned home, and sent for an officer. The officer went into the back-room. I then came out into the shop, and stated to the prisoner that there was money short in the till; he referred me to the book, and told me that the till and the book would correspond, if I examined them. I told him there was money short, and I missed it. I desired the prisoner to walk into the back-room, where the constable was; he did so; I desired the constable to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched him, what did you conceive that there was too short - A. A one-pound note, not accompted for. Upon searching him, there was found three guinea, a few shillings, and that one-pound note; before the constable examined the note, I told what number it ought to be, and the date. When the note was examined, it was the same number and date I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110028"/>mentioned. The prisoner acknowledged that he had stolen it: I desired the constable to walk into the shop; I then told the prisoner I had strong reasons to suspect his conduct for some time; now I could prove it so; as he could not deny if, I should be glad if he could tell me to what amount he had robbed me at various times. His answer was, that he had never robbed me but of a five-shilling and a seven shilling-piece before that one-pound note, and that he meant to return that one-pound note on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>JAMES GAY. I am a baker; I live in Chancery-lane. On the morning of the 24th of March, Mr. Nicholson called on me; he delivered me two one-pound notes, with directions for Mrs. Gay to lay them out at his shop; I gave the two same notes to my wife.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GAY. On the morning of the 24th of March, my husband gave me two one-pound notes; I went to Mr. Nicholson's, and laid them out. I bought of the prisoner with these two one-pound notes six pair of cotton stockings and one pair of silk; they came to 1 l. 16 s.; he gave me four shillings change.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nicholson When you asked the prisoner for the account of what he had sold, did he give you any account of six pair of cotton stockings - A. No, he did not account for them. I entered the account that he gave me; the six pair of cotton stockings are not entered in the book; they came to a guinea; here is one pair of silk entered.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and man-midwife. About three o'clock in the morning, in the middle of last month, I was called to attend Mary Burton; I went to her house, I saw her all over blood; I found she had received several wounds on the face, and on the side of her neck they were most of them superficial wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the wounds upon her face first of all - A. Both the lips, the right side of the mouth was partly gone, it appeared to have been torn off, the cheek was very much lacerated and, confused, the integument on the left there were marks of teeth; on the right it had not penetrated at all. The margin of the left ear had been very much torn. On the right side of the neck she seemed to have a wound made, I judged from a fork, one of the prongs had penetrated a little better than an inch; there were no wounds of any importance on the right side; there was a wound which might have been done with a fork, or it might have been done with a pointed instrument, it had penetrated about an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there two punctures or only one - A. There were two punctures, they were so near together they appeared to have been done with a fork. She was scratched as if he had been using his nails. There were two or three other punctures, the depth of them were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110033"/>about the tenth part of an inch.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the worst wound that I understand from you was this wound that had penetrated about an inch - A. Yes. It was in a mascular part of the neck; I did not perceive it of any great danger.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two punctures there, were they of equal depth - A. No, one was very trifling; I found a difficulty in introducing the probe.</p>
               <p>Q. Then none of the wounds arising from this pointed instrument were dangerous - A. No, not at that time; I could not foresee what inflammation might arise.</p>
               <p>Q. From where did this hemorrage arise - A. From the lip, I think.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutrix had lived with me fourteen days, and on this night we were both half intoxicated, we went home together, and afterwards went out again to other public houses, and had more drink; I was very much intoxicated; we went to bed together; she bit my finger, here is the mark; she catched hold of me in a tender part, and I, feeling great pain, did bite her; she scratched me, and we fought together. I do not know any thing about the fork. I, being intoxicated, did not know what I was about.</p>

            . I keep the Seven Stars. On the 17th of March the prisoner and the prosecutrix were together in my house the best part of the evening, they were neither of them sober; she came in again at twelve o'clock, she was very much intoxicated, she fell down in the tap-room; and last Saturday she said she could not tell whether she took the fork first or he, or how it happened.</p>
               <p>MR. GARSTONEY. I am an Italian I went to see the prisoner in Newgate, the prosecutrix was there, they ate and drank together, both of them seemed very sorry, and they kissed each other.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it this happened - A. I cannot tell the day of the month, nor the day of the week; it was last month, the constable has got the day down. It was near six o'clock in the afternoon, Steadman came in and asked to look at some lace that I had in the window, Gray came in while I was shewing Steadman the lace, she asked for a pennyworth of shirt buttons; Steadman said that she would not take the lace then, she would ask her sister first; I told her that it was half a crown a yard. As I was putting the lace in the window again I saw

The velvet belonged to a lady, and the velvet bonnet was for a pattern, it was to be made like it. Steadman went away without the lace; I stopped Gray and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing to the other prisoner - A. I saw her bustle close up to her before Steadman went out of the shop.</p>

            . On the evening of the 15th of March Bly brought Gray to the office. From information, a week afterwards, we apprehended Steadman in a court in Whitecross-street, she at first denied her name was Steadman, I told her I was not satisfied, she then said it was Steadman. I searched her house and found nothing. I told her Gray said she was the woman that went with her to the shop in Albemarle-street, where there was some velvet lost,</p>
               <p>"Oh, said she, she has told of me, has she, now I'll tell how she lives, and all her family, they live by smashing," that is, passing of bad money. I took her to the office.</p>
               <p>Gray's Defence. I am in the bonnet making way, and having lost my place of work I went to seek another, and coming up Albemarle-street I saw a bonnet shop, I went in and asked the prosecutrix for work; I told her who I worked for, and the length of time, she approved of it. On the next Monday I went in again, there were several people in the shop, I waited for an opportunity to speak to the lady, and when these people were gone out of the shop, she asked me if I had taken a piece of velvet, or a piece of ribbon, I told her I had not taken either.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that this was on the Monday - A. Yes, on the blessed ensuing Monday; she insisted upon searching me; I told her she was wellcome, I did not come in with intent to rob her. I was searched, and what halfpence I had they took away; I was taken to Clerkenwell. I sent my friends to her, she said, if I would pay for the velvet, and the expences, she would not appear against me; I said, why should I pay for a thing that I am innocent of, I would rather stand my trial.</p>
               <p>Steadman's Defence. I am totally innocent; I never saw the prosecutrix nor the shop before this gentleman took me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. She did not call on the Monday, and when she came on the Friday she never mentioned any thing about work. She sent her father frequently to me, I sent word that I had put it in the law, I could not do any thing in it.</p>

             in the act of pulling out ear-rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before that - A. Yes, on the 6th of March. I saw Donald Forsyth endeavouring to push out a piece of glass in the shop window, he could not do it on account of the putty being so hard; the pane of glass had been cracked before, there was no hole in it; upon my seeing him attempting to do this he was followed down the Strand, he was by himself; that is all I saw then. On the 7th of March, about one o'clock, I saw

             in the act of taking out the ear-rings; the other prisoner was standing by him at the time; he had a hook wire. The glass had been previously pushed out, I did not see it pushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him move any thing - A. One earring. I had observed the window half an hour before, the piece of glass was not pushed out then. We were watching the window every half hour, expecting he would come.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you observed him take out an ear-ring with an hooked wire - A. He 
               <persName id="t18100411-47-person519">drew</persName>
             the ear-ring to the front of the tray in which it was laying, there was no glass in the front of the tray, and when he

             the ear-ring to the front of the tray he put his finger within the window and took it out; the two other rings that were found on him were previously taken out; Mr. Field went out of doors, took them both, and brought them into the shop.</p>


               <p>Q. At the time that Forsyth was doing this, what did Doran do - A. He appeared to be covering him, he was dressed in a soldiers great coat, standing close to him. I saw the prisoners searched when the officer came, three ear-rings were found upon Forsyth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that ear-ring found upon him that you saw him take out of the shop - A. It was. Doran had his forefinger cut, it appeared to have been recently done.</p>

            . I am an assistant to Mr. Miers. On the 6th of March I saw Forsyth leave the window, and after he had gone five or six paces I saw Doran join him: I followed them along the Strand, they went up Southampton-street. On the 7th, about one o'clock, I saw Forsyth at the window; I had observed the window about a quarter of an hour before that time, there was only a simple crack in the glass, no hole whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. After you observed the boy Forsyth there what further did you observe - A. I observed that they were both very close to the window, I called to young Mr. Miers to come to observe what they were doing, while I went to the door, and when I went to the door I laid hold of them both and brought them in; I stepped in between them and took them one in each hand. I took this hooked wire from Forsyth.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is Mr. Miers's house in - A. In the precinct of the Savoy, that is connected with St. Mary-le-Strand; the poor rates are collected by the officers in the Savoy parish.</p>

             was the last of them; I was alone, he came up by the side of me, I felt a blow on my side; the other persons had passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any other person, in the situation in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110035"/>he was to you, give you that blow but the prisoner - A. No; no other person was near enough to give me that blow but the prisoner; I immediately perceived my watch-chain, seals, and key, were gone; I called to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. A gold watch key - A. Yes; the seals were gold and the chain was gold.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you perceived a blow on your side - A. It was a blow, I supposed, merely to draw of my attention.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a blow, not a mere push - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a blow to hurt you - A. It gave me pain for the moment; it rather stunned me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch - A. I had; the watch held in my pocket; I imagine the chain gave way, in attempting to draw out the watch; it did not remove the watch from my fob. I called out to the watchman; I followed the prisoner; he ran very hard for 50 yards; I never lost sight of him; I was never more than two or three yards off him; he was stopped at the end of the lane by the watchman; he was met in the lane by the watchman; he turned back, and ran up a yard, where, in consequence of his falling, he was taken. I came up to him while he was on the ground, and assisted the watchman in securing him. The chain, key, and seals were never found.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he struck you, when the persons were coming up the lane with him, were they near enough for him to have any communication with them. - A. I should have thought not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your chain and seal since - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark or light night - A. It was directly under a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the atmosphere - A. It was neither very dark or light.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are quite sure that you never lost sight of him from the time that you felt him snatch the chain. - A. He was never more than two or three yards before me; I am sure the man I secured is the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. And snatched the chain - A. Yes; I supposed he snatched the chain; there was nobody but him near me to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at all see whether the other persons who came up the lane at the same time joined company afterwards with him - A. They did not afterwards; I went one way, and they the other.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Giles's. About half past one, me and another patrol was in Drury-lane; we heard the alarm of Stop thief! I have lost my watch. The alarm came from the corner of the coal-yard in Drury-lane; the prisoner ran down the coal-yard; me and my partner pursued him; we saw him instantly the alarm was given; the prosecutor was following of him; the prisoner turned down a short turning in the coal-yard, where there was no thoroughfare; he was running; we secured him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What charge did the prosecutor make against him then - 
               <persName id="t18100411-48-person530">A. </persName>
            He laid his charge of the seal, key, and chain; he thought he had lost his watch, but he had not; when he put his hand to his waistband, he found his watch remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe in what way, he had lost it - A. Yes; he said the prisoner came and gave him a blow on the side; and he lost the chain at the same moment. This was in the prisoner's hearing; the prisoner said he knew nothing of it; he was innocent. I searched for the chain and seal; I could not find it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the cry of stop thief - A. I did; I was almost close to the prisoner; I saw him when the alarm was given; he was running, and the prosecutor close to him; I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner ever out of your sight before you secured him - A. Yes, about two minutes. The prosecutor and the prisoner were running; I could not mistake him for another person; the prosecutor said he had robbed him of his chain and seal, and at the watch-house he said he gave him a blow on the side before he took the watch-chain from him; the prisoner denied the charge in toto; we looked for the watch-chain and seals; we could not find it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL ROBERTS. I am the keeper of the watch-house; when the prisoner was brought in; I searched him nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday the 3d of March I left work, about seven o'clock in the evening; I went to Mr. Knight's, an ironmonger in Foster-lane, to purchase a bit of copper to finish my work the next week, and coming up Holborn. I called in a strange public house that I never was in before; I had a pint of porter, and hearing a few songs sung caused me to stop till between twelve and one o'clock. When I left the public house I lit with a couple of young women that I never saw before, they asked me to give them a glass of something to drink, I did so, they took me to a public house facing of Hatton Garden; I stood outside of the door, where there were several more people standing; I took a walk a little way with these two young women and after I left them I went down a turning which brought me into a coal-yard, a man came running towards me. I heard the cry of stop thief, I went to run towards him, he knocked me down, and when I got up the watchman stopped me, and the gentleman accused me of robbing him. I was all over mud, and no one was nigh me till I got up, and then the watchman came and stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Can you be certain that there was no person near him when you were pursuing him, could any person be running to knock him down - A. No; I deny it upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. to Baker. Did the prosecutor appear to you to be at all intoxicated - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner - A. I could not discover any thing in him; he acted very consistent, he appeared to be sober.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character</p>

On Friday night, the 16th of March, I had spent my evening at a public house in Leather-lane, I was rather the worse for liquor: and at twelve o'clock I was returning home through Long Acre, I was met by the prisoner and another, she was very different in habit then; I did not speak to them; I was walking along as fast as I could, the prisoner came before me and asked me where I was going, I told her, home; she laid hold of my arm and walked three or four paces with me, the other woman staid behind. The prisoner got me on the opposite side of the way in Long Acre, she asked me to go with her, I refused; she there pulled me on a step of a door.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose half lovingly and half violently - A. I suppose that was the case on her side. She sat herself by the side of me; I walked on to the former side of the street to perform my former course, I did not perceive her following me till I reached the pathway; we came near to the corner of James-street, leading to Covent Garden, she till trying to persuade me to go with her, she caught hold of my arm by the side of her and drew me half towards her, near to an area railing, then I instantly missed something; I clapped my hand upon my side and missed my watch; the prisoner immediately ran away across Long Acre, and the first house she came to she put the watch down the area. I was close to her, pursuing her, I caught hold of her by her upper garment, she tore away and left her handkerchief in my hand; I pursued her, she was taken in custody by a watchman that came up; by that time the other woman came up, I gave charge of her. My watch is in charge of the watchhouse keeper, the watchman and watchhouse-keeper got it out of the area.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN M'DOWELL. I am a watchman. About the hour of twelve I heard a scuffle, when I got up to it I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner, the prosecutor charged the prisoner with robbing him of his watch, he said, she had put it down an area. I afterwards found the watch by his directions. I took charge of the women. Mr. Roberts has the watch.</p>
               <p>- ROBERTS. Q. Was this woman brought to in charge by the prosecutor - A. Yes; and by his directions I found the watch; I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Long Acre, this man took me by the arm, he said he should wish to go home with me, I told him I was not fit; he was quite intoxicated; he asked me to have something to drink; I told him I could not drink any thing, and as we were coming up Belton-street he staggered and let the watch fall, I picked it up; he got hold of me and tore me all to pieces; he drew his knife out and cut me after he knocked me down; I got up and ran away. When the watchman catched hold of me, I said, do not hold me, he pulled out the watch, and I will tell you where it is.</p>
               <p>M'Dowell. The prisoner was not cut; she had cut her hand by a fall on the stones.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to the hair dresser in Essex-street, Whitechapel, with intent of having my hair cut, and finding the house full, I went to the Catherine Wheel public-house and called for a pint of beer; the prisoner brought me a pint of beer; I thought her to be a servant in the house, but she did not prove to be so; she sat down by the side of me; we had a little conversation together. She then persuaded me to go over the way with her, I told her if she went out first I would follow her; she went out and in about five minutes I followed her out, she stood opposite of the house; we went up the court into a house, we were together in the house about ten minutes and then I missed my watch; I charged her with taking it, she denied it; she stripped, and nothing was found. Two watchmen came in, and the watch was found up the chimney. There was no one in the room to take the watch but her.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at home when your house was broken open and the property stolen - A. I was, my son was at home, my wife and servant. On Thursday the 8th of March, between the hours of twelve and one in the day time, I was in my accompting-house adjoining my shop backwards; I was there writing; there is a glass door between the shop and the accompting house with a curtain, the curtain was half drawn; my son had just come in before and shut the shop door after him, my wife had been sitting in the shop untill about two minutes before this business happened; I thought I heard a noise in the shop, I turned my head, I saw the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the man you saw was the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I saw him in the act of folding up the goods as they lay on the counter. I was surprized within myself, thinking whether I had sent for the cloth-worker to come and dress them, I recollect and had not; the prisoner left the shop, I followed him into the street, he walked very deliberatly up the street, I do not think he saw me; I did not speak to him untill I got up to him he had not got more than fifteen yards, he was just going to turn into the gate of the Church-yard when I came up to him; my intention was to knock him down; he just saw me, and dropped the goods in the street and ran off; I gave the alarm, he got a little the head of me; he escaped across the Church-yard, and ran into Rose street: he there came in contact with a man and was throwed down, he got up and went up Bird-in-hand-court, there he was stopped; I was not in sight, I came up about three minutes after he was taken. I laid hold of him, and insisted upon his going to Bow-street; he said, do not hurt me, Sir, he was secured; my son picked up the cloth.</p>

            When you went back did you find any of your premises broken - A. No, the latch had been lifted up, it is a common latch, he must have opened the door and came in.</p>
               <p>Q. However you were not in the shop to see it was actually closed - A. No, nor do I know the latch was actually closed, none of the windows were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of cloth was it - A. Twenty-two yards of superfine blue cloth, I value it at 35 l. I set it down 32 l. It cost me that.</p>

            Yes, I was in the accompting house when the prisoner came into the shop, I saw him going out of the shop with the cloth in his hand: I am sure the prisoner is the man; my father walked gently after him, when my father came up to him the prisoner turned round and looked at my father, and his countenance changed, he dropped the goods and ran off; I picked up the cloth and took it home; I went out again and saw him in custody, I knew the cloth to be my father's.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SMITH. I am shopman to Mr. Roberts, a linen-draper opposite of Mr. Attwood's house. On the morning mentioned in the indictment I was with Mr. Roberts in our shop, we noticed the piece of blue cloth in the prisoner's arms; Mr. Attwood followed him, we thought all was not right; I heard him cry out stop thief; I immediately ran out, and pursued the prisoner until he was stopped, and when I came up to him I took charge of him; I lost sight of him in the court, and at the turning of Rose-street; I am certain he is the man, I saw him come out of Mr. Attwood's shop with the cloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the cloth, it is mine, I have had it ever since, I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The cloth has grown, has got four yards bigger since I came from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. That is very impertinent of you, you are tried upon a capital charge; the question is whether you stole it all. - A. No, Sir, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course your trunk or portmanteau was there - A. Yes. On Monday night, January the 8th, returning to my lodgings, I was as usual lighted up into my room by the chamberlain; I immediately missed my trunk, I had left it on a hair in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not left your door locked I suppose - A. I had not; I had a coat and a pair of pantaloons hanging over the same chair that the trunk stood on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see any part of your property that you had lost - A. Yes, I did it might be the second day after this happened; this happened before I left town; I was upon the eve of leaving London, and after I had left I received notice from the Hummums that my watch had been stopped at a pawnbroker at Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left your watch hanging up - A. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110038"/>in my trunk, it was a silver hunting watch, my trunk was locked and I had the key in my pocket, my watch was out of repair I brought it up with me, my intention was to have it put in repair.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that watch - A. It cost me eight guineas and a half at Wigg and Moss's, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had possession of your watch when you saw it again - A. I saw it at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you knew it - A. I knew it because I had been to the watch-makers to get the number, and it corresponded with the number; the watch is here, I have it in my possession. There was a coat and a pair of pantaloons were brought to Bow-street, I was confident they were mine; I could not swear to them, the buttons had been taken off, and coloured buttons put on, and having no private mark I could not swear to them.</p>

            . I live at 123, Swallow-street: I am a salesman, on the 10th of January, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop with a coat and a pair of pantaloons, they were tied up in a handkerchief, and the watch he took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before this time. - A. Oh yes, perfectly; he asked me five pound for the coat, pantaloons, and the watch altogether; first of all he said he wanted to sell the coat and the pantaloons, then he said I want a little money, I think I shall sell the watch, I do not fancy it. I gave him four pound for them all.</p>
               <p>Q. You asked him no questions about them - A. No, because I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him his name, or did you know it. - A. I did not ask him his name; it is not usual to ask a persons name that buy cloaths of us, it might affront them, I never asked him his name. He shewed me the duplicate of a watch pawned for two guineas and a half; he said, he liked that better then that one, and that was the reason that he was going to part with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that watch after you bought it. - A. I just happened to want a little cash a day or two afterwards; I went into Mr. Dobree's shop that I knew I am in the habit of pledging things when I want money, he shewed me a bill that it had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to pledge it then. - A. Exactly so, I told him that I had bought it with a coat and a pair of pantaloons; I was taken to Bow-street, and the next day I was liberated. I described the prisoner at Bow-street; I had dealings with him before in selling him clothes, but never bought of him before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up. - A. About a fortnight after, that I believe; the officer came and let me know that they had a man of the description I had given of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the watch. - A. The magistrate made me give it over to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was apprehended in about a fortnight, you had notice given you from the office, you went there. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner is the man from whom you had the watch in the way you have described. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other articles, the coat and pantaloons. - A. The other articles I had given me back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you altered them. - A. They were not altered by me, I only beat and brushed them and smoothed them with an iron, that is all I did.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street; from information, I went to the Dolphin public-house in the Haymarket, there I apprehended the prisoner in February, he lodged there; I searched him and found nothing upon him; I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Have you got that watch. - A. Yes, this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it. - A. Between five and six years.</p>
               <p>Q. The maker told you what number it was, independant of that did you know the watch. - A. Yes, independant of that I could swear to the watch, it cost me eight guineas and a half.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110039"/>Q. You never saw the trunk again, I suppose. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there a great many other things in the trunk. A. Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The watch that I sold to Myers in Swallow-street, I had it of captain Graham, of St. James's coffee house, and the pantaloons and the great coat belonged to him, they were his old ones that were thrown off; the watch I had in my possession a twelvemonth or better; I was short of money, I went and sold them; the watch I sold him was not a hunting watch. I asked him five pound for the coat, pantaloons, and the watch, he bid me three guineas; I said I would not take it; he afterwards said he would give me four pound; I took the money and left the watch, coat, and pantaloons; it was better than two months before I heard of this; I dressed my master and went to the Talbot Inn to dine, dinner was there always ready at two o'clock. After dinner was over the officers came in, I went to Bow-street with them, they said they had a detainer against me; I went before the magistrate, Myers without looking at me swore I sold the watch to him, and the person at the Hummums swore he saw me in the house; the magistrate asked if the gentleman was in town, this man said he was not, I was detained till Saturday, on Saturday I saw the gentleman, he swore the watch was his; I was turned over at the next sessions and remained till now.</p>

In consequence of information from the servant maid I went up stairs, the prisoner's box stood on the landing-place, the prisoner went up stairs, and Mr. Percival with me, I opened his box in his presence, I immediately discovered nine yards of Irish linen, it was cut in a very aukward manner, the outside shop mark was cut off; I found a number of pieces of muslin cut into square handkerchiefs, I think there were ten, there were no marks upon them; I also found a silver table spoon broke in two, the other spoon was not found till after the prisoner was taken in custody, the broken spoon I found in the prisoner's box, it was an old family spoon with my father and mother's initials upon it; I have not the smallest doubt of it being my spoon. The prisoner used to clean the plate, he had been repeatedly asked whether he had taken them down with the knives, he always protested that he never had; I asked him how he came by the Irish cloth, he said that he had purchased it of Mr. Stary, his late employer; Mr. Stary is a wholesale linen draper. I told him it was too fine for his wear, and in the next place I did not believe he sold any article of that kind; he repeated that he got it from Mr. Stary, and the muslin handkerchiefs he brought out of the country.</p>

            Did they appear to have been worn - A. Never, it was quite new. The broken spoon he was at a loss to account for. I asked him about the other spoon that was missing, he said he never saw it. I told him I meant to be lenient.</p>

               <p>Q. You recollect the time when the prisoner's box was searched - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had there been any spoon missing. - A. Near three weeks, I asked the prisoner whether he had taken them by a mistake of any kind, he said he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. The box stood on the landing-place, all the servants had access to it. - A. No one had been there but me from the time that he left the key in the shop, that was about an hour before it was discovered; I knew it by going up to the sink; I looked in the prisoner's box before he came up, the first thing I saw was the table spoon broken in two with my master's father's name on it; I knew the spoon from using it, the spoon was in a bit of paper on the top part of the box, I saw the linen and muslin there, I informed my master.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. You had the curiosity to look in the box, you expected to find a Valentine there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Percival. Q. You are in the employment of Messrs. Bells - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up when the prisoner was charged with this - A. Yes, I went up stairs, the prisoner's box was opened; on opening the box we first discovered the spoon, the prisoner was present; in turning up his clothes in his box we found nine yards of Irish linen, the outside mark was cut off. When we have got a whole piece of cloth, and a person does not take the whole piece, we put a pencil mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then find on any part of these pieces of cloth your own mark - A. I did, at one end of it. It was cut into a yard, two yards, and two yards and a half, to elude detection; I know my own mark.</p>

On Friday the 9th of March, about half after ten in the evening, I and my wife were going home. We met the prisoner; she asked us to let her have a lodging for that night; we permitted her to come for that night; we got home about twenty minutes before eleven. I went to bed first, and did not awake till the morning, and then the prisoner was gone. On the Thursday following I found her, I charged her with taking away a cloak, apron and a pair of shoes, she had the shoes on her feet.</p>

            . Q. You had known this young woman before this matter happened, had not you. - A. Yes, I consented to her staying in our apartment on Friday night, the 9th of March. We all of us went to bed as soon as we went home; the prisoner laid down in her cloaths; I locked the door myself; between twelve and one she begged to go down to the privy, she went down and left my room door open; I expected her coming up again, she did not return. I went out in the morning before it was light, she was not in the room, then I missed my cloak apron and shoes. On the Thursday following my husband found her; I was fetched, she had my shoes on her feet, I knew they were mine, I had only bought them the day before; the cloak and apron had been pawned. I saw the duplicates of them, the cloak was worth sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner bore a good character, or else you would not have taken her in. - A. I had not seen her for three or four years, her husband is at sea.</p>

After they left the shop Solomon's boy came in, I followed them and overtook them in Denmark-street, about fifty yards from the shop. They were together standing against a wall; they both were holding some print in their hands, Smith was assisting Brown to put it under her gown. I took the print from them, and told them it was my master's property. I told them to walk back. I laid hold of Brown, and the other followed after.

               <p>Q. At that time had you any particular ear rings - A. Yes, twelve pair that I bought, and never shewed them to any one. I put them in a drawer underneath the window; nobody in the shop knew any thing of them but myself and wife. I never had any ear-rings of that pattern before nor since. I missed a pair of these ear-rings on the 7th of March. I accused the prisoner of taking them. I asked her to let me look in her boxes, she has two boxes; she brought forth a box with a broken lock upon it, and the things were all turned out, there was nothing there, she unlocked the other box and the first thing that she bid her hand upon was a bit of paper in the middle of the box, she turned the things out with her left hand, I asked her what she held so tight in her right hand, she said, they are my own, I have had them some time, with that, one of the ear-rings fell on the floor I picked it up, I said, these are the ear-rings that I am looking for, they are mine, she then turned round and cried and said she would fetch her father.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe her father came and was too warm, and that induced you to prosecute - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been some difference between you and her father - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did some work for you, you thought he charged too much - A. I told him if he would go to any shopkeeper, and the price they would charge I would give him; he had charged me a great price.</p>
               <p>Q. She went home to her father and came back with her father; no officer was fetched until her father had been - A. No.</p>

I was present when the prisoner's boxes were searched; we found nothing in her first box, in the second I observed her take out a piece of paper which she kept in her hand. I asked her what she had in her hand, she said they are not yours, I have had them some time; one of the earrings fell on the floor, Mr. Steele picked it up, and it proved to be the pair of ear-rings that we had missed. She began to cry and said she knew nothing of them, and never saw the ear-rings before, she said Mr. Steele must have broke open her box and put them in to make her out a thief; she would go and fetch her father, which she did; her father came and abused Mr. Steele very much, and said he must have put them in the box; the constable has got the ear-rings</p>

On the 12th of February between ten and eleven o'clock at night, just as the people was coming out of Covent-garden Theatre, I apprehended Hart at the office door. I followed him about an hour and a half before that and saw him in the act of picking pockets, I saw him take this handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, I think it is this because it was damp at one corner, the name appeared to have been bit out by the damp at the corner as though it had been put in the mouth to bite the name out. I did not take the prisoner in custody when I saw him take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, I let him be till the mob was almost dispersed, I am sure the prisoner is the man, I followed him different nights from the 5th to the 10th, I found two handkerchiefs upon him, I cannot swear positively that this is the handkerchief, he was apprehended on the 6th for picking a gentleman's pocket, he was discharged; when I first saw him in the evening he was standing at the entrance of the play-house going into the pit.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the gentleman whose pocket he picked - A. I do not know, there was no gentleman came forward to own the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know the gentleman that you described having his pocket picked - A. No, I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder and asked him if he had not had his pocket picked, he said he had he lost a yellow handkerchief out of his pocket, he said he would come to the office to-morrow at eleven o'clock, he did not give his name or address. It was a yellow handkerchief that I saw him take.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Mr. Lack the officer took me into Bow-street he said that White took that handkerchief, that handkerchief is worn out, it is not bitten out in the corner, he told me in Bow-street office he would endeavour to transport me because I was a <rs id="t18100411-61-deflabel340" type="occupation">jew</rs>

               <p>Court. Q. to Lack. Did you say that you saw White pick the gentleman's pocket - A. No, White was taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110042"/>up by a gentleman and given to me, the prisoner said both these handkerchiefs were his own.</p>

I called her at six, she said it was too early; about seven she got up, had her breakfast and went away; she came back in half an hour for me to lend her twopence to buy some hemp, I gave her the twopence, she went away and I went out to work; on my coming home I saw her by the Admiralty, I stopped to see whether she was going into the place where she said she worked at, she passed by it; I went up to her and asked her the reason of her telling me such a falsehood, I found my gown wrapped up in a sheet under her arm; I asked her how she came to take it, she said she could not get work at the shop unless she paid her footing; I took them from her, I forced her home with me, and then I found another sheet and a shift upon her. On the Friday she had sold the shift to me for two shillings, and on the Saturday she took it.</p>

I then sat down on the chair and she sat on my knee; she pulled my watch out of my pocket, I had no suspicion of her absconding, with that I took off my clothes and was going to bed, and at that time she took the opportunity of leaving the room. I did not see her again till ten o'clock the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some money besides, how came that to be taken - A. I cannot tell at what period I lost that money, I had it in my pocket when I went into the room, and when I came out I had it not.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the next morning about ten o'clock, the prosecutor pointed her out to me, she was sitting below stairs at breakfast with a man and four women; he said this prisoner robbed him of his watch and money, she said she had never saw him, he said he could positively swear to her, there was another girl he said came up into the room and turned him out, I took them both to the watch-house, I searched their pockets, there was nothing found upon them.</p>

The key that I had found on me was the key of my lodging, every lodger in the house gives the landlady a shilling for the key to open the door themselves if they stay out late.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he get into the house - A. I do not know how he got into the lower part of the house, but in my room he had broken the lath and plaster partion to get his arm in to undo the lock of my door. When I had observed him about ten minutes as I sat up in the bed, I then called to him to know what he was about, he had then got a tea-chest in his hand; on my jumping out of bed and calling to him he dropped the tea-chest and flew out of the door, I found myself not able to follow him, I threw up the window and gave the alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was your apartment in - A. The two pair of stairs front room; by my giving the alarm he was taken in the street. On my looking about the room there was nothing taken out of the room; this hat was taken off the place where I left it and put by the door: this coat that I have on was on the bed, he put it close to the door and the tea-chest was moved, in fact I did not lose any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him take the coat off the bed - A. No, my wife waked me, we heard a noise like the rats making a noise, I suppose that was the time of his breaking the laths, we supposed that he got in on the evening, the door had been left on the latch for a lodger that was gone out.</p>

            . I live at 38, Stanhope-street, in the first floor in the same house that Mr. Fox keeps, I came home about one o'clock, or a few minutes after, I put to the street-door and went to bed. I am confident I latched the street-door. There are four lodgers in the house. I was awoke by the alarm of stop thief, I heard the watchman's rattle spring, I heard the man brought back to the door; I heard Minns cry out why do not you come down, this is the house he came out of; the next morning I saw the hole in the lath and plaster that the prisoner had made, I never saw the prisoner in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. You did not see the man's face, you said - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not observe his person at all - A. Yes, he had a brown coat on and a yellow blue-striped waistcoat on, that is the same man that was brought back to me in less than five minutes; I was certain to his person when he was brought back; I never saw his face before.</p>

I did not look for it till Saturday afternoon; and on that Saturday afternoon, about half-past two o'clock, she went to fetch the pots in as I thought; she never returned. I went up stairs and missed my pellise.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the 27th. A young man met her opposite of the monument, and he brought her to the Duchess of York.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMAS. I am a servant to Mr. Flemming Fleet-market. On the 17th of February between twelve and four the prisoner pledged this pellise. I lent her 17 s. on it.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON. I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 27th of February I was sent for to the Duchess of York; the prisoner was there crying, she was charged with stealing this pellise; she acknowledged that she had pledged it at a shop in Fleet-market, and she had destroyed the duplicate on the step of the door as she came out. I took her with me to shew me the shop, she found the pellise by the apron it was in, and Mrs. Benham claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went out I asked her to lend me a pellise, I went out and pledged it. I asked her for some money, she denied me, I was ashamed to return. When I met this young man, I said I would go home with him, as he said they would not hurt me if I would own it.</p>

            . I live at Battle-Bridge. On the 8th of March, about half after three o'clock, I saw the prisoner pass by the prosecutrix's house several times backwards and forwards. At last he went into the prosecutrix's house; he had nothing with him then, and when he came out he had a parcel under his arm. I immediately ran over to Mrs. Berwick. I followed after the prisoner in consequence of what Mrs. Berwick told me, and when I overtook him he had got these things in his apron.</p>

            . I live at 48, Charles-street Drury-lane. I keep a fruit stand near to Mr. Tolner's shop. About four o'clock on the 9th of April I saw the prisoner take the table from out of Mr. Tolner's shop, he put it underneath the next door, he went into another door, he returned and took the table away. I went and gave information at Mr. Tolner's.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Tolner. From information I pursued the prisoner, and found him with the table on his shoulder. I stopped him. He said a gentleman employed him to carry this table. When I stopped him there was nobody with him. I brought him and the table back to my master's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On last Monday week I had been out in the fore part of the day. Going home at the end of Drury-lane there was a gentleman buying nuts of a basket-woman. I passed by; he said, young man, could you tell me of a porter. I said I could not. He said it was only a light table to carry into Oxford road. I took the table on my shoulder. He said, you had better drink first. I put the table down and went and drank with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110045"/>and then I took the table, and the person that employed me was a few steps before me. When the man stopped me he would not let me call him back, the gentleman told me he would walk forward, I should see him at the White Lion opposite of St. Giles's.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Bembridge-street St. Giles's. I sell nuts for my living, my husband is a labouring man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known this man - A. I never saw him before the day he was taken prisoner. I was at the Drury-lane corner of Long-acre. When I first saw this man, a gentleman asked me for a pennyworth of nuts, and after I served him with the nuts he asked me if I know of a porter. I told him, No. The prisoner was coming along, the gentleman asked him if he knew of a porter; he said, no, what was it he wanted carried; he said a small card-table into Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow this gentleman and this porter - A. Yes, a little distance behind, they walked nearly together.</p>
               <p>Q. Who walked first - A. The gentleman. I went into the public-house to sell my gingerbread-nuts, and when I came out of the public-house the prisoner was stopped with the table, I did not see the gentleman then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sedgwick the man that stopped him with the table - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you stepped up to speak to him - A. No, I did not, I followed the mob, and he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then at Bow-street you went in and told them what you had seen - A. No, I knew the young woman, that the prisoner sent for his wife the same evening. I stopped in Bow-street; it concerned me, I thought he was innocent. I told several people in the mob I thought he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you step up to the man that had taken him, and say that you thought this man was innocent - A. No, I staid in Bow-street about a couple of hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go in and tell the justice - A. A young woman told me he was fully committed to Newgate for trial. I went to the prisoner, and asked him if I could be of any service. She told me his name, I found him in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever enquire after the gentleman that met him -

She laid down four five-shilling papers of halfpence as part of the money. While I was settling with her the prisoner and two others came in and called for a quartern of gin; the halfpence laid on the counter, and the moment they called for the gin the prisoner catched a five-shilling paper of halfpence off the counter in an instant, and throwed them to a short man behind him and he ran out of the door. I directly challenged the prisoner. I said you have stole five-shillings, worth of halfpence from me. He said he did not know any thing about it. I detained him and sent for a constable.

               <p>Q. It was parted from her and laid before you - A. Yes, I drew it towards me; she came to pay me some pounds. She said, I must pay you four five-shillings in halfpence; I was counting it with the rest.</p>

            Yes, I cannot say how much I was to pay him; there were two one-pound notes, four five-shilling papers. I had put these papers out of my hand on the counter. Three men came to the bar the prisoner was one of them, they called for some gin, the prisoner stood opposite of the counter; Mr. Suter was settling my account in the book. On a sudden he ran out into the lobby and took hold of the prisoner, saying, you have taken five-shillings of halfpence and given them to that man that ran out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did one of the three run away - A. Yes, instantly. Mr. Suter then said to me, did not you see that. I said, what Sir, he replied, why this villain has handed off five-shillings to that fellow that ran out of the door. I did not see it, and so I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Suter stand by the loss - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met two men, I was intoxicated, and when I came into this house I called for a quartern of gin. I never touched a halfpenny belonging to him.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 21st of March did you go with Mr. Linschoten and a search warran to the house of the prisoner - A. I did, I found the prisoner near his master's manufactory. I read the warrant to him in the presence of Mr. Linschoten and Joshua Armstrong. I then said, have you any oil or colour at your house. He answered, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110046"/>not. I told him I must search his house. We went with him to his house in Wilmott-street, Bethnal-green, and searching under the cellar stairs under some old wood we found a hamper containing fifty or sixty pounds of white lead, and in a corner cupboard of that cellar we found white lead, vedigrease and other colours that I do not know the name of; they were in paper tied up, and some of them clean, having the appearance of recently been put there. I asked him how he came by these things. He said, some of them were given him by his master, and some of them he had ten or twelve years; he had once kept a shop, and that was part of the stock. In the same cellar we found some rape oil. We then took him and the goods to the public office. The place under the stairs was damp, the bottom of the hamper was rotted out.</p>

I left the shop in the evening at seven o'clock, when I could not see to work any longer: I double locked the door when I left the shop, Mr. Girdler's door was open. At seven o'clock on Tuesday morning I returned, I found the lock had been pushed back, it was only single locked, and sixteen brass plates were stolen out of the shop. When I missed them I looked about to see if I could find them, I could not; I went and told my master. I saw the brass plates at Bow-street when Yates and Field were in custody. I knew the plates again when I saw them, I had been at work upon them. They did not take all the brass plates from the shop, they took sixteen and left twenty in the shop.

I returned back to the public-house in Queen-street, and sent Robinson into the Three Tuns, the corner of Shorts Gardens. Robinson came out and told me Yates was there, playing at shove-halfpenny. I went in, found him there, and took him in custody, and just before I got him to the office I asked him what he had done with the brass; he said he did not know what I meant. Robinson said Mann was going to be chairman of a free and easy club at the two Brewers in Bembridge-street. I took Robinson with me. I came from the two Brewers, and came to the Turks's head, in Dyot-street, and as I was standing there Robinson pulled me by the coat and said that was the man. I took him in custody.

            . I am the wife of James Healey. On the 26th of March I had a one pound Bank note, two guineas and 18 s. in silver in my pocket. I went into the Three Tuns to have half a pint of beer, the prisoner was there, and when I came out he followed me. I went with him to the Crown in Chapel-street, he called for half a pint of gin, it came to eight pence; there were two more men with him. I opened my purse, he took out a shilling, and put the four pence change in his pocket; he called for another half pint of gin, and said I should pay for that, I said I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you partake of the last half pint - A. Yes, I drank two glasses in his company; I was wrapping up my money, he took it out of my hand; the landlady came in, took it from him, wrapped it up and gave it into my hand. When I came out of the house the prisoner took it out of my hand; he went into the house again, he said he would return it to my husband the next morning; he sent the one pound note, but did not return the other.</p>

               <p>MRS. PERRY. I am the landlady of the public-house. On the 26th of March the prisoner and the prosecutrix and two women came into my house. When first the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110048"/>prisoner took the money from her the woman sat down to take out the money for the gin. I said he had no business with the woman's money; I took it from him, counted it, and wrapped it up and gave it the woman; he forced it again out of her hand and dragged her out of doors. I did not see her again till the next morning. He came into the house and said, by G - d I have got her money, she shall never have it any more, I will return it to her husband.</p>

On Saturday the 24th of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and said his father was going to fit him with a pair of shoes; he went away, and returned to the door in about tea minutes; he asked if his father had been there, after that he waited about twenty minutes. I had suspicion and watched him, I saw him go to the step of the door and take down a pair of shoes, the shoes were outside of the shop. He went into my passage with the shoes, concealed them under his waistcoat and walked off. I pursued him, and never lost sight of him. I came up to him about forty yards distance from my door, brought him back, and took the shoes from him; these are-the shoes, I know them to be mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see enough of the man at that time to say whether or no it was the prisoner - A. I was hurried at the time; I am apt to be harried; he surrendered the shawl to me; I could have done what I liked to him. He came in to look at the house, it is to let, it is not finished, I had left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had given you the shawl what became of him, how came he to be stopped - A. It was my hastiness. When my husband came in I said I had been robbed. My husband ran after him, and the man surrendered himself to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you were a good deal flurried - A. A good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You were alarmed so much, I should not think that you should be able to speak to the person of that man from another - A. I was so much hurried I cannot pretend what to say in it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BEALE, I am one of the patrols. About eleven o'clock, I was coming up George-street, formerly called Diot-street; when I came up to Phoenix yard, three girls came up to me, and said there was a cry of murder; I went down, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch; he looked round, and found the watch without the outer case; he said she throwed the watch over a cart, and it fell on the dung-hill. The outer case was never found.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along Diot-street; there were three or four women, with the man under the gateway; he knocked me down, and said I was the person that took his watch away.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was there - A. There were five men in my room; they made no reply.

            . I am a patrol. On Tuesday night, the 20th of March, I was informed there, was a a disturbance in Bell-court; I immediately went there, I saw five men coming out of the court; I saw Murray, he had a scratch on the side of his face; Crawley was the last one that went down the steps, they all five went into Fox-court, and then they told me they would rip my b - y guts out; I drew my cutlass and called a watchman to my assistance; I went after them, they all escaped; they said they could beat fifteen or twenty watchmen at any time; Price came to me, we met Weston and Murray at the corner of the court; I secured Murray, we took him to the watchhouse; I am sure Murray is one of the five; I thought Crawley was one of them, but I cannot swear to him. Crawley bears an infamous name; the neighbourhood is all in terror of him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HUTT. I apprehended Crawley last Wednesday night at the Sugur Loaf in King-street, Drury-lane, he made great resistance when I took him; he said he supposed I wanted him for that bawdy house row.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Henry. How did you get these things - A. The men made their escape, and after this was over some men came in the court with a woman, they had the curtains and tea tray, the woman said, I advised these men to bring the curtains back, as they belong to you; the men said they would not deliver them unless I would give them some gin; I told them I had no gin, and made haste in doors, they threw the things in after me.</p>
               <p>Crawley's Defence. I had been drinking with this woman all the afternoon; I had lived with her before I went to the East Indies; the first night I came home I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110050"/>saw her in Holborn, she said she was glad to see me, and we drank together, and on this very afternoon she spoke to me, and we went into the White Hart and drank together.</p>

               <p>Murray's Defence. I work for Mr. Phipps at Rotherhithe. I was sent to get plaster; I came to Brooks' market to find a young man of the name of Buckel; I went into the White Hart; I saw this man, we went in the Jolly Butchers; I fell asleep in the tap-room. I was in Henry's house, but in this house I was not at all.</p>

The part of the property that he took away at breakfast time was found at his lodgings.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL LACK. I am one of the patrols of Bow-street. On the 12th of February about twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner in company with a man of the name of Hart that was tried to-day. I watched him night after night from the 5th to the 10th. I saw him attempt to pick a number of gentlemen's pockets, but never saw him pick one till the 12th. A little after eleven o'clock, I saw him go down the street, along with an old gentleman, conversing about the play. I was watching him, suspecting what he was about; the gentleman crossed over at the end of Bow-street; he returned, and came towards the office door. I asked him if there was any thing the matter; he said he had his pocket picked, and lost his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the time you had seen the prisoner in his company - A. Not more than six or seven minutes. I told him if he would attend the next morning, probably I would be able to find out the man that had committed the robbery upon him. I had some suspicion that they knew me; I put my great coat on, and tied my handkerchief round my hat, to make myself look like a coachman; and just as the playhouse was over I followed the prisoner. I am quite sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time how long had he been about the playhouse - A. From a quarter after ten. I saw him pick a gentleman's pocket, and walk away; I followed the gentleman and asked him to return, I wanted his address; he said he had got some ladies with him, he could not return; I said, sir, will you be so good as to see if your pocket has been picked; the gentlemen felt in his pocket and said he had lost his pocket handkerchief; I went round the play-house and came into Bow-street again; I found the prisoner in custody of a gentleman, he said he had picked his pocket; I took him in custody; I found three handkerchiefs in his hat.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18100411-89-person820">Q. </persName>
            Had he a handkerchief for his own use besides the three in his hat - A. I did not see any. He began to abuse me a little, and said they were all his own. I took him to the office. There are twenty-four pawnbrokers duplicates I found in his pocket book; they are duplicates of handkerchiefs, watches, and broaches, and different articles; the amount of money advanced upon them is between six and seven pounds. These are the three handkerchiefs I found in his hat; this is the handkerchief that the gentleman charged him with, by the description he gave; it is a yellow handkerchief, it is worth one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was returning from the theatre the gentleman charged me with picking his pocket; I was in a hurry to go home, I had as far as Bethnal-green to go; the gentleman said, you have got my handkerchief; I said, I have not got your handkerchief, the officer collared me and searched me, and took from me that pocket book and the handkerchiefs; I told him it was all my own. The gentleman never came to identify his handkerchief. In respect to Mr. Hart, I do know the person, I never saw him before to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110052"/>knowledge. And the reason I put the handkerchiefs in my hat I had no pockets.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I had my back to the door and my head upon my shoulders, so that I could see her; she took the opportunity of taking the shawl away; I suppose she walked off; she had not got above two yards, a man stopped her; I brought her into the shop, she had the shawl under her arm, she wished to pay for it, I refused, She was searched; she had money enough to pay for it.</p>

               <p>JOHN PERCIVAL. My partner's name is Matthew Percival. The prisoner lived with us as a <rs id="t18100411-94-deflabel527" type="occupation">carter</rs>

               <p>Q. When was it you missed these dusters - A. On Wednesday evening, the 7th of March, Mr. Kent, a brush maker, called at our house, Mr. Prentis was with him; I received information, which led me to Mr. Prentis, a brush-maker. The prisoner came to Mr. Prentis's and asked for the money for the dusters that he had left the day before. When the prisoner asked for the money I collared him; he said they were his own, he had them in his possession for nine months.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENTIS. I am a brush-maker, in Chandois-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner apply to you to sell any brushes - A. Yes; that dozen in question. On Tuesday the 6th of March, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner called at my shop, he had a dozen brushes with him, he asked me twenty-two shillings; the fair value would be about thirty-two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, know with whom he lived - A. No. I agreed to buy them, but avoided paying for them, that I might make enquiry; Mr. Kent, the maker's name was upon them. I went to Mr. Percival in consequence of the enquiries I made of Mr. Kent; Mr. Percival suspected his carman. I went into the stable, and there I saw the prisoner, and it not being convenient for Mr. Percival to come down that evening I kept out of the way, and told my servant to tell him to come the next evening.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner and tell me whether you saw him on the 12th of February - A. Yes; the prisoner passed me two or three times. About a quarter before eleven I saw him in Bow-street, close to the theatre.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before - A. I have seen him here before - A I saw him pick an elderly gentleman's pocket of this handkerchief; he was alone.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the same evening that you found the other two men that you have given evidence about - A. Yes; the same evening. I followed the gentleman; after he got through the mob I said, sir, you have had your pocket picked; he said he was very sorry for it; he was in the habit of taking snuff. I let him go on. A little while afterwards there was a rush from the crowd, at the corner of the street. I saw part of a gentleman's handkerchief in his hand, he had not quite drawed it out. I took hold of him directly and told the gentleman to follow me; I searched him, I found a handkerchief in his breeches, one in his hat, and one in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the handkerchief that you saw him take out of the gentleman's pocket - A. That was in his breeches. I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who that gentleman was that he picked his pocket - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen him about the playhouse before you laid hold hold of him - A. About three quarters of an hour. I did not watch him so close as I did the others; I am positive of his person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Which handkerchief was it you took out of my breeches - A. I cannot swear which of the two it was, it was one of these.</p>
               <p>COURT. Which was the handkerchief that you saw him take from the gentleman - A. The plaid handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My prosecution being closed I will take the liberty to state the exact case. I was taken in custody at the corner of Bow-street, and charged before the magistrate with picking a gentleman's pocket. Prior to his taking me to a public house he searched me, he found on my person three handkerchiefs, one in my hat, one in my pocket, and one in my breeches. Before the magistrate the officer stated that he saw me in the act of picking a gentleman's pocket; it is false, and had I been so doing, it would have been impossible for him to have seen it; it was a dark night, and the shops being all shut, how is it possible he could have seen it. My handkerchiefs being found in such a situation, I acknowledge it had some suspicion, but the reason of one being found in my breeches, from my infancy I have been afflicted with an incontinency of time, when I have not a convenience to go to a proper place. I do declare, solemnly, my innocence, and have no doubt but I shall find that justice from your lordship that my case merits. At the last Sessions I had several friends to speak to my character, who now are incapable of coming; one of them, by reason of sickness.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the boy say, in the hearing of Pearson, that he pledged the gown there - A Yes; they said, the gowns laid all in a heap, they could not think of looking for it at that time. The boy pawned it in the name of Matthews, and destroyed the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that sheet and these stockings, we have heard you pawned them at Mr. Flint's - A. Yes; I got them from the prisoners; I had been ill for three weeks; I went out for the air on the 17th of February, I was going up the Edgware-road, in the afternoon to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do they live in Edgware-road - A. No; they live in Williams's brick fields, down Bayswater. The woman asked me if I would pledge what was in the basket; her husband was with her; I refused pledging them; afterwards I said I would take them to Mr. Moore, Burr-street, Oxford-street; she told me she would not have them taken there; I was to take them to Mrs. Flint's, Edgware-road, and to pledge them in my own name; I did so. I pledged them for ten shillings; her husband was in the shop at the same time, he pledged his watch for five shillings; he went out, and when I came out I went to them; I gave them the basket, the ticket, and the two five shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not sell her the ticket as she has stated - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You were taken up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said then that they had employed you to pawn the things - A. Yes; I said the same then as I do now.</p>
               <p>Q. The consequence was, you were discharged and they were taken in custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a brother in trouble some time ago at the assizes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he transported - A. I do not know where he is.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, did not you apply to these poor people and beg of them to purchase this duplicate of you, you saying that your brother was in distress, and you wanted a shilling to send him down in the country - A. Upon my oath, I did not. This man was with my brother, and I have no doubt he was the man that drawed my brother in; I was very much hurt, thinking that this man should abscond and my brother suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you supposing your brother was suffering on the hulks, having been drawn in by this man, you would have us suppose that he prevailed upon you to pawn the things in your own name - A. That is the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you, you supposed that man was a dishonest character, you believed that he led your brother into the misfortune, and after that you were prevailed upon by him to pawn these things in your own name - A. I was. I did not know what was in the basket till I opened it at Mrs. Flint's.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you get your living by - A. Needle work. I work for any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you brought up a mantua-maker or millener - A. No; but I know so far of it I can get my living by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your last service - A. It is not two years ago since I was in service; I chose to be out of place, then I can do as I like; an accident took me from my service, by being scalded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You say you have a brother unfortunately in trouble - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Notwithstanding that you assisted him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago - A. The 2nd of August, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your brother was not at large in February - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were immediately to be found by the description that you gave when you pawned these things - A. Yes; I gave my true address.</p>
               <p>COURT. What service had you - A. A cook's place; the woman prisoner was a cook, I succeeded her.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LACK. I am an officer of Bow-street. In consequence of a search warrant, on the 13th of March, I searched the prisoners house; the house is in a brick field at the back of Bayswater. The prisoners were in custody then.

When I took her in custody she gave me these doileys, and the ticket together in the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wake. When you were taken in custody you gave the officer the ticket, the handkerchief, and doileys - A. Yes; I had from the prisoners the two gowns, eleven doileys, and the handkerchief. They were to give me some money for my brother; they said they had no money, but wished me to pawn them; I did pawn them; she said if I could get the sum of seven shillings not to pledge the doileys; I might get more on the gowns if I could; I got seven shillings and sixpence upon the gowns, that money was for my brother. I went down to her with the ticket, she was not at home, and it was very wet after that.</p>
               <p>- SEARLE. I am a servant to Mr. Moore. A person of the name of Wake pledged two morning dressing gowns with me; I lent her three half crowns on them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Kind Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will take my sad misfortune, which I now labour under, into your consideration, as I am left alone in the wide world, and I am the mother of ten children, and brought here to answer the faults of my deceased husband. My husband in his life-time rented an apartment in Mrs. Deamer's house; after living there some time, he was out of work; he made use of these things, and meant to return them when he got work again. Mrs. Deamer received of me a variety of duplicates for the rent; and as soon as she found he was buried, she sent me here, and threatened to transport me. I beg for mercy, as my husband made me pledge them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is almost all false.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew she had a husband - A. There was a man there sick; he got his illness through her taking the things off the bed; he said so; she is a shocking drunken woman.</p>

            . I am a victualler. I live in King-street, Drury-lane. On Sunday the 11th of March, in the afternoon, the prisoner came for a pint of porter; I served her, and on Monday, when I collected my pots in, she was not at home, neither in the morning or afternoon. On Tuesday morning, I went again to her lodging in King-street, Drury-lane; she gave me this pint pot, belonging to the King's Arms in Vere-street; I told her it was not my pint pot; she declared it was the pint pot I gave her on the Sunday afternoon. I put it on my strap, and collected the rest of my pots in; and after coming home, I took the pot, and returned to her lodgings. I asked her for my pint pot; her answer was, that she had not got it; there was a small basket standing in the middle of the room. I desired to see the contents; she said they were coals; I insisted upon seeing; she took up the basket, and turned out the contents into a closet; she brought to me the basket empty, and observed, you see there was nothing but coals in it. I went to the closet, and brought these three pints out belonging to Mr. Charlton. On looking further in the room, I found a quart pot belonging to another publican; I never found my pint pot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

On the 8th of March he asked me if I wanted any change, I told him I did, and gave him a pound note, and received of him the change, I returned him a bad shilling he gave me; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out two half crowns, and five or six shillings; he gave me another shilling for the bad one. Upon seeing him have so much money it struck me it could not be all his own. At night I counted all the copper in the till, I did not lock the till that night. In the morning I gave him the key out of my bed room to open the shop, and light the fire; I came down sometime afterwards and missed ten-pence. On Thursday night I marked all the copper money that was in the till; fifteen shillings of new penny pieces and halfpence, and eight shillings of old copper, and left the till not locked. On Friday morning I gave him the key, as I did the other morning, I came down in about a quarter of an hour; I sent him up stairs for something while I counted the money; I missed one shilling and eleven-pence halfpenny of new copper, and seven-pence halfpenny of old copper; I called him down stairs, told him to bring forward the money that he had taken out of the till that morning, I had missed two shillings and seven-pence; he hesitated, and pulled out a canvas bag containing two shillings and eleven-pence of new and old copper; he told me that was the money he had taken, and a few loose halfpence he had taken out of his pocket, and put into the bag. I then told him to take out what he had got in his pocket, he took out a one pound note and eleven shillings and six-pence in silver, and a small red leather purse, he said he had bought it with my money, and the money he took that morning he was going to buy a pair of stockings with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any character with this boy - A. No; he came out of the country; it was the first place he had.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me when I came down stairs to give him all the money, and he would have no more to do with me; I gave him the money, and he knocked me down. I sold a watch that I bought myself for one pound eighteen shillings; he took that money from me.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. This spoon was pledged with me on the 21st of December for one shilling and six-pence by the prisoner in the name of John Brown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I pledged the spoon I was in want of a pair of shoes; I changed a ten pound note in the morning to give the charwoman the bill, and as I had changed the captain's ten pound I asked the captain for my quarter's wages, seven pounds ten shillings; he replied, I will pay you in two or three days; I was barefoot. I, unfortunately, knowing captain Drummond to be a passionate man, I was afraid to ask him; I said to myself, I'll get one shilling and six-pence on this spoon till he pays me my wages, and then I will bring it in again. As to the affair of Mr. Harrison's, I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is the account of his wages being due correct - A. That very day that he was taken up was the first time that he asked for money. It is all false. I owed him eight guineas, I meaned to pay him when I got change.</p>

I told him I had not said any considerable quantity; I said he had sold hay a variety of times, or else I had reason to suspect that he had; he said he was to come to own he was in fault; he was very sorry for it; and if I pleased, he would work it out. No, I told him, it was a matter that I ought not to settle; if he chose to go before a Magistrate, they would settle it; he did go before the Magistrate, and made the confession; it was read over to him, and I saw him sign it.</p>

I found my horses were getting in a bad condition; I was fearful that they did not keep in the stable, while the horses were feeding, and that the ostler took it away.</p>

I went up stairs to their room, and saw the room was floating with water; I saw the lead was gone from the top of the house; I told them one or the other of them must have taken it; I saw the lead was fresh cut; I went to the Magistrate, got an officer who searched their room, and part of the lead was found in the bed before the Magistrate. The woman prisoner said she stole the lead; she told where she sold it at different times; she got 5 s. 9 d. at one time, and 1 s. 3 d. the other time.

            . I am an officer; I went to Smithfield-market. In consequence of information I found Thomas Eldridge, I asked him if he had bought two pigs of the prisoner; he said, yes, and the sow, Oliffe had bought; he said he had sold the two pigs to Mr. Briant of Battle-bridge, and there I saw the two pigs. We went to Worship-street and obtained two warrants, and took away the two pigs, and the little sow. As I was driving the pigs home I apprehended the prisoner, at the Cock at Hackney; he begged of me to take him to Mr. Gerrard's; going along he owned he sold the two pigs for six pounds, and the little sow for two pounds seven shillings and six pence; he said he was very glad he was apprehended, or else he should do something to come to be hanged. I searched him, and found a two pound note, a five shilling piece, and half a crown.</p>

            . I am a butcher, I live upon Saffron Hill. I bough the little sow of the prisoner on Friday the 6th of April, in Smithfield-market, I gave him two pounds seven shillings and six-pence. It is the same that Mr. Gerrard claimed afterwards.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ELDRIDGE. I am a foreman to Mr. Cotterill, Bacon merchant. I bought two pigs of the prisoner in Smithfield on the 6th of April, I gave six pound for them; I sold them to Mr. Briant for six pound ten shillings.</p>
               <p>MR. BRIANT. I bought two pigs of Eldridge on Friday the 6th of April, the prosecutor saw them afterwards and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q to Gerrard. The two pigs that you saw at Mr. Briant's, and the sow that you saw at Mr. Oliffe's, were taken out of your sty, were they not - A. Yes; they are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Friday the 6th of April, at the corner of Robinhood-lane, I was accosted by a well-dressed man, he asked me whether I would drive the said pigs to Smithfield-market, he would give me five shillings; on our way he was desirous of knowing my residence, and when he got to Shoreditch church he desired me to go off, and if he did not see me till I got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110060"/>to Smithfield, to go into the Brown Bear-yard; I might ask nine pounds, but not to take less than eight pound eight shillings for the pigs; I did not see my employer at nine o'clock, I sold them for eight pounds seven shillings and six-pence; I, wishing to get home, would rather lose sixpence than stay any longer. As my employer did not come I supposed he would call on me for the money. In the evening I was taken in custody. I am sorry I did not tell the truth to the magistrate. I resign myself to your lordship.</p>

On Last Thursday morning, a little after nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner take the earth rug from where it hung at the door for show, he gave it to his companion, who carelessly folded it up and put it under his left arm. I made after them and the prisoner mended his pace, and the person that had got the rug threw it down, I took the rug up, and after that laid hold of the prisoner, and took him to my door, he suddenly jumped off the pavement, kicked off his shoes, and run as fast as possible; I pursued him and laid hold of him again, brought him back to my shop, and sent for a constable. This is the rug, it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going down Noble-street to work; this man came up and challenged me with thieving a rug from his door; I told him I did not steal it; he told me he would transport me; I ran away from him, I was stopped again and taken.</p>

            . I am a baker in Dog-row, Bethnal-green. On the 28th of February, a little after three in the afternoon, I perceived a cart standing still in Red Cow-lane, there was a man upon the cart, and another man by the side of him; the cart stood there. In about ten minutes I saw the cart coming past my door, the carman was with his horses proceeding towards Bethnal-green, and the prisoner was going towards Mile-end turnpike, he appeared to have a bulk under his coat; I stopped him; I said, you have flour about you; he threw a bag he had under his coat on the ground; I gave him and the flour in the charge of an officer. We overtook the cart where the flour was taken from, it stood unloading at Mr. Brockson's; the carman was challenged of taking the flour, he went down upon his knees; I gave him in custody of a man, the mob coming round, he run away. This is the bag and the flour.</p>
               <p>MR. BROCKSON. On the 28th of February I re- received ten sacks of flour from Mr. White; I weighed them and found twelve pounds weight deficient; that flour and the bag and all weighed fifteen pounds.</p>

I gave a man of the name of Glaney three pints of beer to carry my box to the Savoy; my box contained a regimental coat, a shirt, jacket, and a pair of stockings. About two in the afternoon he put my box down at the White-hart public-house door, Drury-lane. I went in to drink with him. Upon my coming out I missed the box. My box was found the next morning.</p>

            . I am a Fishmonger in White-hart-yard, Drury-lane. On the 26th of February, between five and six in the afternoon, I returned home; I was informed that the drummer had lost all his clothes. From information I ran down the street, and saw the prisoner with two drummers jackets in her apron; she was so intoxicated I could get no answer from her. I took the jackets out of her apron, and took them to the public-house in White-hart-yard. I knew the woman by being about the neighbourhood. When I left the woman the drummer boy came up.</p>
               <p>The property produced and indentified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the crime I am charged with. I met a woman, she gave me a glass of gin, and I happened to be in liquor. This woman said, take these things in your lap and I will be after you. I fell down, and was not able to get up again till Mr. Jones came up to me. As for the box, I never saw it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 10th of this month I apprehended the prisoner upon another charge. I found these three watch seals and a key in his possession; the prisoner said they were his property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. He is a thief, he is no business at all as I know of; he lived at No. 10, Short's Gardens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You apprehended him for something that an honest jury acquitted him to day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these things in his possession a month after the time the prosecutor said he lost them from his watch - A. Yes.</p>

I took this place in Shorts' Gardens with intent to make it a shop. I purchased them three seals in Croydon market, and when they were found in my possession I owned them as my own property. I gave 30 s. for them in trade. As for Limbrick saying I was a thief, I never was taken up before in my life.</p>

               <p>DANIEL BISHOP. I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 21st of March I went to the prisoner at the prosecutor's manufactory. I told the prisoner, in the presence of his master and Joshua Armstrong. I had a warrant to search his house. I asked him if he had any colour or oil in his house; he said he had not. I then told him he must go with me and his master to search his house. I then took him to his house in Hare-street Fields, Bethnal-green; on searching the bed-room we found a bottle containing some rape oil.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity - A. I believe there is something under a gallon now, the bottle if full would contain two gallons; he said that he had taken it from his master's manufactory, that Mr. Ayres the clerk had given him leave to take it. In the lower room I found this keg. I then brought Mr. Ayres to his face, and Mr. Ayres said to him he did not give him leave to take it. When Mr. Ayres said that he had not given him leave to take it, the prisoner made no reply.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Linschoten. The prisoner we understand was your foreman, had you a clerk in your service of the name of Ayres - A. Yes,

            . I have not discharged him, I have not settled with him; the prisoner had the care of the keys and the property in my custody, Ayres never had; Ayres employ was in collecting and keeping the accounts. The prisoner said it was my keg or else I should not have known it, it is worth a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the kind of oil that you had in the manufactory - A. Yes, it cost me 5 s. 6 d. the wholesale price; the prisoner told me when he took it it had about two gallons and a half in it.</p>
               <p>Court. If the prisoner had not told you you would not have known that it was your oil - A. No, I should never have known it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master employed me at night to pack up things when he returned from the country to send away before day-light. I told my master, that when my hands were up to my elbows in oil I could not run to the book.</p>

She came on the next day, and the same candlestick was on the mantle-piece: dear me, she said, I think that is my candlestick. I said, yesterday you said it was not. I bought it of a man: I believe him to be an honest man. She took the candlestick; she said, she did not mind any thing so much as the cocoa nut-shell.

On Saturday, the 7th of this month, for the first time, I suspected the prisoner of robbing me. I missed a pair of shoes that day which I had no doubt were taken by the prisoner. On Tuesday night, the 10th, I searched the place where he was at work, I found a pair of shoes hid under some loose leather, the initials of my name on the bottom were endeavoured to be punched out; having no doubt they were put there for the purpose of taking them away, I took them out and marked them privately in the upper leather, and put them there again; and on the Wednesday, when he went to tea in the afternoon, I looked and found the shoes were gone. I said nothing to him at night on the same Wednesday. I looked in the same place again, and another pair of mens' shoes were secreted there. I marked them the same as I had done the others, and put them in the place where they were hid. The next morning, when the prisoner was to breakfast, I looked for the shoes, they were g went to the Police-office, Worship-street, go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110064"/>to search his premises. I took the opportunity of going with the officer when he was at dinner, that he might be present when the search was made. I accused him of robbing me; he denied it. I told him, we had a search warrant, he might as well produce it; he said, then, he had a pair up stairs. We went with him up into the second floor, he pulled out this pair of shoes from behind a bonnet-box in the cupboard; this was the last pair; he said then, that he had taken on the day before, and on the Saturday he had sold to a stranger.</p>

I have acquaintances of my own that I recommended to buy shoes of my master; this pair of shoes in question, I sold them to a young man; Mistress Phillips, or the son, took the money; he had one or other in the shop always ready to take the money. This young man never tried the shoes on, he went away with them and brought them back, and I changed them; this pair I took home to bind to change for the man; and before I could bring them back, the officer came and took me</p>

There were six fowls, two common ducks, and this Muscovy drake; they were taken out of the roosting-house between eleven and twelve, I apprehend, at night. They opened the door and took them out. On the morning I went into Leadenhall-market, the prisoner pitched them out of his apron; he said, he had bought these and three more in Newgate-market; he had sold the others.</p>

On the 13th of this month, the prisoner came to my shop between two and three in the afternoon, she purchased a yard of print, I was in the shop. I perceived her to be a very knowing young woman. I left the shop, and watched her through the counting-house window: she pointed to some prints on the shelf, and desired my young man to take them down; when his back was turned she pulled a print off the counter, and secreted it under her clothes; in a few minutes after that she bought a yard of print for 3 s. 2 d. and when she gave the young man the money, I went out and informed the young man. I did not say any thing to her then, but let her go out of the shop a short distance in the street; I then took her by the elbow, and asked her to come back. I asked the young man, if he missed any thing; I said, I do; and then she fell a crying. I took the print from her; this is the print, it is mine. I saw her secrete it under her clothes.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BALL. I am a servant to Mr. Austin. On the 9th of April Mr Austin gave me orders to watch the prisoner; about five o'clock the prisoner went out at the back gates, I followed him into Ray-street. Clerkenwell; I saw him come out of an old iron shop; I went in and demanded the metal which he had sold; the woman said she had not bought the metal. that he had it in his hand; I went out of the shop and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the metal in his hand - A. Yes, wrapped up in brown paper; I collared him and brought him a few yards off the door, Mortimer throwed him and I took part of the metal from him; he said it was his metal; he did not fear going back to Mr. Austin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took this metal by the pound, whatever was wasted I was to make it good when we came to a settlement.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was to account to me for the waste; this is not waste, I know it by the shape of the ingot.</p>

On the 13th of April, I was down in the kitchen, my mistress called me to mind the door, it was on a jar; I came up stairs to go into the parlour, I saw the prisoner walking across the passage, he had the things under his left arm, and with his right hand tried to pull the street door after him; I called out, stop him; he turned to the right, and went down the street; I ran after him; he throwed down the clothes; I still followed him; he turned the corner, and went into a public house, I went in after him, he was trying to get into one of the boxes in the parlour; I caught hold of him and told him he had been robbing the house; he denied it; I told him he should go to the watchhouse to be searched; he begged me to let him go, he wanted to go and see his uncle in Oxford-road. A neighbour came in, he took him back to our shop; he denied it there, and said he had not been in the house; I never lost sight of him until he was put into the hands of the constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I never was in any court of justice before this time charged with any offence inimical to the laws of my country; I am now twenty-one years of age, and the rectitude of my conduct cannot be impeached previous to this; I was led into this crime by a designing and wicked man, whom I never saw before; I saw him in Long-lane, West Smithfield, and the goods I obtained from my prosecutor, I received an order from this man, and only received a remuneration of one shilling and sixpence, and I never had any conception that it was an illicit transaction, therefore, was the same person to ask me to go again of the same errand, was I to see him, I might have so done, without any guilty knowledge, particularly as I am not able to read writing, and being illiterate; I hope the respectable housekeepers with whom I have lived will satisfy this court that this crime is not wilfully done, and as such I expect the word of acquittal in my favour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I reconciled the circumstance to my own mind in consequence of Mr. Jackson having lost his partner, and this being busy shipping time I thought he might want such an assortment of goods, and therefore we were very desirous of accomodating him, and likewise the prisoner represented they were particularly busy, they could not get them made fast enough.

First, I am charged with obtaining goods under false pretences, I answer, I never did, directly or indirectly, do any such thing; I never saw the evidence till I saw him in the Poultry compter, and to all the charges I am perfectly innocent; but if this assurance of my innocence should be over-ruled, I beg for the lenity of a British court of Justice; and I beg it to be understood that that is my hand-writing that I have just delivered.</p>

               <p>Q On the night of the 3d of April at what time did you retire to rest - A. About eleven o'clock; my shop was shut up between ten and eleven; when I went to bed my shop was secure. About three o'clock in the morning I was called up by a violent ringing of the bell, and Mr. Sapwell called out to me; in consequence of what he said I came down stairs and examined my shop window; I found the glass broke on the inside, and the broken glass had fallen on the shawls in the window; I saw ten or a dozen holes in the shutters, they seem to have been made with a large gimblet, rather to represent a of kind half square; the pannel is in court; and provided they had gone on, they could have taken goods out. We had a considerable quantity of goods in the window.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN CROMAN. I am a cit patrol. On the morning of 4th of April I was in Bishopgate-street about two o'clock, Horton and Bates were with pie; when we came within a dozen yards of Mr. Styles' house, I saw three men standing at his window, as to drew nearer they split from one another; one went towards Sun-street, and the other two men came towards Bishopgate-church, Horton followed him that went towards Sun-street, the other two, Miller and Pether, came by us; Pether said, what o'clock is it; my partner said, past two; I went up to the shutter and found by feeling it was shagged and tough; Horton called to me that he had got Hanfield; we went up to his assistance and took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the others - A. We did not know that they had been doing any thing then. When we got Hanfield to the watchhouse we searched him, I found a piece of candle, and this black patch, it is about the colour of the shutters; I judge it was to cover the hole of the shutter.</p>
               <p>JOHN HORTON. I am a patrol. I was with the other patrols on the night that we have been speaking of, I saw these three prisoners, I knew Hanfield before; as soon as we got with ten or a dozen yards of them they split; Hanfield went towards Sun-street; when I got to the corner of Sun-street he made a motion as if he was going to ease himself; I took hold of him, I knew him directly; after we had taken him to the watchhouse I went with my partners in search of the other men, and towards Widegate-alley I fell in with Pether and Miller; I am sure they are the same men; I seized hold of Pether by the collar, and stroked him down, and found this gimblet in his pocket; my partner seized the other. I have not the least doubt that this is the gimblet that made the holes in the shutter.</p>

               <p>MR. CARPENTER. I am an engraver in Aldgate High-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On or about the 18th of January last, did the defendant call at your shop - A. He did, within two or three days before or after; he called the first time with a book entitled the Worthies of Devon, a quarto volume; he asked me to purchase it; I declined it; a Mr. Bond came in before the defendant had left the shop. Mr. Bond was asked if he would purchase it; Mr. Bond paid thirteen shillings for the book, and the book was left at my house till the evening, when Mr. Bond called for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the defendant is the man - A. Yes, I have known him for twenty years. The next day the defendant called again with two more copies of the same work; he pressed me to purchase one; I did, for ten shillings and sixpence; this is the one I purchased; I wrote my name on it, when I gave it up; the defendant took the other out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, in consequence of your seeing an advertisement, you caused information to be given - A. That was the case.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You said you had known the defendant for twenty years - A. Yes; I never knew any harm of him before this time, and this I leave you to judge of him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BOND. Q. Were you at the house of Mr. Carpenter at the time that he stated - A. Yes, I purchased this copy for thirteen shillings; there are my initials.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GALE. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Worrall, the attorney - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 10th of February last, by the direction of the prosecutor, go to the lodgings of the defendant - A. I did; I told him that I had called on Mr. Carpenter, who had purchased a book entitled the Worthies of Devonshire; that Mr. Carpenter had informed me, that at the time he bought his, he had another undisposed of; he said that he had; I told him I should he very glad to purchase it of him. I agreed to give him twelve shillings for it; he said that he had not the book by him at that time, but if I would call on Monday afternoon at four o'clock, I should have the book, paying him the twelve shillings; I asked him whether he had any more than one; he said no he had not. I then asked him whether he could procure any more; he said that depended upon whether he could see his friend between the time of my calling on Monday afternoon. I said, at any rate you will let me have the copy you have got; he said, at any rate you shall have the copy I have, by my God. On Monday I went again; I was accompanied with Hancock, the officer, Mr. Longman's clerk, and a warehouseman. I first went up alone; I asked him if he had the copy; he said no, he had not got it; I came out of the room, and went into the street, and called Hancock. When Hancock went up, he searched the lodging; the defendant then said he had sold one to Mr. Carpenter, and that was the only one that ever he had; I said, Mr. Polack, you are certainly mistaken; you have already disposed of two, and at the time that you disposed of the second to Mr. Carpenter, you had a third in your possession in Mr. Carpenter's shop; he still denied that he ever had more than one in his possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. That could not be, because he told you that he had two.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Mr. Gale, did you enquire how long he had that one or more - A. He said that he had that one in his possession two months; he said he bought it along with a parcel of waste paper.</p>

               <p>Q. While you were searching the lodgings of the prisoner, do you remember any thing being said by the prisoner about the Worthies of Devonshire - A. I remember that the prisoner said that he had not more than one or two copies, and he was a dealer in old books; he bought any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say what time he was possessed of the books - A. I believe six weeks or two months, I cannot recollect which.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'CREERY. Q. I believe you are a printer - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you print the whole of that book, or any part for Messrs. Longman and Co - A. I printed the whole of this work for Messrs. Rees and Curtis of Plymouth; I ordered my warehouseman to deliver them to Messrs. Longman and Co. Paternoster-row.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BANFIELD. I am foreman to Mr. Wesley, a bookbinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in the month of January last, put up the works, the Worthies of Devon, in boards, for Messrs. Longman and Co. - A. Yes, we received the sheets of letter-press from the printer about the 4th of January, and part of the copper-plates from Messrs. Fox and Barnet, and the other part from Mr. Trepas, Mr. Longman's servant. We were to put them in boards for Messrs. Longman and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these two of the copies that you so put in boards - A. They are; they are marked No. 10, by our sewer.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day were the copies delivered by you to Messrs. Longman - A. The first copies on the 6th of January; and on the 10th, 11th, and 13th, there were regularly deliveries afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. TREPAS. Q. Are you in the service of Longman and Co. - A. I am; I delivered out part of the copper plates of this book to the last witness about the 2d or 3d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive the first copies from him. - A. I think about the 8th; it was a book published by subscription.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the first copies delivered out to subscribers - A. On the 12th of January, they were sent to Rees and Curtis for the subscribers at Plymouth. I think I sent them three hundred.</p>
