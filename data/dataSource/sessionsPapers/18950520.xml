I am manager to John Larkam, who keeps the Pelham Arms, South Kensington—on May 11th, about twelve o'clock, and everything was secure at 1.30—at nine a.m. I saw that a bottle of whisky had been opened—I missed 2s. 6d. in coppers and this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and these cigars and tobacco and a pipe, worth altogether about 35s.—a man had the key of the lavatory about 11.30 the previous night—when I left the window of the saloon bar was securely fastened—I was at Westminster Police-court when the prisoner was examined—he said that we had no business to lock him in; that the barman gave him the key, and he was drunk and fell asleep—when I went to bed my coat was under a shelf behind the bar, not in the lavatory.</p>

Wilson said, "We will buy the other <hi rend="italic">line</hi> some where else"—they got very near the door, and I could see the shape of a piece of silk under Hanstead's skirt—it was rolled up like this, paper and all—I pushed by Wilson, and caught hold of Hanstead and said, "You cannot go, you have a piece of silk"—she tried to push me away and kicked it from under her skirt; it dropped, and she kicked it away—this is it—I know that it was under the counter that afternoon—I picked it up fifteen or twenty yards from there—there are eighty-six yards, value £4 6s.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No one was serving or inside the warehouse but me—there were no other customers—I heard the prisoners say that they did not know one another—I say they were together, because one followed the other in immediately—they told the prosecutor they did not know one another—from the very first moment I was pretty confident they were trying to rob me—my mind has been trained by my experience in shop<lb/>lifting—a great number of these rolls of silk were placed under the counter—I placed about four rolls of silk on the table; there were none there before I began to serve them—Hanstead said that the roll of silk stuck to her dress—I tried to keep it there—Wilson said she was a respectable woman, of Hackney.</p>

I am assistant superintendent to the Royal London Friendly Society, 88, Bow Road—on 30th January this year the prisoner was appointed a collector—he had to canvass for new members and collect premiums, which he had to pay over to the office every Friday—each member keeps a book—the prisoner kept this collecting-book in which he entered all amounts, and sent in every week a sheet, showing the payments in his book—he got no salary, but was remunerated by a payment for the introduction of new members—he got tenpence for every penny of new business he introduced—if he introduced a member to pay a penny a week he would get tenpence from the office—upon premiums he col<lb/>lected on old business he got a commission of 25 per cent.—on Friday, 22 nd March, he brought in his book and this sheet, and this docket, which was all filled up, except the balance; it is his statement of account for the week, a kind of summary without the names and items—he brought in these four proposals for insurance; those were the only new business—I checked the sheet, the docket, the book, and the proposals, and filled in the balance 15s. on the docket, and put my initials—I also put 15s. on the sheet—he was entitled apparently to £1 5s. 6 1/2 d. that week; 2s. 7 1/2 d. being the commission on 10s. 6 1/2 d., which he had collected on old business—he had collected that 10s. 6 1/2 d., and would keep it, so that 15s. was the balance due to him—I handed this docket and sheet to the cashier, who</p>

               <p>would then be authorised to pay the balance to the prisoner—on Saturday afternoon, 23rd March, my suspicion was aroused, and I made inquiry—on the following Friday, 29th March, I saw the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Hambridge, the superintendent—I said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by introducing fictitious business last week?"—he apparently did not understand, and I put it to him that these people were not existing at the addresses given, to which he made no reply for some time, and finally he said, "John Odell did it for me; I am innocent"—he represented that Odell had introduced this business for him, and that he had paid Odell for the introduction—Odell had been in our employment—the prisoner was told to go about his business there and then—I after wards saw Odell—the prisoner wrote me this letter after I had seen Odell; it is in the prisoner's writing: "9th April, 1895. Sir,—Mr. John Odell had nothing whatever to do with my business in connection with the society. If I stated so I made a sad mistake. He said he was going to canvass for me, but he never made a start.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I received the prisoner's letter on 16th or 17th August the prisoner owed me £178—he paid me that by cheque when he came on 17th August—the goods for which he so paid he had had on approval, and he elected to keep them—it was a cash transaction—I had not come to any arrangement as to any term of credit with the prisoner at that time—I had only had that one transaction with him—I had had no deal<lb/>ing on credit—he paid me £178 voluntarily—if he had sold these watches by auction the proceeds of them might have been expected to realise more than they were pledged for—if sold by auction they should have realised a margin of profit on the £395—when I saw the prisoner the night before the first meeting of his creditors he told me he had pawned the watches—after that we had a good deal of conversation, principally about his affairs—he said he thought he should be able to get well through his meeting next day; he hoped to be able to pay me and all his creditors 20s. in the £—I said I would trust him again if I got 20s. in the £—he said in October that a large number of his creditors in Hatton Garden had suddenly served him with writs, and that was the reason why he had been obliged to call his creditors together.</p>

Attenborough formerly had the business—on September 24th, 1994, twenty-two gold watches were pawned with us by Harris for D. Bischoffswerder—they have been identi<lb/>fied by Mr. Hawley—six others were pawned at the same time—we advanced £220—this is the contract note—Harris, for Bischoflswerder, pawned on August 3rd the diamond jewellery, including a necklace and head ornament and bracelet, for £200—Mr. Weiner had identified three of those ornaments—this is the contract note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On August 3rd nine articles were produced, three of which Mr. Weiner identified; the necklace and two brooches, I think—the other things were a diamond tiara, a diamond bracelet, and two rings—they were all articles of considerable value—we left the usual margin; we like to lend a good price, but to have a good security—there is noth<lb/>ing unusual in diamond dealers pledging articles with us; it is a common practice—if a man in a large way of business wants to raise money to meet a bill he pawns with us and takes the articles out again—it is done nearly every day—ours is the establishment in London where that is done to a large extent; we have a special position among diamond dealers—the prisoner had often pledged with us from time to time, through his brother, for £200 or £300, and had redeemed in a short time; he never left the things very long—he had regularly redeemed up to within a short time before his bankruptcy—we had other goods of his in pawn, but we had not had them very long—about October, about a fortnight before his bankruptcy, he redeemed about £500 worth—I believe that was on the 3rd October; I cannot say exactly.</p>

I am an auctioneer at Bradford—on 25th May, 1894, the prisoner deposited with me a quantity of silver articles and jewellery to Hell, and asked for an immediate advance, in order to release other goods—I advanced him on that day £2,000 by cheque—on 16th June I arranged with him for the sale to begin on 25th June—it was</p>

               <p>confined to his goods, and lasted from 25th June to 1.3th July—I advanced him £220 on 26th June, £10 on 3rd July, £200 on 5th July, £160 on 11th July, £210 on 12th July, and £1,600 on 13th July, the day the sale closed—the total amount realised by the sale was £5,189 16s.—on 27th July I forwarded to the prisoner my account, showing a balance of £25 13s. 2d. due to me—I had overpaid the prisoner, but I had a small security which just about secured me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Substantially I paid him £4,400; the rent went for commission and expenses of sale—he applied for more money—I had con<lb/>ducted sales for him three or four times before for considerable amounts—on January 30th I sold £4,175 17s. 9d. for him, and in April £1,938, and in July £7 13s.—I always found him perfectly straightforward in his dealings with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Poppleton, a chartered accountant, and the trustee in bankruptcy of the prisoner—I have had the conduct and management of the affairs—the prisoner has no books relating to a jeweller's business—I have seen books relating to a pawn<lb/>broker's business; I believe there are no entries in them since five years ago—there are no books of any consequence of the prisoner's business during the last five years—there are small memorandum books, but they do not contain any important details; they are not books of account—I believe the liability of £12,123 has all been incurred within a period of twelve months preceding the date of the receiving order, and most of it within eight months—I have nothing to show when the prisoner last redeemed any jewellery pledged with Mr. Attenborough—it is very improbable that prisoner will pay 20s. in the £; it will be more like 5s.—I think less than that, that is making allowance for the expenses, but it depends to a great extent on the result of certain Chancery actions now in progress to which his wife is a party—if they turn out satisfactorily I should say a dividend of about 6s. in the £ will be paid—the costs of the bankruptcy have taken a good deal of the assets; if the composition had been carried out there would have been more dividend.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The assets, diamonds and things of that kind, have realised at the present time about £2,500, by means of auction sales and sales by tender; some things were put up with reserve and some without reserve—the house property at Plymouth and Penzance is being realised—they are freehold premises in good parts of the towns, and are spoken of in very glowing terms—the total rentals of those properties is about £400 a year roughly—I found among the prisoner's papers a large number of writs which had been served by people in Hatton Garden for large amounts, within a week in October—I have traced the proceeds of the majority of the pawnings in the prisoner's bank book—in some cases, as</p>

               <p>far as I can trace them, I find the money obtained by pawning paid into his bank—I have not got the bank book—I have traced that some of the money received from the pawnbrokers has not gone into the pass book; it may be £400 in six months—he was in the habit of dealing with cash at that time—I had only the four pawn-tickets—I cannot say it was not paid away by him as cash in the purchase of other goods—I believe his bankers, ceased to allow him to overdraw in September last—his bankers are secured creditors for £2,000 or £3,000—the overdraft was less than that—they also had an account for a loan—the securities were more than enough to cover the current account, but they had stopped his over<lb/>draft about that time—I found from my investigation that when he ob<lb/>tained money by pawning diamonds he paid money into his bank and drew cheques on it, and paid his creditors in the ordinary course of trade—his transactions last year amounted to £20,000, I should think—in the ordi<lb/>nary course he would be paying old debts during the year, and contracting new ones, and if the term of credit was eight months I should not expect to find debts older than eight months—the earliest writ was issued against him about 10th October—there were writs issued against him between 10th and 20th October to the amount of £3,288—I can trace total payments of £11,000 in eight months last year—I think the goods he obtained in that time came to something more than that—there might be a difference of £1,000, one way or the other; it was a difference of more than £100.</p>

I am a widow, and live at 2, Vincent Street, West minster—my husband died about two years and eight months ago—he was a soldier—I have known the prisoner about twenty years—when he left the army he came to me—we were always friendly as neighbours—I knew his wife, perfectly well—on 18th January, 1894, I went through a form of marriage with the prisoner at the Registrar's office in Mount Street, Grosvenor Square—he then represented himself as a widower—I did not know that his wife was living till she drove up in a cab one night about eleven very drunk, and threatened to break the windows; she went into lodgings—the prisoner did not tell me his wife was dead—I have one child by him; he treated me well—there could not be a better husband or a kinder to my children, and those by my first husband—this is the certificate of my first marriage.</p>

She is now living at 8, Lambeth Road; she left me on March 15th, 1892"—I subsequently found it was at St. Ann's Church in 1870, instead of 1871—the prisoner afterwards quali<lb/>fied the name of the church—I have not got that on my note—he spoke to me at the Police-court, and asked if I had the certificate.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a director of Barclay and Sons, Limited, wholesale druggists, of 95, Farringdon Street—in December, 1889, I received this letter from Gustav Opitz, offering to represent our 'firm in the East, and representing that he was about to take a journey there, and asking for £100 to be 'paid to him in full settlement of salary and expenses, and for three per cent, commission on all "Business he did—on 15th February, 1890, we agreed to employ him, and to let him act as our agent in the East, to pay him £50 before he left England, and £50 at the expiration of six months—this is the agreement—we 'paid him £50, and sent him several cases of samples—we did not after that hear of him for some time, and some months afterwards we made inquiries, and found he was still in London—we employed a firm of solicitors, and they succeeded in getting back from him the £50 and the samples, without legal proceedings—we received this letter from the prisoner, dated September 2nd, 1890. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that if the agreement had been carried out they would have had to pay</hi> £100; <hi rend="italic">that he was ready to carry out the agreement, but that the breach of it was due to their solicitors' letter demand<lb/>ing repayment of the advance; that he thought it right they should pay some part of his expenses; that he had never bound himself to a particular days and wets going the journey as proposed</hi>)—we got back the samples after getting back the cheque—this is the cheque, no doubt, signed "L. L. Opitz,' by which we got back the £50—I had known nothing of Gustav Opitz until I received from him this letter <hi rend="italic">in</hi> 1889—there is no truth that I know of in the statement that Lehnert had obtained information from us as to the trustworthiness and respectability of Opitz—we had no inquiry from Lehnert—I never knew the prisoner in any other name than that of Gustav Opitz—I gave no information to anybody that he enjoyed our fullest confidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are four directors of our company—in 1890 there were four or five—our secretary was Walker—I showed him these letters—the prisoner gave a reference to Messrs. Bull and Bevan as to his character when he applied—they are large merchants in the City—he mentioned other firms whose names he gave as references; I don't remember their names—he wrote to us afterwards that the original plan under which he was going out had fallen through, and that he was going out as the representative of the Eastern Exchange; that was some time in 1890; my impression is that was about the time he returned the £50—the letter is dated July 23rd, 1890, in which he told us that I don't</p>

               <p>know if he was the secretary of the Eastern Exchange at that time—it was about that time that we first heard of his representing the "Eastern Exchange—I do not think I had heard of it before, but cannot swear to it—I have made ho inquiries about the 'Eastern Exchange and know nothing about it—our solicitor wrote and insisted on having the money back and not going into this arrangement, and thereupon the prisoner sent a cheque for the money—the samples were sent on his order some—where; I don't know If they had gone to the packet; I cannot say Where they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He proposed by the letter of the 23rd July, 1890, that our agreement should be transferred to the Eastern Exchange, and that the other £50 should be paid to the Eastern Exchange—we refused to do it, and after that we got our £50 back.</p>

                  </persName>. I am one of the firm of Perken, Son and 'Rav<lb/>ment, opticians, of 99, Hatton Garden—in January, 1890, I received this letter from Gustav Opitz referring to a tour in the East, and asking for £100 for expenses, £80 to be paid down—finally we came to this agree<lb/>ment with him—we declined to pay him any money in advance, but agreed to pay him commission, and a further small commission at the termination of His journey—he sent us this 'letter,' giving references to D. A. Hume and Co., 38, Mincing Lane; H. Haschte and Co., 86, Leadenhall street; and L. Lehnert, 14, Trinity Square, Tower Hill—I cannot say if we sent him a parcel of samples-; if they were sent, they were returned—Lehnert made no inquiries of us as to Gustav Opitz; we communicated with Lehnert, but we gave no reference to Lehnert or anyone else about Opitz—We knew nothing of Opitz till we recerved this first letter from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We communicated with lahnert—I Wtnnot say if we did with the other references—we got samples ready to send to the prisoner—I don't know Whether they were delivered Or not—I believe he called on us and mentioned about the Eastern Exchange—I cannot recollect the details; it is many year ago.</p>

                  </persName>. I am a chartered accountant—I was trustee in the prisoner's bankruptcy in 1887—I was never able to realise anything—the prisoner never attended his public examination, nor any of the proceedings, after my appointment—in September, 1890, I was released from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> trusteeship—amongst the debts alleged to be due to him is one from Morris, Brandt and Co., of £1,902, upon a judgment said 'to be obtained against them—L. Lehnert negotiated with me for the purchase of that debt, and offered £10 for it—I would not take it—in September, 1887, Lehnert wrote, "All I can offer for the judgment is £10"—I did not get any money by it—I don't think I should have been justified in selling a £1,900 debt for £10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner told me shortly after he became bank<lb/>rupt that he had an appointment from a firm, and was going to India to earn his living—I had no reason to doubt it—I think he went in March 1887—10th March, 1887, was the first date for the public examination, 28th April the second, and 26th May, 1887, the third—I don't know whether the prisoner was in India when Lehnert offered to buy the judg<lb/>ment debt—I refused it, and heard no more of it.</p>

In 1886, in consequence of information, I kept observation on the firm of Bernard and Co., of 4, Bury Street, St. Mary Axe—I watched persons supposed to be con<lb/>nected with that firm—as a result, on 6th June, 1886, I arrested Axel Holme, who was sent for trial to this Court—upon his arrest I searched Bernard and Co.'s office at 4, Bury Street, and among other things I found this press copy letter book, with letters signed, "Bernard and Co."—at the time I watched the premises I frequently saw Lothar Lehnert, in company with Axel Holme and others—I saw Lehnert going in and out of 4, Bury Street—one day, just before or after the conviction of Axel Holme, Opitz was first pointed out to me in Lombard Street in Lehnert's company—I did not see him again—Axel Holme was tried and convicted of fraud in this Court in July, 1886.</p>

                  </persName>. I have been in Lehnert's employment—I know Opitz and his writing—to the best of my belief these two bank slips, one in the name of Gustav Opitz, and one in the name of Walter Arnold and Co., and these letters signed Gustav Opitz and Bernard Opitz, are in the prisoner's writing—I know Lehnert's writing—this memo<lb/>randum, addressed to Louis Lowry and Co., and giving references to Bernard and Co., M. and E. Hesse, and Liman and Co., is, to the best of my belief, in the prisoner's writing—the answer to that, the letter of 24th February, 1886, is in Lehnert's writing—I understand German. (<hi rend="italic">This letter stated that Opitz was the London buyer of an Indian firm; that he teas considered an experienced man of business, possessed of some means, and supported strongly by his Indian firm, and that accounts of not a high figure might be credited to him</hi>)—on the front of this document is an inquiry from Schmeisser and Co., of Berlin, as to Opitz, and the trans<lb/>lation of what is on the back is, "In answer to your inquiry referring to G. 0. Rotten, hands off"—there is an answer written on it by Lehnert. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had known Opitz for some time through forwarding, and knowing the bank where he kept his account; that the bank gave a very good report about him; that the firm of whom Opitz rented an office, and who were a great exporting firm enjoying an excellent reputation, also gave satisfactory information about him; that Opitz repre<lb/>sented one of (lie largest firms in Mancliester, and was the European buyer for an important Bombay firm, but that it was said that he once had a differ<lb/>ence with two London enquiry agents about the collecting of some disputed accounts</hi>)—this letter of August 18th, 1886, is in Lehnert's writing—all these letters signed Lehnert are in Lehnert's writing, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

I knew Laitwood about six months before I knew the defendants—he knew I was involved through my bills to the extent of over £1,000, and was present at 15, Park Place, Leeds, at a meeting about 7th July—the meeting took about a quarter of an hour—Mr. Usill was in the chair; Mr. Parry, Mr. Holdsworth, and Mr. Alfred Avis were there, not Mr. Overton nor the other defendants—the sig<lb/>natories' shares were allotted—so far as my knowledge goes, nothing was paid for them, and no other shares had been applied for—the bills became due on 8th July, and some were presented for payment—that month an execution was put in my works at the suit of Brown for a bill—that had nothing to do with the twelve bills I had given—in consequence of the execution I filed my petition in bankruptcy, and was adjudicated a bank<lb/>rupt, in addition to the overdraft—my liabilities were not included in the valuation; I was to defray them—£2,066 was the valuation of loose assets—I knew Laitwood through the British and East India Fibre Company—the other £5,000 of bills were given by that company—I said before the Magistrate something on the lines, "I do not think I wanted the business turned into a limited liability company to prevent my assets being seized for my liabilities"—I was a little bit confused at that time—my object was to do good to all my creditors—I did not think I should defeat their claims—I had not sufficient money to meet them—I was constantly drawing money and paying money away—I knew I had not enough money to meet my bills at maturity—I hoped to meet the first eight bills because I expected the agreement to be carried out, and that the bills would be met out of promotion money—I filed my petition in bankruptcy on 19th July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Overton.</hi> I knew Mr. Frank Sampson at the same time as I knew Mr. Laitwood—Sampson had some of the bills—the balance of those bills I did not divide the proceeds of were given in payment for shares of the British and East India Fibre Company—I never got the shares. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in the depositions and the infor<lb/>mation</hi>)—I cannot say what I said at the Police-court—I have no recollection of Laitwood being on the platform when you came down to Leeds—the suggestion to turn my business into a company came from you through Laitwood—I deny that I authorised Laitwood to offer you £2,000 from my business for promotion money—Parry accepted the bills for a consideration—it was not suggested I should discount half the bills—execution was not put into my works on one of your bills—I said I wanted more working capital, and if I did not get it I should have to shut up the works—I do not think you did all you could to make the company a success—I allege fraud—I do not know Mr. Holt, a solicitor—loose assets would be loose as distinguished from fixed machinery—my total assets were returned at £2,498—the £14,000 was a "break down"</p>

               <p>price—you and Mr. Avis said you would underwrite in default of the public subscribing—I tried to help you to reinstate the company—I acted as a go-between once or twice—I did all I could to assist George Ambler, limited, to go on—you might have got some of your friends, as you said you wanted, to invest money in the company—you said you could make if thing a success even if the public did not subscribe a penny—I deny that you said you could not discount my bills in full—I have no recollection of it—I know now you could not—I have not had money to discount the bills—I am liable on them—I am a bankrupt—my estate has not yet paid anything—if you succeeded in taking over the property from the mort<lb/>gagees and my trustee in bankruptcy, I was to get £3,000 in shares as commission—I remember dining with you at Bradford, but not what we talked about—we were not together the whole day, because the examina<lb/>tion before the Registrar was finished about twelve o'clock—my letter to you stating that when I got back I found the sheriff's officer formally installed in the Canal Works at 2.30 on Saturday afternoon, etc., was written two or three, days after I filed my petition—when I gave up the £2,000 worth of bill. I was not aware that I was insolvent, nor was I that I know of—I took the risk of the bills—I dare<lb/>say my bankruptcy would make my position more difficult—Mr. parry was present when. I handed in the four bills—that was not the same day that the agreement was filed; I think it was signed on May 17th—I do not know whether the four bills shown were mine or not—personally I did not expect to get anything out of the first batch of bills except the money received from the company, which I thought was for the purpose of meeting the bills—I did not expect any of the proceeds of the discount of the bills—you made very frequent journeys—if I had raised any objec<lb/>tion I do not think Harris would have given up the bills when he had once got them—I do not remember going to Mr. Avis; his idea in going was to induce the bank to make an arrangement—if I had succeeded I should have been manager of the company, and should have £3,000 in shares for the work I was to do, and also for getting my mother to waive her interest; she had an annuity—I did not obtain her signature—I know I could not meet the £3,000 worth of bills if I had to find the money myself—one of these exhibits, 80 or 85 is in my writing; it is the draft of the National Mercantile—I was aware that Mr. Parry sent out circulars to his customers—this letter to Avis is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi> "<hi rend="italic">I am deucedly short of cash, and if you drop it I give you my word I won't blab.</hi>")—at that time I was endeavouring to borrow money—my bill for £200 commission to Maple was not in connection with this affair at all—the proposition as to £200 promotion expenses did not emanate from my com<lb/>pany—you were to pay this commission to Mr. Parry—I told you that the Indian Fibre Company had taken part of my mills at £400 rent and showed you proof to that effect, but I denied yesterday that they signed an agreement—it was not signed by the managing director, but by a large shareholder—you were not under a contract to underwrite the company, nor did you guarantee the sub<lb/>scription to the company by written agreement; there was a general agreement—I do not think it curious that it was not embodied in that letter—my own solicitor, on May 17th, put in an agreement founded on the affidavit, and it was not mentioned even that they had a guarantee—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200044"/>
               <p>said he would underwrite the greater part of the shares—I do not think told my solicitor about that—the Mercantile, did not draw the bills; I drew them—they were not to have any consideration for that as far as I know—those bills were not given for precisely the same purpose as the first lot of £2,000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first knew Mr. Sampson through Mr. Laithwood, and he introduced me to Maple, who introduced me to the defendants—I never got a share in the Fibre Company—I said in my letter, put in yesterday by Overton. "I had a very pleasant introduction to the sheriff's officer about 8.30 yesterday"—Simpson had handed one of my bills to Brown—"Of course I wired Sampson, I don't care which of you arranges it"; that was my feeling in the matter; either of them might arrange it—Sampson induced me to take shares, which I never got—he introduced me to Lait<lb/>wood, who introduced me to the defendants—Overton drew up the docu<lb/>ment of April 5th in reference to the underwriting, and from that time I was in communication with him or with Alfred Avis—one of the letters to the holders of the bills was written from Charing Cross, Mr. Overton being there—the promotion expenses were to be paid out of the £2,000; that was the reason for which they were given—there was I claim for them, but I do not know the amount—I have never received a single penny; I have been swindled out of £3,000 worth of bills—when I parted with the bills I believed they were for the purpose of purchasing my business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">He-examined.</hi> At the time I parted with my eight bills and the four bills the defendants had not told me that they were undischarged bankrupts, but I believe I knew it before I parted with the first eight bills.</p>

I am clerk to Williams and Co., bill discounters, of 35, Coleman Street—I have known Overton and Alfred Avis seven years as general agents and company promoters; they generally came to me together and brought bills to discount—in April, 1893, they brought Mr. Laitwood to me, who I did not know before—Laitwood had this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and wanted me to discount it—he said he had got his commission from Mr. Ambler—Overtonsuggested that we should make inquiries, whether the bill was in order—we wired and received replies—Laitwood said, could we make a small loan upon it, and I drew this cheque for £60 to John Laitwood, Esq. or order, dated April 13th, 1893—we discounted the bill a few days afterwards, drawing a cheque for £210 to John Laitwood or order on April 17th, 1893—I took the cheque out and cashed it, and deducted £75 from the £210—we said we would take £15 for three months; that was ordinary, not compound interest—that left him a balance of £145, so that he had £205. in all for the bill, and we had £45 on a bill of three months; we charged for the risk—Mr. Mapleton's name is on the back of the bill—one or other of them was there when £60 was paid, and when the £210 was paid.</p>

Overton—it is endorsed, and was met at my bankers—on the first bill, of May 9th, £100 was given, and the remainder in cash—the cheque is endorsed, "H. Williams, for and on behalf of the National Mercantile Company"—I did not know who H. Williams was—the balance was paid in cash—a considerable sum was owing for rent at that time, which I mentioned from time to time, and it was promised to be paid—the next bill was brought about June 7th for £250, on which I drew this cheque for £100, and on June 10th £40 in cash-both those cheques were payable to the National Mercantile Company, and the one for £100 was endorsed by Overton—on June 14th I paid a farther sum of £40 in cash, making an advance of £345; I charged £50 for interest, and that leaves a balance of £165 on the two bills—I applied that towards the rent, and Overton assented to that—the cheque was originally crossed, but either Overton or A. Avis asked me to take the crossing off—I do not know whether they had banking accounts—in May, 1893, I held bills of Mr. Cator's, which I had received from him, except the first—the National Mercantile had received them and endorsed them—they were not met—I sued the company on Cator's bill, and they handed me four bills of Ambler's and Parry's to hold as security—I held them till they matured, and Ambler or Parry wrote and asked me not to present them—I have not got the letter—I was told not to pay them in for a few days, because the company was not floated—I did so, but the company did not come out—with the Exception of £115 deducted from Ambler's two bills, I did not receive any rent—they owed me two years' rent, £145—I afterwards seized the furniture at Charing Cross for the unpaid rent.</p>

Parry Godfrey, and by the National Mercantile, S. E. Overton, Manager—I arranged to discount the bill on condition that he should pay the amount of his old debt, £90—I went with Overton and paid off the £57 10s., for which I charged £10 as commission, and gave him an open cheque for £92 10s.—I retained the bill till maturity, and it was presented and dishonoured—I got a dividend from Parry's estate—I took proceed<lb/>ings against all the parties—that was the only bill of Amblers which our company received, but we had transactions with Overton and Alfred Avis in 1893, which left them indebted to us about £1,000—before December, 1893, we pressed Overton for payment on account—he said that he was bringing out some companies and expected to be able to realise enough to pay it off, or at any rate to make some payment—in September, 1893, he applied for a further advance, which I made him, of £155, and he gave me some debentures of Ambler and Co. as security, on September 5th—this is the charge on the debentures.

I am a civil engineer, of 12, Spencer Road, St. John's Hill—I first knew the three defendants about June or July, 1892, and had business matters with them, and in June, 1893, A. Avis, I think, asked me to go down to Tilsdon, at Leeds, to report on the works of Mr. R. Ambler—I went there and made a valuation—the report dated June 8th, 1893, was afterwards put in the prospectus—I put the value at £14,630 for land, machinery, plant, and business—in July, 1893, Alfred Avis asked me if I would become a director of the Ambler Company; I at first demurred, I said that I could not qualify—he said that they would qualify me, and that they had bought the business—on that I agreed to become a director—in July I paid another visit to Leeds, and met young Mr. Avis and Mr. Parry—there was a meeting of the directors of George Ambler, Limited, at 15, Park Place, Leeds—I did not consider my<lb/>self a director, but they voted me into the chair, because I was a stranger; I suppose because it was a compliment—Mr. Parry took part in it as a director—the meeting lasted about half an hour—there was an agenda paper; a prospectus of the company was produced, but I do not think there was any discussion upon it; I think it had been already issued—there was a change of solicitors—I do not know who were the candidates for the secretaryship, but Mr. Newton secured it—the offices were to be at 15, Park Place, Leeds—I know of persons applying for shares—I met Mr. Holdsworth Piggott, but I did not know him as a shareholder—I paid nothing for my share—I held one—I do not know what became of the subscriptions, or if they ever paid a farthing; nothing was said about where the money paid for the shares was—the Craven Bank was appointed banker, but no money was drawn out because none had been paid in—the office of George Ambler, Limited, was transferred to 26, Charing Cross—I was asked nothing about the transfer from Leeds to London—the meeting in London was for issuing debentures—Avis said that owing to the bankruptcy of Mr. Ambler some arrangement must be come to with regard to taking over the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cove in Dumfoiesshire, Scotland—my wife has landed property there—in August or September, 1893, I was introduced by Mr. Myers Harris to Overton in London, but I knew Overton in 1892 as a company promoter—I desired to form a company to quarry the stone on my wife's property—I had a conversation with Overton about it, and I was to meet him the next day to go into the matter fully—I got this letter of 15th September. (<hi rend="italic">From S. C. Overton, Manager of the National Mercantile; that his directors had decided to form a limited syndicate, with</hi> £5,000 <hi rend="italic">capital, to work the quarry, on Mrs. Nugent agreeing to grant a lease for sixty years of twenty acres at a rental of</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">and a royalty, and to pay</hi> £300<hi rend="italic">a year for Overton's travelling expenses and</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">for promotion expenses, which would be returned if the company was not formed within three months</hi>)—I discussed the £500 bill at 26, Charing Cross with Overton—Alfred Avis was there—I said, "What do you want the £500 for? <hi rend="italic">First of all, I cannot lay my hands on £500 at the present time." He said, "Never mind about that, I can get it from the friend who introduced me to you." I said, "Before I sign any bill I must have security"—the £500 was to pay the expense of registration, engineer's and solicitor's fees, and different things—he said</hi> he would give security—I do not remember anything being said about underwriting—Mr. Harris then came in, and Mr. Overton said he was going to start these quarries for me, and asked Mr. Harris if he would discount the bill—Harris said it was too large a sum, but he would dis<lb/>count one bill for £250 first, adding, "Look here, Mr. Nugent, if the bill is dishonoured I shall hold you responsible." I said, "I do not care about that; Mr. Overton has promised me security for the amount"—Harris said, "What do you want security for?"—I said, "I shall not sign any bill unless I do get security"—then it was arranged there should be two bills for £250, instead of one for £500, accepted by me for my wife—then I got this letter from Overton. (<hi rend="italic">Agreeing to the</hi>£250 <hi rend="italic">bills</hi>, £10 <hi rend="italic">to be charged for renewal, and to deposit</hi>£500 <hi rend="italic">five per. cent, paid-up debentures in George Ambler, Limited.</hi>)—that was the first I heard of that debenture stock—the next day, Overton called at my town house, 45, Lower Belgrave Street, with the two bill forms—he saw me and my wife—I asked him about the debenture security, and he showed me the printed prospectus of George Ambler, Limited, with a picture of the mills and works—he said it was a going concern, and the debentures were fully secured on the freehold and the mills, and that there was £8,000 of new machinery in the basement—I believed that statement, otherwise I should not have signed the bills for £250—my wife also signed—I did not get</p>

               <p>the debenture certificates that day—the next day I consulted my solicitor, Mr. Holt, of Gray's Inn Square—in consequence of what he said I called with my wife at the Mercantile office, and arranged for a meeting for the 22nd at my house—I saw Overton, and asked him to bring with him two other bills for £250, drawn by the National Mercantile Company, instead of being in blank—I got the debenture stock, I think, on the day he came—these are the certificates and transfers of the £250 stock from Argles—I did not pay £100, the nominal consideration for the transfer—on the 22nd, Overton came to Lower Belgrave Street, and saw me, my wife, and Mr. Holt—he brought two bills drawn for £250 at three months—Mr. Holt said, "Before I allow my clients to sign these bills I should like to know what this security is you are offering; what you promise to do is nothing at all. Except you form and register a company, they have no security for this money (£500), supposing you do cot carry out your agreement"—Overton said, "Oh, it is understood, if we do not form this company, the £500 will be returned"—then Mr. Holt asked him as to the security, and Mr. Overton told him what he had told me—after consulting Mr. Holt aside, we signed the bills—it was arranged that Mr. Holt was to keep one bill as trustee for the National Mercantile Company, the other was given to Overton for expenses in promoting what was to be called "The Cove Quarries, Limited"—the company was registered in November—the other bills were destroyed at that interview—I next saw Overton at the Savoy Turkish Baths on 26th October—I was surprised to see him, and said, "What brings you here?"—he said, "I have just been up to the First Avenue Hotel, and have seen Mrs. Nugent"—I said, "Yes, what did you want to see her for?"—he said, "I want some more money"—I said, "You had £250; what have you done with it?"—he said, "I have got the money subscribed; I have got a board "f directors; I want £250; I want to head the list of subscribers myself with £200"—I said, "What have you done with the money?"—I did not want to part with another bill, and Mr. Holt had the second bill—I said, "Why don't you go to Mr. Holt for it?"—he said, "I don't want to have anything to do with him"—he told me he had Mrs. Nugent's signature to another bill, and I asked him why he did not go to Mr. Holt instead of to my wife—he said if I did not sign the bill he could not go on with the concern—I said, "Who are the directors?"—he said, "I have got Florence, the architect, to go on the board"—I went out with him and, like a fool, signed the other bill at the Gaiety Restaurant—he took this bill of 26th October from his pocket—it bore my wife's acceptance—it is Overton's writing—we went to Scotland, with Mr. Usill, his engineer, and went over the property—Mr. Usill's view was favourable; there was much stone there—I drove Overton to Annan to see Mr. Scott, my Scotch solicitor, on 15th and 18th September—I afterwards attended at the offices of the London solicitor of the Mercantile Company, Mr. Daniel Jones, of Quality Court, and letters passed between the solicitors—the beginning of 1894, my first bill became due, and was paid—Mr. Harris was the discounter—Mr. Holt has the second bill—it was dishonoured—I was pursued in the Scotch Courts, and eventually the action was settled by a payment of £175 by my solicitor—the solicitor for the holder of the bill was Mr. Daniel Jones—I had conversations with Overton at various times about the com<lb/>pany—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200061"/>
               <p>said he was going on with the company, getting the directors, and the money for floating it—once I met Overton and the two Avises in Chancery Lane—I think it was after the first bill became due—in the course of the conversation Overton and Alfred Avis went away and left me with Henry Avis—I said, "Look here, Avis, cannot you inform me if Ambler's business is a sound business, and if my security is all right?"—he said, "Yes, you can rely upon that; it is all right, it is a going con<lb/>cern"—I said, "Why did not you answer my solicitor's letter and give him the list of shareholders of this George Ambler, Limited?"—he said, "I can't be bothered by answering the letter of every shareholder; if Mr. Holt wants to find out he had better go to Leeds and find it out for him<lb/>self"—I had been introduced to Henry Avis a day or two before that by either Overton or Alfred Avis—I took him to be the secretary of George Ambler, Limited—no company has been yet formed on the lines stated by the defendants—I have had no return for the bills—a lease was drawn and signed by Mr. Scott, and everything was done on our part to form the company—I signed the bills on the faith of the statements made by Overton—I believed that George Ambler, Limited, owned the works depicted in the picture at the top of the debenture certificate, and the statements made about the new machinery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 6, Gray's Inn Square—I acted as solicitor for Mr. and Mrs. Nugent—on 20th November Mr. Nugent came to me and showed me two letters; we had some conversa<lb/>tion, and I gave him some advice, and on 22nd September I wrote to the secretary of George Ambler, Limited. (<hi rend="italic">Asking for particulars about the company, as a client proposed to take a transfer of debenture stock.</hi>)—I afterwards went to 45, Lower Belgrave Street, on 22nd September, and met Mr. and Mrs. Nugent and Overton—I told him I was acting as solicitor for Mrs. Nugent; that I understood he had obtained two accept<lb/>ances accepted by Mr. and Mrs. Nugent, each for £250, and that those acceptances had been drawn in blank—he said it was so—I asked him if he had them with him, and he produced them—I said, "These bills are drawn in blank, and do not show the name of the drawer, and I must have them back"—he gave them to me, and I tore them up and put them at the back of the fire—I said I understood he had two further acceptances, each for £250, drawn upon Mr. and Mrs. Nugent by the National Mercantile Investment Company, Limited—he said he had, and produced them—I said before I could allow Mr. and Mrs. Nugent to accept those two further bills, there was certain information which I enquired—Overton said at once, "If you are dissatisfied with the arrange<lb/>ment,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200069"/>
               <p>the whole business is at an end"—I said that I had not come there to end the negotiations between Mr. Overton and Mr. and Mrs. Nugent, but to put them upon a proper basis—I showed Overton these two letters of the National Mercantile Investment Company, of 15th and 18th October, setting out a few of the heads of the arrangement between Overton and Mr. and Mrs. Nugent—I pointed out that in those two letters the National Mercantile Investment Company undertook to form a limited syndicate of £5,000 capital, for the purpose of working the Cove quarries—I objected to the word "form," as susceptible of several meanings, and asked him whether he meant to undertake that £5,000, which we all agreed would be necessary as working capital for this company, should be actually paid up to the credit of the company's banking account—he told me that was what he did mean—I pointed out that the word "form" might possibly mean registering a company of £5,000 nominal capital, and I went on to say that as he wan asking £500 for doing that; if he meant merely registering he was doing what anyone else would do for about £150; that I thought the company and Overton were asking far too large a sum; that in order to register a company with £10,000 nominal capital, the fees at Somerset House would be about £15; that the legal charges ought not to exceed £50; printing the memorandum and articles of association and prospectus would probably cost, I think I said, £20, and the only other disbursement he would have to make would be the fees of the expert for going down and examining the quarries, and I put that down at £25 or £30 at the outside, and I said that £250 would be ample for the needs of promoting the Cove quarries—Overton agreed that that was reasonable—I then went on to discuss the question of the security which he was offering—I had in my hands at the time two debenture stock certificates of George Ambler, Limited, and the transfer and the prospectus of the company, which I had received from Mr. Nugent—I said I wanted some more information about the position of George Ambler and Company, Limited, I knew nothing about it, I never heard of ib before—Over<lb/>ton at once said, "We promoted George Ambler, Limited, and I can vouch for it. It is not a large company, but it is a very sound one; it owns the freehold mills, which you see on the prospectus. A large portion of those are sublet, so the company makes a profit out of them"—he said the company owned £12,000 worth of machinery, of which a large portion was practically new; that the company was making a net profit at the rate of £1,500 a year, and that the interest on this debenture stock issue would only require £500, and that, therefore, it was thoroughly well secured—he added that the company was a small one, but it was a thoroughly sound one, and with more capital he expected much better results than £1,500 a year—I told Mr. Nugent I should like to make further inquiries—he said he was quite satisfied with Overton's statements—I took him aside, and gave him certain advice, and we came back to Overton, and Mr. Nugent concluded the transaction—Mr. and Mrs. Nugent then accepted two other bills in place of the two I had destroyed for the same amount, but drawn by H. Horwood Avis, as secretary of the National Mercantile Investment Company—it was pointed out that the amount was too large, and it was arranged that I should take one of those bills, and hand it over to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200070"/>
               <p>the National Mercantile Investment Corporation as soon as the £5,000 for working capital had been subscribed and paid up, and practically the whole transaction completed—Overton said that the whole business would be concluded within two months, and then out of the money Mr. Nugent would obtain as the price of the lease of the stone quarries he would be able to take up these two acceptances—when the interview was over I drove with him in a cab to Whitehall—I had the transfers and one of the bills—in the cab Overton asked me for a line just to show that I held this bill for the National Mercantile Investment Company—I agreed to do so, and a day or two afterwards I sent this letter and memorandum, dated 25th September. (<hi rend="italic">The letter enclosed a memorandum of the arrange<lb/>ment between the company and Mr. and Mrs. Nugent, and requested in<lb/>formation as to whether the directors had ratified the arrangement</hi>,)—I received this reply from Overton on 29th September, 1893. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the memorandum was not the undertaking he required; that he merely wanted a letter, stating that he (Mr. Holt) held the</hi> £250 <hi rend="italic">bill, as bailee, the bill to be handed to Overton or the company as soon as they had formed and registered a limited syndicate or company, and that he supposed the lease would contain all necessary covenants, and so obviate any further preliminary agreement.</hi>)—I don't think I saw Overton again till 10th October—on 7th October I wrote asking how the matter was progressing—on 9th October I had this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he was much pleased with his inspection of the quarry, and his experts report.</hi>)—on 10th October, I believe, he called at my office and said he was very well pleased with the quarries, and that he had got practically the whole of the capital for the proposed company, and that he supposed he was now entitled to the second bill—I told him he was not yet; even if he had the capital promised, it was not paid up, and I said I certainly should not let him have the second bill until I was satisfied that the capital was paid up, or at least subscribed by good and solvent people whose word was as good as their bond—I asked him for a list of the names and addresses of the people who had subscribed this capital—he said he could not give me the names and addresses because they had not signed application forms; he had only got their verbal promises, and he could not have them interfered with until they had actually signed their application forms so as to bind themselves—he went away, and did not have the bill—I saw him again about November 1st or 2nd at my office; it was a very short interview—I had then heard that he had got a bill behind my back with<lb/>out notice to me from Mr. and Mrs. Nugent—I mentioned it to him, and said I did not think it was a proper way of treating them—I asked him how the company was getting on—he said he had practically got the whole of the money, but he had some difficulty about getting a board of directors—I was not friendly with him—I had occasion from time to time to go to Mr. Jones's office about some other matter—I saw Overton on some occasions; I met him just inside Mr. Jones's office, and in Quality Court outside—I just said, "How are the Cove quarries going on?"—he said, "Very well," he had got all the money—about 29th January I gave a cheque for £250 to Mr. Myers Harris in exchange for one of the bills that Mr. Nugent had accepted at my office—on 29th March, 1894, H. H. Avis called on me; I was so surprised that I wrote up to Scotland giving the purport of the interview—he wanted to know whether I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200071"/>
               <p>taking proceedings against him—I told him that at the present moment I was not doing so, but that criminal proceedings against the whole gang would certainly follow—he complained that Overton and his brother, A. Avis, had made a cat's paw of him, and induced him to sign all sorts of acceptances without his knowing anything about them, and that, as a consequence of his faith in Overton, he had been adjudicated a bankrupt—I asked him what had become of the money which Mr. and Mrs. Nugent's acceptances had produced—he replied that he had no idea, but guessed that Overton had stuck to it—he stated that he was secretary of the company only in name, and that his chief duty had been to put his name either personally or on behalf of the company to bills upon a promise that he was to be paid for so doing—he complained that Overton had never given him a penny, and left him finally stranded in the Bankruptcy Court—I next saw him in the dock at Westminster Police-court—in August, 1894, I applied for criminal process against Overton, and got a warrant against him—I had communicated with the Treasury some time before, but matters were delayed owing to the resignation of the late Public Prosecutor about that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Overton.</hi> The letter I wrote on 22nd September to the secretary of George Ambler, Limited, was not returned through the Dead Letter Office—I did not write to ask why I had no reply, because I had made some inquiries at that time about the National Mercantile In<lb/>dustrial Company, and Overton, the managing director, and I had searched at the Somerset House Registry of Joint Stock Companies, and had seen the nature of the company which George Ambler was, and I regarded Mr. Nugent's £250 as lost—you had signed for and on behalf of George Ambler, Limited—in some companies there is very little difference between manager and managing director—I did not write to George Ambler, Lim., again—you had written to Mr. Nugent two letters which were very vague, and I thought there were expressions in them which ought to be explained—I do not know that I had any definite idea when I went to that inter<lb/>view, except to get back the two bills—that was my chief object in going there—they were two bills drawn in blank, and anyone might have put his name to them, and I thought it was not the proper way to carry out a transaction—on 20th September I went with Mr. Nugent to the Joint Stock Companies Registry to ascertain what the National Mercantile Com<lb/>pany was, and I found that the subscribed capital was less than £300,1 think, and I thought it was a very weak company to guarantee the under<lb/>writing of £5,000 capital—I had no definite intention, one way or the other, of having the agreement altered before I let my clients go on with the matter—when I stamped these documents on the 20th, I did not know that we should succeed in getting back these two bills—I think the date on them was some time previous to the 22nd; but the matter was before my mind then, so I stamped them—I refer in my letter of 25th to the interview on the 22nd at Lower Belgrave Street—my cost book is not here—you handed me back the two bills for cancellation without any understanding as to their being replaced, and you surprised me still more by offering to withdraw from the business—you were not keen on it at all; if you had been I should have been more cautious—I did not want to impose other terms—before I allowed my clients to give up the bills I made a condition that £5,000 was to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200072"/>
               <p>subscribed and paid up before the second bill was paid over—you informed me that that was the meaning of "form" in your previous letter—possibly I said that there was no undertaking on your part to guarantee the subscrip<lb/>tion and payment of £5,000 for the company—you said you had always intended that, and "form" meant that—you said the £5,000 was to be guaranteed and paid up before I paid over the second bill—you were agreeing to exactly the same terms as were in the agreement as regards the £500; the only difference was that £250 was to be retained by me in the form of a bill until you had carried out an agreement—if the business went through the result would be the same to you; if you failed, and it did not go through, it would make a difference to you—I don't admit that you were not keen on the business; you offered to drop it, and not proceed with it—Mr. and Mrs. Nugent were present when you said you were not keen about the business; I was thrown off my guard by it—I said, in a company of this sort, with a nominal capital of only £10,000, in case of liquidation, it was the unfortunate experience of debenture holders that there were generally no assets if the debentures were in the nature of a floating charge; I re<lb/>garded them as security, but not in the very favourable light you wished me to—you never mentioned Mr. Linnett's name, or that any property had been transferred—I did not reply, "I know Mr. Linnett"—I only knew him by name, I think; either then or shortly after, I got to know him—I am perfectly certain that the date of the interview was 22nd; my first interview with Mr. Nugent was on the 20th; at my request Mrs. Nugent called on the 21st—I don't remember having seen this letter of September 21st before—I never saw you on September 21st—I swear I did not ask you to write that letter; that is, if the date is correct—it is quite possible I asked you to write such a letter on the 22nd; it bears out what I say, that I wanted the subscriptions for the £5,000—I don't think it is a fair way of putting it to say that that letter represents the sole variation and alteration of those two letters of the 15th and 18th—if the whole of the terms which are necessary in a promoter's agreement, where there is to be a lease, had been put into writing, they would have run to 120 folios probably—there were a lot of verbal agreements introduced as well—if the lease were signed that would show many of the terms, but here many terms were never put in writing—Mr. and Mrs. Nugent wanted to go back to Scotland on the 23rd—when they parted with these two original bills they had had no legal advice—the sentence in the memorandum, that £500 should be paid for negotiating the lease, was my way of putting your promise that there would be a sufficient sum in cash, payable to Mr. and Mrs. Nugent before the end of two months, so that they might retire their acceptances if they were called on to do so—the £500 was to be a premium for granting the lease—you do not, in your reply of 29th September, say anything about getting the capital subscribed; you only wanted me to give you a line saying that I held a bill, without setting out the terms on which I held it, and you could have sued me on it the next moment—you could have registered a company on that, and people, if they had had a letter of that sort in their possession, and did not know the mutual interpretation of the word "form," would have been grossly misinformed as to the terms on which I held that bill—after the interview in Lower Belgrave Street you asked me to let you have a line paying I</p>

               <p>was bailee of the bill; when I sat down in my office I thought it was an unsafe thing to do, and I gave you more than you asked for—it was incorrect to say that the whole of the agreement was at your request—the memorandum only contains my views; I never asked you to sign it—I received no letter repudiating it—I did not exactly know your position in the company—I got no ratification from your directors—I did not write again for it, or press for it verbally or otherwise—after your letter I was not very favourably impressed—the directors might have passed a resolution giving you a free hand—I did not write again to you—I was liable to a demand from you for that second bill; you made a demand, and I refused to listen to it—I suppose, if the agreement constituted by the letters of 15th and 18th September had not been altered, my clients would have been liable—I did not think it necessary to send a copy of the memo<lb/>randum to Scott—I left the preparing of the lease to Scott—you said you had been to Scotland to inspect the quarries—at the interview at Lower Belgrave Street you said you were going, I think—it was not understood that if your inspection and report did not confirm that of Mr. Beattie, you should have the option of withdrawing from the contract, and not going on; that in not the reason you handed me those bills—I do not remember that Mr. and Mrs. Nugent gave you a letter answering yours of the 15th, 18th, and 20th—I will not swear one way or the other whether it was so—I have no remembrance of saying, "This letter does not include your subsequent letter of the 20th"—you did not suggest whether £250 was reasonable—it would be five per cent, for promotion; a solicitor's fee is only one per cent—I did not know that £250 would not cover your out-of-pocket expenses; I know something about company promotion—I said £15 would be the registration fee for a com<lb/>pany with £10,000 nominal capital; I think I had just registered a com<lb/>pany with that capital—I had no knowledge how the National Mercan<lb/>tile Investment Company was going to get the money—I knew you had not got it yourselves; I believed you had means of influencing it—I did not for a moment expect that a prospectus would be issued to the public in a company of this size; it is too absurd—I suppose you had been back from Scotland about ten days when I saw you on the 20th—you repre<lb/>sented to me then that you had got the money subscribed, and I at once wrote to my clients and told them of it—I asked you if a, trust deed had been executed; I think you said it had not been; that it was deben<lb/>ture stock—you did not say it had not been because the property had not been transferred—it was done so rapidly because Mr. Nugent said he had absolute faith in you; that you had been introduced to him by Mr. Myers Harris, whom he had known as a respectable man for several years, and that he was quite satisfied with your statements; and when I urged that I should have delay for inquiries, Mr. Nugent said he was going back to Scotland next day, and the thing must go through—the company had only been recently registered, and here could not be a balance-sheet—the prospectus of George Ampler shows that the business will be taken over from 25th April, 1893; it was not possible to have a balance-sheet in September 1893—you stated that the net profit was £1,500—I had no knowledge about it—I was there pri<lb/>marily to get back the £500 you had got—I think I first "knew Mr. Usill when he brought me a writ which the National Mercantile Company</p>

               <p>had issued against him—I had seen his name on the prospectus—I think very likely Mr. Nugent introduced him to me—Mr. Nugent's information was drawn and settled by Mr. Cecil Basil Champion, barrister—I saw it—I made no complaint to you till these proceedings were taken—I had a long correspondence with people connected with Ambler to try and get some truth; I had written to Parry at Leeds.</p>

I was at the Police-court through<lb/>out these proceedings—I was present when Henry McKeone was called as a witness, examined by Mr. Bodkin, and cross-examined by the prisoner's representatives—Mr. McKeone signed his depositions after they had been read to him. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Henry McKeone was read. Those parts referring to the charges in the Indictment were as follows</hi>: "I am a civil engineer and contractor. I was a partner in the firm of McKeone, Avidor, and Crawley, of 9, Victoria Street. I know defendant Overton. I was introduced to him about July 26th, 1892, at Euston, by Mr. Avis and Mr. Newton; by Mr. Alfred Avis. I think I may say. I was introduced by Newton. I was on my way to Shrewsbury in connection with business for the Shropshire Mineral Light Railway. I had, I should think, learnt about the railway about two months before the introduction. There were letters during this time passing between our firm and the National Mercantile Investment Company—always, I think, in connection with the railway. I first learnt of the company shortly after our return from Shropshire, I think, by letters with that heading coming</p>

               <p>from Overton, signing as manager of the company. He offered me farther security in the shape of a debenture bond of George Ambler and Co., Limited. He said that Ambler and Co.'s business of making shoe and heel tips had been a successful business—had been carried on for many years by the late George Ambler, who had built the works at Silsden, near Leeds; that George Ambler had died, the business being carried on by his widow and son; that the National Mercantile Company had undertaken the flotation of the business at Silsden into a limited company; had registered the same and issued the prospectus; that applications locally for the shares had been made; but that the son, who had speculated in Stock Exchange matters, had been foolish enough to file his petition of liquidation just at the moment in which the company was prepared to go to allotment. The applications for shares in George Ambler, Limited, had therefore been withdrawn, and that, in consequence, the National Mercantile and their friends had been (together with Mrs. Ambler) obliged to invest considerable sums in finding the capital necessary to carry on the new company's business. Doing so had denuded his company and himself of ready money, which necessitated his asking my firm or me for the advance. That the debentures were secured on freehold property, buildings, and machinery, valued at £20,000 or thereabouts, on which there was al<lb/>ready a first mortgage of, I think, £4,000 or £5,000. I should send up my confidential agent, Mr. Millett, to the office, 26, Charing Cross, to get all particulars. He said that the money was wanted at once. He left a trade journal, describing George Ambler and Co., I think a north country trade paper. He left the debenture bond (marked in red, No. 2). That afternoon I sent Mr. Millett to make inquiries, and next morning I re<lb/>ceived letter (3). On the 7th November Overton called on me. We touched on the letter (3), every statement in it, in my conversation with him, and I received the assurance from him that the statements in the letter were true. I asked why no dividend had been paid in Ambler and Co.; he said that the company had been a very short time in existence; no dividends had been declared, but the profits were satisfactory. I stated that, having had no further time to inquire into the debenture bond, I should require his personal security in case the National Mercantile should fail to redeem the bond, or repay the debt. I can't say the words I used. He said he would do so, and I think that morning we ex<lb/>changed letters. I think a resolution was at that interview drafted by Overton. The letter (4) is one of the two so exchanged, written by Over<lb/>toil. At the same time there was a discussion as to the resolution. The letter (5) contains the resolution, initialled by both of us. No. 6 is Over<lb/>ton's letter, as to the passing of the resolution in those terms. No. 7 is the letter signed by me; the advance was to be made for six months. I agreed to advance £150, and I accepted in the name of our firm this bill of exchange, dated 7th November. The advance was for three months, but it was understood I was not to press Overton for six months. The advance was for six months; the bill was for three months. I received in blank a transfer of £1,000 debenture stock in Ambler and Co. The name of the witness is S. C. Overtoil; the transferor is H. Williams. The defendant Overton took away the acceptance with him on that occasion. On the 8th November I got this letter (10), signed by H. Williams, secretary. At the time I signed the ac<lb/>ceptance</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200076"/>
               <p>I did so on Mr. Overton's statements, of which I have details, with regard to George Ambler and Co. I wished to assist the railway scheme, and I believed Overton's statements, with regard to Ambler and Co., and his prospects, were true, and that his giving me his personal guarantee in the matter of the acceptance was a proof of the <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi> of his statement. The bond had necessarily had an influence on my mind. I believed that the bond was a security. I did not at that time know who the H. Williams on the bond was. I had letters in that name from the National Mercantile. After November 8th, I received letter (11) of November 10th, 1893, from the National Mercantile; I saw the articles of association of the company before I accepted the bill of exchange. I got the letter (12) of November 16th, 1893. On Decem<lb/>ber 15th I received letter (13). I received letter of January 13th, signed 'A. N. Avis' (14). J received letter of January 26th, 1894 (15), signed 'S. C. Overton.' I read that letter. I saw Overton since. The first time I said I would consult my partners. On the second I said, 'My partners would certainly not consent.' I made no further advance than the one £150. I received letters 16, 17, 18, and 19 from Overton. After letter 19, I must have had further conversations with Overton on the question of advances. I had conversations. Mr. Overton asked, or rather I asked, that we should see Mr. Conybeare on the subject men<lb/>tioned in Mr. Overton's letter. We received some time during that period draft works, contracts, and financial contracts with reference to the line (marked 20 and 21); 20 is the works, 21 the finance. The con<lb/>tracts were not looked very carefully through by our firm. The financial I would have nothing to do with on any consideration. We never executed either contract. I got the letters 22, 23, and 24 from Overton, and also 25, of the 7th April, referring to Mr. Usill. On the 1st May I got 26 from Overton. On 5th May, or the 6th, the £150 bill became due. I wrote in the name of the firm to the company (<hi rend="italic">not produced</hi>), pointing out that the debt was becoming due, and asking for repayment; and I wrote, I believe the same day, to Mr. Overton (I copy letters); I got answer (27), signed 'C. E. Brown 'on behalf of the company. I can't remember if Overton kept the appointment; he made so many he did not keep. I received letter (28). I had written to Mr. Overton that I had seen in one of the papers that a petition had been presented against the company. About 15th or 16th May Overton called on me, and said that he hoped to re-establish the position of his company and pay the loan, and failing that, he would pay it himself. I waited, but the loan wan never repaid. I wrote on 21st May. I never got any satisfactory reply. In no form have I received the £150, or any portion. During the time the loan was to run I took no steps because of my guarantee, my undertaking not to do so. About the beginning of May I first heard something, and I mentioned to Mr. Overton at that time that I was not satisfied with the bond He attempted an explanation. He disputed my assertion that the bank, the first mortgagees, had foreclosed on the property, and further asserted that his company was still negotiating with the first mortgagees to acquire full title of the property, but I cut the explanation very short at the time. I did nothing to realise the bond. I took no steps to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew that Overton was the managing director of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200077"/>
               <p>National Mercantile Company, and that the business of the company (I was told) was the formation of companies. I was told that the com<lb/>pany had purchased the Act for the bringing out of the Shropshire Light Mineral Company. I was introduced to Overton with a view to my firm acquiring the contract for the construction of that line Ambler's bond was first mentioned to me on 6th November. I have been connected with public companies, and have had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> experience as a pro<lb/>fessional man in their formation. I knew what a bond of this character meant. I mean a bond in similar language. Mr. Overton wanted this to be pressed forward through quickly, and there was no time to make inquiry. I should not have lent money without the debenture bond. I thought it would be worth something near £150. I did not know that Amblere had gone to smash. I can only say I believed the bond to be worth something—that the company was not so rotten as it turned out to be. I insisted on Overton's personally guaranteeing the bond. It was that his being liable showed he believed in the bond. I had no time to make inquiry as to the value of Ambler's bond. Looking at letter (3), I do not say of my own knowledge that any statement therein is untrue. I think I should have consulted my partners more fully if I had not had Overton's guarantee. I don't think I should have accepted that bill without Overton's guarantee. I first made complaint on receiving a call from Mr. Usill, when he told me his solicitor wished to make a statement to me about Ambler and Co. I complained to the solicitor (Mr. Holt) about the time the bill became due. I did not know about it when the bill became due. After the bill became due I laid this information. Overton offered me £50 down and the remainder at three and six months; some time in September, I should think—after I knew proceedings had been taken I don't suggest that Overton knew at that time proceedings had been taken here. Overton told me that Ambler had property and machinery value £20,000. I make no suggestion as to that not being a fact. I understood Ambler's property had been transferred to Ambler and Co., Limited. Overton did not mention Ambler's business to me on the first occasion. Ambler's business was first mentioned to me on the 5th or 6th Novem<lb/>ber. Between September and November 5th or 6th I would imagine that Overton's company was short of money. I did not understand that Ambler's property would be taken over by the receiver of the estate. I understood that the company had acquired the property before Ambler filed his petition in bankruptcy. According to my knowledge they could only acquire it by paying for it. Overton had informed me that the National Mercantile Company had had to find the money for Ambler's property; that was the reason they were short of money. He told me the Craven Bank held a mortgage on this property, I heard from Overton that a company had acquired the property, subject to a mortgage of £5,000 by the bank I was told that Mrs. Ambler had an interest in the property. I understood that she had transferred all her interest in the property to the company for shares, for a consideration. I know what a debenture bond is. In any debenture bond there should be some charge on the property to secure the debentures. I don't think I asked Overton if any mortgage deed were executed on this property to secure the debentures. I don't think I should ask if a mortgage had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200078"/>
               <p>been executed if I went to purchase debentures. I took the debenture bond of £1,000 to be a mortgage on property valued at £20,000, subject to a first mortgage of £5,000. Before advancing this £150 I wanted Mr. Overton's personal guarantee, although I had, as I thought, a mortgage for £1,000. I knew that Mr. Usill was a director of George Ambler, Limited. I knew the secretary of George Ambler, Limited'—Mr. Newton He was the gentleman who first introduced this Shropshire Light Railway Company to me. At that time I think I knew Mr. Overtoil's private address. I had never been to his house. I did not know that it was an expensive establishment; I knew nothing about it. I never heard that Overton had been proprietor of a large block of residential mansions at Queen Anne's Gate till this moment. I have already said that I would not have advanced that £150 but for the debenture bond. I knew nobody else in that company but Mr. Overton. I handed the bill to Mr. Overton before I received the letter as to the resolution of the company. I believe so. Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 47, Chancery Lane—I knew Overton and A. Avis; H.H. Avis I did not know till I saw him at the Police-court—I knew of the National Mercantile Investment Company, at 26, Charing Cross—about 28th October this bill for £250, accepted by Mr. and Mrs. Nugent, was brough to me—Overton and A. Avis then owed me a bill for £160, and sundry loans; about £230, I should think—I think they brough the bill together; they asked me if I could discount it, or get it discounted—I said I thought I could; I kept it—I asked them how they got it, and they said it was in connection with the promo<lb/>tion of a stone quarry company belonging to Mrs. Nugent—I discounted it with Mr. Jones, a client of mine; who gave me £235 for it, and I gave the prisoners the same amount, less some moneys they owed me, and a small sum for the registration of the Cove Quarry Company—I drew against the bill two cheques, for £50 and £115, payable to the National Mercantile Investment company—the balance was made up of £15 for discounting it, £14 10s. for costs, £17 10s. for registering the Cove Quarry Company, £3 for petty cash loan, for the expense of wiring to Mr. Scott; £5 was given to Avis, and I have no record of the last £10—I kept the bill till maturity—I then presented it, and it was dishonoured—I sued Mr. Nugent in the Scotch Courts, as he refused to pay—eventually</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200080"/>
               <p>I accepted payment of £175 to settle the whole transaction—I recollect having a promissory note of Mr. Richards, of the firm of Richards and Neale—Avis first mentioned it to me, but Overton brought it, and asked if I could get it discounted, and I said I could—I did not know Mr. Richards, a brother solicitor—I put it through my bank, and discounted it for £90—he happened to be banking at my bank—£7 10s. was deducted in respect of a dishonoured cheque for Argles, which I paid to Avis—£65, I believe, I paid to both Overton and Avis; £10 was the bonus, and £17 10s. was retained on account of out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Windsor Castle Brewery Company—that was on October 3rd—the entry of the £7 10s. for Argles' bad debt is in the cash-book, "Argles commission, £7 10s"—he was Argles, of Bedford—I did not know him as the purchaser of £1,000 debenture stock; I know nothing about that—Mr. Richards paid that bill on pres<lb/>entation—Overton brought me McKeone's acceptance for £150 at the beginning of November—he may have mentioned before it was coming—at that time we had the negotiations on for the Shropshire Mineral Light Railway—I was acting in the matter with Overton—I discounted that bill for £140, I think—the difference was my charge for discounting it—I paid it by several cheques; some to Overton, some to Avis—at maturity, my bankers collected the money, and it was paid to my office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Overton.</hi> On October 21st I sent down to register the Cove Quarries, but Avis being in London and Overton in Scotland, there was some difficulty about signing the articles of association, and they went backwards and forwards, and the company was not registered till November 4th—I acted on your instructions as manager of the National Mercantile Company in the correspondence with Scott and Co.—delay arose because I did not understand Scotch law, not only about finance—there were technical terms about earnest money and the payment of rent, which were different to the agreement come to between the parties—you seemed anxious to get them thoroughly complete; you were at my office nearly every day, I think—the negotiations for the lease went on up to January this year—you seemed very interested in the quarries, and seemed to think a good deal of the scheme—if I was satisfied that the state<lb/>ments made by you and in the prospectus were true, I could have found some of the capital—I should not have found £3,000—I don't believe in putting all my eggs in one basket—I was never asked to do it, but I thought it was a good concern from what you told me—the lease is referred to in the prospectus—I did not know you as an architect and surveyor before you were connected with company matters—I have employed your services as an architect and surveyor since I have known you—you told me you practised as an architect and surveyor—I knew you from the time you ceased to be repre<lb/>sented by John Hughes, of 26, Charing Cross—before you went to Scot<lb/>land you told me Mr. and Mrs. Nugent were finding the expenses for floating the quarries, and that they were going to provide the £500 by two bills—I always' understood from you that there were to be two bills—you first mentioned the matter to me in October, before you went to Scotland—you may have mentioned that Mr. Holt held one of the bills; I have no recollection of it—nothing was said to me about the capital having to be subscribed before you were entitled to the bill—I think you mentioned</p>

               <p>you were going to Scotland to obtain Authority for Mr. Holt to give the bill up—I believe the £250 bill, dated 25th October, was brought to me on 24th or 25th October—I noticed at the time it was the day anterior to the date of the bill, and I asked the reason of it and I understood you to say that Mr. and Mrs. Nugent did not want the bill to fall due on a given date—I fix the 25th as the date it came into my recollection by a letter I wrote to my bankers—I asked you who discounted the other bill, and you told me Mr. Harris had it—I think something was said about taking him one at a time, and I think some reference was made to his extortion<lb/>ate charges—I have no complaint to make against you—I am a loser by you; I put that down a good deal to your misfortune.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By Overton.</hi> I gave you a cheque for £40 for the balance of McKeone's matter—a few days afterwards £50 was given to Mr. Treherne, I think, on account of the Shropshire Mineral Light Railway Company.</p>

I saw Henry Horwood Avis at the Ship public-house, Wormwood Street, on the evening of 9th November—I took him into custody on a warrant, and told him he would be charged on a warrant, in connection with his brother and Overton, for conspiracy and fraud in the Ambler matter—he said, "I don't see how you can charge me; I don't know anything about it"—he handed me some letters—on the way to the station he said, "I had a row with Overton, and it was about that matter I left him"—when charged he made no reply—I took five pawn-tickets from him, and when I gave them back to him on 27th November. 1894, he gave me this receipt: "Received of Sergeant Due five pawn-tickets.—<hi rend="smallCaps">H.

                  </hi>. I received a subpoena this morning, on behalf of the defence, to produce all the documents in my possession, and I have some here; it was the first intimation I had—I am a solicitor—in April, 1892, I was in partnership with Mr. Jones, and we acted for the firm of Overton and Avis in their bankruptcy—I don't know of any<lb/>thing wrong on your part; Counsel attended for you—I acted part of the time as solicitor to the National Mercantile—I acted in the winding-up proceedings—Mr. Pike obtained a winding-up order—Counsel had no time to understand the case; there was a stay, and ultimately the first order was rescinded; the last order was made.</p>

               <p>instructions as to a resolution appointing me solicitor in the George Ambler matter, and I entered into negotiations, and a contract was pre<lb/>pared for the purchase of the mills by George Ambler from the Craven Bank—they agreed to convey them, and leave a sum on mortgage—at their request I prepared a draft mortgage, which was sent on—I carried on negotiations till some time in November—at last the bank refused to convey the property, because they said we had not purchased the machinery—I believe I was told that you had always been led to believe they would transfer the property without the machinery; there were two different vendors, and I suppose you mean the bank would sell the free-hold without selling the loose stuff—about October I was in negotiation with Roke and Midgely, solicitors to the trustee, with regard to the purchase of the machinery, and correspondence passed between us—I think they sent a draft contract for the purchase of the machinery—I heard that a clause was struck out, and that Mr. Gray would not wait any longer, and sold the machinery about 10th November—about 22nd September someone came from Mr. Neale about the position the Ambler matter was in—I told him there were two contracts then in course of approval, and I think he told me you and Overton were doing some business with them—I think he said you were borrowing some money—I told him the exact state of affairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. I thought Overton and Avis, when I first heard of them, were company promoters—they failed in 1892—I acted for them in filing their petition—I don't know what they owed their creditors at that time—I think my late firm of Jones and Linnett registered the National Mercantile Investment Company—I went to the Charing Cross office once, I think—I was introduced to Mr. John Laitwood—I saw him a fortnight ago in London—I have not seen him here—I know nothing of Holdsworth Piggott—I have not seen him for mouths; I should like to find him—I do not know J. Havelock Overton; he was said to be a director of the National Mercantile Investment Company, I think—I don't know if the chairman was Mr. Bennett; I never saw him, to my knowledge——I was told that Holdsworth Piggott was a large tea merchant in Tower Street; I could not find out that he was—I did not find him in the Directory—he was a member of some firm, I was told, but no doubt he was there at one time, because they said he had left—I sent down there some months ago, long before this prosecution, and he had left—I had an extract of a resolution, giving me a retainer for George Ambler, Limited, sent me by the secretary to George Ambler, Limited, in July, 1893, I should say—I believe all I had to do with the Ambler business was to file the articles at Somerset House; I did not prepare them—I cannot say that was all I had to do with the National Mercantile—I acted for them in the winding-up petition—no money was paid me on the retainer from George Ambler, Limited—it was hardly a retainer; it amounted to instructions for an agreement—I knew in September or October of the negotiation which was going on as between the bank and the National Mercantile Company, or Mr. Gray and the National Mercantile for the purpose of acquiring this property—that negotiation began in July, I think, it might be August, and was not concluded in October—when Mr. Neale or a clerk called on September 22nd, I knew that a debenture</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189505200084"/>
               <p>in George Ambler, Limited, was being offered to Mr. Neale's partner to secure an advance of £200 for him—they came to me for information as to what was being done in Ambler, and I told them there were draft contracts—I would not have lent £200 on that information; I was not asked whether I would or not—I gave all the information I was asked for according to my present memory—we acted as solicitors to George Ambler, Limited, from July to November, I think—I did cer<lb/>tain things for the National Mercantile Investment Company from regis<lb/>tration till it was wound up by petition in May, 1894—I believed Over<lb/>ton and A. Avis were the managers of it; I did not know anything about the younger Avis—I am not aware that I ever saw the secretary, I had letters from him; I did very little business for him—I believe I had letters from the secretary, H. Williams—I did not know that H. Avis was passing in that name—I knew that the manager and assistant manager in July, 1892, were the same people for whom a petition had been filed in May, 1892—I did not file the petition, and I do not think my partner did; we were not asked to act till just prior to their public examination—we knew the visible principals in the National Mercantile Investment Company were undischarged bankrupts—I should not have gone on doing anything for them unless I thought they were all right—I thought they were clever City men; apparently their credentials were not very good—when that information was sought from me by Mr. Neale on the 22nd September, 1893, I believe a debenture in George Ambler, Limited, was not mentioned as security—Mr. Richards has since told me he viewed it only as a speculation—I am certain I did not give the information at that time that it was a good debenture; I was not asked whether it was good or not, I did not prepare the thing—the public examination of Overton and Avis was sworn to on 13th July, 1892; I was not present—probably the registration of the National Mercantile Investment Company was on 23rd July, 1892, if you say that is the date—I am not aware that a man's bankruptcy makes him a criminal; I did not think it sufficient to make me say I will not have anything more to do with him—if two men came to me, who I knew to be undischarged bankrupts, I would not now proceed at once to. register a company for them; it was indiscreet; I have seen it since, but I did not know it at the time—I went once to the office of the National Mercantile Company, I believe—when I did not go Over<lb/>ton and Avis came to see me on its behalf—I never saw the secretary—when I went there I saw Overton, I believe; they had two or three rooms—I believe a clerk let me in; there was not a large staff of clerks—I can<lb/>not recollect anyone I saw in the office besides Overton and Avis—I be<lb/>lieve I have seen H. Avis once or twice in my office, when he brought letters from Overton and A. Avis—I believed he was A. Avis's brother—he came with letters from the company—I did not know he was passing as H. Williams, the secretary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by Overton.</hi> I believed the National Mercantile was all right—I knew that two individuals could not be a company, and I under<lb/>stood that other people were going to subscribe towards the capital—I believe you told me—no one except you and Avis told me that they were going to find money.</p>
               <p>

You know I am married now; why do you come here?"—he said, "Can't I come upstairs?"—I said, "No,"—he said, "What about the medal?" and that he would get a certificate, and would have the medal, and would make a noise—he called me a wretch, and asked me why I got married without telling him—I said, "To please myself"—he walked along, and I said I would speak to a policeman—he said, "Speak to a policeman if you like"—he remained with me till five or six in the afternoon—he said he would have the medal—I borrowed a sovereign from my sister, because he would have some money—he called again in a little over a week, and made a noise at the door—I said, "Don't do that; I will come out"—he spoke about the medal, and said that I should never live comfortably, and he would take</p>

I am house physician at Univer<lb/>sity College Hospital—on April 24th the prosecutrix was brought in; I found her lying on a sofa bleeding from many cuts on her hands, arms, chin, forehead and eyes; there were three clean cuts on her chin, the longest was one and a half or two inches long, not very deep—there was a small cut on the left side of her lip, a cut near her nose, and another on the left eyelid—the main injuries were on her hands and arms—there were five or six cuts on each arm; one was two inches deep, going down to the bone, and on one hand a large cut two and a half inches long—they had been inflicted with a sharp instrument—she was in a state of collapse; she had lost a good deal of blood.</p>

I am a registered practitioner, of 102, Clarence Road, Clapton—I saw Bassich at the station in a state of semi-collapse; he had had a great deal of hemorrhage—he had a stab wound in front of his left shoulder and a grazed wound or scratch on his upper eyelid—they could have been caused by this dagger—the stab on his shoulder would require violence to inflict it; I cannot tell the depth, it was not right to probe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a direct stab downwards—it could not happen from two persons struggling and one holding a dagger and the other falling on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I remember Bassich being brought to the German Hospital on Easter Monday—I found a wound on his left shoulder, penetrating his left lung—it was a dangerous wound—I kept him in the hospital a fortnight, and he was then discharged, not cured, but out of danger.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would not require very considerable force; the depth was between one and two inches—I do not think it could have been caused by his falling on the dagger.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Morning Lane, Hackney—on Easter Monday I was with the prisoner at Millfield at nine or 9.15 p.m.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were a good many traps driving down the road, and it was a very dusty blowing night—I was wearing jewellery—the prisoner left me for a few minutes—I was not sitting down—I noticed a man about thirty yards off coming towards me—before I went into the field the prisoner showed me a dagger, and told me he was wearing his brother's coat, who is a member of a theatrical society, and must have left the dagger in his coat from the last rehearsal—it had a sheath—he seemed surprised when he found it in his pocket—I was very frightened at the man's sudden appearance and walked to<lb/>wards the prisoner—Bassich followed me—the prisoner said, "Has this man been insulting you?"—I could not answer—he could see that I was very frightened—Bassich said, "I will show you who the b—hell I am," and struck the prisoner on the jaw—the prisoner took off his overcoat to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I ran away when they were close together, and after the primmer spoke to Bassich—the prisoner took his coat off directly after the blow was struck—I did not see Mitchell stab him at all—my account is that Bassich said, "I will show you who I am," and then struck him—that is all I saw—directly I saw them close I ran—he had not time actually to take his coat off, because the constable was ready to give him another blow—I am sure I was not sitting down—I did not say at the Police-court, "I went into a field and sat down"—this is my signature to my deposition.

                  </hi>. I am undergoing my sentence of seven years' penal servitude, at Wormwood Scrubbs Prison, for uttering three drafts for the payment of tea guineas—that was at the April Sessions of this Court—I have since given information to the police—I know the prisoner as Bradbury—I had known him three or four months—I first met him at Waterloo Railway Station on a platform—he asked me how I was getting on, and about my luck, and said he had had rather rough and hard times, And asked would I like to join him in getting some money—he said he had been a grocer's assistant, and connected with the trade for many years—he said he could get some fine situations in the grocery trade by Advertising in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, and such news<lb/>papers, the replies to be addressed to a certain box of the newspapers; going the next day, obtaining the key of the box, and selecting two or three of the most likely applications for the position of manager, and use the references as having been written by himself—I arranged to meet him the next day—I met him in the Lord Hill the next day, when he said his plan then was to cash a cheque; it was a better plan; he would write a draft on different bankers and enclose it in a letter purporting to come from the customer to the tradesman, who would cash the cheque for fear of losing the customer—he would select a neighbourhood, and in the morning watch the different carts collecting orders from the shops, take the name of the cart down and the number of the house it had been to; after the cart had left he would ascertain the names of the people in the house where the cart had been by making himself out to be collecting for a directory—the draft was to be written on plain paper by Stevens, that he was a very good penman and could print copper-plate, or imitate a lady's or anybody's hand—he said he did that at night when all was quiet and his wife and family were in bed; he would buy a rubber stamp in Fleet Street of the number of the house to put on the heading of the paper—I consented to join him—on 16th March I went with him to Harvey and Shillingford's, a grocer's, at Stoke Newington—before I went into the shop he showed me the letter, and the draft he had printed or written like this. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I was to take it into the grocer's as the son or servant of the sender and ask the grocer to cash it—I did so and got £10—I also went to Mr. Sidney Andrew Hall's shop, Stamford Hill Pavement, And got this draft cashed by the assistant—I got them from the prisoner—a letter was with them—I also went into Palmer and Bryant's and got this draft cashed, the letter purporting to come from Mrs. Fox—the prisoner waited outside—he said he would like to take money at Palmer And Bryant's because he owed them a grudge; they were dirty dogs—I Afterwards met the prisoner outside and went to a public-house in the Kingsland Road, where I gave him all the money, £31—I believe a note was with it—he said it was a good day's work, and he gave me my third hare, keeping the other two-thirds—we then took a four-wheel cab and</p>

I am an expert in handwriting, of 59, Holborn Viaduct—I have had ten years' experience—I examine writing for the Treasury, public authorities, and Scotland Yard—I have examined the documents in this case—including the rent book and notes referring to racing, also the agreement with Pearce, which are admittedly the pri<lb/>soner's writing—these letters and cheques marked P 1, 2, and 3 are also the prisoner's writing—these entries in the cash book are his—there are certain instances of marked similarity in the writings—the letters are disguised—they profess to be ladies' writing—the cheques are another form of disguise, but still the prisoner's writing—both are undoubtedly written by him—I have made a report and given my reasons, and I am prepared to give them here.</p>

               <p>at our office, Mr. Wollard having died leaving you absolute heir to all his property")—he said his uncle had left him the money and he was coming into possession of it shortly, but he had not sufficient money—he said he had fourteen freehold houses at Guildford and two in Canning Town, and £22,000 on deposit at the City Bank at the corner of Finch Lane; that his uncle's name was John Charles Wollard, late of Guildford—I be<lb/>lieved it all, from the letter he showed me—he said he wanted money to pay expenses, Probate duty and stamping—between December, 1893, and 23rd April, 1894, I lent him at various times about £35—he showed mewhat I thought were legal documents, supposed to come from the Court, signed by judges—on 14th January, 1894, I received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the Court had fined him £</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">for not complying with an order, and he would see me the instant he was clear of the Court</hi>)—on receiving that I advanced him some of the money. (<hi rend="italic">A number of other letters were put in making various excuses for not calling, and soliciting aid to com<lb/>plete necessary arrangements</hi>)—altogether I lent him £380 at various times—I have never received back a farthing—I made these advances believ<lb/>ing his statements, and that the documents he showed me were geninue.</p>

I keep the Greyhound, at 92, Balls Pond Road—I made the prisoner's acquaintance in October, 1894—he came to my house as a casual customer, and soon after he told me that he had just lost his uncle, who had left him so much property—he borrowed £10 of me, and I think he gave me £2 interest—altogether he got about £40 from me in various sums—I lent him superfluous cash, which I never accounted for—he said the property was in houses at Guildford, and £22,000 in the City Bank—he showed me several documents, and said he could not get the property before twelve months elapsed, as it was thrown into Chancery—I lent him the money on the condition that he would get the property in a twelvemonth, and from the legal documents he produced, some signed by judges; Mr. Justice Charles and Justice Hawkins.</p>

I am a publican, at 50, Mare Street, Hackney—I formerly kept the Norfolk Arms in Hackney Road—at the end of October, 1893, the prisoner came there as a casual customer—three or four days after he showed me certain documents, and said he had an uncle who had died at Guildford, and he had come into considerable pro<lb/>perty, horses, carriages, land, houses, etc., and that he was worth thousands of pounds; and that there was a considerable amount at the City Bank in Finch Lane—he said he was going to Guildford to bury his uncle, and he asked me for some money, and I lent him £3 10s.—he was in mourning—he said his uncle's name was Wollard; I think it was John Charles Wollard, of Clarence Villa, Guildford—he did not tell</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter purported to he from the prisoner's wife, and stated that her husband's of airs were all settled, and he was about to draw some money on Wednesday, and requested a loan of</hi> £2 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> £3.)</p>

On Saturday, 20th April, I arrested the prisoner on a warrant, which I produce—I read it to him, and told him I should arrest him for fraudulently obtaining money from Mr. Knight—he said, "I know the representation was wrong; I have been drawn into this by four men" (mentioning their names). "The documents that I showed Mr. Knight, which purported to be signed by the judge, are at my safe in the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit; my wife has the keys"—on Monday, the 22nd, I received the keys from the wife—I went to the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit—he had a safe there—I obtained some letters, and a document—on the 6th of this month T went to Guildford—I made inquiry of the Registrar of the district to ascertain if any John Charles Wollard had died—he examined the books, and there was no such entry—I found no such place as Clarence Villa—I made inquiry about Mr. Brockenshaw, of 96, High Street, Borough—I found 96 had been a hosier's shop for thirty years—there is a Brockenshire, a solicitor, at No. 51.</p>

I am a qualified medical practitioner, of 234, Barking Road, Canning Town—on April 5th, about twelve at night, I went to the prisoner's rooms, and saw the child lying on the bed in its ordinary day clothes—I examined it; it was dead—I concluded that the death was from syncopy, caused probably by some shock—the mother tumbling on the floor with it in her arms could have caused it—I saw no signs of violence—the prisoner was in a dazed, muddled condition, in my opinion from the influence of drink—she made no complaint of having a fit.</p>

               <p>as an Inspector by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children—I first knew the prisoner on 26th February; I went to see her at 210, Lower Road, Deptford—I told her I had come to see her baby—she said it was a fortnight old—she was upstairs in her living room, the back room—I said, "The child appears very thin and emaciated"—she said it was only a seven-months' child; that her husband died in October last, and that had brought on a premature birth—I drew her at<lb/>tention to the state of the room, and said, "I am not satisfied that the child is looked after properly; I shall call again"—I told her I was an officer of the Society, and I was in uniform—I said the child was dirty—she said Mrs. Ballard, the midwife, was coming to wash and dress it—the child smelled very offensive—she said she had paralysis of the feet; she gave that as a reason why she did not do it herself—she was walking about the room; she was under the influence of drink—I called again on Wednesday, the 27th—I knocked at the door; she came down in answer; I saw she was the worse for drink—I said, "I have come again to see your baby"—she said, "You are not going to"—I said, "Why?"—she said, "My child is going on all right"—I pressed her—she said, "To tell you the truth, the place is dirty; I am not going to allow it"—I did not see it—next day I called again about three with Doctor Cable, hoping she would allow the doctor to see it—I knocked; a woman came down, and from what she said I went out and looked for the prisoner at a little beer-shop a few yards away, where I found her drinking—I called her outside; she was very drunk—I said, "I have brought a doctor to see your baby"—she said, "My baby is all right"—I said, "I understand it is very ill"—ultimately she did let us see it—I went upstairs with the doctor and saw it—the room was in a most filthy state, thick with dirt, and smelled most offensive—a neighbour was in the room—I said to the prisoner, "I think the baby looks worse than when I saw it last, it looks as if it was dying"—she pointed to another child on the bed and said, "That is the one that will die, not the baby. I have lost all my five babies"—I saw the child weighed; it weighed five pounds in its clothing, and the clothing was wet—I asked her what she fed it on—she said, "The breast, and condensed milk"—I said, "Will you allow me to see the bottle"—she produced a bottle half full of milk; I smelt it, and said, "This milk is sour," she said, "Oh no, it is not"—I said to the woman in the room, "How long has Mrs. Burrell been out"—she held up two fingers, and I said, "Oh, she has been out two hours"—I then left—I returned next day about five or six, and found the baby dead—the prisoner was the worse for drink then—she said it had died at half-past two.</p>

Dr. Atkinson did not give me any instructions about it, he only said he would not prescribe for it—I did not see the child again till April 25th, when I was sent for—it was in a fit—it was very clean then, but very small—I was quite horrified, it was worn to a shadow, I said to the prisoner why had she not had a doctor before—she said she had not thought it requisite—I went for Dr. Cooper, but he did not come—when it was about five weeks old I told her it would die if she did not look after it better—she said it was all right, it was healthy enough, it would not die, the little boy would die before that—while I was attend<lb/>ing her the room was very untidy and very dirty, but not for the fort<lb/>night I was there, it was kept very nice then—I think the prisoner was sober when I saw the child the second time—it died in my arms on the 26th—the prisoner seemed terribly worried and upset then about the child—she was sober.</p>

I live at 4, Victoria Place, Bermondsey—on May 11th, about 1.15, I met my brother-in-law, Peter Connor, who was about thirty-four years old, outside the Bricklayers' Arms—I gave him threepence—he had not been drinking then, so far as I could see, but I met him at eight o'clock, and we started drinking at the Bricklayers' Arms, then at the Jolly Tanners, and then at the Wellington; we got there about 8.30 and stayed till ten—the deceased was drunk then—ho had no money; I paid for the drink—I saw the prisoner, who was a friend of both of us, in the Wellington—the deceased said to Robinson, "I will</p>

               <p>you, and I will your brother"—Robinson took no notice, and he said, "Come outside, and I will fight you or your brother"—Robinson's brother had been there, but had gone—Robinson appeared sober—he took no notice, but all of a sudden the deceased went to hit him, and Robinson pushed him; they had a little bit of a skirmish; no blows were struck; they were wrestling, and the landlord got over the bar and put them outside—Connor went out first, and the prisoner followed him—I went out after them, and saw my brother-in-law in the road, stand<lb/>ing up—Robinson wont to hit him, and I found him on the ground—I thought the blow was somewhere behind his right ear—I picked him up; he never spoke again.</p>

I am a labourer, of 59, Merville Place—on Saturday night, May 11th, I was with Robinson at the Wellington—the deceased, who I knew, went up to the prisoner and his brother, and said, "What is your animosity towards me? That has nothing to do with me"—the prisoner jumped up and pushed him against the partition, pretty hard, and he slid down—his back went against the partition, not his head—he got up again, and they both went out, followed by Ryle—there was a little scuffle before he went, but no blows were struck—they then went out, and I saw nothing of what took place outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practi<lb/>tioner, of 33, Bermondsey Square—on the night of May 11th I was called to the deceased and found him dead—on the following Tuesday I ex<lb/>amined the body, and found fracture of the base of the skull, and a blow on the neck which did not go below the skin, and had nothing to do with his death—I found effusion of blood on the base of the brain two inches behind and a little below the left ear, which followed from the fracture—the skull was only about half the usual thickness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A man's fist would hardly be able to break a skull of that thickness, but if he fell on a stone it might happen—he had been drinking, by the congested state of his skull and other organs—when the prisoner was committed for trial I heard him say, "The deceased was in the Wellington and said, 'What do you think, where is my beer?' I said, 'Here you are.' He turned on me and got talking, and I said I did not want a row. He brought up my brother's name, and put up his arm to strike mo, and I struck him and he fell on the back of his head."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If he fell on a stone I should expect some evidence of it; a stone is harder than a fist—he was a much heavier man than the prisoner—if he had fractured his skull in the public-house it is more than likely he would have dropped at once; it depends upon how gradual the effusion is and where it is—the fractured bone was not touching the membrane of the brain; it was merely cracked—it was more consistent with a blow from a fist than with a stone—I have heard the evidence of the two witnesses who saw the blow struck, and it corresponds very ac<lb/>curately with what I saw.</p>

I am a jobmaster, of 19, Peckham Road, Camber<lb/>well—on 11th May, about 3.30 a.m., I was awoke by a noise—I went downstairs and saw the reflection of a light—I called out the servants' names, and the light was immediately put out and I heard a scuffle of feet—I opened the front door and spoke to a passer-by—a constable came up and we searched the house, and saw the two prisoners on the other side of the garden fence—it was light—the constable went round and captured Williams—Evans ran along the fence; I heard him creep under some bushes, and stood with a poker in my hand till the constable came and took him—I had not gone into the kitchen the night before—I found</p>

               <p>the window wide open—there are bars inside which I thought were not wide enough for a man to get through, but I find they are—I found a pair of my boots outside put away under some bushes, and two coats which did not belong to me—I went to the station with the constable and the prisoners.</p>

I am manager of the George public-house, in Waterloo Road—on 13th April, about 12.30 p.m., I met the prisoners and another man in Tower Street—I had £60 in gold in my inside coat pocket, takings of the George, which I was going to the bank to exchange for silver—I always go to the bank about 12.30 on Saturdays—I have known the prisoners for two or three years, but I have not served them in my house for about twelve months—I had spoken to Mr. Burton, the butcher, and was about ten or twenty yards from his shop when the prisoners came up, two in front and one man on each side—when I got past the first two Pearson struck me in the jaw, and Pickett struck me in the eye, and gave me a black eye, and smashed my hat—the four men surrounded me—I was kicked from the back, and I fell—I have been attended by the doctor, and I have got an abscess—when I was on the ground Pickett took 5s. 8d. out of my pocket—then kept on kicking and punching me—I went into the butcher's shop—Pearson threw something at me, then the men ran away—a constable came, and I complained to him—Pickett was arrested about five minutes afterwards—I saw him in custody when I came back from the Police-court, about four o'clock—Irwin was arrested the following Saturday night—being assaulted, I defended myself—it was dot a fair fight.</p>
