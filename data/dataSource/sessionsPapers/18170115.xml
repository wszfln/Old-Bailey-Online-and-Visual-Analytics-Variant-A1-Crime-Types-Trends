I went to the gate at eleven o'clock the next morning and found it locked; about half an hour afterwards I heard that the candlestick was lost. I am sure that the gate was not opened with our key between the time that I locked it, and the time that the candlestick was missed.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Porteus. On the 21st of December, I was in the back-kitchen, I heard somebody go up the area steps, I ran out, and found the candlestick was gone; I looked up, and the area-gate was half open; I went out, and saw the prisoner, Davis, very near it. I passed him, and looked at him. I met a man, who told me that a man had ran round the corner. I followed the prisoner, Davis, he went towards Lausdown-passage. I then met a man of the name of Barrow, and he went with me. I overtook the prisoner, and laid hold of him, and accused him of taking the candlestick; he looked at me, and said, he was quite struck. A person then came up, and the prisoner unbuttoned his coat, and said, he had nothing about him. Mr. Barrow heard some keys rattle, and asked him to let him look at the keys which were in his pocket; he pulled out, I think, five keys in the whole - I am not sure. Barrow gave them to him again. I asked the prisoner to go back to the house, and walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150004"/>by the side of him; as he went along he dropped one of the keys, and I picked it up (producing it), this is the key which he dropped-it is a picklock key. I saw the officer open the area-gate with one of the keys which were found on the prisoner Davis.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DAVIS. Was I the first person that you saw when you came out of the area - A. You was.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARROW. On the 21st of December, I saw the prisoner, Davis, about thirty yards from the area-gate; he was going towards Cousin-street. I and Mazey followed him. The boy asked the prisoner if he had the candlestick. I demanded the keys, and he pulled out one or two, one of which was a latch-key. I said, you have more, and he pulled out three; I returned them to him; and asked him to give them back to me - He was not willing; he dropped one of them, and we picked it up. The officer, Jeffries, has the keys.</p>

            . On the 21st of December I was in Half-Moon-street; the prisoner, Lemon, ran past me, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw he had something in his bosom; the two witnesses asked me if I had seen any person, and I told them of it. I looked round and saw him again, standing and looking round the corner of Half-Moon-street, leading to Cousin-street, when the servant said he had been robbed. I went on; and as I was going into Piccadilly, I saw the same boy again, he must have gone through Sheppard's-market, he was running under the wall of the Green-park, towards Bond-street. I took hold of him, and asked him what he had got, he said, nothing. I told him he had got a candlestick; he said, no. I opened his jacket, and found the candlestick wrapped up in his apron, under his jacket. I delivered him, and the candlestick, to Mr. Porteus's servant, at his house. The candlestick produced is the same which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner LEMON. Did you ask me what I had got - A. I did.</p>
               <p>WM. TUSON. I was in Lansdown-passage, Barrow asked me to look at the keys; I desired the prisoner to go back, and in his way he dropped the key-Mazey picked it up. When Lemon was brought back, I asked the prisoner, Davis, for the keys to try the area-gate; he gave them to me. I took them, and then he demanded them back as his property. He gave me the three skeleton keys very willingly. He did not give me the latch key. I refused to give them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's, DAVIS, Defence. On the 21st of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, as I was coming from Kensington I saw the keys in the road, and I picked them up. I passed the house; the servant ran past me, and I walked slowly on, when I came to Lansdown-passage, the footman asked to search me. I gave the gentleman the keys. I went back, and the other prisoner was in the passage.</p>
               <p>LEMON'S Defence. A young man came to me by the Park, and asked me to carry the candlestick to Bond-street.</p>
               <p>DAVIS - GUILTY. Aged 17.</p>
               <p>LEMON - GUILTY. Aged 15.</p>

On the 27th of December, I went out with my sister, who leads me about; in my way home the prisoner came to me, and said, she had travelled sixty miles, and was very hungry; I told her if she would come home with me I would give her some food. She went home with us, and my sister made her some tea. I told my sister to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150005"/>give her a gown and a pair of stays, as she said she was very naked. She then said, she had pawned a box for five shillings, and asked me to lend her money, and she would pawn one of the gowns which were in it, and pay me. I sent my sister to pledge my ring for three shillings, and lent her two shillings and nine-pence of the money. The prisoner remained with me while my sister went with the ring; when she returned, the prisoner asked me to go to a public-house with her, to see her husband; I and my sister went with her; we had some beer, and then we all came back to my house again; the prisoner came back with us to take her old things away. When we got back the prisoner told my sister she would give her in charge if she did not go home; I told her she should not turn my sister out. I had bolted both my shutters. I went out and locked my door, and asked the prisoner to lead me to my sister's; it was about ten o'clock at night. When the prisoner came out, I locked both the doors, and put the keys in my pocket. She took me the wrong way, and left me in the street, saying, she would return to me-a person came by and took me home. When I got home, I found my door was locked, as I had left it. I let myself in and locked the door after me. I found one of my shutters unbolted, inside, and the window was downa person could get in at the window from the ground; my lodgers were all in bed. I went to my box, which I had left locked, and found it open. I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; the box was in the same room that the prisoner was in.</p>
               <p>REBECCA BOND. I went out with the last witness, who is my sister; the prisoner stopped us, and asked her for charity. The prisoner went to my sister's, and had tea with us; afterwards I went out and pawned the ring for three shillings, and my sister gave the prisoner two shillings and nine-pence of it; she then went to a public-house with the prisoner, and then we all returned to my sister's house again; in our way the prisoner took the shawl off my shoulders, saying, you will go and pawn that next. Before we went out my sister fastened the shutters. When we returned the prisoner would not let me go into the room, she pushed me, and got my shawl of my sister's bed; I told her I was going to get my shawl, but she said I should not. She pushed me out at the door; I went out and called, through the shutters, to my sister, saying, that the woman wanted to rob her, and not me. The prisoner then came out, and said, she would give me in charge. I went home, and I was afraid to go back again. My sister had not been drinking, except some porter which she had with the prisoner. The next morning I went back to my sister, who told me she had been robbed. If the shutters were open I could get in at the window myself. I knew my sister's clothes, I used to put them away for her.</p>
               <p>GREEN. I am a police-officer. I know the prosecutor, and the house, which is in the parish of St. Margaret; she is a lodger, but the landlord does not live in the house. The prisoner was described to me on the 28th of December, I knew her, and went after her to a house which she frequented, several times, at Marsh-gate, Lambeth; I, at last, found her at Moulsey, on the 7th instant; she had this bonnet on her head (producing it,) I met her in the road, and took her into custody; before I said any thing to her, she cried, and said, she knew what I wanted her for. I took her to her mother's, at Moulsey alm-house. I searched her, and found a duplicate on her, it was tied up in a handkerchief, which she threw upon the floor, she said it was the duplicate of a gown that was pledged at Kennington. I went to the pawnbroker's, whose name was upon the duplicate. I produce the gown.</p>

               <p>REBECCA BOND re-examined. My sister only rents the room in which she lives, the landlord does not live in the house. The house is let out to different persons.</p>

            , I am Mr. Stephens' apprentice. On the 16th of December, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some ribbon, another person served her; the drawer was on the counter, I saw her put her hand in and take out three pieces of ribbon, she did it at different times; I was within two yards of her; there was another person with her, who was purchasing. She put the ribbon up her sleeve, and afterwards into her pocket; I told my master, and he sent for an officer, before the officer came she was going out of the shop, my master accused her of it; she said, it must be a mistate, and sat down on the stool. She was taken up stairs and searched, but nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I knew her well, I had seen her before. I am sure I saw her do it.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher. I was in the shop, and sent for an officer; the prisoner was going out, when I detained her, and told her she had got some of my property in her pocket; she said, she was surprised at the charge, and sat down on a stool, which was six or seven yards from the drawer. She went up-stairs with me, and wanted me to search her - I found nothing upon her. I went down stairs to see for an officer, and under the stool on which she had been sitting, I saw three pieces of ribbon; I can swear to one of them. I gave them to the officer.</p>

            . I am Mr. Stephens' apprentice. On the 26th of December, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some twist; I was alone in the shop; when he asked for twist I put the twist drawer on the counter; he wanted three yards' to match three pieces of cloth. I saw him take a ball of twist, and put it up his sleeve, and while I was measuring him a yard, I saw him take another ball, and put it up his sleeve also. I made an excuse to go up stairs for some more twist, and told Mr. Beioly. He came down, and caught hold of the prisoner's right arm, and I took hold of his left, where he had put the twist; he pulled it away, and shook one ball out, Beioly held the other in. The The prisoner looked into the shop before he came in, and could see that I was alone. Beioly took the ball of twist out of his sleeve, and found three more in his pocket. I cannot swear to those which were found in his pocket.</p>

On the 6th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner on the stairs, on the third floor, she had a bundle in her apron; I asked her what it was, she said it was nothing to me. Knowing she had no business in the house, I stopped her; she had got two sheets and a quilt, rolled up together; she said, let me pass. She was secured. She said she was sent to fetch them, and was to be paid for her time.</p>

I showed him the shoes, they fitted him, and I put them aside for him, and fitted him a pair of boots; I had my back towards him. He was to pay me 2l. 6s. for both pair. I was taking some boots from the pegs, and saw him doing something to his pocket. He pulled out four or five shillings, and wanted my boy to fetch some gin; I would not let him; he proposed my going out with him to have some - I refused; he then said, you will not hinder me from going out. I told him I must first know what he had in his pocket; he stepped back, and pulled two shoes out of his pocket - They were mine. I sent for a constable, when he shoved me, broke my window, and run out of the shop. I gave an alarm, and he was brought back. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I live in Great Pulteney-street, Golden-square. On the 20th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street; I was accosted by the prisoner Myers, she took me to a house in <placeName id="t18170115-14-crimeloc70">Angel-alley</placeName>

We were in the lower part of the house; the light was brought in about a minute; I then did not like the place I was in, and the prisoners were importunate for money; I gave them 1s. 6d. and left the house directly, my watch was then safe; the two prisoners came out with me, and had hold of my arms; as soon as I got into Bishopsgate-street, I felt a hand seize my watch, and the two prisoners left me immediately. I gave the alarm, went back to the house, and offered a reward for the apprehension of the prisoners. Myers was taken on the 8th of January, I knew her again; the other prisoner was taken on the 13th, and I knew her also. I am sure they are the two who took my watch.</p>

The prisoner went out, and the other man came to the bar for some rum, and then went out also; I did not see the prisoner go out; this raised my suspicion. I went into the parlour and missed my glass, which hung in the room. I went out, and overtook them at Hyde-park corner, the prisoner had got the glass on his shoulder. I laid hold of him, and gave him in charge to the constable. I have been offered two guineas for the glass.</p>

I compared it with my yarn, and it exactly matched. I got a search-warrant, and went with the officer to the prisoner's house, and found a quantity of yarn, and a sleigh in his room, which was mine; and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150010"/>more yarn in the cellar, which was also mine.

On the evening of the 28th I saw the piece of sealing wax and the pencil taken out of the prisoner's pocket by the constable. I had asked him if had seen my pocket, and he said he knew nothing about it. My sister told him she thought it was dropped in his room; he persisted in deny-it. We sent for Hartly, the constable, but he did not search him thoroughly; the prisoner then went up to his sister, who lives in the house, and did not come down again. We afterwards sent for Watson, and he found the sealing-wax and pencil on him.</p>

I watched them into a gin-shop, in Holborn, I looked through the door, and saw them change a note; when they came out, I went in and told the landlord to keep the note.</p>

I went into the shop, and missed my gold watch, chain and seals, and a diamond pin. I had put them in the shop the overnight when I went to bed. As soon as I went into the shop, before I missed any thing, the prisoner told me my things were laying about the floor (he had come up again), meaning my coat and waistcoat, which hung on a chair - They did not appear to have been on the ground. I missed my watch, and asked him where it was, he said he did not know, they were not there when he came in the morning. I said I should send for an officer; he said I might if I liked. I asked him where he had been when he ran down stairs; he said, to the shop privy. I went there, and found nobody had been there for sometime. I saw some footsteps towards the door, which leads into Duck-lane; they appeared larger than the prisoner's footsteps. I told him what I had observed; he answered me very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150011"/>impertinently, which made me suspect him. He was searched, but nothing found upon him.</p>

On the 20th of December the prisoner was at my masters' shop, there were several persons in the shop at the time; I was serving some ladies. One of the shopwomen was near me; she had occasion to go away, and as she passed me she gave me our watch-word, which was a signal for me to look to the goods on the counter. I saw a piece of poplin taken off the counter by a woman in a black veil, who was standing behind some ladies; thinking it was taken to look at, I waited some time, it not being returned, I looked up and saw the prisoner, who had a black veil on, going to the door; I went after her, and took hold of her as she was opening the door; I held her with one hand, and put my other hand to her side to prevent the poplin from falling, which she had under her arm. I took her into the counting-house and took it from her. It was the piece I had seen taken off the counter; it is worth 50s. cost price.</p>

            . I am a constable; I saw the prisoner crossing the top of Ludgate-hill with the beef on his back; he was coming from the market; when he saw me he turned round, and went down Ludgate-hill very fast. I laid hold of him at the top of Creed-lane. I asked him what he had got, he said a man had given it to him, threw it down at my feet, and ran away; I pursued him, and took him to the watch-house; he was not out of my sight. Mr. Silverside claimed the beef.</p>

            . I am an officer of Tower Ward; on the 21st of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was watching about the New Custom-house. I saw the prisoner coming towards the gate, from within the premises, and make a stop, and looked about; he stooped down, and appeared to draw something from under him; he walked off very quick: I stopped him, and asked him what he had got - He begged for mercy; I found he had got some old lead in his hand, in a bag. I secured him, with difficulty; he ran away after he was hand-cuffed. The lead weighed ten pounds. I saw his hand quite under the gate.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, charged with stealing the breeches; he had two buttons on his waistcoat, with the crest on them; he said he bought them at Rag-fair. I found two more of the same buttons on his trowsers, which he said he bought at Duck-lane. At his examination, he delivered the duplicate of the breeches, and told the magistrate, that he sewed the buttons on the waistcoat himself.</p>

They had worked for Messrs. Freak about four months, and used to sleep in the same room. When the prisoner had done eating, he took up a candlestick which was bent, and began to straighten it with the poker. The deceased was at the table, and had not finished his supper; the prisoner was knocking the candlestick with the poker on the table, the decased desired him to desist. The prisoner continued knocking, and the deceased went from the table to push him away; he stepped back a little, and the prisoner continued knocking; the deceased laid hold of the poker, and they began struggling up and down, pushing one another about, each having hold of the poker, for about five minutes - They appeared to be in a passion with each other; they each let go of the poker with one hand, but holding it with the other, they struck each other with their base hands; they then laid hold of the poker again with both hands, both trying to get it. The prisoner wrenched it from the deceased, and hit him over his head with it twice, and after the last stroke, the deceased fell down. They were both in a passion, and in liquor. The noise brought the people down. The deceased was bleeding.</p>

               <p>HENRY WORTHINGTON. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital; I saw the deceased at the hospital before his death; when he first applied to me, there was a large wound on his head - He was in a stupor; he died on the Friday evening. I opened his head, there was a large fracture in his scull, which might have been done with a poker; and, in my judgment, that was the cause of his death.</p>

When I first got down, they said eight. I heard he was to have two dozen. When he had received one dozen, the weapon was shifted into another hand. Only two persons struck him while I was there. I did not know them; I believe the prisoners were in the room at the time, they were paupers in the house. I saw the deceased the next day; he was a weak man, and in a declining state before; he said he was very much hurt, and complained of his loins being sore, several times.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK AGER. I am a surgeon. I was called in on the 20th of December, to examine the body of the deceased; there were some blows about his back which had been done some time: in my judgment, they were not the cause of his death. I opened his body, and found the appearance of a blood-vessel being reptured. I have no doubt but the rupture, and the blood discharged from it, was the cause of his death. That could not have taken place so early as the 10th of December, it is impossible.</p>

               <p>JANE JEALOUS. I live in George-street. On the night of the 28th of December, I was at the coffee-shop, in <placeName id="t18170115-36-crimeloc181">George-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18170115-36-crimeloc181" type="placeName" value="George-street"/>

Stanton, the deceased, came in with a girl soon after me; the prisoners came in soon after. There were more than twenty men, and five women in the room. Stanton called for some coffee, he pulled out his money, and paid for it, and said, if I lose this, somebody must starve. The two prisoners, and several others, took him away from where he was, and drove him into the corner; when he was in the corner, they set him in a chair. The prisoner, Downs, put his hands upon the deceased's mouth, he tried to get away, and Downs put his fore finger and thumb upon Stanton's throat, he kept them there some time, I should suppose ten minutes; and the persons around kept pushing: during that time, the prisoner, Walton, was putting his hands into the deceased's pockets, and gave something around amongst them; they were there about half an hour altogether; he was in the chair about a quarter of an hour, and it gave way, and he sunk in it. The landlord Besthall, then came, and sent them out. The two prisoners took Stanton and led him out; they had been in the corner some time before they put him in the chair. The deceased made a noise with his throat, as if he could not speak; after this Walton asked a boy, named George Graham, if he wanted any money, and told him not to say no, if he did; for he would let him have a dollar; he kept pulling money out, I could not see how much; about twenty minutes after, I went out of the house, by myself, and saw the deceased in the hands of four watchmen; he appeared dead: both the prisoners came into the coffee-room again, and the other men with them; they stopped there, and the four watchmen came in, and asked for the young man who had bathed the deceased's temples with vinegar; nobody answered; and the watchmen went away about a quarter of an hour after. The prisoners stopped there till four o'clock, and then went over to the Turk's Head public-house; I was there when they came in. About five o'clock the prisoner, Downs, went out for a short time, and came in again, and said he had been taken up on suspicion of the dead man, and let out on his own bail; and that he had to appear on the next day, and would swear hard and fast against the d-d b-g-r. Walton was present. The deceased gave Walton 2s. or 3s. when he paid for his coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Prisoner WALTON. Why did you not acquaint the coffee-shop man, or the watchman of it - A. If I had said any thing, one and all of them would have ill-used me. When the watchmen came, I beckoned to one of them to tell him, but he did not understand me; I did not tell the watchmen when I saw them with the deceased, because I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that Downs did not take hold of his throat, until he was in the chair - A. I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that Downs took him by the throat, and threw him into the chair - A. I cannot say whether he pushed him in by his neck or his body; I did not hear the noise in his throat until he was led out at the door-he appeared as if he could not keep himself up; the prisoners supported him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the man was dead, when you was at the Turk's-head - A. I did. I did not drink with the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate woman; I had no lodging. On the 28th of December, I went to Besthall's coffee-shop, at a little after twelve o'clock; the two prisoners came in after me, with several more. The prisoner, Downs, first went up to Stanton. I did not take particular notice until he was in the corner: Walton was with him. Stanton was sitting in a chair, and Downs had his hand on his shoulders near his neck. Walton was rather more stooping; they were surrounded by persons. I was sitting in a box four yards from them.</p>
               <p>Court. If you was sitting down, how could you see them, as they were surrounded - A. I could see them; the chair broke with their restling: Besthall came up, hearing the chair break, and sent them out. The prisoners took the deceased towards the door, and the prisoner, Walton, pushed him out of doors; they did not come back till about twenty minutes after. I went out before they returned; when I returned, the two prisoners came into the shop. Downs said, there is a poor man dropped down dead, and I rubbed his temples with vinegar. Four watchmen came in to enquire for the young man who rubbed the deceased's temples with vinegar; as they wanted to know how it happened. Downs went and hid himself in the corner, he stooped down to conceal himself in a place, where the watchmen could not see him: he must have heard it. Nobody answered. The watchman said they did not want to take him, they only wanted to see him. I did not see Walton in the room at the time. At four o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners went over to the Turk's-head. I went too, nearly at the same time; I sat in the same box with them. There was a young man between me and Downs; one of the beadles came in, and stood with his back to the fire. Downs was laying with his head down, I pushed by him to get out, and he said, D-n you, sit still, do you want him to see me; his head was turned from the beadle. I got out at the other side, and left him in that posture, and left the house. I was afraid to tell the watchman, my life had been threatened.</p>
               <p>Court. He was thrust out at the door - A. I do not mean to say that he was dead at that time; I did not hear him make the noise.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, I live in George-street. I was in the coffee-shop at the time when Stanton came in; the two prisoners came in soon after; there were a great many men with them. I observed nothing till I heard the crush of the chair, I got up, and said, Oh! my G-d, they have killed the man. I went to the place, the men pushed me about, and said, d-n you, what is it to you. The prisoner's, Downs, arms were towards the neck of the deceased, and Walton had his hands towards his breeches; I did not see him take any thing out of his pocket, he drew his hand backward and forward. Besthall ordered them all out; the two prisoners laid hold of the deceased. They came back afterwards, and I heard Walton say, d-n it, deal fair. I could not see what they were about. Downs was very much agitated, his handkerchief was torn, and his waistcoat unbuttoned. The patrol came in, and asked for the man who had bathed the deceased's temples. Downs was laying his head down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DOWNS. Why did you not tell this at the time - A.I said, they have killed the man; and a man thrust me back, and said, d-n it, hold your tongue.</p>
               <p>Court. How near were you to the man when he was taken out - A. About four yards, the crowd was very great; I saw him lifted up in the middle of them. Downs was sitting down when the patrol came in, he did not change his place.</p>

I was sitting in a chair behind the door, and the prisoner, Downs, came up to me, with the deceased, and told me to get up and let him sit there; I got up, and Downs took him by the collar and set him down. The deceased staggered as if he was in liquor. I went away to the other end of the room, and nine or ten men surrounded the chair in which the deceased was put; I heard it crack. Besthall came, and said he would not let us be there any longer. The men all went out together, and the deceased was with them; the deceased staggered very much, he looked ill-he frightened me; I saw Downs with him. I remained in the shop till eight o'clock next morning; several men came back, the watchmen came and enquired for the man who had bathed the deceased's temples: nobody answered. I did not see any body move at the time.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles's. I apprehended the prisoner, Walton, I found him under the bed in the kitchen, at No. 7, Church-street, St. Giles's, on Sunday last.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURGESS. I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the deceased about three o'clock in the morning of the 29th of December, he was quite dead, and nearly cold; there was an appearance about his face and neck, which indicated a determination of blood towards the head; the eye was very full, and had a livid appearance. I endeavoured to bleed him in the arms and temples, without effect: these symptoms would proceed from strangulation, or pressure of the throat.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person applied his thumb and finger to the necks,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150016"/>and he died of that, would it have that appearance - A. Most certainly. He appeared to me to have been a healthy man; the foaming would arise from apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after a man receiving a pinching in the throat, would he live - A. If it continued many minutes, he would have died directly. A man might walk across the street after such strangulation, but he would be in a very exhausted state. If the pinching at the throat had continued a quarter of an hour, he could not walk about. A person subject to a determination of blood in the head, is subject to apoplexy, and liquor would encourage it. I cannot say whether his death was occasioned by strangulation, or apoplexy. I did not discover any marks, the pressure would not leave marks. It is my opinion that it was apoplexy, arising from the pressure.</p>
               <p>DOWNS' Defence. I was in the coffee-shop, the other prisoner came in, we were talking together; a few minutes afterwards I heard that the decaesed man was laying down next door to Mr. Boilam's; I went out and told the watchmen, and I asked for some vinegar, and bathed the deceased's temples.</p>
               <p>WALTON'S Defence. I was in the coffee-shop with some young women, the deceased came in and had some coffee; soon after a number of men came round, and began talking with the deceased; one of the young women broke the chair, and I went to help the man out.

            . I sat next to the prisoner Downs, a young woman was sitting by me; the deceased came, and the young woman got up and broke the chair. Downs was sitting by the fire. I did not see Walton put his hands to the deceased's breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. The deceased went out by himself, quite well, nobody touched him; he was drinking his coffee, nobody put their hands to his pocket; there was no noise. The man was not pushed into the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that Walton was not near the deceased all the while - A. I will. The prisoner were in the room before the deceased came in, it was about twelve or one o'clock</p>
               <p>EMMA BURFORD. I was in the coffee-shop with the prisoner, Walton; he was in the house before the deceased. I broke the chair, the men were all round me. I jumped up, to save myself, and broke it. The deceased was in another chair by my side, his chair was not broke. Walton was trying to get me out when I broke it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Jealous was in the room when I broke the chair. Walton did not send for me to be a witness here; I saw him on Saturday last.</p>

All three ran different ways. The prisoner ran towards Fore-street; one of the others crossed over, and ran the same way. I called out, stop thief! just as I got up to the prisoner, he called out, stop thief! I collared him; he had not got above a dozen yards - I did not lose sight of him. He had an oilskin hat and a blue neck-handkerchief. I am sure I never lost sight of him; I charged him with being the man, and collared him. Mr. Carter took him into custody. I thought I had lost my watch at the time. He was searched at the Counter, and a tobacco-box found on him, which smelt of snuff, and corresponded with the smell on my face; his coat cuffs were also covered with snuff.</p>

               <p>HOLLAND SMITH. I live with Messrs. Smith and Edwards. About eight o'clock on the morning of the 8th of January, the prisoners were employed to take away the dust; the lead was near the door, and had been weighed the evening before. I saw the prisoners put a lump into their baskets every time that they passed the counter. When they had removed the dust, I charged them with it; but I let them go, as I knew where their master lived. They said they had only taken a small bit, which they wanted for a particular purpose. I got up into the cart, and took out eighty pounds weight, in seven or eight lumps.</p>

I had a glass or two at different places with her, and I had been drinking before I met her. I had 22l. in notes, one guinea, and four half-crowns, in my pocket. I went to a house with her, and fell asleep; and she afterterwards said she would see me home, and left the house with me. I suppose I had the money when I met her. I do not know. I went home, when I missed 4l. and half-a-crown; I went out, and met the prisoner in Holborn. I gave her into custody. The notes had my employer's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150018"/>name on them. I do not remember giving her any thing. The constable found four 1l. notes upon her.</p>

I asked them where they were going - They said, to buy fish, at Billingsgate. I asked them who they were. Burton said, his name was Burton, from Southgate. I asked him what was in the cart - He said, nothing but empty baskets. Norris said, he was going to seek a place in town; and Burton told me, there was a very suspicious cart behind loaded with furniture, and that I had better go back. I followed them to Newington-green, and then searched the cart with the watchman's lantern, and found three geese, and some fowls. Burton told me, they had fowls and geese, and that he bought them at Mill-hill the day before, of a woman. I secured them</p>

On the 10th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I left my shop, was absent about five minutes, I rent the lower part of the house, of Oates; he lives in it. I had pulled the door to after me; I do not know whether it was fast, or not. As I was returning, when I passed my window, I saw a person standing with one foot on the door cill, and the other in my shop, with his left arm extended, so as to take something out of the window; there was another man with him at the time. I passed them to see if they would go away; they went away together. The tallest man had something under his coat; I pursued them about forty yards, and secured Leary, the other ran away. I called out watch, and Furze-man came up, and I gave him in charge. Three cruets, and a frame, were found under his coat; they were mine, and were in my window when I went out.</p>

               <p>Court. What were you talking about - A. I was not in a hurry; the watchman called to me as I was going home. I think it was the 10th of December; we did not go home together - He came home soon after ten: he lives with me; his brother went out and brought him home.</p>

I found the wall broke down, and the lock forced. I waited all night, but the prisoners did not come home. The next morning I went out with Gates, we found a picture and a milk-pot at Mrs. Yate's, in Great St. Andrew-street, which he claimed; we found some more things at Mrs. Gray's.

I saw two young men lurking about me for some time; my bundle was taken from me-it contained the articles mentioned in the indictment. I got up, and called, stop thief. I afterwards saw my bundle in the watchman's possession. The prisoner is like one of the men who were lurking about me.</p>

               <p>JOHN LLOYD. I am a watchman. As I was going half-past ten o'clock, I heard the alarm; I ran down the garden, and saw the prisoner and another man run through the Hole-in-the-wall public-house, there is a passage through it; the prisoner had a bundle under his arm. I went round another way to meet them. I saw them both run down Beauchamp-street; the prisoner had the bundle still. I lost them. Soon after eleven o'clock, I saw him again, at the end of Drayton-street; I went after him, and he ran away; he threw the bundle away. I am sure it was the prisoner. I took the bundle up, and sprung my rattle.</p>
               <p>GEORGE FERRY. I am also a watchman. The last witness described the prisoner to me. I was going to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner with a girl; I took the girl, as I wanted her. The prisoner followed me to the watch-house, and I took him also.</p>

I accompanied Vann, the officer, to the prisoner's house, in Middle-street, Cloth-fair, on the 3d of November; the prisoner, Eliza Macginnis was at home, she had a handkerchief on her neck, which I recognized to be the same pattern, as one of Ellen's gowns. I asked her what she had done with my blue superfine cloth, and if she had any. She at first said, she knew nothing about it. The prisoner, Thomas Macginnis was present; I told her I knew she had some, and that I had got proof of it. She told me to search the premises. I found nothing. I asked her about the handkerchief. She said, it was a small remnant that she had bought in Field-lane. I told her she must go with us. She lives in a small room, with a bed in it, and sells greens; when I got her to the watchhouse, I confronted Ellen, who was in custody, with her.

The prisoners, King and Murrell, came to my house on the 9th of December, and took a furnished apartment, and the articles mentioned in the indictment were let with the lodging. On the 10th of December, in the evening, they came into the lodging. On the 11th they went out and took the key with them; they slept there on the 10th and 11th; they did not return; I broke the door open on the next day, and I found the things gone; they had nearly stripped the room; they did not return any more; I saw King in custody on the 16th; about a fortnight afterwards the other prisoner was taken; I went to Rose and Crown-court, and found my property there; the prisoner, Rudd, brought their boxes when they took possession of the lodgings.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARR. I am a broker, and live in Rose and Crown-court, Moorfields. On the 12th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, King, came to me, and asked me if I would buy a bed, as she was going in the country; I went with her to Peahen-court, Bishopgate; she took me into a room on the two pair of stairs, and showed me a bed; the prisoners Rudd and Murrell were there; they asked 2l. 15s. for the bed, bolster, pillows, and rugg; I offered them two guineas for it; they consulted together, and Rudd said, let him have it; King said, it was hers; and there was only one bed in the room. The prisoner, Murrell, offered me a set of fire-irons; I gave her 4s. for them. I asked Rudd to help me home with them, and I would give him the money; he said, he was going out; King helped me home with them, and I paid her; Mrs. Morris afterwards claimed the property.</p>
               <p>BERNARD GLEED. I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 13th of January, I accompanied Armstrong to Norwich; we took the prisoner, Rudd, into custody there; on the 15th, we told him, that we took him for a robbery; he said, he was very sorry for it; it was the first time, and if he got clear, he would not do the like again. Murrell was in Norwich Bridewell; I took her. King was apprehended in London.</p>

               <p>SUSAN GRAY, I had a piece of money exactly like that found on the prisoner; it appeared to me to be of the same age and wear, I will not swear to it. We also lost a Napoleon, and a half-guinea, which had a small dent in the middle, like that produced; I had had it five years.</p>

            'S Defence. I bought the coat of a man, who told me it was concerned with a robbery, and not to wear it till it was altered. The evidence of Mrs. Gray is true. I told her what I did, out of revenge to my brother, in consequence of a family quarrel. I never said the things were taken to my mother's house; and I can produce two witnesses to prove that I was at home on the night of the robbery. I said my brother was concerned in it, out of revenge, that was my only motive.</p>

            . I am watchman to Mr. Brown of Millbank. On the 21st of December, between eleven and twelve in the morning, I saw the prisoner lurking about the house, as I passed, when I returned he was gone; I looked in at the gate, and saw the windows open, heard a door rattle, and saw the prisoner put his head of the parlour-window. I shook my head at him, and he came to the door to me; I asked him why he went into the house? he said the door was open; I told him that it was false, and that he got in at the window. He wanted me to let him go. As I was taking him to Mr. Bramah he threw a screw-driver into the garden. I went back and found it.</p>
               <p>JOHN COBHAM. I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to Queen-Square, and I found two locks in his coat pocket, and the nobs in his other pocket. I went, with Taylor, to the house, in Union-place, Millbank, and found eight doors with the locks off: those found on the prisoner fitted two of the doors exactly.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was taken ill, and went into the house. The locks found on me are mine. I am continually pestered with officers. I was once transported, and since I received my pardon I will defy any man to say I I have robbed anybody. I can produce a hundred locks of the same description.</p>

On the 2d of December last, I went out between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning; there were a great number of guns and pistols in my shop window. I returned about three o'clock in the afternoon. My house was perfectly safe when I went out; when I returned, I found my house in a very demolished state; the shop window-frame and windows were broken. The shop is part of my dwelling-house.

            . I was Mr. Beckwith's apprentice on the 2d of December last. A young man came into the shop on that day, about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock; and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards about four or five hundred came, and said they would have the young man out of the shop; he had been taken into custody for shooting Mr. Platt. The young man was afterwards rescued; the mob broke open the shop before they rescued him. The left hand window was broke-the glass was broke first, and afterwards the frame; they then proceeded to take the guns and pistols, by putting their hands in at the window. They afterwards came into the shop and took the guns out. I saw the prisoner, Cashman, there, he was in the shop, opening the drawers, and taking the things out; he took some shot charges out, and some guns, and distributed them amongst the mob. I should think that he took a dozen, all at one time. He was backwards and forwards in the shop; I did not see him go out of the shop, he gave the guns out at the door; he took them out of the counting-house, which is within the shop. I am sure that Cashman is the man who did it.

            , and Griffin, were in the shop, when Cashman was there. Two pistols were fired off when Cashman was there; I was alarmed. The mob had colours flying about in the street. I rather think Gunnell broke the windows, but I will not be certain. I did not see how they was broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was repeatedly examined about this, before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not always so sure of Cashman as you are now-A. Yes; I was always: I said, I was not certain of the brewer's servant, but was certain of Cashman. I was a great deal alarmed; there was a great mob. My efforts were directed to save my master's property. I am certain Cashman is the man, and always was. I am not sure who broke the window, but I think it was Gunnell; he was dressed as a brewer's servant, and it was a brewer's servant who broke the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you do not recollect who broke the window - A. There were three or four brewer's servants there, which of them it was I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason for saying you believe Gunnell was there, than from his being dressed as a brewer's servant - A. He is very much like the man.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LIDYARD. I reside in Snow-hill; I am a hair-dresser. On the 2d of December, having heard the report of a pistol, I ran out of my door towards Mr. Beckwith's; I went into his house-when I got to the door, a mob of about eighteen persons were near the door; in a few minutes it increased to about two hundred. They had flags with the words "Justice," and "Trust to Providence" I think, upon them. The mob seemed to ask for their leader, the man who had shot Mr. Platt. Mr. Hone said, that he was gone, in order to get rid of them; but he was, in fact, up stairs. On the west side of the window, there was a man, in the habit of a drayman, who broke one window with a stick: a man like a sailor, broke the other. Upon the windows being broken, the guns were taken out; two boys were taking the pistols out, and the men were taking the guns. Five or six rushed in at the door; they seized the arms out of the glass-cases by the sides of the shop.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150026"/>A sailor jumped in at the east window, and several with him; almost every thing was taken out of the shop. The mob were making a great noise, and breaking the windows: the flag was brought into the shop by one of the men. I saw the prisoner, Hooper, give the flag to another man, at the door of the shop, before the mob entered. The flag remained opposite the house, and I lost sight of it. About ten minutes afterwards it was brought into the shop. During the time that I lost sight of the flags, my attention was directed to the mob in the shop; I saw the prisoner, Cashman, in the shop: he had hold of Griffin, and another man laid hold of him on the other side. Griffin had been to get hand-cuffs for the man who we had in custody; he was seized by one man, and afterwards I saw him in the hands of Cashman. I saw Cashman go into the counting-house, and take arms out of it twice; the counting-house is at the back af the shop. He took about a dozen out the first time, and eight or ten the second: he threw them out to the mob at the door. I also saw the prisoner, Gamble, opposite the shop: before the windows were broken, he was among the mob, standing close to the east window; he had no gun then, he had nothing in his hands at that time. I saw him shortly afterwards with a gun, he was in the coach-road, among the mob, with a gun on his shoulder, and appeared to be going away; the mob were running at that time. I did not see Carpenter there. After the mob had taken the arms, they went up towards Newgate-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I was only examined once at the Mansion-house; I was there several times to see the different persons who were examined. I only said whether I knew the different prisoners, or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say before, that you saw Hooper with a flag - A. I think I said so at the Mansion-house: I only answered to what I was asked. I was asked whether Hooper was the man who took hold of Griffin-and I said, no. I said, I never saw Hooper in the shop; and say so now.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you much alarmed - A. I was afraid.</p>

            . I live in Skinner-street; I am a perfumer. I was in Mr. Beckwith's shop on the 2d of December last, between eleven and twelve o'clock; the first thing I observed, was Warrell, the officer, searhing the man whom he had in custody. I was in Beckwith's counting-house, I stood there about five minutes, and afterwards I went out for some hand-cuffs: I returned in about ten minutes. I went into Beckwith's shop - A mob was on the outside of the house; the shop was then quite safe. The window towards Holborn was first broke by a brewer's drayman, with a broom-stick: Gunnell is the man who did it; I am sure of it. I had observed him before he broke the windows; I saw him break the first window. The prisoners, Hooper and Cashman, came into the shop afterwards, they came from a flag. I had seen that same flag in Hooper's hands, in the Old Bailey, when I was going for the hand-cuffs, it had the words "Soldiers, and Loving Brothers" on it. Hooper and Cashman came to the front door. I was laid hold of by the prisoner, Hooper, and I laid hold of him. Cashman came up and collared me, and asked what was the matter. A third came up, I do not know who he was. Before they came in, Hooper hallowed out "Follow me! Follow me!" upon that a rush was made at the door. There was no windows broke at that time. When they had got hold of me, I said, what do you want of me? I came to rescue the man as well as you: I said so for my own safety. They then let me go. They went towards the counting-house: I followed them. I passed them, and lald hold of a blunderbuss, pulled the trigger back, and put it on my shoulder. Hooper took a pistol from his great coat; he presented it, and said, I can do that as well as you: pointing it at me. I was so terrified that I ran up into the kitchen, and did not come down again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I have been a hairdresser for twelve years, and lived in this house. I did live with a Mr. Marquis, twelve years ago; he is a hairdresser: I was his journeyman. I left him because I did not agree with him: he did not turn me away - I went away myself. I was at the Mansion-house two or three times a week, for three or four weeks; I went for the purpose of being examined, but sometimes I was not examined. I have been examined there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever, until after the examinations had been all gone through, or did you ever, at any one of these examinations, say Hooper was the man who presented the pistol at you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did you say so - A. About a week ago, at Mr. Newman's office; I think it was not before all the examinations had been gone through.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever examined at the Mansion-house after that day - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say, in the presence of the prisoner, Hooper, that he was the man who presented the pistol to you - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have also sworn that you saw him displaying the flag; did you ever say so in the presence of the prisoner, until to day - A. I have not. I do not know of any reward being offered for any thing, but for the man who shot Mr. Platt.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. GURNEY. I went to the Mansion-house, when I was directed to go; sometimes I was examined, and sometimes not. There were a great many persons against whom examinations were taken. I always answered, to the best of my knowledge, to the questions that were put to me: I did not know that there was a reward offered.</p>
               <p>Court. When you returned to the shop, in Skinner-street, had you the hand-cuffs open in your hand - A. No.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live at No. 5, George-street, Snow-hill. On the 2d of December last, I was in Skinner-street; I was not there till the mob was at Mr. Beckwith's shop. The mob extended across the street; they had a flag with them: the flag was nearly opposite the shop-door-it had reading on it. I saw the prisoners, Cashman and Carpenter, there. The mob were breaking the windows with sticks. I saw Cashman go into the shop and bring out fowling-pieces, or muskets, to the mob; I suppose he brought out four: he came out with them in his arms, and gave them to the mob at the door, saying, "Here! Here!" and gave the arms to them. He went in again, and brought out three more: he gave two of them away, and kept one himself. I then went home and came back again; the major part of the mob were then gone towards Newgate-street. I then saw Carpenter with two pistols, he was in the body of the mob;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150027"/>one was a large horse pistol, and the other was a small one: he was going huzzaing, and brandishing the pistols about in his hands. I also saw the windows broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CURWOOD. I live close by; I told a woman of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to her, come out, and see the fun - A. I did not. I said no such thing, to the best of my knowledge, I did not. I never said I wished them success. I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard that they had laid down their arms, did you not say, that they were bl-dy fools, and that they, ought to have gone to Carlton House - A. I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, that you heard there was a reward of fifty guineas, and that you thought you could pick out two for it - A. I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there was a reward of fifty guineas - A. When I came home, I said, I knew two of them;-there was no reward then. I did not say afterwards that there was a reward, and that I knew two of them: I told the woman I knew two of them, the moment of my coming home. The woman had sent me up to see if her husband was there; she was alarmed for fear of his being in the crowd: I knew her husband perfectly well; I did not see him. When I went home to the woman, I said, I knew two that were there; for I had frequently seen them before the riot. Neither of the prisoners are the two whom I spoke of: it was two men who are not apprehended. There were no rewards at that time; there could be none.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN MIDDLETON. I am a wholesale stationer, in Skinner-street. On the 2d of December last, when the mob were opposite Mr. Beckwith's, I saw a number of persons before my house, pass down to his house. I was standing at my warehouse door, which is about twelve doors above Beckwith's house, but within sight. I heard the report of fire-arms, and a few minutes afterwards a number of persons came opposite my house, between my house and the church; they very soon after returned again to Mr. Beckwith's. I was in the balcony of my drawing-room window: I observed several of the mob. The prisoner, Hooper, most certainly was there; I saw him conversing with the man who held the flag: he appeared to me to be directing the mob. I think he took the flag from the man, but I am not certain; I saw him in the mob for two or three minutes: he had a tri-coloured cockade in his hat-the flag was also tri-coloured, and had letters on it. He had something in his hand, I thought it was a sword; he flourished either a sword or stick, and was directing the persons about him. When the mob returned opposite my house, they appeared to be going to the city; but there was a noise from Mr. Beckwith's house, and they returned there again. The flags moved with them, and Hooper went with them too; he was very near the flag. I did not follow them, I watched them; I saw the windows broken, and a great quantity of fire-arms taken out of the windows; the remainder of the windows were broken, with the muskets which had been taken out. I did not observe any muskets with the mob before this; when they were opposite my house the first time, they had swords. After I saw the windows broken, and the arms taken out, the mob came towards Newgate-street again, when I lost sight of them. I am partly sure that Hooper was there with them; the flag went with them: I have no doubt that Hooper was with them, the last time that they passed my house.</p>
               <p>Flag produced. MOTTO: TRUTH TO PROTECT THE INJURED, NATURE TO FEED THE HUNGRY, JUSTICE TO PUNISH CRIME.</p>

            . I am drayman to Messrs. Calverts. On the 2d of December last, I was in Warwick-lane, with my dray, it leads into Newgate-street, it was about two o'clock, I knew the prisoner, Gunnell, I have known him for six years; I saw him on that day in Newgate-street, he had a gun in his hand - He was with a great many people, going towards Cheapside. I also saw the flag among the mob; the flag went first, and the mob followed - They were all going the same way. I have known Gunnell six years, he was a lame man. I never saw him walk with a stick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Have you never said that it was not Gunnell, but another man - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been dismissed from Calverts' service - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been without receiving your wages - A. I was at the Mansion-house for three days, and received no wages for those three days. Gunnell was not working for Calverts' at the time - He had lived with them some time ago.</p>
               <p>SIR JAMES SHAW, Bart. On the 2d of December, the day of the riots, I offered the Lord Mayor my assistance; I first saw the mob on the north side of the Royal Exchange, near the north door of the Old Stock Exchange; they had a flag with them: I did not perceive the arms. I seized the flag, that which has been produced, is the one; we dispersed the mob: they flew in all directions. The flag was attached to a long pole: (produced) that is the pole, I know it by a mark.</p>

He said he knew it, he brought it for the purpose, either to kill, or be killed. I have had it ever since, and now produce it.</p>

I asked him where he had got the gun, he said he picked it up in Skinner-street it was a dirty day.

            . On the morning of the 2d of December, I was in Spa-fields; I saw a mob assembled round a waggon; I saw the prisoner, Hooper, in the waggon at the time the mob were assembled round it. I did not see either of the other prisoners. There were two tri-coloured flags displayed from the waggon; the one that has been produced was one of them. I saw the mob leave Spa-fields, they went towards Coppice-row, Hooper accompanied them they left the waggon behind. The flags moved with the mob, and a banner also; they quitted the waggon, after way was made for them; Hooper was with them, he was close to the flags they were carried, and he joined them. When they came to Coppice-row they made their way towards the City. I saw Mr. Stafford, with some officers, make a rush towards the flags. He carried off one of the flags and a banner; the other was drawn down, and they went towards the City.</p>
               <p>JOHN LIMBRIC. I am an officer of Hatton-Garden. I went into Spa-fields, and saw the waggon, with a great number of persons round, and several persons in it.

Hooper had a tri-coloured cockade in his hat, this was in the waggon, another man had this banner, (pro ducing it.)</p>

            WINDERMUDE. I live in Horse-ferry-road, Westminster. I am the proprietor of the waggon which was in Spa-fields, on the day the mob was there. It was hired on the 27th of November, which was the Monday preceding the day. On the Sunday evening, the person who had hired the waggon came to me, the prisoner, Hooper, was with him. I received directions from both of them, to be at the top of Chancery-lane, Holborn end, at nine o'clock; I was there at the time appointed. The other man and Hooper came to me there, and put something in the waggon. I afterwards found it to be colours, those produced are the same, there was a small bundle put in the waggon. After the mob had left Spa-fields, I found the bundle to contain bullets, and a cat of gun-powder, and some bits of lead cut to pieces. I think Hooper put it in, if he did not, he was present at the time. After the things were put in, we proceeded towards Spa-fields. Hooper rode in the waggon; there was a large mob round the waggon in Spa-fields. After some time, the mob left the waggon; Hooper was in the waggon when it was there. I had been paid part of my money for the waggon, he said, I should have the remainder. Hooper was in the waggon when the flags were displayed. Cashman was in the front of the waggon, and had one of the colours. Hooper and Cashman went away with the mob; I delivered the bullets and powder to Gillman.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150029"/>GILLMAN. I received the bullets and powder from the last witness, there are from sixty to one hundred bullets, about a pound of powder, and some slugs.</p>
               <p>CASHMAN'S Defence. I went to the London-Hospital that morning, to see my shipmate, who was ill. I took a letter for a gentleman to the Admiralty; I returned and went to Rosemary-lane; I staid there sometime. I was sent back to the Admiralty, and as I was returing, the people were running, I ran with them. I took the arms from the men, and was taken into custody. The two men, when they were examined before the Lord-Mayor, said, that I was drunk; and so I was. The man who took the musket from me, said I was drunk.</p>
               <p>HOOPER'S Defence. I was informed, that there was no material evidence against me, in consequence of which, I was admitted to bail; it now appears to day, that there is frightful, terrible evidence against me. Griffin often came to look at me at the Mansion-house, but he never brought any evidence against me; Lidyard also, never appeared against me till this time, seeing this is the case, I am altogether unprepared to meet it. I never carried the colours; I certainly had a tri-coloured cockade in my hat. On my leaving Spa-fields, I came into the city, for the purpose of calling on the Lord-Mayor, to inform him that they were rioting, and to prevent them from plunder. I never entered Beckwith's shop.</p>
               <p>GAMBLE'S Defence. On the 2d of December, I went out to look for work; I was in Holborn, and followed the people to Spa-fields; I followed the mob from Spa-fields to Mr. Beckwith's shop. I picked the gun up in Skinner-street. I went home to Union-street, in the Borough. I was taken into custody about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>GUNNELL'S Defence. I am very wrongfully accused of breaking the windows. I had not got a broom-stick in my hands on that day; nor was I in the shop, or near it.</p>
               <p>CARPENTER'S Defence. On that day I went to the London-docks to look for work, I could not get any; and was going to Spa-fields. I heard of the riot at the Mansion-house, and went there. The pistol was forced into my hands, powder and shot was offered me; I said, I had no use for it. I took the pistol, as I was afraid of my life. I went home. I was at home by one o'clock; I have witnesses to prove that I was at home by that time.</p>

               <p>MR. GRIFFIN re-examined. COURT. - Q. It appears by refering to your examination before the Lord-Mayor, that you said, Cashman presented the pistol to you? - A.

I was met by the prisoner, Barton, who instantly struck me over the left eye with a stick, and knocked me down in the kennel and stunned me; the first returning sensation that I felt was a difficulty of breathing; I found the prisoner, Barton, was kneeling on my breast - He had his hands over my mouth and nose; I struggled hard to liberate myself; he pointed a stick between my nose and mouth, and said, if I moved an inch he would blow my brains out. Frampton was turning my pockets inside out. Barton asked him, if he had drawn all out. Barton then struck me on the nose, and left me again insensible; when I came to, I felt the water flow on my neck. I got up to pursue them, with the assistance of the watchman, from St. John-street to Goswell-street, without effect. I went home. I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment. I lost the handkerchief off my neck, and I am sure, Frampton is the man who ritled my pockets. I am also sure, Barton was the other man. I looked particularly in his face, when I was in the kennel; he was between me and the lamp.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. It was dark, but the shops were open; I must have passed one hundred shops with Frampton; I told him, I was going to the City-road; he did not frighten me; he is a little man. - Q. Do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150030"/>you mean to say, that sixteen days after the transaction, you would know him again? - A. I pointed them out myself. The prisoner, Frampton, was sitting by the fire; and in order to convince myself that he was the man, I turned upon him and he drew his hat over his face, and left the room, his partner was there. I did not see the police officer till I had seen the men; I can swear to them positively.</p>

            . I am a jeweller. I live in Clarke-street, Sutton-street, Goswell-street. I went to No. 53, Vineyard-street, Islington. On the 23d of December, I was in company with Frampton at the Angel, at the corner of George-street, Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. How do you know that it was the 23d of December? - A. Because the next day being Christmas-eve, made me remember it. I went to the Angel at a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening; Frampton came at half-past; he was on the other side of the room all the evening; he was not absent more than five minutes; I continued there till eleven o'clock at night; I am sure he was there till eleven o'clock, except for two or three minutes; he was drinking by himself on the other side of the room. I have used the Angel, this five years; it is in my neighbourhood. Frampton usually came in, at a little after eight o'clock; he was apprehended at this house; I should suppose he was there, four or five times a week; I go there every night. I am a single man. I get from 1l. 10s. to 1l. 15s. per week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you are there every night, how can you swear to the 23d of December. A. I had to get up the next morning very early, to do some particular work; and my brother came to fetch me that evening.</p>

I was called up at half-past two o'clock and found a piece of linen on the floor, and another on the counter, which were not there when I went to bed; the fan-light was broken in two places. There was some linen piled under the fan-light, within the reach of a man's arm; two pieces were taken, and the rest of the articles mentioned in the indictment. The fan-light was broken at each end; it reaches across the shop. About 10 minutes afterwards, I heard the rattle spring, and the watchman brought one piece of linen and part of the shawls, saying, he had found them in Cleveland-mews, which is at the corner of my house. I went there. Brown found the remainder of my property. The prisoner was taken soon after.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROWN. I am a watchman. The last witness called me; I found his house broke open. I examined about and found part of the property in a basket in a cart, in the mews. About four o'clock two men came down Martin-street; one said to the other, it is a very bad job: they went down Howland-street into Russell-mews, which leads into Cleveland-mews. I told the other watchman, and we concealed ourselves, to catch them. I stood behind some dung, and he was behind the court; in five minutes the prisoner came down the mews, and made a stop, opposite the cart, in which we found the property. I laid hold of him immediately, and brought him to the watch-house; his shoulders were covered with muddy feet marks, as if some body had been standing on them. A piece of cotton was found in his breeches pocket; he said, he had slept in a cart, in Fitzroy-market.</p>

               <p>HENRY HOWARD. I am the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I found a piece of print in his pocket, and a latch key; his shoulders were muddy, as if somebody had been standing on them: it was a dirty night. He said, he picked the print up in the mews, when he went there to ease himself. Fitzroy-market is quarter of a mile from the mews; the print was not dirty at all. (I produce it.)</p>

               <p>JAMES WOODCROFT. The print found on the prisoner is mine, and hung over my fan-light, when it was broken; a person standing on another's shoulders might easily reach my fan-light.</p>

Randall and Co's is about one hundred yards from my house; they then came to my shop. I heard the windows broken in; I then got out at the top of the house, and through a neighbour's house, and went home. I returned at a little after three o'clock, and found my shop demolished; the windows and window frames broken. I had left my property in the shop. I found I had lost upwards of 1000l. worth of property; consisting of muskets, pistols, fowling-pieces, blunderbusses, and 7l. in notes, and 30s. in copper.

            , Esq. I am a merchant. On the 2d of December, I saw the mob in the Minories, they were employed in breaking Randall and Co's shop; there might be at that time about twelve or fifteen armed men. They afterwards went to Rae's shop; by that time they had collected to a larger number: they had fire-arms, and were firing them in the air. I saw the prisoner there: I at first saw him in the Minories with the mob at Randall's door; he had a sabre in his hand, and seemed very active. The noise was great, I could not hear him say any thing; he kept brandishing his sword, and making the various cuts of the broad sword exercise; he was within four feet of Mr. Rea's at the time they broke in. They at first broke in at the south window of the shop, got into the shop and took the arms, they afterwards attacked the back part of the house, the back window looks into the counting horse; there was four or five men with pickaxes, forcing the door, and endeavouring to gain admittance, after some trouble, they succeeded; the prisoner went with them, and brandished his sword, to keep persons off who might attempt to disturb them, some of them went in at the door; they were at Mr. Rae's house. about three quarters of an hour; they made a complete passage through the house, and took a great deal away, some of them came out at the part where the prisoner was, and brought cartouch-boxes, pistols, and other arms. The prisoner was certainly co-operating with those who went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were his actions such has to create terror to those in the house? - A. Certainly, they were; I heard him shout.</p>
               <p>Q.PRISONER. Did you see me in the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask me if I knew my broad-sword exercise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM SAMUEL. I am a City constable. I was opposite Mr. Rae's shop on the 2d of December, at the time the mob were taking arms. I saw the prisoner there; he had a broad cutlass in his hand, flourishing it about; he was close to the door when the mob were bringing the goods out of the shop. I saw him with his hands in the window handing out some pistols to the mob. I saw him harranguing the mob for half an hour; during the whole time he was the most active man among them.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Thames Police-Office; the prisoner was examined at our office; Delany was examined, and produced the pistol. The prisoner was asked how he came by it. I took down, from his mouth, what he said (reads.) "I was servant to Lieutenant Prior, he brought it from abroad about two years and a half ago; he went to Chichester, and I dare say he is there now. I was in London at the time of the riots; but do not recolleet where. I was not at the riots. I used to attend clubs before I went to sea, but that led me into bad company, and that was the reason of my going to sea. Lieutenant Prior gave me his pistols, and other things, to the value of 50l. I have sold all the other things, as I was short of money."</p>

               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am police-officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 2d of December, which was the day that Mr. Rae's house was robbed. I took him in Great Aliff-street, he was coming in the direction from Mr. Rae's house, walking very fast, with a gun in his hand(I produce it). I stopped him, and asked him how he came by it; he said he had picked it up in the Minories. It was a dirty day, but there was no appearance whatever of mud on it. It could not have lain in the Minories, and have been in that state, the streets were very dirty. I took him about half-past two, just after the soldiers came.</p>
               <p>RAE. The gun produced is the one which I spoke of; it is Mr. Aplin's property, and worth 10l.</p>

I walked behind them, and asked several to assist me in taking the three. They kept together till they came to Red Lion-street, the prisoner then turned down the street; I got assistance, and secured him. My friend asked him if he was an officer, he said, no; I said, how did you come by that sword? he said he found it in the Minories. It was a dirty day, but there was not the least appearance of dirt on it; if it had been picked up, it would not have the appearance that it had. I gave the sword to Dalton. It was not drawn.</p>

On the 2d of December, about a quarter past one o'clock in the day, there was thirty or forty persons round our shop, they broke it open, and then got in. I had shut up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150034"/>shop before that time; there were fire arms of different descriptions taken away, amounting to about 750l.; there was also powder and shot taken away.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, on the 2d of December, in Church-lane, Whitechapel; between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; it is about a quarter of a mile from the Minories; he had a gun with him, the outside of it was quite clean, it appeared to have been recently discharged.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When you took him, he had it dragging after him - A. He carried it. It was not on the ground. I know Back Church-lane; if the prisoner had been going from Brander's, to Back Chuch-lane, the place where I met him, would not be the nearest way, it was in the way from Newgate-street; I produce the gun it was not fired while in my possession; nobody could get at it.</p>
               <p>MR. POTTS. The gun is mine, and was taken out of my counting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It had not been fired while it was in my possession, after it was proved; I have no doubt but that it has been fired since it was taken from my shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I picked it up.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. When I took it, it did not appear to have been on the ground.</p>
               <p>RICHARD JONES. I live in Old-street; the prisoner, is my son, he is a wood-cutter. On the 2d of December, I sent him out with the cart; Robins went with him. I sent him to St. Giles's, in the Fields; he worked for Mr. Jameson, as well as me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROBINS. I am the prisoner's brother-in-law. I went with him to sell the wood, we returned at a quarter to twelve, we went up Field-lane, Fleet-market, and to Temple-Bar, we then turned back, and went down Fleet-street into Fleet-lane; when we got to Newgate, the prisoner left me, it was about two o'clock; he went towards Whitechapel; his brother, Thomas Jones, accompanied us with the cart.</p>

I went to bed on Wednesday night, about twelve o'clock, my house was fastened that night; I was not up the last in the house; an entry was made, by breaking into the Court-yard, at the back of the house, into the area, and getting through the door; there was a latch to the door. I did not see it before I went to bed; the area is covered over, and the covering is connected with the house, running up against it, the hole was broke through the covering. When I saw the area next morning, the hole was broke in the wall; it is a wall of lath and plaster, with boards an inch and a quarter thick. There is no communication without the house to the area, we found this rope (producing it) suspended to one of the joists of the wall of the area, by which means, they must have got down, the hole was eight or nine feet from the ground; my servant was up between seven and eight, and I got up at eight.</p>
               <p>LUCY TURNER. I went to bed at half past twelve o'clock. I was last up at night. I got up rather before eight o'clock in the morning. I went down, and found the back door, which leads into the area, open; upon looking further, I found a glass frame, taken from off the iron grate, and several flower-pots had been removed; a large sheet of lead had been taken off the wall; and there was a hole in the ceiling; and the side board had been ransacked. I heard no noise in the night.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GILL. re-examined. Upon examination, I I found nearly all my plate gone. I lost the articles stated in the indictment; there were a great many plated articles in the same place, but they were not touched.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL HUGHES. I am a watchman. On the night of the 12th of December, I was calling four o'clock in the morning, it was nearly half-past four; I came by Mr. Levy's house, in Wentworth-street; I saw the prisoner standing in the court there; I did not know him before, I thought he might live in the court; I went up the court, and took particular notice of his dress, as I passed him; I went on, and returned again; I missed him; I went up the court, and saw Levy's side door was open, it is in the court; I returned to my box, and in a few minutes, the prisoner came by my box; I stepped out, and called to him, he stopped, and I crossed over to him, and asked him what he did at the house round the corner - He said,"what house," and seemed strange. I asked him, what he had got upon him, his pockets appeared full, and bulky - He said, "nothing at all," and that he was of a different character, to what I took him to be. I asked him if he had any thing in his hat, I did not observe any thing in it - He said, he had nothing. Levy's house is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150035"/>considered a receiving house; I have been on that beat fifteen months; Levy has lived in the neighbourhood some time; the door in the court is not usually left open; but there is a light burning in the room all night. I took the prisoner's hat off; I saw some lace, wrapped on a piece of blue pasteboard; I asked him, what he was going to do with it - He said, he was going to take it to his old woman. I said, "Who is she" - He said, his wife. I asked him where he lived - He said, in Frying-pan-alley; I took him to the watch-house; he wanted me to let him go; but, I refused; I put his hat on again, in taking him to the watch-house; as we were going along, he took his hat off, took out the lace, and took it off the pasteboard, and tried to put it in the puddle, in the street; I laid hold of his wrist, and he said, I wanted to rob him; I then put the lace into his left hand breeches-pocket, and took him to the watch-house, and told Barrs, that the prisoner had got some lace, Barrs asked him for it, and he pulled it out of his pocket, and gave it to him; the cap-caul was with the lace.</p>

I asked him who they were for; he said, for Gillman and Lucas, who were customers at our house. He had two pieces, which came to 1l. 10s. I gave them to him with a bill made out to Gillman and Co. I asked him his name; he said, it was Williams; he took them away with him.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner drank tea with us, on the 4th of January. I went out in the evening within two or three minutes after my husband and the prisoner. The coat was safe in the front room up stairs when I went out; when I returned at eight o'clock, it was gone. I locked the room-door before I went out.</p>

            . I am the daughter of Joshua Allen, who keeps the house. About twenty minutes past seven o'clock, the prisoner came to the house, alone; I let him in, and told him, that Mrs. Holland was not at home; he said, he knew that, but she was only next door, and that he would go up stairs and wait until she came in; he waited about ten minutes, and then went out, before Mrs. Holland came in. He shut the door after him. Nobody but the prisoner went up stairs during the time that Mrs. Holland was out; she returned about eight o'clock; I told her Jones had been; she went up, and missed the coat directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Have you not often heard your mother find fault with the prosecutor, for going out and leaving the door open? - A. Sometimes.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fothergill, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in Aldersgate-street. On the 4th of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner pledged the coat at out house, for 1l. 10s.; I am sure he is the man. Mr. Holland claimed it. I have done business with the prisoner before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at Holland's house the whole of that day before tea. I wanted some paper to write a letter - He had no paper. I was there till after tea. I went out with Holland after tea. I was going to Mile-end. I went back to write the letter; when I got to the side-door, there was a man pushed by me. I found the room-door locked, and came out, and found the coat lying in the court, and I pledged it.</p>

I talked some time with the landlord; if I had got any thing when I went out he must have seen it; I could not leave the house without going through the bar. I bought the two duplicates of a man at the public-house opposite the prosecutor's. Prosecutor first said at the office, that he saw the things on the Sunday Morning, and the pawnbroker said they were pledged on the Saturday, he then said it was that day.</p>

I was stopped by three men, one of them held my right arm down, while the prisoner robbed me of the money stated in the indictment. The notes were in my right hand breeches pocket, the silver in the left, and the copper in my left hand waistcoat pocket, which he tore in taking the copper out. The third man stood by; they were with me about five minutes; they then ran away. I gave information at the police office, and described the men. I saw the prisoner in custody at Lambeth-street, on the 21st, I knew him directly. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I picked him out immediately from several others. There was a good light at the place, from a factory lamp; it was by the lamp that I was robbed.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. I took the prisoner into custody, on the 28th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, from the description that I received from Judd. I found him walking along Whitechapel. I told him that I wanted him for a robbery, and the next morning I took Judd to look at him, and then told him, that I wanted him for the robbery of the postman in Bell-lane, with two others; I did not tell him what day it was, he said, he knew nothing about it. Judd saw him when he was before the magistrate. This (producing a paper) is the examination before the magistrate I heard him state what has been taken down.(read.)</p>

            . I am in the silk line. I called upon Mrs. Elliot on the 5th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and waited there till eight o'clock in the evening. The prisoner lodges with her. I left him there when I left, he was not out of the house all the time that I was there. Mrs. Elliot lives at Dog-row, Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. I live in Dukesbery-court, Whitechapel. The prisoner lives more than half a mile from Bell-lane. I did not go to inform the magistrate that he was at home on that day. I knew he was taken up, but it was three weeks after he was taken up, that I knew he was charged with doing any thing on the 5th of November. I do not know what day of the week the 5th of November was on. I had been to buy some linen and called on Mrs. Elliot, she was sitting by the fire reading, when I went in; the prisoner was nailing his shoes; the prisoner drank tea with us; I staid till eight o'clock Mrs. Elliot went to her needle-work after tea, another woman came in while I was there, and staid till four o'clock. She was Mrs. Elliot's acquaintance - I do not know her name. It was eight o'clock when I went away.</p>
               <p>DIANNA ELLIOT. I live in the Dog-row; the prisoner has lodged six months with me; he is a rope-maker. He came in about half-past one o'clock, and nailed his shoes; it was a wet day; he was nearly all the afternoon nailing them. He drank tea with us. Mrs. Carr also drank tea with us; she came to my house about three o'clock. I see her almost every evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do while she was there - A. I was chiefly talking to her. and looking at her things: she went away about eight o'clock; the prisoner did not go out at all. I heard that he was taken up on the 29th. I do not know what day the 5th of November was, I only noticed it by its being wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The prisoner lives at my house; I was cleaning my room when Mrs. Carr came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150038"/>Q. Did any body come in while Carr was in the room - A. Mrs. Clayton came in with her; I knwo her by sight. The reason of her coming was because she was with Carr; we all three came home on Saturday together. Mrs. Clayton stopped at my house, drank tea with us, and went away with Carr. I had not been reading the whole of that day.</p>

A cry of stop thief! was given, and they ran up Finsbury-place into the square; two young men pursued them, with the watchman, the prisoner was stopped on the south side of the square. They said nothing when they pinioned me; one laid hold of my wife while the other robbed me. He was taken to the watch-house. I had lost sight of him myself; but I am certain the prisoner is the man, I had an opportunity of seeing him: there are two gass lamps, one on each side of the street, I saw him plainly, and will swear to him; the whole transaction did not last ten minutes; he at first ran from me, and then passed me again. I am sure that the same persons who robbed me came back again. My watch, except the case, was found in the square.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness; we were coming home together on the 29th of December; just before we turned the corner of Crown-street, we were stopped by two men-the tallest took hold of me; I begged of them to go about their business, and not interrupt us. As soon as the tall man let go of me, I saw the watch go out of my husband's fob, and called out, they have got your watch; I turned towards them, they were making towards South-street, I cried out, thieves, you have got his watch! They turned round, came back again, and passed us at the corner of Cross-street, Finsbury-place: when they had got past Lackington's shop-door I heard the glass of the watch break, and called out, you are breaking his watch, thieves. I turned round, and saw the prisoner hold up his hands, and he said, I have got it (speaking to his companions). I pursued them, crying, stop thief! several people were gathered in the square, and I stood with my husband till they brought the prisoner up. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I am sure that the same men that ran down South-street came back again; I did not lose sight of them till they got into the crowd; my husband was not in liquor. When I saw the prisoner at the watch-house, I knew him to be the same man, he came up to us, and followed us, in Broad-street, about a quarter of an hour before; he said something to us, I do not know what, and Mr. Stubbs said, what does that fellow want? It was on the dark side of Broad-street, we crossed over to the other side, the lamps gave a good light at the time, quite sufficient for me to see him, so as to know him; I looked at him several times. I lost sight of him in Moorfields, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am porter to a master-tailor. On the 29th of December, I was coming along Finsbury-place at the time, the prisoner was with another man, taller than himself; I saw them running from the prosecutor. I pursued the prisoner, with the watchman, till he was taken. I ran from Finsbury-square to the corner of Wilson-street, and from Wilson-street to Lackington's, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they took that direction did you see them take any thing - A. No; I saw them run from the prosecutor to the place where the prisoner was taken; I did not see them come back again; I did not see them go towards South-street. I am sure that the prisoner is one of the men that I saw run from the prosecutor, he was not out of my sight of the whole of the time. I saw them run straight, from the prosecutor, down Wilson-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you first see me - A. In Finsbury-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did I run - A. From Lackington's, round the corner into Wilson-street, which is the next street to Lackington's, and leads into Moorfields. When the prisoner was taken, he said he was not the thief, but that he was running after the thief. I am certain that he is one of the men that ran from the prosecutor; I did not lose sight of him the whole time till he was stopped. He had a silk handkerchief tied round his neck, which covered the lower part of his face. When the watchman said that he would take him to the lady and gentleman, to see if he was the man, he pulled off his black silk handkerchief, and put it into his hat; he had a white one on underneath, which made him appear quite different. He was taken to them, and the lady said he was the man.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Chiswell-street, Finsbury-square. On Sunday night, the 29th of December, at half-past ten o'clock, I was crying the hour; I had got to the end of the street which looks into the square, I heard a woman say, "You villian, you have got my husband's watch: I know you have, I heard you break the glass." She cried out "thieves! these two men have robbed my husband of his watch." I being on the opposite of the street, facing them, I saw a bustle by the gaslights; I ran across the road to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner, in company with another man, run from Mr. Stubbs to the other side of the square, towards Sun-street. I sprung my rattle, and called out stop thief! I ran as fast as I could, and some persons passing at the time, held out their arms, and prevented the prisoner from getting any further; I came up and collared him. I said you are my prisoner, of whom the alarm was given; I will take you to the prosecutor to see if they will know you again. As soon as Mrs. Stubbs saw him, she said he was the man. When I told him I would take him to them, he took off his silk handkerchief, put it in his hat, and said,"Take me to them, they will not know me, I am not the man." I took him to the watch-house, and searched him, but found nothing on him. We found the watch on the pavement, the glass was broken, and the case gone, opposite Lackington's, in Finsbury-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the handkerchief tied round his neck - A. It was round his neck quite up to his nose.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SHREWSBERY. I am a head boorough; I was on duty in Chiswell-street, about half-past twelve o'clock, on the 29th of December, I heard the cry of stop thief! I went to the place where the cry came from; when I came up the prisoner had been taken into custody by the watchman: I went to the watch-house with him, and searched the prisoner. I found a red handkerchief in his pocket, and some copper - He had nothing in his hat. Mrs. Stubbs knew him directly. I found the watch on the pavement, where he had been taken; I did not find the case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When Stubbs came into the watch-house, did he not charge two or three persons with it - A.He said two men did it. I told him to look round to see if the other man was there, he said, no.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent; I had been spending the evening at my cousin's; I heard the alarm, and went to the lady to see what was the matter, she ran from me towards Cross-street - I followed her, a young man stopped me, and attempted to stop two or three more, Mr. Stubbs was intoxicated, and charged several men with the robbery; his wife said, she could not say I was the man.</p>

When the other prisoner came in, he said, perhaps I had got a pair that would fit him; he tried two or three pair on; then Mason said, he would be measured also; my back was turned from them to look for the shoes; the prisoner walked about the shop. When I had measured them, Smith said, I will be a pot of beer, and put his hands to his pocket for some money; I would not be treated by them; they left the shop, and I began to think all was not right; they were to call for the shoes, and both gave me the name of Smith to put on the measure; there was nobody else in the shop, while they were there. Mason had got an apron on, and by his manner of going out, and shutting the door after him; I suspected them, and followed them, and laid hold of Mason, about one hundred yards from the shop; they were talking together, and had another boy with them.

I saw the prisoner in the shop putting the tea in his bag. I went back for my key; when I returned he was gone. I found him on the step of the street-door with the bag in his hand. My lodgers left the door open; but I found the staple of my cellar door drawn, and the floor of my shop broken away; he must have broken through the floor to get in; it was forced up. I could not follow him, as I was not dressed. I called out stop thief. The prisoner had lodged at my house about seven months before. I saw him by the gass-light, which reflects into my shop. I described him to the officer, and told the officer his name. I missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; they were in my shop the evening before.</p>

I saw he was gone from the door, and a girl came in and gave the information. I did not see him take the cotton. I pursued him, his companion had left him. I saw him throw the cotton out of his apron into an area; as soon as I came out of the door. I followed him into Soho-square, and took him. I did not lose sight of him.</p>

               <p>JOHN EVANS. I am a stable-keeper and let out horses. On the 15th of October, the prisoner brought the mare to my stable to sell.

I shewed Mr. Dester the same mare that I bought of the prisoner.</p>

The back of his house comes against our warehouse; his windows look into a yard at the back of his house, and our store-room window looks into that yard; it is only a glass casement. On the morning of the 14th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I came to Mr. Wilknson's house, it was just getting day-light. I got in through Mr. Wilkinson's dwelling-house. I was the last in the place the day before; I locked all up at eight o'clock. When I got in, I observed a quantity of papers about, which was not there the night before. I found the papers had been taken from my pocket-book, which I had locked up in the desk the night before, and took the key with me. I missed six 10l. notes, four of which were endorsed; one 40l. note; one 30l. note; and six 1l. notes; the 30l. and 40l. note was my property, the rest belonged to the firm. The whole of the desks, six in all, were broken open. The counting-house was only fastened with a latch. I examined the premises, and found a door that comes out of the lumber-room, which I had bolted the night before, open; the lumber-room is under the same roof as Mr. Wilkinson's dwelling-house. There was nothing to impede the progress of the men from the store-room to the door; after getting through that door, they might go to the counting-house without interruption; they would have to pass a door with a spring or pully before they got to the counting-house. If a person had entered the store-room window and took the direction I have described, he could not pass through any premises, but Mr. Wilkinson's; they are not under the same roof all the way along. The store-room is under Mr. Wilkinson's roof; the manufactory is on the same floor; there is nothing over them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Is the counting-house part of the dwelling-house, or not? - A. It is distinct, it is no part of the dwelling-house. We lost about 150l. It is impossible to say. which way the persons came. I do not know whether Mr. Wilkinson's rent is paid out of the partnership account or not.</p>
               <p>Court. If a person wanted to go to the counting-house after you left it, they must go through the door which you locked? - A. They must.</p>

The store-room window looks into Harris's, senior, yard, it is on the first-floor; the store-room leads into the workshop, they are both under the same roof. The store-room and workshop are not under the dwelling-house; the lumber-room is part of the dwelling-house, there is a door out of the lumber-room into a passage and into the warehouse, you can go into the counting-house through that door; the lumber-room is under the dwelling-house, but detached from it by a partition and door, which is nailed up; there was no communication through that door.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you go from the lumber-room to the dwelling-house, without going from under the roof? - A. No, you must go under another roof, and come again under the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider the whole continuation of the dwelling to be more than one roof - A. Yes; two roofs; the firm pay for the whole of the premises, and charge my father with the rent of his dwelling-house.</p>

The window was quite safe the night before; it was broken the next morning, part was inside and part out. I could not see how they could get in but by the window, I got through it myself, any body could get through it-the bar was bent round; a person could stand on the privy, and get in at this window from the prisoner's, Harris, yard. I found a candle, which had been lit, and a mallet, in the room near the window.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRAVES. I am a watchman, my beat is near Moorfields. On the night that Messrs. Wilkinson and Co. were robbed, I saw the prisoner, Harris, jun., at the Punch Bowl public-house, which is about two hundred yards from Messrs. Wilkinson and Co's. house. harris, sen. lives in Sash-court. The four prisoners, after that came out of the public-house into Broker-row, and went up Wilson-street; Sash-court is in Wilson-street. They then went round and came up the street again, and stood a little while at the end of Sash-court, and went down the court. I followed them, they went into Harris, sen.'s house; this was about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock. I first saw them at eleven o'clock-Mitchel was with them.</p>
               <p>SARAH BLACK. On the 12th of December I lived in Sash-court, in Harris, sen.'s house, the other prisoners used to be backward and forward at his house-Lupton is his daughter. I was at work on the 13th of December, I did not see them on that day. I went to bed at a little after nine o'clock. Harris keeps the two pair of stairs front room, my room is on the ground floor; at a little after twelve o'clock I was awoke by a rustling noise, it proceeded from the passage, close to my door. I heard a voice say, "d-n you, Jem, do not run, were are all safe." It was a voice which I knew, but I do not know whether it was a female voice or not; they went by twice, talking to one another, they shut the yard-door, and soon after I heard the rattling of some glass, as if it was breaking; I did not get up, as I had been used to hear noises. A person could get to Wilkinson's window by getting on the top of the privy. Sash-court is no thoroughfare.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know the particular night - A. I heard the words, which made me notice it.</p>

            , the prisoner, Willis, also lived with her; I used to chair for her, I know Pettit, and both the Harris's. On the night of the 13th of December, I was at my father's, I went to the Punch Bowl at half-past eleven o'clock, I went to see Edward Willis, Collis opened the door to me; the prisoners Harris, juu., Lupton, Pettit, and Willis, came out together, I asked Willis if he was going home, he said that he was not, and that I should not go home with him; I walked along Broker-row with them into Wilson-street - they were all together; I then asked Willis for two pair of shoes which he had got of mine, he said I might take them in the morning; I had left them in Mrs. Aliff's room, who lodges in Harris's house. He had never refused my going to Harris's house before. The other prisoners were at home at the time. Lupton said that I should go home with her that night. I went and slept at my father's. I left the prisoner at the corner of Horseshoe-alley, Wilson-street, it is the next court to Sashcourt, not twenty yards from it. As we were standing at the corner of Horse-shoe-alley the watchman came up to us; I went away, and saw no more of them that night. I saw them on the Saturday morning at Harris's house, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went to Aliff's room to get my shoes; I saw Lupton the same afternoon in Chiswell-street, she was alone, I met her as I was going to my father's; I told her that I had been to her father's and got my shoes from Aliff's room; I asked her if she was going home, and she said she was going to look for somebody. The prisoner, Willis, came to my father's house on Sunday morning, he told me that Lupton wanted to speak to me; I went with him to Red Lion-market, and found Lupton there, she asked me to go and buy her a second-hand gown-Lupton and Willis went with me, we had some breakfast at a coffee-shop in Barbican; she bought a second-hand gown in Field-lane, and paid for it with two three-shilling pieces, I saw she had got a great deal of money; I then came back to Barbican with her, Willis left us at the coffee-shop, I went home - She said Willis had got the money. On the Sunday afternoon she sent to my father's for me again, and I found her waiting at the top of my father's court for me; she asked me if she might stop at my father's house till nine o'clock, when Willis and Harris would call for her, she waited there, and they called for her at nine o'clock, they had supper-my father was in the room while we were at supper; when he was gone I heard Willis and Harris talking about Wilkinson's robbery, they said they had got 140l. from Mr. Wilkinson's, and if they had had a drag (meaning a cart),<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150044"/>which they had got now, they would have taken the iron chest; they said, they had given 15 guineas for the horse, and 5l. for the cart; I heard them say, that they got into Mr. Wilkinson's house, by the back part of Mr. Harris's house; they said, that they had lost 40l. in changing the notes; they only received 100l. for the 140l., and that they told Pettit, that they got 20l. less than they did, and that they had shared 120l. among Willis and Harris, jun.; I was in the room at supper; they went away together, about eleven o'clock; I saw Lupton one day afterwards at Mrs. Collis's, it was either Monday or Tuesday; I know that Willis and Lupton were very short of money before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was Lupton's chairwoman. I never lived with either of the men; she and Willis cohabited together; they had no money to pay me my wages; on my oath I never cohabited with either of the men; I never quarrelled with Lupton about Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not quarrel with Lupton for taking Willis away with you A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask the man to let you go home with him, when you was living with your father - A. They had said, that I was to go home with them. I never said that I would be revenged on Lupton, for taking my sweet-heart. I heard them talking of the robbery; I did not come here for the reward; I have not seen Johnston, since Lupton lived at New-terrace; I never said that I would be revenged on Harris, if I swore away his life.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have not seen Johnston since the prisoners have been taken up; I have no malice, towards either Lupton or Willis; I do live with a young man; I asked Harris, if I should go home with him, because Lupton had said that I should live with her, and should never leave her. Johnston is a prostitute; I have never been on the town.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. I told Mr. Wilkinson what I had heard about a week after, I did not like to tell him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell of the robbery, when you first heard of it - A. Nobody heard of it but me, Mr. Wilkinson was the first person that I told about it.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coach keeper. I sold a horse and cart for 15l., to Willis, I believe he is the man; It was the Friday before Christmas-day, there was a young man with him; I saw Willis riding it afterwards, and a young woman with him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOUGH. I am a broker, and live in Golden-lane, the prisoner, Willis, took a lodging of me a few days before Christmas-day; Lupton came with him, and remained there; they stopped till Christmas-eve; the prisoner, Harris, used to come and see them. When Willis took the lodging, he said, he had just come from the country, and they were to pay 6s., per week; they staid five days with me; after they left the lodging, I examined my bed, I found it very much broken, and terribly torn, so that any thing might be put into it. When he first came, he had a whip with him, and seemed quite a dasher; I took them without a character.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ARMSTRONG. I am a police officer. I went with Gleed and Turner, to look for the prisoners; I knew them all by sight, and by name, but Pettit. I went to the Punch Bowl, Queen-square, Moorfields, and found the prisoner, Lupton there, we staid a few minutes, and Willis, and Harris, jun., came up; Willis had a whip in his hand; Gleed said, here is Willis, and he, and Turner laid hold of him, and I said, here is Harris; he ran away, I run after him, and told him, that he had better stop, and he did; as soon as I took him, I told him, I took him for Wilkinsons' robbery; I took him to the Punch Bowl; Gleed and Turner had got Willis in the tap-room; in entering to the bar, six or seven men came by me, who I knew to be reputed thieves; the prisoner, Harris said, d-n your eyes, Joseph, I am no thief, leave go, or I will hit away. We found a knife on both of them; I told them, I took them for Wilkinsons' robbery, they immediately said, I am d-d if there is a man in the room; I went out to look for the horse and cart, which was in Moorfields, about one hundred yards off, when I got there, it was gone; I took them to the office; a few days ago, I apprehended Pettit, I had been to his house for him, but he did not come home all night; he came to me, and said, I understand you want me, and I am come to deliver myself up to you, if you have got any thing against me; I told him, that he was concerned in Wilkinsons' robbery, with Harris and Lupton-he said, he knew nothing about it; I told him, that he was at the Punch Bowl with them - He said, he had left them at ten o'clock, and never saw them any more that night.</p>
               <p>BARNARD GLEED. I apprehended Willis; the last witness has spoken correctly.</p>
               <p>HARRIS, JUNIOR'S Defence. I was at the Punch Bowl that night; I left it about ten o'clock, and went to bed.</p>

            . I was commander of the Duke of Wellington, East Indiaman, we arrived in the Docks about the middle of July last. On the 20th of July, we began to discharge our cargo, part of which consisted of bandana silk-handkerchiefs; on the second day, we found a chest of bandanas had been broken open. The 21st was Sunday, and on the 22nd we did not work. There were three or four pieces of bandanas remaining in the chest, which were rather damaged by the sea water.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I received information, which made me examine to see if I lost any thing. I had seen the things safe on the night of the 20th; I cannot say, that I had seen the chest before; I cannot swear that it contained bandanas, it was marked bandanas, and had three or four pieces remaining; I have not the least doubt, but that it contained bandanas.</p>
               <p>EZEKIEL BARTLET. I am an officer of the customs; the Duke of Wellington got into Dock, in the month of July, and commenced her delivery on Saturday the 20th, she did not work on the 21st or 22nd. On Tuesday, the 23rd, I was called into the hold by Mr. Warry, who is foreman to the company; he gave me a piece of bandanas which he had found. Soon after the broken chest of bandanas, was brought on dock; there was one side of it raised sufficient to put your fingers in, it appeared to have been plundered; I immediately sent for the superior officer, who examined it. We found it had been robbed, and had only two pieces of bandanas in it, they were damaged; I found some bags of ginger, and temaric in the chest; these things are not usual to be packed in chests.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The cargo consisted of indigo and other things; the chest was not marked bandanas; they were reported to be bandanas; I do not know what it contained, but from the Company's books, nobody could tell by looking at the outside there were bandanas in it.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JOHN HOWARD re-examined. I have been in the East India Trade ten years, and have never known temaric, or ginger, to be packed with bandanas.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARRY. I am superintendant to the East India Dock Company. On the 23rd of July, I was in the main hatchway of the Duke of Wellington, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found one piece of bandanas loose, it excited my suspicion; I soon after found another piece between decks, I looked further, and found the chest; I had it hoisted upon deck, there was a corner of it loose; I thought it might have been done by accident; I found eight or nine small bags of ginger and termaric in it, and two pieces of damaged bandanas; these things are never packed with bandanas; I believe the chest had been broken open; the cargo consisted of ginger and other things, some of the ginger was loose, and some in bags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I cannot say, whether the chest was broken in her voyage, or at home; the bulk is not broken, till the ship comes into Dock; at sea, the hatchways are barred down, and the crew are turned out of the ship before they are broken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CURTIS. I have known the prisoner, Hatton, twelve years. I have not much knowledge of Murray. On Sunday morning, the 21st of July, Giddons and Hatton came to me; they told me, that they had seen the man belonging to the Docks, who had told them, that there was some bandanas on board the Wellington, which they might easily get at. Hatton then lived at Rotherithe; they saw me at my house, No. 1. Marine Crescent, Bermondsey; I agreed to go with them, on the Sunday evening, to get the handkerchiefs from the Wellington; they told me, that they had got a ladder, which was hid in a potatoe-field, near Bromley Hall-field, which was in the way from the Commercial-road, to Bromley; there is a way from the field, to the East India Docks, by going across the marshes. We went to the field, and took the ladder; Giddons and Hatton were both with me, we got over the wall with the ladder, and then drew it over into the docks, got down the wall on the other side, with the ladder; we then went round to the south-side, where the Wellington lay; we all went into her, and rose the hatchway-bars by a rivet of wood; we went down below, and struck a light; we had a tinderbox and matches with us; we found the wooden case of handkerchiefs, we took them out, and put them in our bags; we cut the cords of the case, and opened it; it was only tied with cords; we easily lifted the head up took out the handkerchiefs, and put them in three bags;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150046"/>we put some gummy bags, and some ginger bags into the case, which were laying in the hold near the case; we brought the handkerchiefs upon deck, replaced the hatch bars, and came to the ladder; Hatton got over first, and carried the bags up, and Giddons lowered them down to him on the other side; we pulled the ladder up, and got down on the other side; we could get across the marshes with the ladder, by laying it across the ditches; we returned the ladder to the potatoe-field; Giddons's wife was at the bottom of Cut-throat-lane, with a cart and horse; we expected to meet her there, it was about a quarter of mile from the Docks. John Gardner, her son, was with her, we put the three bags into the cart; she and her son went across the water, to wait till the cart came round; we three came over London Bridge with the cart, to my house; we found them there; we then lotted the bandanas out into three parcels, they were damaged with, I think, sea-water, there were two hundred and seven pieces in all; we each had sixty-nine pieces; I sold my parcel to a man of the name of Gates. On the Thursday or Friday following, I met Murray at the half-way-house, at the George, Hatton and Giddons were with me at the time; I had never seen Murray before. Hatton gave him 3l., Giddons 3l., and I gave him 4l.; I gave 
               <persName id="t18170115-101-person778">Murray</persName>
             the money myself, nothing was said about what it was for. In the month of September, I saw Murray, at the Green Dragon, at Stepney; I went there, expecting to see him. Giddons and Hatton were both there at the time; there was some conversation about the Wellington-he, Murray, told us, there was a watchman in the Docks now, and that there had been a piece of work, about the robbery of the Duke of Wellington, and that he would let us know, when the watchman was taken off; I gave him 1l. more than the rest, because they had bought the ladder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am in custody now in the House of Correction. I have been a thief for five years. Murray was a stranger to me, before this. Giddons and Hatton, both said, the ladder had been hid in the field. I struck the light and helped to take the things out. Hatton held the bag; it was a coarse wrapper bag that I had; each carried his own bag. I do not think the chest was nailed down. I have been admitted as evidence against Giddons and others.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIDDONS. I have known the prisoner, Murray, six years, he was working in the East India Docks in July last. I have known Hatton ten years, he resided at Black-wall. We met about going to see if there was any watch in the docks. We bought a ladder in Mile-end-road together, it was in July - I do not know the day of the month, it was on a Saturday; we gave 1l. for it; we were to give 1l. 1s., but they trusted us a shilling. I do not know the name of the man whom we bought the ladder of; when we got the ladder at night, we went directly to the docks. Hatton and I went by ourselves, it was on a Saturday night, we did nothing there that night; when we came out we put the ladder in the potatoe-field just by Bromley-hall-field. The next morning I and Hatton went to Curtis's house, and told him, we had been to the East India Docks, and that if he would go, there was two bales of bandanas down the hatchway; Murray had told us that the Wellington was in the Docks, and that it had two bales of bandanas in the main-hatchway; he was a labourer in the Docks. We agreed to go in the evening. We went and got the ladder out of the field about ten o'clock at night. We went through the marshes to the Dock-wall. We got over the ditches by the ladder. When we got to the wall, we laid along the bank till all was quiet. We then got over, pulled the ladder over, and got down on the other side; we went round to the ship,(Murray had told me where she lay). We got some hand-spikes and glutted the hatchway and went down. We found the case of bandanas; took them out and put them into three bags. We filled the case full of ginger bags, put the hatchway back again, and got out of the ship, and over the wall; we put the ladder in the field again, and took the things to Cut-throat-lane, and put them into the cart. My wife and son were waiting there with the cart; I told them to come there. I sent them across the river and drove the cart round. I overtook Hatton in the Commercial-road; we went home together. We took the bandanas to Curtis' house. We had about seventy pieces for each ones's share, they were very much damaged with sea water, some were quite rotten. My wife sold some of them to Walker of Deptford - I took them to him myself. I met Murray again, at the latter end of the month, at the half-way-house, in the Commercial-road-Curtis and Hatton were there; Murray came to be paid for the handkerchiefs we got out of the Dock. Hatton and I gave him 3l. each-Curtis gave him 4l., making 10l. in all; Curtis gave him 4l. because we had bought the ladder. After we had robbed the ship, when we were laying the ladder in the field, the man who belonged to the field, asked us what we were doing to his crop; Curtis was with us at the time. We had put the ladder down and were looking for it, to see if it was safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. When we met on on the Sunday morning, nothing was said about the cart. It was dark when we got into the ship, we had a tinderbox and dark lanthorn. Curtis was my partner in thieving. My wife went with me to sell Walker the handkerchiefs - I did not sell them all to him; my wife received the money.</p>
               <p>Court. When you was before the magistrate, did you have one of those handkerchiefs round your neck - A. I did, it was one that was taken from the ship.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I worked for Mr. Mann, who is a farmer. Last summer I was mowing the weeds out of the potatoe-field and found a ladder; it did not belong to my master. I took it away, and sold it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was it July, as near as you can tell - A. The weeds want cutting down about that time; the road parts our field from Bromley-hall-field.</p>
               <p>MR. MANN. I am a farmer at Bromley. I have a field near Bromley-hall field, the road parts it. In July last, I remember two men coming across my field - I asked them what business they had there. I rather think, that the prisoner, Hatton, was one of them - I think I should know the other if I saw him. I think that is the man,(pointing out Giddons from amongst several more) I think it is his voice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Can you swear to either of them - A. By no means. I only say, that I think they were the men. I rode a great way with them. Giddons spoke very sharply to me, his saying so much, makes me think I should know him better than the other; it was day-light. Giddons has remarkable features.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JOHN HOWARD re-examined. The property was under my care as owner of the ship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The moment the ship enters the Dock, she is reported, and considered under the care of the Dock Company. The officer comes on board before we break bulk; she is considered in the hands of the Dock Company. I am still commander of the ship, but I consider the cargo under the direction of the Company, and myself not responsible.</p>
               <p>JOHN PURTON. I was foreman to the Dock Company. Murray was employed under me the whole of July.</p>
               <p>GILMORE. I am an officer. I produce a handkerchief which I took off Giddons's neck, when he was under examination; it is sea damaged. I went to Walker's and found some handkerchiefs which correspond with the one on Giddons's neck. (I produce them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If the damage had been done by aqua-fortis, they would be yellow.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARDING. I am an officer. I apprehended Murray, at the Docks. I went to his house and found some silk handkerchiefs there - They were not damaged.</p>
               <p>Hatton's Defence. They have committed depredations themselves which I know nothing about.</p>
               <p>Court to GARDNER. How do you get your bread. - A. I sell wood to the shops.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN HOWARD. The things are worth 200l.</p>

             has part of my business - He is not my husband's executor. I have had no fresh agreement with my landlord since my husband's death, it is only an agreement among ourselves. I am a weaver, the prisoner worked for me, and on the 17th of January I lost the articles stated in the indictment out of my bed-room - He worked just by the bed-room, they were safe an hour before; the prisoner left my house a little before seven o'clock in the evening, he had only been at work one hour; there was work for him all day if he had come to do it.</p>
               <p>MARK GRAHAM. I am in business with my mother; my things were taken from the room above where the prisoner worked. I have seen them since at Mr. Sowerby's</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SOWERBY. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Brick-lane. On the 17th of January a coat was pledged at my shop, and on the 18th I took in a counterpane, it was pawned by a woman in the name of Davis; Graham claimed them.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRAHAM. I am the son of Mrs. Graham. On the 17th of January, while my mother was at tea, I let the prisoner in, he went up stairs into the workshop.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Friday, the 20th of January, I stopped the prisoner, at eleven o'clock in the morning, in White Horse-lane, Mile-end, he had a bag with him; I told him that I was an officer, and asked him what was in the bag; he said, he was my prisoner, and surrendered. The bag contained the skirt of a gown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150049"/>one cloak, one sheet, and two pair of pantaloons, Mr. and Mrs. Graham afterwards claimed them. He said that he had stolen them, and begged me to let him go. I found the duplicate of a coat, pledged on the 17th of January at Sowerby's, on him, I went there and found the coat.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

On the 20th of January I fastened the house myself, my family consists of my wife, two children, and a maid servant; I went to bed at eleven o'clock, the house was broken open between four and five o'clock in the morning, the cellar shutter was forced and broken in two pieces-it is a flap outside the door. The watchman alarmed us between four and five o'clock, I got up, came down, and found the shutters broken, and the prisoner in the cellar, laying on the coals, I told the watchman that he was there, and he took him into custody; I asked him how he came there, he said that he was a poor man out of work, a cabinet-maker by trade, and that he only came down into the cellar for a night's lodging. I asked him how he came to break the door? he said that he did not know that he had done any harm. I took him to the watchhouse, and gave him in charge to the constable. On our return we searched the cellar, and found a chisel, nothing else; we found a brad-all on him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARROW. I am a watchman of Stepney parish; I was passing the house about three o'clock, on morning of the 20th of January, and observed a little piece of the door broken, but it was fast then; I came round again at four o'clock, and found it broken open - I alarmed Mr. Gillham; he came down into the cellar. I had called out to him at the window, that his flap was broken open, and asked him if he knew it. He told me to wait till he came down. I never saw the prisoner about; I only call the hours, we do not call the half-hours, but we keep walking round-mine is a long beat. I did not see any body break it open, I found the man in the cellar; the chisel was found underneath the prisoner, where he was laying. The door was split open, The door which leads from the cellar had a mark in it which fitted the chisel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say at the office, that you found the door partly broken - A. I found a little nob off - I say so now.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GILLHAM. The door which leads from the cellar was locked. I compared the chisel with the mark, it appeared as if an attempt had been made to break it open.</p>
               <p>JOHN SURIER. I am the constable of the night. Gillham brought the prisoner into the watch-house at a little before five o'clock. I took him in charge, searched him, and found a brad-all on him and a key.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is the key of my lodgings. I was shut out of my lodgings. The flap appeared to be loose and I opened it, and went to sleep there for the night. GUILTY. - <rs id="t18170115-107-punish565" type="punishmentDescription">

            . I am a cabinet-maker. I found the till (producing it,) at the back of the chapel. I kicked against it as I was going down Corbett's-court. I asked the last witness whose it was, and he gave me a description of the prisoner, and told me his name and his dress, and said that he had been lurking about the door for some time. When I took the prisoner his companion ran away. I found them at the sign of the City of Canterbury, in Mile-end. Ward swore to his being the person he had seen go into the court.</p>
               <p>WARD re-examined. I believe he is the man - I did not tell his name.</p>
               <p>TRUEWILLIAM re-examined. He told me that he was the man, and that he went by the name of Smouchey, and I found him by that name. He said that he had seen him skulking about the door, about a quarter of an hour before he brought the till up the court. He said, that he knew the prisoner, that he ran down the court with the till under his arm. He said, that he had blue pantaloons and a blue coat on, and ragged shoes; and that his name was Smouchey. I took Ward to the watch-house the next morning, and shewed the prisoner to him, and he said he was the same person, and began crying.</p>
               <p>WARD re-examined. Did you see the prisoner that night, or not - A. I did, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you had seen him walking backwards and forwards several times - A. Yes, I said that I saw him go down the court; I said he had something under his arm, either a box or a till, and that he had blue pantaloons on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, you did not know what was under his arm - A. I told his name.</p>

On my return home my servant let me in, I fastened the door myself, I fastened the private door, the shop street - door was fastened before I went out, but the door which leads out of the passage into the shop was not fast. My apprentice sleeps in the shop, I sleep in the two pair of stairs front room. On going up stairs. I found the windows shut and the shutters fastened, the one pair of stairs back window was shut down when I went out at half-past eleven o'clock, but I do not know whether the shutters were shut or not. I went to bed and was called up about eight o'clock the next morning, and told that I had been robbed. I went into the shop and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment, some of them were from my pledge stock and some from my sale stock. I published a bill from Bow-street and sent it round to the trades-people. I saw my property in the custody of Foy and Jeffries at Malborough-street, on Monday last, I knew it to be mine, it was in my possession the night I left the shop. On looking at my house the next morning, I found an entry had been made through the one pair of stairs back window, there was a pane of glass broke in the window - I believe it was shut down when I first saw it; a pane of glass was also broken in my back parlour, and an attempt made to force the shutters. The sash fastening had been pressed against the shutters, which made an impression<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150051"/>that had not been there before; the outside of the window appeared as if a lighted candle had been put on the frame which had burnt it, there was also a match on the window frame.

            . I am Mr. Hall's apprentice, and live in his house, I slept in the shop. On the 24th of December, I went to bed at a little before two o'clock; I awoke about a quarter before six o'clock, and seeing a light, I rose up in my bed and looked forward, but saw nothing at first, I looked in the front and saw a candle and the crown of a hat on a level with the counter, there was a quantity of jewelery and watches near the counter, it was the sale stock; the pledges were neariy level with the side of my bed, in some drawers, there was two doors before them, the drawers contained jewelery, &amp;c., there was spoons in both stocks. I turned a little more round and stretched a little more out of bed, and saw a man, who I at first thought was Mr. Hall, I said to him, 'Ah, who is that?' the man made no answer but turned round, and I thought put the candle out, I could not see it any more, I heard no more at that moment, but in a minute or two, I heard one step and the sash-window slide along, it is made to slide along, and the jewelery is behind it, it is the glass-window or case which incloses the things, I heard it slide back; soon after I heard the things tingle and something drop, which proved afterwards to be a miniature, I heard paper rustle at different parts of the shop, some of the pledged stock was inclosed in papers, I said nothing more, I did not cry out; I heard a man's shoes creak as if he was going out of the shop into the parlour, just as it was getting light I heard the private street door go, it leads into Paradise-street, all this from first to last might be about one hour and a quarter, it was just beginning to get light when I heard the door swing. In the morning I found some papers about the shop. My master got up about an hour afterwards. Soon after they went I rose up and thought I heard a noise among the boxes, I was alarmed and remained in bed for some time, I suspected it was thieves; I only saw one man. I found a miniature and a snuff-box on the floor, and some other things on the counter, there was also some duplicates which had been pinned on pledges, they were thrown about the shop.</p>

I saw the prisoner, Macmahon, go down the area steps of Mr. Cooke's house, and returned in about three minutes, with a bundle before him; he came up, and gave it to Chadaway; I pursued them into the New-road, and from thence into Northumberland-street, calling stop thief.

On the 16th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I sent my son into the garden to get some water, it was dark; he called out shut the door, for here is a man; my wife bolted the door; I heard my son outside, begging for his life; I went to the back-door; I heard a man halloo to open the door; he fired a gun, which made a hole through the door; I heard somebody say, go it while your blood is warm; I told my wife, that we should all be murdered; I heard two or three voices outside. My wife then cried out murder; our house stands by itself, there is not another within half a mile of it; they fired a blunderbuss at the window, which knocked the casement right out; I saw one man at the window, he fired a pistol at me, the ball grazed my arm; I ran into the bed-room, which is on the ground floor, and pushed against the door to prevent them firing in, it was wrenched off its hinges with an iron crow, the bed-room door is inside, they must have been in the house to do it; there was one man with a blunderbuss, and another with an iron crow in the front room; I had the poker in my hand; they told me, if I did not give it up, they would blow my brains out; my wife had put our child out of the window, to run for assistance; they were going to tie my hands, but there was an alarm out of doors; I sprung out, the man called out shoot, but they did not fire; I saw my daughter at the top of the field, by the light of the moon; the men had gone out; they did not take any thing with them; the prisoner is the man that shot at me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150052"/>with the pistol; I saw his features as plain as could be, I am positive of it; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I work for Mr. Franklin. I was afraid to live in the neighbourhood after this occurred, I have lived at Wilsdon; I saw three men, I struck the prisoner with a poker, when he put the pistol in at the window; I did not complain to the magistrate, at Wilsdon; two persons came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the magistrate, did you not complain of an assault - A. I was not used to the business. I told the magistrate how I was served, and he issued out a warrant; the shots made a hole in the door, Foy saw it; when I saw my son, his hands were tied, the prisoner was taken up two days after; we found two balls had lodged in a basket of clothes; I saw the prisoner in Queen-square, he was paving. I pointed him out myself.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARTON. I am the son. On the night of the 16th of December, between seven and eight o'clock, my father sent me out for some water, the pond is about twenty yards from the house; my mother takes in washing. When I got out, the prisoner rushed up to me with a blunderbuss, and said, if you do not open the door, I will shoot you, he presented the blunderbuss at me; I am sure he is the man; it was quite moon-light; he was the only man that I saw then. I called out for my mother to fasten the door; two more men then came up, and spoke in Irish; the prisoner said to them, if they do not open the door, let us shoot him; the prisoner told me to open the door, or he would blow my brains out; I told him it was fast; the prisoner snapped the blunderbuss at me twice, but it did not go off; he then hit me with the but end of it, over my head, I was insensible for some time, when I recovered, I found my hands and legs were tied, and 1s. 41/2d. had been taken out of my pocket. I am positive that the prisoner is one of the men. When they went into the house, they untied my legs and brought me in, but kept my hands bound; they forced the bed room door open with a crow, my mother and father were there; somebody whistled, and they left the house, the neighbours then came to our assistance; I went to the justice the next morning, with my father. I was with my father, when the prisoner was taken in Queen-square, we were both sure of his being the man, and knew him the instant we saw him, it was a very light night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I saw the prisoner in Queen-square first, the officer was with us. I did not see my sister come in; I do not know who tied my hands; they began to tie my father's hands; the prisoner struck me with the blunderbuss, and he knocked my eye (here the witness shewed to the Jury a scar over his eye), which still remains. We went to Queen-square, to look for the prisoner, we did not see him the first time. Howard went with us before, he said, that he knew another man who he suspected; I knew nothing about any reward.</p>

            . At the time that this happened, I lived at Wilsdon. I never was with Barton at Hampstead when I heard of the attack, on the next day, I went with Barton to look after a man, whom he suspected, he was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I went to look for another man, whom he suspected. I had seen that man in Queen-square; I left Wilsdon to lodge with Barton. I know nothing about a reward.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Barton's house - A. Yes, the bedroom door was broken down, and the wash-house doorappeared to me to have been shot through; I saw Barton's arm, it had bled.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MACINTOSH. I am an officer, of Marlborough-street. I went to Queen-square with an assault warrant, to apprehend the prisoner; I do not know, what name was in the warrant; I come here at the desire of the prisoner's solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner's name in the warrant or not - A. It was, he answered to the name that was in it; I found him in Queen-square, Barton and his son was with me at the time, and pointed him out to me; he surrendered himself quietly; the magistrate admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>FOY. Barton, and his Son, came to Mr. Baker's office; he said, that six or eight persons had surrounded his house, and had endeavoured to assassinate them; he said, one of them had tied his son's hands and legs, and at last the person went away. I was sent to examine the house, and found it had been injured in several parts, the windows broken in, and one of the doors were forced off the hinges, another door had a hole in it, but it did not appear to have been done with a shot. Barton did not appear to be hurt.</p>
               <p>Jury. What was your opinion of the house - A. I reported it to Mr. Baker, the magistrate, that I thought it was a fabrication, I did not find the bullet - They gave me some bullets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent of the charge, which I will prove. I shall prove that I was not there, I was at a public-house in Berwick-street, Soho, on the night until eleven o'clock. I was apprehended for an assault, and the magistrate admitted me to bail; I attended at Hicks's-hall, and to my surprise, I found an indictment against me for a capital charge; I have now surrendered to take my trial.</p>

            . I keep the Black Lion public-house, in Berwick-street, Soho. On the night of the 6th of December last, the prisoner was at my house from six to eleven o'clock in the evening, another man was with him; he was not out of the house five minutes all the time.</p>
               <p>Court. What makes you remember the particular night - A. It was four nights from the 2d of December, when the riots were, he was at my house five nights running from that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember six nights from that time - A. I thought it strange he should be so constant, he was not in the habit of doing so; he has used my house for one year. I am sure he was there on that day; I told the magistrate so within eight days after, the reason that I remember his being at my house on that night, was, he ran 2s. 6d. in credit, and has not yet paid me, the other man had used my house for six months; I have known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150053"/>prisoner fifteen months, his 2s. 6d. is still on my slate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NUGENT. I am in Mr. Howard's employ. I was with the prisoner on the 6th of December, at Baraclough's, from a little after five to eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that it was on the 6th of December - A. It was the day of the riots at Spa-fields, that is the day I mean to speak of, it was the very same day, I mean to speak of no other day, than the day of the riots; we do not owe the landlord any thing, we paid for what we had.</p>
               <p>ANN COCHRANE. I am servant to Mr. Baraclough; he has kept the Black Lion for eight or nine weeks. I lived there before he came, the prisoner frequented the house; I saw him there on the night of the riots, that is the day that I come to speak about, Nugent was with him, they staid till eleven o'clock, they paid for every thing they had.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you desired to come here - A. Yesterday; I was told the riots were on the 6th of December, I heard Nugent say so. I am sure that the day I am come to speak of, was the day of the riots, for I went to the door and saw the people shutting up, and they said it was because of the riots. I have not seen the prisoner at our house since the riots; the prisoner was not a customer at our house before Baraclough came, which is eight or nine weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Jury to BARTON, jun. What kind of buttons were on the man's coat - A. I did not notice.</p>

I said I would, he took me to the corner of Long-Acre, and said he was going to take them into a house; I saw the house would not be a proper place for me to go into, and said I would wait outside, and he promised to return in a few minutes, I gave him the veils in Wild-street, I waited near an hour without seeing him, I went to the house in Wild-street, and found his sisters there, who told me where I was likely to find him, a person took me to Phoenix-alley, I waited there for him, but he did not come, and I went home. He had come out of that house and went in again, but I did not know him as he had changed his dress.

            , senior. I am the husband of the last witness. The rabbits were left at my house on the 7th of January. The prisoner, Bridgen, came and another with him, and wanted 12s. for them. I found a silver-grey doe among them, which I knew had been mine. I told them that I had sold it, but they said they had bred it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150054"/>themselves; they said that they lived at Purim-place, Dog-row, and that the rabbits were there own, and that I might go home with them to see the hutches, if I would buy them. I gave them 8s. and told them I would pay them the rest when they brought the hutches. I sent my son to look at the hutches, when he came back I looked more distinctly at the rabbits in consequence of what he said, and remembered selling the silver doe to Mr. Bloom. I shewed them all to him and he claimed them.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BAXTER, jun. My father sent me with Bridgen, and another boy, to look at the hutches, when we got to Church-street, they said they would not sell them, as they were going to keep more rabbits; and they sent me back again.</p>

            . I set up at Mr. Bloom's to watch the premises; I saw Bridgen come from the premises with another boy, they had forced the back gate open; it was about half-past one o'clock in the morning. I apprehended him, and found a chisel, a phosphorus-box, and matches on him, while I was taking him before the magistrate, he said that there were six of the party, and gave me their names, he said that two were on the look out and four went in, and that he had taken the rabbits. I afterwards took Ross, Gibbons.</p>

               <p>"Will you let me be taken in this way?" one of them said to me, let him go, it was not him; I knew that man to be a bad character. I took the prisoner with much difficulty and gave him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. My attention was directed to the fire, I had about twenty-five round me, my back was against the wall; I did not observe the prisoner till I took hold of his hand, the watch fell immediately I took hold of his arms, it fell at his feet; he stood next to me.</p>
               <p>Court. From the position in which the arm was when you seized it, could there be any other arm to convey away the property, but the one you seized - A. I have not the least doubt of it, the hand was directly before my fob.</p>

               <p>JOHM COLLINS. I live opposite to Clapp. I was at my window, I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and come out again with something under his arm; I told Clapp and he went after him. I am sure the prisoner is the boy, that I saw go into the shop, he waited at the door before he went in talking to some boys, one of the boys went and pointed his finger at the shop window when the prisoner was in.</p>

I was at ten in my parlour, which looks into my shop, I saw a broom move that stood inside the door, I went into the shop and found it was gone; I went to the door, and saw two persons walking on my right hand - I followed them, Westley was one of them - He was about twenty yards from the door; I heard the broom fall, and a man said, Westley, what have you done with the broom? I laid hold of Westley, and picked the broom up by the Olympic Theatre: I did not see them with it. The man went away, and Westley denied taking it; I told him I should take him to Bow-street, but he wanted me to take him to his father's. Fry was taken up afterwards. The prisoner, Fry, came to my shop that evening, and said that Westley was his brother; I thought he was the person whom I had seen with the boy, when he said he was not, but he had heard the boy was taken. Westley said that he had stolen the broom by the direction of a man, I believe Fry to be the man, he was dressed like him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CLARKE. On the 7th of December, I went out to look for Westley by his father's desire, he was brought to the watch-house for stealing the broom. I went to look after the man, I found him and took him before the magistrate; I told him that I took him for stealing the broom, and he said it was a very pretty business.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FROUD. I am a shoemaker; I was standing in my shop, in Chesterfield-street, and saw the prisoner go by my window, he had the prints under his arm; he went about two steps and turned back, my passage door was open, he went into the passage, and was there about ten minutes. I did not go to look for him, as I thought he was going to take the things up stairs to a woman who lives in my house. One of my lodgers asked if the prints were for sale; I got up and saw the prisoner tying the prints up in bundles in my passage; he offered one of my lodgers one piece of print if she would give him a handkerchief to tie them up in, she said she had not got one; he pushed the door to, the constable came to the door, and asked for the prisoner. He told one of my lodgers that he had had a dreadful fall, and that they must not be alarmed at his coming in - I heard him. The constable took him.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Stamford-hill; I had called the hour of one, and the prisoner ran passed my box after two pigs; I called to him, saying, you have got some wild pigs there - He said he was almost dead; I said, you seem to run well after the pigs. He drove them back again, and they ran to Mr. Bailey's house; I assisted him with them. He ran down after the pigs, and I stopped at the end to prevent them going the wrong way; he said, that he wanted to take them to town; he was gone a long time, I went down the lane to meet him, and saw him come out of Mr. Bailey's yard with them; we came up the lane, and I asked him if he had got his complement - He said, yes. I said, how many is there? he said, thirteen, and thanked me for my trouble in assisting him. I walked a little way with him. I returned to my box, and found two pigs left behind; I called after him to tell him, and he said he did not mind two pigs, that there were two more men coming behind with another drove, and they would pick them up, that made me think he had stolen them. I went to the lane where the pigs came from, and found Mr. Bailey's gate open, I went into the yard, his pigs were gone, I then alarmed Mr. Bailey. and he sent me after him; when I got to Kingsland turnpike gate, which is two miles and a half from Mr. Bailey's, he had a stick in his hand, I got the other watchman to assist, and we secured him. I am sure the prisoner is the man; he had got twelve pigs when we secured him.</p>

I am a watchman of Kingsland-road; about a quarter after two o'clock in the morning of the 30th of December, Neave came and asked me if I had seen any pigs go by; I went with him to look after the man, as I had seen some go by, we took the prisoner just by Shoreditch church; he asked me the way to the City-road, and I told him he must go with me on suspicion of stealing the pigs-he had three sows and nine store pigs with him; he said, he had not stolen them. I took him to the watch-house, and left the pigs at the White Hart.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ, the pistols were in the shop where the prisoner slept, for him to guard the house; I had been ill for some months, and the first time that I came into the shop I missed them, and asked him for them - He said, he could not find them, and wondered where they were gone to, he said, he had not seen them for some months, I asked him if he suspected any man of taking them, and he said, he suspected a man, named Payne. I saw the pistols at Hatton Garden, on the 9th of December; I had an officer on the 9th of December at my house, and he found the duplicate of the pistols on the prisoner, and he said, they were the pistols that he had stolen from me.</p>

I went to bed about half past eight o'clock; I looked over my notes, and they were all safe then; I rolled three 1l. notes upon the outside of the rest to buy some cloaths with, and put them all into my wife's pocket, which I put under my head in the bed where we both slept, the prisoner slept in the same room; he went to bed about a quarter of an hour after, and, by my desire, put out the candle. About two o'clock in the morning my wife awoke me, and asked for her pockets, to get some snuff, I told her they were under my head - We could not find them; I went down and got a light, and as soon as I came up, I found them laying by the prisoner's bed side; he was not in bed, I asked the man who slept with him, where he was, and he asked, what I wanted of him; I blamed him for robbing me of 36l. and 60l.; I awoke three more men (there were nine men quartered in the room), and looked about; I told the Colonel of it the next morning, and went to Queen-square; the prisoner was absent. I got a constable to accompany me to Isleworth, to look for the prisoner; I met a man who had been with him, and he went with me, and we found him in prison at Hammersmith, he had been taken before we arrived, nothing was found on him. His brother brought 13l. 18s. 6d. which the prisoner owned to be mine; the three 1l. notes were among it, and my name was on them; he had laid out 8l. in clothes, and bought a watch for 4l. 10s. and had been to several public-houses, and changed notes at them.

I told him, he had better buy himself some clothes, and he went with me and bought two coats, two shirts, two waistcoats, one pair of pantaloons, one pair of overalls, three pair of stockings, two pair of shoes, three handkerchiefs, and a hat, which came to 8l. 14s.; he gave me 3s. to go with him to take his money to his mother at Isleworth; he got into the Reading coach, and rode to Isleworth. When I gave him up to his sister, he counted his money there, and said he had got 17l. in 1l. and 2l. notes, and part of the change of four 1l. notes; as I was going home I met Shorter, and told him where to find the prisoner.

About the 29th November, I went up to my bed-room and found my box empty, and missed several things from my drawers, the next day the prisoner came as usual, and I asked her if she knew of my loss, she said she knew nothing of it, about half an hour after she said she had robbed me, I said I thought it was her, she said if I would go to her lodgings she would tell me all about it. I went up with my husband, and she gave us the duplicates and said she would tell me the rest on Monday. She said the duplicates were for the only things that she had taken, she went away. Her husband gave me the duplicate of a pair of trowsers.</p>

            . I learned from my wife, that I had been robbed, I asked the prisoner about it on the 30th of November, she denied it for some time; I told her I would have her lodgings searched, and desired my wife to detain her. As I was going out of my door she said, do not go, if you and mistress will come to my room, I will tell you where the things are. She said she had robbed us, and gave me nine duplicates, saying, she hoped I would be merciful and let her come and finish her work that day, and she would let me know where the remainder of the things were; my wife gave her leave, and in the afternoon she said, there was a place in Bishopsgate-street, where she had pledged several things without tickets, she said she had been to the place and that they were so busy they could not attend to her, and that she was to go again on the Monday and she would get them. I expected to see her on the Monday morning, but we found she had ran away. We went round to the pawnbrokers, and found the things to be our property, and told the officer to look for her.</p>

            . I am a smith; I was at the Bull's Head, in Kingsland-road; about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner, Taylor, came into the house with a pair of boots, he asked me if I knew any body that would buy them; I told him I would go and see; I took them out of his hand, and went to Saunders's-gardens, which is close to the house, and offered them to Gadsden for 12s., he offered me 10s. for them; I went to Taylor, and he said I might let him have them - I did, and gave the money to Taylor, and he gave me a shilling for my trouble; he told me if Blake should come in, and ask what I sold them for, to say six shillings. In about a quarter of an hour Blake came in, and said, if he had been there at the time they should not have been sold for that money. I was quartered at the Bull's Head.</p>

            . On the 17th of December, Mr. Burton applied to me, I and my son, accompanied him to the Bull's Head, in Kingsland-road, and found Ingram and Baker sitting there together, we took them. I left Ingram in Burton's care, and took Taylor, who was there. I took Ingram to Gadsden's house, and he gave me the boots; we took the three to the office, and I heard both Taylor and Baker say, it was the first thing they had ever done, and that it was through distress.</p>

On the 21st of December, I went down stairs to tea with my mother; I shut my door after me, but did not lock if; when I went into my mother's room the prisoner was there and my mother too, before we began tea, the prisoner made an excuse to go out to fasten my mother's shutters - He came in again in about a quarter of an hour. He was not out after My mother's clock stopped, and I said I would go up and look at my watch; as soon as the prisoner heard that, he went out, and did not return until the officer brought him the same evening, very late. I missed my watch out of my room, it hung up over my bureau. I went round to stop the pawnbrokers from taking it in, if it should be brought, and Mr. Matthews stopped it.</p>

             sent me some beef to sell-there were two lots of beef; I sold one lot, and had another left, which I put out for sale on Saturday morning, the pigs laid over it. A person came to me, and asked if I had sold the beef; he had made me an offer for it the day before. When I went to look for it I found it was gone, there was only one piece left; the rump, loin, veiny-piece and flank were gone; between one and two o'clock the officer came, and told me he had taken the five prisoners, with the beef, I went to the office to see it-it was mine, and would complete the lot.</p>
               <p>JOHN PELIS. I am a butcher, and live at East Smithfield; I sent Messrs. Terry two lots of beef to sell for me; the next morning I heard that three pieces out of the lot were stolen; I went before the magistrate, and saw the three pieces of beef; I am sure they were mine, I cut them myself.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITH. I am an officer. On Saturday morning, the 4th of January, about ten o'clock, I received information that there was a quantity of beef taken into a chandler's-shop, No. 91, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; I went there, with Freeman, we went up to the two pair of stairs front room, and found the five prisoners in the room, before the fire; Freeman kept the door while I searched. I found the beef covered over, between the prisoners, James and Edwards's bedsteads - They said they were their beds, there were a great many beds in the room; it was a dirty wet morning; the two prisoners, James and Edwards, were very dirty, the other prisoners did not appear to have been out; we took them to the office, and when we got there, James said, that he and Edwards had stolen it.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FREEMAN, I confirm the statement of the last witness, the beef weighed seventy-eight pounds.</p>

               <p>JOHN SMITHIES. I am the son of the last witness. On the 20th of December I missed the lead off the roof of my father's engine-house, I saw the two prisoners cutting it away, and told Mr. Simmonds; I returned to the premises, and found the mill-house door broken open, and a rope tied to a beam, which would enable them to get to the roof of the engine-house. Simmonds went into Bunhillfields burial-ground to prevent them escaping; I got on the roof, and secured Heney, on the first floor of the mill-house, I asked him where the other man was, he said there was nobody with him; I gave him to a man and went to look for the other; I saw him jump out of a window, twenty-five feet high, into the burial-ground-Simmonds secured him. The lead was on the roof but removed from its proper place, and had been recently cut. Bryan said, he had not been on the premises. I found an axe and a sack on the roof, on the 17th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. It was not quite dark. I am sure the prisoners are the men, I saw them cutting the lead, I was on the watch.</p>
               <p>VALENTINE SIMMONDS. I am a plasterer; I went into the burial-ground, on the 20th of December, I heard the window thrown up, and a man dropped into the ground and ran off, I secured him.</p>

            , the prisoner, Betterton, was in our employ, at a salary of 90l. per annum, and had lived seven years with us, we live in the Old Jewry. On the 17th of January I took out a search-warrant, he lived in the City-gardens, City-road. Armstrong and Gleed went to his house with me, to execute it. Armstrong went in first, and laid hold of the prisoner, Frost, he ran away directly he saw us; Armstrong brought him back into the kitchen - He had a parcel in his hand, which he put on the table; Armstrong asked what it was, he said it was his own clothes. Armstrong produced his warrant for silk goods, and asked if it contained any thing of that sort; after some hesitation, he acknowledged that it contained some of the articles which had been read to him; it was opened, and contained the articles enumerated in the indictment - I knew them to be mine; we had not sold him any of them, they are worth 40l. Frost said that he bought them of his brother Betterton, and produced a paper in Betterton's hand-writing, which, he said, was a bill; some of the articles are much lower, and others rather higher, than they would be sold for. We went up and found Betterton in his bed-room, I told him what I came for, and that Frost said he had the goods of him - He did not deny it. He afterwards requested to speak to me, and said, he hoped we should be lenient with him. I told him it depended on my partners.</p>

            . I am servant in the house where Mr. Digby lodges. Thompson delivered the coat to me, and I put it in the one pair of stairs room, it is a private house, and we have no other lodgers. The area gate is left open in the day-time. The coat was missed on the 5th of December, I saw it again at the office on the 12th. I am sure that it is the coat that Thompson gave me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AMES. I am Mr. Perry's errand-boy. I brushed the coat and tied it up in the handkerchief. I saw it again at the Police-office, and I am sure it is the coat I gave Thompson for Mr. Digby, it is worth 2l.</p>
               <p>HYAM HYAMS. I live in Dean-street, Westminster, and am a dealer in old clothes. The prisoner brought the coat to me on the 4th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, she wanted 1l. 10s. for it, thinking it worth much more, I asked her how she came by it; she gave me two or three different accounts, and I told her I suspected it was not her own, she said if I went home with her, she would convince me of it; she took me to Duck-lane. I offered her 1l. for it, and she said she would take it, I told her to send to my house for the money. I went for Pace, the officer, and told him, and he took her into custody as she was coming to my house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PACE. Hyams came to me, and I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Dean-street, she was standing at the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I deal in clothes, and bought it of a man at the corner of Burton-street, for 1l. 5s.</p>

Rudd came to the house, she said he was her brother-in-law; I supposed him and Murrell to be man and wife. They all came to the lodgings on the 30th of December, in the evening, I objected to taking three of them, King was to go away and Murrell and Rudd to live there, and King was to come in the day-time to assist her sister, they left on the 14th, at seven o'clock in the evening. King passed my door with a bundle, I followed her, and said, I suspected it was some of my property; she said, it was nothing but her own dirty linen; she said she had not robbed me, and objected to go back to my house; while I was talking to her, Rudd and Murrell passed us; she said, she wanted to go to speak to them, and I said, I would go with her; she took me to the back of the house, just by St. Agnes-le-Clare; she then got out of my hands, and dropped the bundle and a small basket, which Murrell had given her, and ran away; I picked them up, but could not overtake her. I found the bundle contained two feather pillows, which were mine; I went into their room and found the bed stripped, and the things stated in the indictment gone; I have seen all of them since, except the looking glass.</p>

I had a three shilling piece in my pocket when I met her, and two guineas, and a half-guinea, and a seven shilling piece in my purse. I gave her the three shilling piece, and she went out to fetch some refreshment. I fell asleep while she was gone, and when she came back I awoke, I fell asleep again almost immediately. I had put my watch under my pillow. I awoke in the middle of the night, and found myself alone, and my watch gone, and my pocket-book right; I felt my purse and found something in it, which I thought was my gold. When day-light came, I searched again for my watch, but could not find it. I went next door to the master of the house, who said, she had not lodged there before that night. She had left one shilling in the room, which he took for the rent - I went away; and when I got to the top of the court, I found two or three Roman coins in my purse instead of my guiueas. I described the prisoner to the constable and he took her. I found the watch in pawn in the name of Corn; I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Shorediteh. On the 20th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was going up the City-road; I met the two prisoners, each of them had a bundle under his arm, they saw me, and threw the bundle down and run away; I called for assistance, and pursued them until they were taken; one of them threw a dark lanthorn out of his pocket, and there was a bundle of matches picked up; I took Mayo to the watch-house, and took a turn-screw from his pocket, his other pocket was turned inside out, as if he had shook the lanthorn out of it; I found the bundles to be two blankets and a looking-glass. Abery broke out of the watch-house the same day; I took him again on the 24th. I am sure they are the men that I saw with the bundles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Mayo was let at large becaute the other could not be found.</p>
               <p>JAMES CORCORAN. I am a headborough. On the 20th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, my brother officer gave me the signal, I saw the prisoner running; I picked up the property, and found an iron crowbar near to where the property laid, I am sure they are the men.</p>

            . I am a cork merchant. On the 17th of January, I sold the prosecutor thirteen bundles of cork, it was put in my warehouse, some of it being stolen, I sent for the prisoner, Robinson, I afterwards saw him burning cork behind the London Hospital, another man was with him; I told him, it was the cork that I had lost, and asked him where he got it, and who he bought it from; he said he bought it of me; and after some hesitation, he said, it was the cork of the Francis ship; I said, it was the Eliza cork, it was a different sort from the Francis, and that he only bought two bundles of the Francis; he said, he had three bundles of the Francis, and this was the best of it; I told him, I could not believe but it was my cork, and I found a piece, and told him, it could not be the Francis's cork; they still persisted in burning it, and the other man said, it was a piece which he had cut a fortnight ago; I said, it was the Eliza cork, and that it was fresh cut. Robinson advised me to let the matter rest for a few days, and I should be more likely to find it out. I described the cork to my son, and told him to go and search all round to the cork-cutters; they were burning it near Prettie's house. I went to Prettie's house with the last witness about half an hour afterwards, and we found about four hundred weight of cork, laying in a shed there. I saw Pettie coming from his own house with a bag full of the cork, which he put into the shed; I asked him where he got it, and told him that it was taken out of my warehouse; he said, if I would come down into the kitchen, he would shew me the remainder, and tell me all about it; I went with him, he shewed me the cork, and told me, that Robinson had brought it to him about seven o'clock in the morning; he said, he brought seven bundles in a cart, about seven o'clock in the morning; he said, he did not know that it was stolen, I asked him, why he was getting it out of his house; he said, because Robinson had been back within the last half hour, and told him it was stolen, and to get it away; he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Cork is a difficult article to indentify in general. I bought the whole cargo of the Eliza; I have sold cork to Robinson; I did not sell him any of the Eliza cork.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALPOLE. Prettie said, he had it from Robinson; the shed was a great way from his house.</p>

I went on and took no notice, when Barker came up and offered to fight me, I had said nothing to them, I refused; Price jumped up and took off my hat, I took it from him, and went into Holborn-court; when I was in the middle of the court the same boys came up to me again, and took off my hat, they ran by and threw a hat away; I picked it up, thinking it was mine, but it was not. I pursued them and called out, stop thief! the two prisoners ran towards Bellingham-buildings. I followed them, they parted, and I collared Knight, he said he had not got the hat, but the other boy had, pointing to Price. Barker came up, and said he could show me where the hat was, and took me to Holborn-court; as I was going along Knight attempted to put his hand into my pocket, I turned round, and he ran away. Barker looked down Holborn-court, and said the hat was not there. I afterwards went with Barker to Air-street-hill; he said Knight lived there-he was not at home, Barker then ran off. I gave information at the Police-Office, and the two prisoners were taken into custody the next night. I am sure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150070"/>the two prisoners were with the other boys when I lost my hat.</p>

I did not see the prisoner near me. I knew the book to be mine. It was in the kennell at Southampton-buildings.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOHPSON. I am a constable. On the 3d of January, I was in Holborn, just by Middle-row, I saw the prosecutor walking along, and the prisoner, with two others, behind him, the prisoner attempted his pocket twice, without success; he put his finger into his pocket; the two other men were close behind, apparently covering him from view. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take something out - He put it under his great coat. I told the prosecutor, and took hold of the prisoner and another of the men; I was the pocket-book fall from the prisoner into the kennell. The other man made his escape, and left his hat in my hand. Mr. Simpson claimed the book; it contained two 1l. notes and some papers.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Q.by Prisoner. Did you not lay hold of another man before me - A. I took both together.</p>

The prosecutor laid hold of her, and said, she was the woman; he said he had lost 20s., and a 6d. marked with a figure of 3, which he could swear to. I searched her, and found a 6d. on her, and 7s.; he knew the sixpence when he saw it. He was quite sober, (I produce it).</p>

The prisoner took a lodging at my house, on the 10th of September, he came about half-past nine o'clock at night. The next morning he got up at five o'clock and went out, he did not return; I heard him about the room, and locked the door; I let him out myself, he had nothing in his hands, but he appeared very bulky about his person; I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the room which he slept in. I met him on the 16th of January, and gave the alarm, and he was taken. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>ABEL BURCHALL. I live with Messrs. Trueman and Co., brewers. On the 7th of December, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the two prisoners at a public-house, in <placeName id="t18170115-183-crimeloc1002">Brick-lane</placeName>

She drank my beer without my leave. The other prisoner was in the room. My money was in my left hand breeches pocket. I had sixteen shillings and a three shilling bank token. I saw her hand come from my pocket, and she ran out of the box; I ran out and took hold of her. Crew came up, and took the money out of her hand, before I could lay hold of it, she ran into the tap-room, and gave it to somebody else. I brought the prisoner, Roberts, into the house, and gave her into custody. Crew was also searched, but nothing found on her. The prisoners appeared to be acquainted with several in the room. My pocket was drawn out.</p>

On the 26th of December, I went into a public-house, in Church-street, St. Giles's, at ten o'clock at night, to enquire for a person; the prisoner took me to another public house to find him. I treated her with some gin. I went home with her about half-past ten o'clock. I had my things about me then. I staid there till the morning. I heard a noise in the night, and missed my things about five o'clock in the morning. I charged her with robbing me, and she gave me 2s. 6d. which I can swear to. I gave her no money.</p>

On the 17th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I parted with a friend in Long-lane, my watch was safe then, the chain hung out; I had been drinking, but knew what I was about. I had just come out of a public-house; two persons came up to me, the prisoner was one of them; I enquired the way to Gray's-inn-lane; they said, they were going that way, and walked part of the way with me, I had my son with me; he walked before, when we got to <placeName id="t18170115-185-crimeloc1013">Cow-cross</placeName>

I called out watch, and the prisoner was taken in half a minute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had been drinking. I only fell down once. The two prisoners came up to me.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MOORE. I was with my father, on the 17th of December; he was not very drunk. When we came out of the public-house in Long-lane, the prisoner offered his assistance; I am sure he is one of them; they laid hold of his arm. I put my father's watch in his fob for him, and put the chain inside. When we came to Cow-cross, the prisoner and another man had hold of his arm, there were two men behind; the prisoner gave me a shove, and told me to go on; he pushed the bundle out my hand, I picked it up, my father said I was his son, and he begged his pardon; I heard my father cry out watch! I turned round, and found they had left him. Thompson took one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My father had been drinking at two or three different public-houses; he fell down, and the prisoner offered his assistance.</p>

I am a watchman, about half past five o'clock in the morning, of the 8th of January; I saw the prisoner go by my box with something on his back; I asked him what it was, he said, it was a bed that he had brought from his lodging, in Brick-lane, and that I might go back with him, if I liked, and that he could tell me what was in it, as a proof that he had not stolen it; he said, he was going to take it to the water-side. as he was going to sea, and must be there by six o'clock; I took him to the watch-house; when he got there, he said, that he was going on board a ship and wanted to go; he said, that his lodgings were in Brick-lane; the officer went to look for them, but could not find them; the prisoner said, he could find them by day-light; we took him to look for them; he would not go up Church-street; nor would he go up Red Lion-street; when we got to the place, he saw his wife and landlady, and went in; his wife was alarmed at his being in custody. When we came to Corbet's-court; he knew it very well; we went into the prosecutor's house, the landlady said, she hoped he had not robbed her; she went up, and missed the things; she came to the watch-house, and claimed them.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HOWE. I am headborough. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house, he said, he was going on board an Indiaman; I told him, it was not a right bed to go on board a ship; he asked me to go with him to point out his lodgings, we could not find them; he said, the name of his ship was the Vansittart; in the morning we found where he had stolen the things.</p>
               <p>The prisoner pleaded distress.</p>

I met the prisoner crossing the road, somebody gave an alarm, and I stopped him with the cask of blue on his shoulder; I asked him what it was, he said, it was salt, and that he got it from Mr. Saltes, in Bishopsgate-street. I asked him, where he was going to take it; he said, to the corner of Angel-alley, Whitechapel, to a cheesmonger's. I told him, it was too heavy for salt, and took him to the watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150074"/>house.

On the 9th of January, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, I was unloading before my master's door, I had unloaded three chests, and a hogshead of sugar, and was making room in the shop, when I was asked by a young man, if I had lost a chest of tea. I run out, and missed one chest. The man said, he had seen three men take it from the cart and cross over, and turn down James-street. I run down James-street, and saw two men standing, and asked one of them, if they had seen any body with the chest, they said no, we have just come up. I thought they might be two of the men. I turned round and saw the chest, and the prisoner standing before it to hide it, he turned away, and I took him, and told him he had taken the chest of tea. I took him to the shop. He refused to go, but I got assistance. Three men carried the chest for me, (it weighed 1cwt.) while I secured the prisoner; he said, he would not go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHALLENOR. I did not see him carry it, he was standing in a dark corner before the chest. It was not a minute before I lost it.</p>
               <p>HENRY JOHNSTON. On the 9th of January, I was standing against Mr. Taylor's door, and saw three men stand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150075"/>ing at the corner of James-street; one of them went up to the cart and took the chest out of the cart, and crossed the road. I told my shopmate, and he told the carman. The last witness came up to me, and I told him which way they were gone, he went down James-street after them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I will not swear that the prisoner was one of them.</p>

            . I am the watchman of Saffron-hill. About a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, I was going down Blackboy-alley, and saw the prisoner, Pilkington, in the alley, putting on a pair of half-boots, he was knocking them against the wall, he could hardly get them on; he saw me looking at him, and said, watchman shew me a light; I went up to him, a pair of old shoes were laying just by him, which he had pulled off. The prisoner, Gray, was looking round the corner and saw me, he pretended to be calling somebody to get up to go to work, but nobody answered. I heard the other watchman coming along, I called him, and we took the prisoners into custody, we took them to the watch-house and searched them, and found some small keys and a small lock on them; I found the prosecutor's property in the cellar of an uninhabited house, close to where they were putting on the boots.</p>
               <p>HENRY BAYS. I am keeper of the watch-house. I searched the two prisoners, and found a picklock-key and three other keys on Pilkington, and a small bolt, and a brass lock; I delivered them to the officer.</p>

I am sure the cloak was in the room when he came to the door, and it was gone when I came down.</p>

I found it in his front garrett gutter. I took him into custody; he said, if I would let him go, he would never do so again. Both the prisoners were in the room - I took them.</p>

               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. On Monday evening, the 13th of January, the prosecutor came to me, stating that he had lost his harness, and who he suspected to have stolen it. About twenty minutes afterwards the prosecutor came to me with part of the harness, (the collar and traces), after that he sent for me to take Murray into custody-which I did. I went with Murray to Wheeler's house, and took him into custody. Wheeler's friends threatened to prosecute Murray, for inducing Wheeler to commit the robbery. The next morning the prosecutor brought me the other part of the harness, which he said, in the prisoner's presence, was delivered to him by Wheeler's friends.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>ATKINSON re-examined by the Court. I got the harness from Murray. I had seen him that night. I do not know where the harness hung up that night. I do not know where it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say, it hung behind the street door in the passage - A. I might. I do not know that it did</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150076"/>Q. Will you swear that it was not hanging there - A. I do not know. I did not see it there at all. I did not see it there that day; my brother had it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate, that it hung up in the passage leading to the street - door, and that the prisoner must go through that passage to go out - A. I do not know. I suspected Murray, by his calling on me; I missed it about half an hour afterwards. I had not seen it that evening.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had seen Gillmore, where did you go to - A.Into Tothill-street, to Murray's, he is a harness-maker, Wheeler was selling the harness there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell me that you knew no more about it - A. It did not strike me then; I met him at this end of Tothill-street, the sadler's is in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was at the end of the street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to swear that Murray was waiting at the other side of the street - A. Wheeler gave me part of the harness, and brought the other part home.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell me this story before - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Is what you swore before the magistrate true or not? which story do you stick by, what you swore before the magistrate, or what you say here - A. I stick by what I say here.</p>

I am the watch-house-keeper; the prosecutor came to the watch-house on the 19th of December, about twelve o'clock at night, and charged the prisoner with picking his pocket of 20s.; she pulled 17s. out of her pocket, which she said was her own, and that she had taken it where she worked. I asked her if she had any more, she said, no. She said she was willing to be searched. The prosecutor's wife searched her, and found 8s. 6d. upon her, and a bad shilling among it; I did not see the duplicate till the next morning, when Mrs. Evans gave it to me. The prisoner said, if I would give her some of the money, and let her go, she would. She did not make any charge against the man, either at the watch-house, or before the magistrate. She said, the 8s. 6d. was her own, and the rest was the prosecutor's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150077"/>and that he had given it to her; before that, she claimed the whole. Evans had been drinking, but knew what he was about (I produce the duplicate and money).</p>
               <p>EVANS. I bought the duplicate of a man, and the bad shilling is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me all the money he had; he pulled me about, and I called watch, he then gave me in charge.</p>

I had got to the top of Queen-street, Bloomsbury, where I lived. The next day, I gave information at Bow-street, and stopped the note at the bank, it was No. 7,899, and had my hand-writing on it.

The prisoner gave me a 30l. note, I gave her 26l. in change. I asked her where she got the note; she said, she lodged with a man who had received it as prize-money, and had given them leave to spend 4l.; she said, he would want some things himself, and I gave her a card of my shop. She gave me the name of Smith, Newman-street, Deptford, to put on the note. I gave her one 10l. note and one 5l. note in change, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150078"/>rest in 1l. notes. Salmon, the officer, came to me the next morning, and produced my card; and asked me, if I had taken a 30l. note - I told him I had; he produced some notes, I knew the 10l. note and the 5l., and will swear, that I gave the 10l. note to the prisoner.
