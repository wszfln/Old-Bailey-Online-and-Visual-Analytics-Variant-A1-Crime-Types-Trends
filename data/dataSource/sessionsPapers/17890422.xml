               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not very difficult to guess what way of life you are in? - Hardly, since I have been committing these depredations.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a thief, a notorious thief? - I have been a very bad man some time.</p>
               <p>Give me an answer, guess a little how long have you been a thief? - I cannot guess, I am in hope to leave it off.</p>
               <p>Nothing will make you leave it off but a halter; how many robberies have you committed within this twelvemonth last? - Nothing but these three robberies, and picking pockets a little, and such like; I think I should use the gentlemen very wrong if I was to say I was an honest man, I have worked at my trade, and I can't say I have been honest.</p>
               <p>What other trade have you worked at than that of picking pockets and other depredations? - I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>You have not worked at that lately? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Who is this Mrs. Ford; I suppose Mrs. Ford is a rib of yours? - A rib of mine!</p>
               <p>Yes, bone of your bone? - That I believe is from scripture.</p>
               <p>What, have you had any thing to do with scripture? - I hope so, though I have been so bad a man.</p>

Hutchinson said, yes; I asked him, what I should give him; and we agreed for 12 s. a hundred weight; and I was to go about nine in the evening in a boat, they laid near to the river, they were under ground covered with earth; we got the gates home to my house, and then I sent for a constable.</p>

Wicks; Curtis then said to the other, damn me what a pretty piece of business you have brought me into; Curtis said, you knew how I came by them; I told you before I came here; in consequence of which they were sent to the Poultry Compter; and on enquiry they were found to be the property of Mr. Wicks, of the Bush Tavern, Bristol.</p>

               <p>Mr. Keys, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had the prisoner been in your service? - About four or five weeks; the prisoner said she had no money, but a guinea and a half-crown when she came to us, she said, that was all she had in the world.</p>
               <p>Did not you make her any promises to induce her to confess? - I said this to her, Sally, if you have any person concerned with you in breaking the house, inform me who it is, and I will shew all the lenity I can; this was after the money was taken; I had suspicions, for I had heard of her keeping this soldier's company; she told me, nobody was concerned at all; she acknowledged it fifty times; she said she had robbed me, and the Devil must be in her to do it.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of March I went with the prosecutor into Little James-street, Oxford-road, to No. 16, the prisoner at the bar was sitting in the right hand parlour, with another woman and two soldiers; I took the prisoner out of that parlour on the staircase, and in her pocket, tied up in this silk handkerchief, were seventeen guineas, and eight half guineas, in her pocket two pounds nine shillings and sixpence in half crowns and shillings; I then went with the prosecutor and the prisoner where the boxes were, in Stonecutters-alley, in a Mrs. Smith's house; there I found in half crowns, shillings, and sixpences, five pounds and sixpence; in a little box, in one of her own large boxes, I found ten of these clouts; there were some new stockings, and six silver tea-spoons, which were new ones, a new umbrella, and a pair of new cotton stockings; the prisoner was not with me.</p>
               <p>When these clouts were found, was any promise made her? - The prosecutor prosecutor promised her he would be as favourable as he could, if she would tell where the boxes was.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I shall not enquire what she said after that? - I believe that was after some part of the money was found.</p>
               <p>But before she said any thing what she had done? - He asked her where the best part of the money was; and she begged he would not take her life, but be as favorable as he could.</p>
               <p>(The clouts deposed to by Mrs. Crank.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Crank. I know them by a particular mark with one iron mould at the corner, this is my own work; they were in the garret, they were not in the same place with the money.</p>

               <p>I belong to the office in Poland-street, I produce this knife, which I had of the prisoner on the 17th of March, about two in the day; I searched him in the office, and took him from the pawnbroker's; I have kept the knife ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure it is mine, I had the handle rasped, it was a great deal larger.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I came in on the morning that the robbery was committed in the garden, and walking backwards and forwards for some employment, I had been out of place; I found the things between a watch-box and a stand, it was covered with straw, it was this property; I took it to the pawnbroker's, and asked half a guinea for it in pawn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was a servant of mine, he lived with me about a month, he came out of the country, and while he lived with me he was very honest, but I believe distress and hunger has drove him to this; he left me two months before this happened in a hurry, one morning his father sent up things to market; I owed him a little money, and he asked for his wages when he went away; he assigned no reason for leaving me; I have entrusted him with money at different times.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you see these spoons before? - The morning before they were taken, they were used in common; when we get up in a morning this flap door is left open; I do not know whether it was taken before I went out or after; it is a thoroughfare for twenty different people.</p>

               <p>I was a servant in Mrs. Callender's house, the prisoner came home, and brought the gentleman with her, and they went up stairs; they asked me to fetch them some brandy and water, which I did, and they gave me some; I went several times, I fetched a shilling's-worth at a time; he gave me two sixpences, I believe, every time to pay for it; when I was in the kitchen I heard Mrs. Callender tell her to rob the gentleman, and she made her do it.</p>

               <p>Court. Let somebody be sent for from Mr. Smith's office; this appears to be an infamous piece of business; and I wish to be satisfied, why Mrs. Callender was not taken up, and included in this indictment; and Mrs. Leonard also for receiving a part of the property knowing it to be stolen.</p>

Money, says I, yes; that I have plenty; then says he, deliver it it directly, for we must have it; then I put my hand in my coat-pocket; I had two brace of pistols about me; and the other prisoner, Gillett said, you may as well deliver it, for we must have it; by that time three of them had got their sticks up; he then put his stick across his arm, and came up with his hand, as if to receive the money; I had two brace of pistols about me; I pulled out a pistol from my breeches pocket; and one of the other two said, we are as good be off, we had better be off; and they ran off, and I fired right in amongst them; and I followed them, crying out stop thief! I am an officer in the excise; and I had been out after some smugglers, which is the reason of my being armed; one of these sticks I can swear to, but the other I will not; I pursued them, they separated, Gillett was never out of my sight, but Forsith got clear off; the corner of the Bank I pickt up this stick; Gillett was stopt in about ten minutes; I am sure to his person.</p>

               <p>My husband keeps the sign of the Crown in Nightingale-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you known the prisoner? - About six weeks; at the time he is charged of doing the robbery, he was in my house; my child was very ill; there were several people dancing up stairs, and he was with them; I went up stairs to take my child up to-bed; I had the child in my arms, and a pillow, and two bottles of medicine, and a candle; I had occasion to go through the club-room; there is a passage at the end of the club-room, which parts the room where I was going to and the club-room; this was a little before eight o'clock; I recollect it, for there was an old lady lay ill in the room; and I asked her, if she wanted any thing? and she asked me, what o'clock it was? I told her; he came up to me, and took the candle to light me; he is a very civil young man, it was on the 5th of March, on a Thursday.</p>

               <p>Court. How do you know that; how come you to recollect it? - It was a particular day, I went to a burial that day; and Mr. Smith, the Justice, sent to my husband afterwards to know whether he he had seen Forsight at his house that evening; I should not have recollected it, but for the circumstances of his coming up to me, and holding the candle to light me.</p>
               <p>How many people were there in the club-room at that time? - There were forty or fifty men and women.</p>
               <p>Did you know them all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to come here? - The Justice desired I would appear on his trial, as he had been informed he was at our house that evening; he said that as he was fully committed, nothing could be done, but I must appear here.</p>
               <p>What part of the room did the prisoner come from, when he came and held the candle? - He came from the further part, he came running towards me.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay in the room? - Not above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner dancing while you was there? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any body dancing? - Yes, some of the company were dancing, but the prisoner was not, he was standing up; there is another witness here, her name is

               <p>How soon after you went up stairs, did you begin to dance? - Almost directly.</p>
               <p>Who did you dance with? - With that young man, the prisoner Forsith.</p>
               <p>How long had you been dancing before Mrs. Chivens came up? - I believe about half an hour.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Chivens come up for? - She came up with the child that was ill; she had a pillow and a candle, and the prisoner ran and took the candle, and held it while Mrs. Chivens unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>When she came back, how long did she stay to see you dance? - About ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>How many were there dancing? - There were two couple.</p>
               <p>What were you dancing? - We were dancing Scotch reels.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Chivens come into the room again? - No, I don't recollect that she did.</p>
               <p>Had you any brandy and water to drink? - I can't say, I was drinking all manner of liquors.</p>
               <p>What was it that Mrs. Chivens brought up? - I don't know that she brought up any thing.</p>
               <p>Don't you recollect her bringing up some brandy and water, or rum and water? - I can't say, but I believe it was brandy and water, or rum and water.</p>
               <p>Who brought it up;

            , or Mrs. Chivens herself? - I believe it was Mrs. Chivens herself.</p>
               <p>How long was that after she had gone down? - I believe it was about an hour; now I come to think, she did come up again; it was her that brought the liquor.</p>
               <p>Then you are positive now, that it was Mrs. Chivens herself brought up the liquor? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoners's Counsel. When was this that you had these parcels? - The 17th of March last.</p>
               <p>Where were you to take them to? - I was to take them to different places according to the directions.</p>
               <p>You pitched for case, I presume? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Somebody came up and spoke to you for a considerable time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Asked you several questions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively you never put your hand off during the time the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220051"/>talking to you? - Yes, I am sure I had my hand upon them when the man knocked me down.</p>
               <p>How long did the conversation last? - It might be three minutes.</p>
               <p>During the time the conversation took place, was your hand ever off the pitching-block? - No, it was not; when I pitched it down I had my hand on my load, and so it was when I was knocked down.</p>

               <p>You cannot tell who knocked you down? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you said before the magistrate who knocked you down? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you said, you thought it was a tall stout man? - Yes, the man to appearance was a tall stout man.</p>
               <p>Have you kept in that opinion down to the present time? - Yes, it was the same man that spoke to me at first.</p>
               <p>A tall stout man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could only swear to the packages by the directions? - No.</p>
               <p>Now the bill you say you swear by? - Yes, I had it with me then, I received the bill from Mr. Bolton, then I put it into my pocket, and looked at it afterwards, but not for some time; I packed the things up myself; I had the same bill, and brought the same home again.</p>
               <p>You said Mr. Bolton particularly carries on the inn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, he is the only master and proprietor of the inn? - They are both partners, Mr. Hurnall and him; my master carries on the business.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter; I was walking in Fleet-street, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, on Tuesday the 17th of March, all of a sudden I heard a man halloo out he had lost his load, that very instant a man came up to him, and directed him towards the bar, and told him it was gone that way; I did not know who that man was; and I heard another voice say, he has not gone towards the Bar, he is gone the other way; I knew the voice of the man that said that, and I immediately went that way, and took down Fleet-street; I looked at every window, and in Serjeant's Inn; I then went up Red-lion Court, and through West-harding-street into Fetter-lane, and opposite Roll's Buildings I saw a man carrying a load; I looked at the load, and it appeared to me to be different parcels from an inn, or something of that sort, game; I thought I would be cautions, and I did not speak to the man, but I followed him, I believe for 50 yards; in following him, some man passed me in the highway, and joined this man that had the load.</p>
               <p>Who was the man that had the load, was it the prisoner? - No, Sir, a taller man, I dare say by a head; he joined him, and went up the lane, and went down Plough-court; I called for assistance, and three or four boys going by, I told them, and asked them to go with me; as we were going down they were coming up, and the prisoner at the bar had the load on his head; I seized him by the collar, and he threw it down, immediately some people came, and presently after the constable came and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220052"/>Mr. Knapp. So you followed a tall stout man up Fetter-lane, did you? - I said nothing about a stout man, a tall man, he had a load on his head.</p>
               <p>Then you followed him down Plough-court, and then the bundle was changed? - I suppose so, I did not see it changed, but by the appearance of the size of the man; I look upon it, it was changed down the court, I have no doubt it was the same bundle, it was changed, it must be changed.</p>
               <p>Then it was put upon somebody else's shoulder? - Yes, I took the person that had it on his head.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen that person before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you see that person on that day before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not see him as he followed the tall man up Fetter-lane? - No, I saw several people follow me, but I could not swear to any of them.</p>
               <p>Supposing this tall man had the parcels on his head, when you took the other man, should you have known his face? - No, I should not, the tall man was out of my sight, and I never saw the other man till he came up from the court; I cannot swear this man was in the lane when they went down the court.</p>
               <p>Supposing there had been no parcels at all on the shoulders of the prisoner, should you then be able to describe him? - No, Sir, I should not, he was a tall man, and when he went down the court he had the bundle on his head; and coming up the short man had the load.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. This is a bill delivered to the porter of the inn with the parcels; and it says,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Monk, Mount-street," one parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see it taken out of that very parcel that was taken from the prisoner? - I did, two gowns.</p>
               <p>When? - The 18th I delivered the parcel into the porter's hands myself; this parcel was directed to</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Monk, in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Basham. You know nothing at all what was contained in these parcels when you received them at the Inn? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to speak for myself; I wish first of all, if it be agreeable to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220053"/>Court, to have all the witnesses out but the porter.</p>
               <p>(The following questions were handed from the prisoner to Mr. Knapp.)</p>
               <p>To the Porter. How long after the conversation took place was you knocked down? - I cannot justly say, a very little time, indeed.</p>
               <p>How soon did you go home after that time? - I suppose it might be two hours after I went home.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go home direct? - I did not like to go home; I was afraid to go home to my master.</p>
               <p>What sort of a day had this been? - It was a darkish day.</p>
               <p>The streets vastly clean, I suppose? - Not very clean, middling, a dry day.</p>
               <p>Who did you see when you went home? - I went to the publick-house just by our house, and I sent to our ostler, he is not here; then I went home, and my master sent for me.</p>
               <p>Was you hurt by your fall? - No, not stunned, but frightned; I told my master, Mr. Bolton, I had lost all my load.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He seemed to be very little concerned about it.</p>
               <p>He did not blame you? - No great matter.</p>
               <p>You was afraid of losing your place? - Yes, that was more than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolton. I saw the porter when he came home, the ostler brought him to me; he was very much flurried; he was afraid to come home.</p>

               <p>His clothes were very dirty? - No, Sir, I do not recollect they were, I took but little notice of him; I immediately set off to No. 3 or 4, a coachman said they were in Duke's Place.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, impressed with the highest sense of candour of your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; I hope you will not be prejudiced against me because I have stood at this bar once before; I hope that the voice of slander against me will do me no hurt: I was returning from Westminster, and went up Fetter-lane to go towards Moorfields; on my way home I saw some persons turn down a court, it was rather dirty and dark, I mistook it for Bartlett's Buildings; a tall person threw a load down within a few yards of the court; I caught hold of the load, and immediately Mr. Stapleton collared me; I expostulated with him in a manner that I was not the person; he insisted on stopping me 'till he went for a constable; the boys likewise came along; I asked the young men, if they did not see him throw the load down? they said, no; if I must speak, it was a tall man that threw it down; I told the magistrate so the next day; when the porter came before the magistrate, he said, the blow that was given him stunned him, and that he did not see the person; I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; my life is now at stake; I have no witnesses.</p>

I told him I wanted my property; he immediately flung the handkerchief down, and gave me a violent blow over the head, then immediately my gardener seeing that he collared him; we brought him up to the house, and I brought the bundle under my arm which contained the things in the indictment, they were mine, they are here, the officer has them.</p>

               <p>My master sent me to look after the chain, I was walking down towards Ratcliffe Highway, and just before I came to the door I saw Evans and one Beck together; then I stept back, he is an accomplice, I said, I believe I want you; then afterwards I let him go; he ran away and I ran after him, and took him again; I sent my master's son away immediately to fetch his father; he brought him to Battle Bridge; then we went to the public-house, and I heard Evans say, he was the person that lent a hand to rob the lighter, on the 31st of March, before Justice Swabey; I cannot say whether it was taken in writing or not, I was present when he was examined.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was present, there was no promise made to Evans or Scott to tell the truth; I heard what he said.</p>
               <p>Kitchenor. Evans said he lent a hand to haul the chain out, and put it into another boat; Scott said he was not guilty.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I heard Evans say that he lent a hand to haul the chain up out of the lighter-head, and to put it into the wherry, and that they sold it at Limehouse for half a guinea; we were going out to search, and before I went out they sent me word they had taken a man; the button which was found and given to me is one of the accomplice's that was admitted an evidence; his 3d and 5th buttons are off his coat; Evans got from them, at that time they did not secure either of them but Beck; Evans got off.</p>
               <p>- BECK sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not hear Beck's evidence against Scott.</p>
               <p>To Beck. You was concerned in this robbery? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Evans with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you go on board the lighter? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>How many were there of you? - Four of us; we took a piece of chain, and two or three pieces of rope; we got a piece of stick and broke the hold board up, and got a chain; we carried the things to Limehouse; there we sold them for half a guinea for the chain, and half a hundred of rope and other things for twelve shillings and nine pence; they gave us twenty-three shillings and six-pence for it all and two tarpaulins.</p>

               <p>PRISONER EVANS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Scott had nothing to do in the affair; Beck persuaded me to go out with him, I being a little in liquor went out with him, little thinking any thing of that kind, and he hauled the chain up.</p>

I said yes, very well; he said he had a horse to go there to the Repository, and he bade me carry it there; the ostler of the Swan Inn delivered the horse to me in the presence of the prisoner, and if he was sold I was to bring the money; I took the horse there, and delivered it to the servant at the repository, and the letter likewise, that was about nine in the morning; I asked the servant what time they would begin to sell; he said about eleven? I said, I have no occasion to wait, I will go back, so I left the letter and the horse; and I came back again, and found the prisoner there; says he, what are you to have for your trouble? I said a shilling; and he said he would give it me; but he did not: he bade me go back and come again at one, for he was going; he went to the repository, and I ran after him seeking for my money; says he, if the horse is sold I will pay you the money; and if not sold you shall take him back again to the inn; the same night I waited there, the horse was put up at 3 l. and each bidder rose him at 10 s. each time 'till he came to 5 l. 10 s. and then he was knocked down; there was no money paid; then the prisoner came back, near to the inn, when all was over, and bade me stop at the gate, which I did 'till about four o'clock, then he took me down Holborn again, pretending he was to lay at the Swan in Holborn, and then he ran away; I am sure the prisoner is the man, but he was dressed better a great deal then, and his hair was powdered a little, but that is the man; I went to the repository the next morning after he flung me; and I asked, what time he was to be paid? the man asked me, if it was me that brought a letter and the horse? says I, I am afraid he has bilked me; the man told me to come between 9 and 10, and I might see him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220058"/>never heard any more of this matter 'till I was at the justice's.</p>

I told him not before Friday, that was Wednesday morning the 18th of February, when he brought the horse to our house, the prisoner staid at the next door, a publick-house, on the Friday morning, I told him he might come for the money, the clerk was there, I had a mistrust the horse was stolen by the writing of the letter, and I apprehended him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor.

               <p>Did any body beat their breasts? - We had not been amusing ourselves in laughing at the people at chapel; we had been in the chapel about half an hour; I am a churchman, we did not insult them; we were going that way, and I hope there is no harm in going in.</p>
               <p>This robbery was done in the face of all the world? - It was in the publick street, there were not a great many people at the door at that time, there were some.</p>

               <p>Did any other person come into the shop, while they were in it, besides the woman you were serving. - No other person.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce two pieces of muslin, one of which I saw the prisoner drop; I was accidentally in Sidney's Alley, going past, I believe it was about four in the afternoon; I saw Langard in the Alley at the time; I did not know what he was doing, he was among the mob, there was no cry of stop thief! I am sure I saw the prisoner drop the piece, there were not many people.</p>
               <p>Court. How many? - There might be two or three dozen people.</p>
               <p>Court. People enough to obstruct your view? - No, I saw her put it under her arm before she dropped it.</p>
               <p>(The muslin deposed to by Langard having his private mark.)</p>
               <p>Can you also swear that that piece of muslin was on the counter at the time the woman was in the shop? - Yes, I had had all the pieces in my hand about ten minutes before; and this is the piece I took from the other woman, and which I saw the prisoner give to the other woman; this also was on the counter at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Langard. Are these two pieces of muslin new? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - About three pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you see me first? - The corner of Sidney's Alley, in Prince's Street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Elliot swore at the Justice's, that he saw me drop a piece in Liecester-fields; I was a quarter of an hour in the shop before any constable came; I was sitting in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Elliott. There was no such thing said.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner's Counsel. The prisoner had used your house very often? - Three or four times before.</p>
               <p>Do you know that he is a farmer in Northamptonshire? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Why; had not he slept at your house for some nights before? - He had slept there two nights; I waited upon him, and carried him his mutton chop.</p>
               <p>Your chops have never any gravy, I take it? - I did not think a spoon was wanting, I took the cloth away.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect leaving the spoon on the table when you took the cloth away? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether the spoon was covered with a newspaper? - I swear I left no spoon there, when I took away the cloth; he ordered six-penny worth of punch.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect then, his asking you whether you had missed any thing? - He said nothing to me, that I swear.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober that night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you swear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was not at all in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the prisoner asking you if you was sure you brought a spoon to that table? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the prisoner did not give you the spoon, and tell you you had left it there, and threatened to tell your master of your carelessness? - No, Sir, that he did not.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 28th of January I went to Mr. Gray's house, about nine; the waiter neither brought a spoon nor any salt, which I thought was something extraordinary, but he appeared as if he was in liquor; after I had been there a quarter of an hour, a gentleman or two came into the box, on the opposite side, I did not know them; after supper I ordered the waiter to take away the things off the table; in about ten minutes after he came for the newspaper, and there lay the spoon under the newspaper; there were two gentlemen in the box, I took up the spoon and said, what a curious fellow this is, Mr. Gray ought to be made acquainted with it; I put the spoon into my pocket with an intent to give it to Mr. Gray; and in about fifteen or twenty minutes after, I went to the bar to give it to Mr. Gray, he had two gentlemen with him in close conversation; I went and sat in my seat again, and ordered my slippers, I had slept there the two preceding nights, I called for six-penny worth of liquor; before that I said to the waiter, have not you missed something tonight? says I, do you recollect what you brought me? he did not recollect himself then; somebody in the coffee-room called him away; in about a quarter of an hour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220071"/>after he brought me six-penny worth of punch; when he bought it I said, don't you recollect you brought me a spoon, do not you recollect whether you took it away again? he said he did not know; says I, who should then? says I, I have the spoon and will give it to your master; he said I might do as I pleased; in consequence of that I apprehend he went to his master, and acquainted him that he missed a spoon, and had a suspicion that I had it; in consequence of that in came the constable; he said, I must search you; I said for what; I did not know that he was a constable; I believe I might be a little pert; says I, I have the spoon, it is in my pocket; he took it away from me; there came a swarm round me, and the constable did not use me well, he began to pull and shake me about, he took me by the collar and pulled me about, he did not use me in a genteel manner; then he took me to the watch-house in Fleet-market, and from thence to Wood-street compter; the next day I was taken before Mr. Chamberlain Wilkes; I begged him to be so obliging as to wait a little while, I expected a gentleman to come on my behalf, that saw me hold up the spoon, I had no intention of taking it, which the waiter must know; the Alderman put off my hearing till the next day; I mentioned it to Alderman Clarke, he said if you have not that person I must commit you; last session I put off my trial on account of the absence of my witnesses; I hope that will satisfy you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Thompson. At the time the spoon was found in his pocket, did he say any thing of this? - When I told him he was charged with stealing a silver spoon, and I must search him; he said I had no business, I said I must; he said, if I have a spoon in my pocket, it is more than I know of, for I have none.</p>
               <p>But did he say any thing to his having put the spoon there, with intent to tell the master? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He would not allow me an opportunity.</p>

             lives next door to me, and is a greengrocer; on the 21st, about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner Caseltine take a sack of coals, which was in a waggon standing by Mrs. Michael's window, and shoot them down into her cellar-window; then he shot another down; Mrs. Michael was present out of doors at the time, about three or four yards from the waggon, in the street; I had the curiosity to follow the waggon; he then drove up Whitechapel, and stopped with another man to drink, and then went to Lime-street; I saw a man take the middle part of the sacks, and draw them up to the top; I informed Mr. Lancaster; I am sure as to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was dark when you saw this? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Not at eight o'clock? - It was not eight o'clock.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220076"/>How came you to say eight o'clock? - It was eight o'clock when it was unloaded at Mr. Lancaster's; it was unloaded, and all by half past eight.</p>
               <p>Who was with the waggon at that time? - The waggoner himself.</p>
               <p>Who was with him? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Where was you then? - As near as I am to you.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I deal in coals and wood.</p>
               <p>So does Mrs. Michael, does not she? - I don't know, she sells greens, I believe, and buys old iron.</p>
               <p>Don't you know she sells coals? - No, I do not, I am not master of her shop.</p>
               <p>How long has she been your next door neighbour? - I believe two years.</p>
               <p>You did not go up to the man, and ask how this happened? - I never spoke to him at all.</p>
               <p>Was you not upon a regular plan of watching Mrs. Michael? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you or had you not before this day formed a determination to watch Mrs. Michael? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner Michael's Counsel. I believe you did not like Mrs. Michael's coming there? - I did not dislike a good neighbour.</p>
               <p>Had not you a dislike to Mrs. Michael's coming there? - One does not like a person to take the bread out of one's mouth.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the sacks they shot the coals out? - They were put into the middle part of the waggon; and when they came to Mr. Lancaster's they drew them quite forward.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you inform Mr. Lancaster of this then? - Not that evening.</p>

               <p>Is Church-street in the way for them to have come with the waggon? - No, a quarter of a mile out of the way; the witness Partridge came, and informed me of the transaction; and that if I would look into the waggon I should find the empty sacks; I bid them stop unloading, but they would not; I endeavoured to get up, but could not; I then went to get a light and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220077"/>a chair, and by that time they had laid the sacks even at the tail of the cart; I asked them, what made them come the way they did? and they said the pavement was up in White-lion-street, and therefore they came the other way; I went to see, and found it was no such thing; there were 26 sacks in all: the woman was taken into custody, and she denied having any from this man; and said, she had in her house a bushel, or a bushel and a half.</p>
               <p>Partridge. Upon the woman saying to the Justice, she had but a bushel, or half a bushel in her house; says he, I am a pretty good judge of a bushel, I will go with you myself; I went with the Justice to this woman's house, and we looked and found the als under the window; the Justice asked her, what she had to say in her behalf? and she said, she was very sure that she had no such quantity of coals in the house, for she was obliged to send for a bushel on Saturday night at Mr. Hands's; then says the Justice, I can judge of a bushel, and I'll go and see myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was what you are talking of taken down in writing? - I believe it was; then I saw the coals measured, first in the cellar, there were about four bushels and a peck, and there was another parcel measured two bushels within about a quarter of a peck, in this hole; afterwards the Justice sent one of the men to fetch two parcels of coal, some out of this cellar, and some out of a room.</p>

I said it was not worth above 4 s. he went into the back room, and laid down the chain before some men; he said, it was his property, and he owned it as such; I gave him 5 s. for it; I had the chain in my possession two months, 'till Mr. Hodges applied to me; when they came to me I produced it to him and Atkins, and he said it was his property, and I gave it to Atkins; when Mason came to me he was very decently dressed, but Pitt was not; I never saw either of the prisoners before or since; they are the men.</p>

               <p>I am a poor man in the workhouse; I was at work with the prisoner and Mr. May one day, and I saw him help Mr. May with his coat on, but I did not see him take any thing.</p>
               <p>May. I had 10 s. in my pocket when he helped me on with my coat; I felt his hand in my pocket; I had two half crowns, and 5 s. in my pocket; I had seen it about half an hour before that; about four o'clock in the afternoon my coat was on the ground on the common before he helped me on with it; I did not see any body on the common but me, and the prisoner, and this man; I was digging gravel; I had the silver in my coat-pocket; I had no suspicion of him before the Sunday morning; it was on Saturday night he took it; I did not take any notice of it at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say at first you did not know of his robbing you? - I did not know he had: I asked him on the Sunday morning, whether he had seen any money of mine? and he said no: I asked him again, and then he said he had got two half crowns and 4 s. of mine, and he brought it down to me; then I said I wanted a shilling, and he said he spent it; I threatened to send him to gaol, before he brought it down, if he did not give it to me; he then brought me down 9 s. and said he had spent 1 s. I got all but 1 s. back again.</p>
               <p>How came you to indict him capitally? Do you know that he is tried for his life? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know that the charge you have made against this boy is a capital charge? - No, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Have you never been told that? - No, I never was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have told the Judge, that to your knowledge they did not tell you it was a capital charge: Do you mean to swear that they did not tell you so? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively they did not? - I have been lame these three years.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that nobody has told you, that if this boy was convicted he would lose his life? - Not to my knowledge; he has been in custody a week.</p>

               <p>Do not you know you would have a reward? - I know there is some reward.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard there is a reward of 40 l. - No, I heard it was some reward; I do not know who told me so; I have heard so from people.</p>
               <p>Who told you so? - I cannot tell now.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he was committed by the magistrate for a capital offence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask the magistrate who was to pay your expences? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not the magistrate tell you that the Could would order you your expences, or that you would have a reward? - I am a poor man belonging to the workhouse; I work under the overseer, and I received this by my labour.</p>
               <p>Is your memory affected by your poverty? - No.</p>
               <p>Is your head affected? - It is a good deal.</p>

               <p>How came you to take out the purse in her presence? - I do not know, because I was foolish; she charged me five shillings for the bed; I took half a guinea and paid five shillings for the bed, and the other five shillings and six-pence was spent in wine.</p>
               <p>You was not very sober I suppose? - I was not drunk, Sir; I lost a studd out of my wrist, it was a Mocoa stone set in silver; in the morning I awaked, and found my breeches, instead of under the pillow, upon the pillow, and my purse and money was gone; I found the purse on the table cut in three or four places, I cannot tell what time it was when I awaked, it was not light, it might be four or five; the window was open, and the curtains drawn; I called to the person of the house, and the maid answered that the door was done; the woman's name is Lumley, I heard of the prisoner at No. 3, Goldsmith-street, at one Eaton's, on Sunday afternoon; I went to her, she was alone at her lodging, I suppose Mr. Eaton came up; I asked for her.</p>
               <p>How did you get her name? - I had her name.</p>
               <p>How did you get it? - I had it.</p>
               <p>You must give me an answer? - I have given you an answer; Mrs. Lumley gave me her name, and even her maid was the person that gave intelligence where she was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the woman you saw at Eaton's, was the same woman you had been in company with before? - Yes, that is the same person, I have looked at her, I asked her whether she could give me any of the money again; she said she had it not in her possession; she said she knew nothing at all of it, she gave me the studd before the constable, it was my studd; my money was not marked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. This is a very pretty, a very entertaining, a very becoming sort of a story; because I observed, when you first came up to that box, you came smiling and laughing? - No, I did not, I do not know that I did, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect that you was laughing? - Somebody gave me a push on the back, as I suppose, as I was coming up, I did not smile at the Court.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that you did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220089"/>smile and laugh when you came up there? - I do not know, I might smile.</p>

               <p>Who are you? - I am a dealer in cattle, when I am out of London.</p>
               <p>Then you came to London about your cattle? - Not on purpose.</p>
               <p>That makes me suspect that here is rather an over-charge as to the money? - Not purposely, I did not come.</p>
               <p>You was at the Swan with Two Necks in Lad-lane? - That day I dined at one, at the Swan with Two Necks.</p>
               <p>How much money might you spend in liquor, before you saw this young woman? - I spent none, for I paid nothing there, I spent it between Lad-lane and this place.</p>
               <p>You drank, I suppose, pretty well at your dinner? - Yes, I suppose I drank some liquor at my dinner.</p>
               <p>Do you only suppose that? - Yes, I know I did.</p>
               <p>You had drank pretty plentifully at your dinner I take it? - Yes, I drank some liquor.</p>
               <p>What liquor? - I drank porter, and I drank punch.</p>
               <p>What might your reckoning come to? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Swan with Two Necks? - At Five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Then you was enjoying yourself from one to five? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then from five to half past six, it was that you was getting this four or five miles to Temple-bar? - I suppose I was; I know I was an hour and half getting to Templebar.</p>
               <p>You did not walk very strait? - Yes, I did; I do not eat a deal, but I drink a good deal.</p>
               <p>Do you know what women you met in the way? - No, I cannot tell their names.</p>
               <p>Amorously inclined, I suppose at this time? - I suppose I was at that time, I do not know, I accusted one, I cannot rightly say what part of Fleet-street I met her in.</p>
               <p>How many places did you stop at in going? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say that you knew every thing you did with your purse, and every part of the money you laid out during that hour and half? - Yes, I will say that I know what money I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Which way did you get into Cheapside? - I do not know that.</p>

I said to Mr. Heath's, a hosier; the prisoner at the bar said, he was going to my master for those things from Mr. Heath; I had the parcels under my arm, I did not see them packed up, my master gave me the parcels to carry; he gave me another small parcel, and said, I must give it to my master; he said, there was a letter in the inside, he desired I would take it to my master, and it was to be forwarded to Mrs. Brown immediately, he took the other two parcels from me, he walked on slowly, and went towards the Old Bailey; afterwards I had rather a suspicion of him, I ran after him as far as the Old Bailey; I asked him, if his name was Mr. Heath? he said, yes, it was, and I left him then; I did not get the parcels back; I can swear positively to the prisoner.</p>

I knew the person of the prisoner before; I took the prisoner about a month afterwards; the alderman told me to take care of the parcel, with the dish-clouts.</p>

               <p>Why did not you stop him? - The boy would not open his parcel.</p>

               <p>You did not see him afterwards for six weeks? - Yes, Sir, I did, I saw him about a fortnight afterwards at about nine in the evening, but I was by myself, and I did not like to stop him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wayte. The boy came back about two hours after I had sent him out; he had been before to Mr. Heath's; I do not know whether he knew Mr. Heath personally.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's Counsel objected, that it was not a felony, but obtaining goods by false pretences, and the case was reserved, and sentence respited, for the opinion of the Judges.</p>

            , in Duke-street, Westminster, No. 20; I had been to see my brother, who is a coachman, in Swallow-street; his coach was at the top of the Hay-market, in Piccadilly, it was the 20th of February, I was coming down St. James's Park, about the middle part of the Park, from St. James's, what is generally called the Canal-walk; it was about half past seven as nigh as I can recollect; the prisoner met me, he put his hand on my shoulder, he was not on duty at that time, he asked me for something to drink; I told him I had nothing to give him; I did not know what he meant; he followed me down the Park, said, he had been on board a ship eating of salt meat, and he had really got no money; I thought a pot of porter was a small object, and I treated him with a pot of porter, at the sign of the Rose and Crown, in Crown-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Court. Had he his regimentals on? - Yes, he had, we drank the pot of porter in the publick tap-room, I paid for it; he asked me, which way I was going; I said, I was going to the stables; I was going to meet the coachman in order to fetch the family home; not finding the coachman at the stables, I returned home to my master's, the prisoner followed me at a distance to the stables and house; he was not with me; I went into my master's house, and he went his way; I staid at the Rose and Crown, as near as I can guess, about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220093"/>was following you to the stables, and to the house? - No, none at all; in about half an hour I went out again to the stables, in order to fetch my master and mistress home; the stables are the top of Delahay-street, the bottom of Duke-street, this man following me, I thought he had no good design; I went up the Park straight, I met him in the Park about three or four poles from the Park-gate, where I went to shun him, for I thought by his following me he had no good design; he met me, and said, young man, let me feel your bubbies, with that he put his hand to my bosom, and took out my shirt-pin, and my handkerchief from my neck, then he ran off; I had hold of him by the hand, but he was too powerful for me, and he ran off; I made no alarm, but went away; next night about half past 11 I was going down Duke-street on a message for my master, the prisoner met me in an undress, in a regimental jacket, with a flapt hat and his hair about his shoulders; he said he was taken up on my account, and he immediately rushed upon me, and took my watch, three guineas, two shillings, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Court. When he rushed upon you, you do not mean violently by force. - Yes, violently; d - n your eyes, says he, if you offer to resist, or call out for assistance, I will kill you; he held his left hand up against me, at the same time he made use of those words, I did not call out for assistance; I was frightened in the hurry of his threatening my life, I was rather confused, and did not, and he ran off immediately, I did not see any thing in his hand.</p>
               <p>At the time he took your watch and money, did you make any resistance at all though you did not call out? - No, I did not make any resistance, he was too powerful for me; I had no strength against him.</p>
               <p>Did you struggle at all for your watch? - I did, I went the next morning upon the Parade, but I was not positive that I could swear to the man, because he came in different dresses to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me on the Parade? - Not to be positive, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you mention this to any body this night? - Not that night.</p>
               <p>Did you mention the loss of your shirt-pin and handkerchief to any body before? - Yes, I did, to my own brother, to nobody else.</p>
               <p>When did you tell him? - The next day when I saw him.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this robbery? - I cannot justly say, as nigh as I can guess about two days.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention this robbery of this watch? - I mentioned it on the 10th of March when he was taken; this was the 20th of February; I believe it was about six days after the prisoner came to my master's door in the evening, about six or seven he knocked at the door, I answered the door; he said, he had my watch, and my property, that he had stolen from me; if I would come out of the door he would give them to me.</p>
               <p>What were the precise words that he used? - Them were the words as nigh as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Repeat them again? - He said, he had got my watch, and my property, which he had stolen from me, if I came there, meaning out of doors, he would give them to me, if I would not say any thing to his officer, to have him taken up and expose him; I went out into the street, and shut the door after me, thinking to receive my property; he then said, he was going to Bath, he had pawned my watch, and every thing he had; and, d - n his eyes, if I did not give him more money, or money's worth, he would accuse me of an unnatural crime, he would take me up, and have me hanged; he immediately rushed me against the wall, and rifled my pocket, but I had no money, and he ran off down Crown-street; I followed him down the street, but he was gone off, and there was not a person there that I could get to assist me to stop him; on the 9th of March he came, about half past seven, to my master's door, and knocked; I answered the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220094"/>door to him; he said then, I have taken your property, and your watch out of pawn, here it is, I will give it you; he put his hand to his breeches, as if he was going to pull the watch out; I went to him, and he immediately, as before, robbed me of one guinea in the same manner as he did before.</p>
               <p>Where was that, in the hall, or where? - In the street.</p>
               <p>How came you in the street? - I shut the door, as I did before, when I saw him put his hand to his breeches, I thought he had got my watch; when he had got the guinea, he said, d - n his eyes, if I did not fetch him more money, he would murder me; I got from him, and got into my master's house; he followed me to the door, I knocked.</p>
               <p>How did you get in, because you said you shut the door? - I knocked at the door, and was let in by the servant in the hall; my master answered the door, and asked the prisoner who he wanted.</p>
               <p>How did your master happen to answer the door? - The prisoner came after me the last time he robbed me, and knocked at the door, and my master was in the hall, he came out of the parlour at the same time, and answered the door.</p>
               <p>What, when you and the other servant were in the hall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for your master to do so? - No, it was not a usual thing for my master to do.</p>
               <p>Was you making any noise or disturbance in the hall, or calling out? - No, I did not, my master asked the prisoner, who he wanted; he said, he wanted Charles; I was present in the hall at the time.</p>
               <p>Who is Charles? - He meant me; my master said, there is no Charles lives here; walk in, if you have any thing to say, with that my master let down the chain, and then the prisoner made off; my master asked me at that time, when he saw him go off, what he wanted with me? and I told my master the particulars; I had not before then told my master of the robbery; on the 16th of March I went from about half past seven o'clock 'till about one, which was the day the guns were fired off the day of the illumination; I pursued the prisoner, I watched him to the house where he went, which was the sign of the Horseshoe in Petty-France; I went, and got two constables, and took him in the street; he had left the house then.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose it was in consequence of your master's advice that you went into the Park the next day? - Yes, it was, but I should have taken him up before, if I could have sworn to the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scboen. Was any of your property found upon him? - Yes, a silk handkerchief, that was the handkerchief he took from my neck; when we took him to Justice Abbington's he was particularly engaged, he asked to go into a necessary; he went in, and he conveyed from his neck this handkerchief, which was round his neck, when he was taken, and he conveyed it down the necessary; I mentioned it to the constable in the coach; I did not think to mention it before, though I saw it round his neck when he was taken; after we had an hearing at Sir Sampson Wright's, he desired us to go back to this necessary, and in the presence of Justice Abbington, we took it out of the necessary; we took the handkerchief the next day to Justice Abbington's, and the constable took it the day he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever get your watch again? - No, Sir Sampson asked him, what he did with the watch; he said, he sold it to a Jew; I was present when he said that, and so was the constable.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his examination taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. There is no examination of the prisoner's returned. I am for the prisoner; I ought to submit to your Lordship; here is a charge which certainly constitutes several highway robberies, and they are all consolidated in one charge in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Take any one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You lived with Mr. Esdale in Duke-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220095"/>Do you live there now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is your master here to day? - He is.</p>
               <p>You say the first attack was on the 20th of February? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was going to call on your brother? - I had called on him, I was going home to my master's house; my brother lives in Swallow-street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>What time was your master's carriage ordered that evening? - At half past eight.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to your brother? - At about seven, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Which way did you come home? - I came in at St. James's.</p>
               <p>It was dark I take it at seven? - Yes, it was darkish.</p>
               <p>Swallow-street, if I know it, is nearer to your master's than St. James's palace? - Yes, I do not know but it is.</p>
               <p>Then you did not go the nearest way home to your master's house? - No, I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Has it never happened to you to hear that people going along the park, have been exposed to robberies after dark, and frequent complaints have been made of it? - Yes, I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Can you give us now, my friend, any good reason why you chose to go round from Swallow-street, all through St. James's palace, into the Park, that way exposing yourself in a place, where you know robberies have been committed, rather than go the straight way? - No, Sir, I do not give you any particular reasons.</p>
               <p>And you can give no good reason for it? - No, I cannot give any particular reason for it.</p>

               <p>You had no reason at the time? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Then you were first of all accosted by the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was then in regimentals? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You a perfect stranger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say that the first thing that occurred to you was, his laying hold of you by the shoulders, and asking you for something to drink? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you a little alarmed at that? - Yes, I was a little alarmed, but not confused.</p>
               <p>Then you was not confused? - I was confused to be sure.</p>
               <p>Were you, or were you not confused at that address? - Yes, Sir, I was confused.</p>
               <p>Were you near any body there? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>And in the dark too? - Yes, it was in the dark.</p>
               <p>I suppose you looked upon this almost as much as forcing so much money out of your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If any watchman had been near, I take it you would have charged him with a robbery? - Yes, I dare say I should, but I am not positive; I could not call it a robbery to ask me for something to drink; I do not know whether I should have charged any watchman with him or not.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether you should not have complained of an attempt to rob you at that time, if you had had any person by, who would have rendered you substantial assistance? - Why, no, I think I should not.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me just now that if assistance had been near you, you should have been inclined to have complained of an attempt to rob you? - When he took his hand from my shoulder, and left me and followed me, I did not thing any thing of his going to rob me; I was confused, and I was not confused; I was alarmed to be sure; I thought by the man's making a pitiful story to me, it was out of charity I gave him part of a pot of porter.</p>
               <p>Then this man being a perfect stranger to you, you at first thinking he had some bad design, he was the most unlikely man in the world, whom you should choose for a companion to go and drink with? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>How came you then to go to partake of this pot of beer, as you meant to give him as matter of charity? - I can give you no particular reason for that.</p>
               <p>How long might you stay at this public-house with the man? - Perhaps ten minutes, or not quite so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220096"/>I take it the explanation took up some time in the Park, before you were prevailed on to give him a pot of beer? - I did not stop, I went on.</p>
               <p>How long might you have been going from Swallow-street to St. James's-palace, and then through the Park? - Not twenty minutes, I was not walking very fast; it was almost at the bottom of the Long-walk, pretty near Spring-garden-gate.</p>
               <p>The centry-boxes are some distance from that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And there is a wall near there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And no windows that look on that part? - No; the prisoner followed me, I did not walk with him, he followed me at a distance, not at a distance, he was telling his pitiful story.</p>

               <p>Did not you desire him to follow you at some distance? - I do not mean to swear any such thing.</p>

               <p>Did he or not, follow you at your desire? - Not at my desire.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes, I did not go through the Horse-guard-gate, not Storey's-gate; we went through a gate by Lady Suffolk's house, which comes into Duke-street; that gate is open till ten, I found no difficulty in getting out at that gate.</p>
               <p>Then you went into the ale-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go first, or you? - I cannot justly say; I did not give him the money for the beer before we went in; I paid the landlord of the house for the pot of beer, I do not know which went first into the public-house.</p>
               <p>Had you drank at that house before? - Yes, I believe about once, the prisoner sat by the side of me, and we drank the pot of beer.</p>

               <p>Did much conversation pass between you at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you staid ten minutes at that house? - I said five minutes.</p>
               <p>Then you say he asked you where you lived? - No, he asked me where I was going, I said I am going to the stables.</p>
               <p>Did you desire he should follow you again to the stables? - No, Sir, I did not desire it.</p>
               <p>Nor forbid it? - No, I did not care whether he knew where I was going; there are other coaches stand in the stables, and there are dwellings where the coachmen sleep.</p>
               <p>Was you pleased with this man's company? - His company! No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you wish to pursue or renew the acquaintance? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not find the coachman there, nor any body you knew? - No, I did not, I did not stay at the stables a moment when I found the coachman was not there; he followed me to my master's undesired.</p>
               <p>No conversation all this time? - Yes, Sir, there was no conversation passed.</p>
               <p>Was there any conversation at all passed? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me yes at first? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>You of course perceived this man following you? - Yes, I did, he followed me directly from the stables to my master's house, I went into my master's house, and he went his way.</p>
               <p>Who let you in? - One of the maid servants.</p>
               <p>Did you relate this circumstance to her? - No, I did not; I went in at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Do you remember opening the other door that evening, the back door, the servant's door? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How long after the street-door did you open it? - I cannot justly say, it might be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was more than five minutes? - Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Then there was nothing improper done all that time? - No.</p>
               <p>When do you say there was any thing improper done? - There was not any thing improper done then, but when I went out again at the gate, which was about a quarter of an hour afterwards, I was robbed of my handkerchief and pin.</p>
               <p>At that time had you no threat at all,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220097"/>nor any accusation from this man against you? - No, Sir, he took my pin and my handkerchief, and he immediately went off, he ran towards the barracks that was in the Park.</p>
               <p>How far was the centry off? - A great way at the top of George-street.</p>
               <p>How far is that gate at which you were, from Storey's-gate, at the top of George-street? - It is about forty or fifty poles.</p>
               <p>You made no alarm of this robbery? - No, I had hold of his hand, he was rather too strong for me, I never called out.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information to any of the servants, or to your master that evening, that you had been robbed in the Park by a soldier? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you give any information at all of this robbery, before you was threatened to be charged with an unnatural crime? - No, not to my family.</p>
               <p>Was your brother before the magistrate? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Is that brother here to-day? - No, he is out of town at a funeral, and has been these two or three days; the second time I saw him was the next night, nothing passed only he met me in an undress, and said he had been taken up on my account.</p>
               <p>That was not true? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the man fixed himself, and you knew him then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That of course fixed his person strongly on your mind? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That he had robbed you on the night before? - Yes, he had, this was in the street about half past seven, it is not a public street, sometimes there is not a person for half an hour to be seen; my fellow servants were in the house.</p>
               <p>How long might you remain in conversation with him that evening? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>At that time there was no intimation from you that you meant to charge him with any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not complain of this second robbery? - No, I did not, to any person.</p>
               <p>That was done with a considerable degree of force? - Yes, it was, I took no means to apprehend him that night, but I went the next day to see if I could see him, but I was not positive then whether I knew him, because of his two different dresses.</p>
               <p>Did you describe him to any of the Serjeants in the park? - No, I did not, the third robbery was attempted four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Even then there was no threat from him? - There was a threat from me, for I followed him down the street, and I should have taken him up if there had been any body; I cried out at the top of Crown-street, and he set off and run, and I after him; I did not say stop thief, but said that man had robbed me: there was nobody by.</p>
               <p>Did not the man, when he came to your masters's, say, Sir, I want Charles; and when your master said to him, there is no Charles here; did not he point to you, and say, that is the man I want? - I did not see him point.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, before the magistrate, was not that given in evidence, and did not you yourself swear it? - No, Sir, I do not know that I did, I will not swear positive, to the best of my remembrance I did not swear it.</p>
               <p>Court. But though he did not point to you, did not he say you was the person he wanted? - Yes, my Lord, he did; he said that is the person I want.</p>
               <p>Then the man said boldly to your master, that is the man I want? - Yes, Sir, he did; and then after he was gone, I told my master.</p>
               <p>But not while he was present, and your master wondering why he called upon you, you never charged him with having robbed you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Nobody was by when you lost your handkerchief? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Your brother knows nothing of this but what you told him? - No, he does not.</p>
               <p>Court. When the man was in the hall, and your master opened the door, and he said you was the person he wanted, did your master ask him what he wanted with you? - Not then, but afterwards he asked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220098"/>And then it was you told the story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose your master said you must take this man up. - He said, if he has robbed you, take him up.</p>

               <p>I am a private in the same regiment with the prisoner; I have known him three years, a very good character as far as I knew; I was coming home from work about eight at night, I believe it was the 5th of February; and I was going up Charles-street, the prosecutor's master lives right opposite there, I saw a grenadier, that was the prisoner, and the prosecutor stand talking together, and I stopped, knowing him to be one belonging to the same regiment; I heard the prosecutor tell him to go round in the Park to the back door, and he would let him in, then he shut the door after him and went in, and I went and spoke to the prisoner; and asked him, what he was about? the prosecutor came and opened the door and let him in, and shut the door after him; he stopped there about a quarter of an hour, he came out again, and the prosecutor wished him a good night, and shut the door after him; I took particular notice of him; I had my working dress on; it was in Duke-street, right opposite to Charles-street; I know the house, because the door of the house is right facing the top of Charles-street, I do not know the number, nor who lives at it, but I perfectly remember the prosecutor, I never saw him before to my knowledge, I suppose I staid the value of half a minute, this was about eight on the 5th of February, there was a lamp at the door, it was very light; I am perfectly sure it was the same person.</p>
               <p>How came you to be applied to, to come forward in this business? - I do not know, I was subpoened.</p>
               <p>Had you remarked this man then? - No further than I said, that I did see the man and the prisoner together; that I have said since he has been confined; I do not know the prosecutor's name; I know him by sight; I am certain sure of him; I know it is the same man.</p>

               <p>Haggett. I was subpoened the 22d.</p>
               <p>What was you subpoened to give evidence about? - Nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>But what was that truth to be? - I have told you that I was coming home from work; and I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor stand at his master's door; I did not know that he was the prosecutor, but I know it was the same man as I saw.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. If you think it proper, my Lord, I wish the master may relate something.</p>
               <p>Court. One is always happy, when a man is standing on his trial for his life, to hear something come out that may be of service to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Esdaile. On the night that I answered the door myself; I was led to it from hearing a number of small taps at the door; the man asked for Charles; I said, there was no such man; I opened the door with the chain up; I recollected the man, I had seen him a fortnight before in the street, with my servant talking, on the pavement; I then suspected something, they ran down into the Park, I knew his face again, and seeing him I threw down the chain; he immediately said, that is the man I want; now it is given in evidence that he ran away, but that was not the case, for he would have come into the house, but he was in liquor; had he been sober he should have come in; I thought it necessary to mention it, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. That is very honourable of you, Sir, indeed.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Lord Rivers; on the 6th of March last, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was returning from below stairs, I saw the prisoner Mitchell come out of the steward's room with the four teaspoons in his hand open; I observed the bowls of the spoons in his hand as he went up the area steps; I pursued him about forty yards; the other prisoner was waiting for him; he seemed to want to shift them from his hand to the other prisoner; the other prisoner was not in the house; Mitchell was not a quarter of a minute out of sight; he was taken, and the spoons found just under his feet.</p>
               <p>- RYMER sworn.</p>
               <p>The gentleman's servant cried stop thief! I saw the man in the blue coat; I ran past him; I stood two seconds; the footman came; he said, what have I done? says I, if you have done no harm, you have no occasion to be afraid; we went back, the four spoons were hid just where he was standing.</p>

               <p>Then you speak of only what you know when you was in Holland; where did you buy that sword? - I bought this sword at Mr. Yorke's in Cavendish-street, facing Mansfield-street, going out of Portman-Place up towards Marybone, next to a General's.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect the General's name, if you hear it? was it Mansfield or Brown? - No, neither of those names.</p>
               <p>What did you give for that sword? - I gave 14 s. for that sword, and a pair of buckles, but I reckoned the sword worth 17 s.</p>
               <p>What became of the sword? - I went into Mr. Alexander's house, and had a glass of gin; it was a publick-house, so when I came in, and paid for my gin, the man of the house said to them, this is the man that took up Jem Poles; I went along the tap-room, says he, you Jew thief,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220103"/>get out of the tap-room; through this, as there was a great many Irish people there, I thought to myself it was time for me to go, because there was bad words there, and I went out, and forgot my sword; as I had been used to have the sword under my arm, from Mansfield-street, I had not been above six minutes, or at the most ten minutes, before I missed the sword; I went back to the house.</p>

               <p>Where is Alexander's house? - Almost the middle of Monmouth-street, the Spread Eagle; I went back again, says I, Gentlemen, you may make a joke of it, but I do not mind paying a gallon, or half a gallon of beer if they would return me my sword; the landlord says, did not I say he would come back to lay it on some one or other? the prisoner was in the room, but I cannot swear he took the sword; I was used very ill in the house; I was glad to get out of the neighbourhood, if the sword had been worth 100 l.; the prisoner was in the room, but I cannot swear who took the sword.</p>
               <p>What day was this you lost the sword? - The first or second of April, I cannot tell very well.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - It was in the evening, about six or seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>What sort of a sword was it? - It was mounted with steel, outside and inside, twisted with silver; it was very handsome before they broke it.</p>
               <p>Should you know the sword again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The sword produced.)</p>
               <p>This is the sword.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by? - This here was out, and I thought to have something put in, and sell it at a shop.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the sword? - I am.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I know nothing of the man; I was that day looking for a job, I called at this publick-house, there were two men sitting in the box; I sat down, and drank a pint of beer, one man calls me out; he says, Bellamy, here is a pawnbroker's ticket, I will be glad if you will take care of it; I never saw the Jew nor the sword 'till I saw him at the office.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the sword you pawned at Davis's? - I never pawned any.</p>
               <p>FOR THE PRISONER.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of March I discovered some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220104"/>leather concealed in my cellar, I was determined to find out who took it; I had at that time two shopmen and an apprentice; on the 24th of March, when Delves was at breakfast, one of the pieces of leather was missing; on the 1st of April a second piece was missing, and I discovered one piece taken on the 16th of April; I lost a piece of inner sole leather, value three-pence halfpenny, from under a board in the cellar, where it had been concealed, I suppose by the person who took it away, it had been taken from the shop; I searched the house of the prisoner, where there was a great deal of other leather, as well as that very piece, which I know to be my own; there was one skin in particular I could swear to; there was a mark of 71 in red chalk on one; on that I had the prisoner taken up; there was a dog skin marked R. M. which I had some knowlege of; I asked him where he bought that skin; he told me he bought it at Alderman Newman's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had this man been your foreman? - About four year and three quarters.</p>
               <p>You know he had carried on some business for himself? - I told him I had heard something of it, and that I would turn him away if he did so.</p>
               <p>I believe you found at his house several manufactured shoes, so that it seems he had not followed your injunctions? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>I believe you know that he dealt with your currier? - Yes, I had heard it.</p>

               <p>Have you heard he was about to set up in your neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near was the situation he intended to set up to your shop? - One within seven or eight doors, the other in Cow-lane.</p>
               <p>The prisoner hath, I believe a wife and three children? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I may venture to ask you whether he was not a very industrious and honest man till this happened? - He was, and I kept him for his honesty.</p>
               <p>He had such an impediment in his speech that he was a great hindrance in your shop, but his honesty got the better of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What a good thing then he hath somebody to talk for him now, as he cannot talk for himself; had you not somebody else in your service whom you know had pilfered you? - No.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he was more a pilferer than the word imports? - The boy once went to buy something, and he charged me more than he gave for it.</p>
               <p>This boy is still continued in your service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect your foreman more than this boy? - He was not my foreman.</p>
               <p>How came you to acknowledge him such before, who looked after your business when you was from home? - Either of my men.</p>
               <p>What quantity of manufactured shoes did you find in the prisoner's room? - About one or two and twenty pair.</p>
               <p>Were any of these your property? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>On your oath, did you not know they were not your's? - They were not.</p>
               <p>How happened it that you let this piece of leather lay so long; did you look at it every day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which was the first, taking the man up, or getting the warrant? - I first got the warrant.</p>
               <p>It was something about the size of this book, and the value about the price of a pot of beer? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Are you the person that was tried for a misdemeanor on the city of London? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you are not tried yet? - No, that has nothing to do with this.</p>
               <p>But it has to do with your character, it certainly must be for some good, no doubt.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Miller. Can you pick out any of that leather you yourself can swear to? - Yes, this piece I can swear to.</p>
               <p>What do you know it by? - There is an odd kind of a stain upon it, which was on it when it was under the board.</p>
               <p>Were the letters on it now, on it when it was under the board? - No, I put it on it to know it again when it was brought on trial.</p>
               <p>How came you to do that, if you was certain it was yours? - Some person stood by advised me so to do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mumby. I know this was mine once; I really believe it is the piece I sold to Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Did you never sell any of that parcel to any other person but Mr. Miller? - I think not, but I cannot say positive; but I am sure it was never retailed out of my shop, but it was sold in a lot.</p>

               <p>I saw some leather in Mr. Miller's cellar; it was on a Saturday, in the month of March; it was inner sole leather, three pieces; I did not know for what purpose it was there for; I missed it on the Monday week following, on Saturday from thence I saw three pieces of a bigger size, then I acquainted Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Do you know what became of these three last pieces? - I missed them at different times after I had told Mr. Miller; on a Tuesday I told Mr. Miller one pair was gone, during the time that these two pieces was there, I saw another piece concealed under the same board; there were two of them missed, and there was another piece concealed under another hole, which has been found since.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220106"/>That piece that the constable found, do you know it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How? - By the mark I put on it under the flaw; the cutting is the contrary way to the flaw.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you heard that this man was to set up for himself? - I heard it since he was taken up.</p>
               <p>He had been a long while in the service, did you know he was going to leave the service? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know he worked for himself? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a leather-cutter; here is a pair of soles which Mr. Miller bought of me, which have my mark upon them.</p>
               <p>What is the mark? - 5 and 6, signifying that they were 5 s. 6 d. a dozen.</p>
               <p>Did you mark them yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Any other bought at your shop, of the same value, would be so marked? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say this sole was sold to Mr. Miller, or some other person? - I am certain it was sold to Mr. Miller, because I save all I get of that price for Mr. Miller for this twelve-month last past.</p>

               <p>Did you sell them marked thus before this last twelve months? - Before that time I did, but not since.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when that mark was put on? - He sends for soles about once a fortnight, and generally hath four or five dozen at a time.</p>
               <p>Are you certain this pair was sold to him? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Suppose you had sold them a twelvemonth ago, would you know them from this? - I should not.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of March last, the prisoner at the bar offered me one of the parcels of wire for 10 s.; I can't swear to the parcel, but I believe it to be the same; the prisoner told me he bought it of one Mr. Grant; I went to Mr. Grant, and he said the prisoner never bought any; I gave the prisoner 8 s. and I received the wire from the prisoner, and was to give him 2 s. more the next morning, if I found he came honestly by it; I carried the wire to Mr. Hyam's the same night.</p>

Did you lock it? - I did not lock it, nor the office door neither, I shut the door; I returned in about ten minutes; I found the prisoner in the office, he offered me 10 s. to take for his 9 s. 8 d. I blamed him much for telling me a lye at first, and was rather surprised to find he had 10 s. after he had declared he had but 5 s. 3 d. when I took the 10 s. I saw a shilling which struck me I had seen before; I then opened my drawer, and began to look over my silver; the witness Saunders said immediately, you have lost your gold; I said I had; I rung the bell immediately, and inquired if any body else had been there, they said no; the prisoner remained there; there was a lad coming, who was in the passage, I believe; I bid him to shut both doors, and told the prisoner I must be under the necessity of searching him, on which he said, you need not search me, I have got 36 s. in my pocket; I laid hold of him, and immediately he pulled out the three half guineas, and some silver; I asked him, where he got it? he said it was his own money, and said I need not be surprised at his having that, for he had six and thirty shillings in his pocket which he had received of one Mr. Jaques that morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. The door of that house is opened in the time of publick business? - No, it is not kept open.</p>

               <p>I live in Elder Row, Marybone parish; I go out charing and washing; on the Thursday before Good-Friday I went to this man's house for some potatoes; he keeps a green grocer's shop; there was a gentleman buying some nonpareils; he gave his wife an old half guinea to change, and she scrupled it; I told her she need not be afraid, it would have many masters; she went to a box, and opened it, and there was another half guinea in it, some half crowns, and some small silver, they were altogether in a sampler, and put this old one with them.</p>
               <p>(The Prisoner holds up the Sampler.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. That is all you know of the matter; you say his wife took an old half guinea, which she put in a sampler with another half guinea, and some silver? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was going along with a friend; I had a great coat, with leather breeches, which fitted exceeding tight, so that I could not put one large seal in my fob; I had a friend with me, who is not here; there was a crowd in consequence of the illumination; I felt a person's hand on my fob; I immediately laid my hand on his wrist; after which I immediately felt a pluck at my seal from the hand which I had then hold of; I had hold of another person with my other hand; I quitted that person, and got hold of that person whose wrist I had got in my other hand; after which I still retained the hand, and I felt it evidently expanded open, there was at the time some soldiers coming past; with an amazing deal of trouble, I got into a house, and afterwards sent away to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you lose your watch? - I lost my watch.</p>
               <p>How could the prisoner have an opportunity of conveying away the watch when you had hold of his wrist? - I had only hold of part of his wrist.</p>
               <p>What became of the watch? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There was a very considerable crowd at that that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you the same misfortune as you have now with your eye? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Had you been at Bow-street that day about your other robbery? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect it? - To my knowledge I was not.</p>
               <p>You was going, as others were, to see the illuminations? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man was instantly secured with the seal in his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The man was instantly secured, and the watch could not be found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What promotion have you in the army - I have sold it out since.</p>
               <p>What regiment was you in? - In the twenty-ninth.</p>

               <p>You must recollect; do you recollect at what time nearly, you sold out? - The sale of it was on the day the first gazette came out after the King's recovery, I was in the gazette.</p>
               <p>Your watch never was recovered? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was this man searched? - I did not see him, the man who came from Bow-street said he was.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. No money was found at all on him only one penny? - No.</p>
               <p>And you searched the man intirely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was perfectly light, you could discern a man's features? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not then, as Mr. Hirst says, duskish; you can see perfectly well, perhaps better, in the dark than in the light? - It was rather light.</p>
               <p>You just now said it was perfectly light to discern a man's features? - It was in the month of March, near nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol with Creedland; on the 2d of March as we were going backwards and forwards, I saw Wood between Acton and Shepherd's-bush.</p>
               <p>Did he run away? - He did not, because he was seized; I brought him to a public-house and searched him; I found on him half a guinea, two half crown pieces, four shillings, and three six-pences (the money produced); I found this powder in his pocket (produced); I saw him throwing away the pistol.</p>
               <p>Did you find the pistol again? - I sent two men and they found it in the very spot where I apprehended him, in a field on the onside of the road, that is on the left side of the road going from here to Acton.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. On which side of the road was the other pistol thrown over? - On the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Court to Grant. What did you do with the pistols? - I unscrewed the barrel, and

               <p>How much did you lose? - One half guinea, one shilling, and two bad sixpences.</p>
               <p>Was there any of the money such as you could know again? - There was one of the six-pences I think I could recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you think you can positively say? - Money is such a thing one cannot scarcely swear to; I verily believe it was the money I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect any thing of the half guinea? - It is one of the late coin, one that looks pale.</p>
               <p>Was there any silver you could know? - One of the six-pences had a notch in it.</p>
               <p>Court. If it is not sufficient to swear to, we need not take up time? - I mean not to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Was there on any of the six-pences any marks? - Not to swear positively to.</p>
               <p>Can you describe the marks on the sixpence with the notch, such as they were; was there any thing else beside a notch; was it a thick one or a thin one; was it a remarkable thin one? - I cannot take on myself to say.</p>
               <p>Have you observed any other marks besides that notch? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether it was round or not? - I do not think it was quite round.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, look at that six-pence. and tell me how far you can speak to it? - This is, I believe, the very six-pence I had fourteen days in my pocket.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220114"/>Does the Inspection make you positive? - It does not, coin is such a singular thing for a man to be positive to.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Wood was my coachman, he lived with me three years, he was very honest, an exceeding good servant, and exceedingly attentive during the three years he was with me; I trusted my property to his care, and have sent him with cash to the bankers, to the amount of six hundred pounds at a time; I entrusted two hundred pounds to his care a very short time before he was discharged my service; he left me in February last, I did not discharge him for any fault, I had no further occasion for him; but on parting with him, told him, whenever I wanted a coachman again, I would take him into my service.</p>

                     <p>On condition of being transported for life.</p>
                     <p>Prisoner. I hope this honourable Court, or any of the Gentlemen in company, will not object to what I shall say; I have laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220118"/>in prison three years; I do not intend to object to my sentence, but I am not in a situation to go abroad; if I was I would go; the crime deserved Death; it is an injury to community, but I never was guilty of it; I have two small children; I have no objection to confinement for life; I cannot live long.</p>
                     <p>Court. Do you refuse to accept the King's mercy on the condition that has been read to you? - I am not in a condition to go.</p>
                     <p>Court. If you do not accept it now; I have no power; if you should wish for mitigation of that sentence; but after you have accepted it you may apply further for mitigation; but if you do not accept of these terms, you stand as a person condemned to suffer Death, and will be in the situation of those who are so condemned, and will certainly be ordered for execution, and it will be too late to recal your opinion; I recommend you to accept of that favour.</p>
                     <p>Prisoner. I only refer it to Mr. Curtis, and the Gentleman who attended on the Recorder to prove my innocence; I submit to confinement, if you think proper to give me time, 'till Mr. Simpson pronounces me fit to go, but not to send me away in a day or two; I accept his Majesty's mercy on that condition.</p>

                        <p>Court. It is my duty to tell you if you refuse the pardon now, it will be too late ever to expect it afterwards; consider what you are about; it is my duty to give you that notice, you certainly will be ordered immediately for execution.</p>

                        <p>Prisoner. I hope this honourable Court, or any of the Gentlemen in company, will not object to what I shall say; I have laid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220118"/>in prison three years; I do not intend to object to my sentence, but I am not in a situation to go abroad; if I was I would go; the crime deserved Death; it is an injury to community, but I never was guilty of it; I have two small children; I have no objection to confinement for life; I cannot live long.</p>
                        <p>Court. Do you refuse to accept the King's mercy on the condition that has been read to you? - I am not in a condition to go.</p>
                        <p>Court. If you do not accept it now; I have no power; if you should wish for mitigation of that sentence; but after you have accepted it you may apply further for mitigation; but if you do not accept of these terms, you stand as a person condemned to suffer Death, and will be in the situation of those who are so condemned, and will certainly be ordered for execution, and it will be too late to recal your opinion; I recommend you to accept of that favour.</p>

I only refer it to Mr. Curtis, and the Gentleman who attended on the Recorder to prove my innocence; I submit to confinement, if you think proper to give me time, 'till Mr. Simpson pronounces me fit to go, but not to send me away in a day or two; I accept his Majesty's mercy on that condition.</p>

               <p>I find there are several of you who have refused his Majesty's most gracious pardon on the present occasion; you have been convicted of very heinous offences, and you seem to forget that the King, in his great goodness has saved your lives; having saved your lives, your not being inclined to accept that pardon arises from a hope that you shall not be sent off so soon as the other prisoners; I think it my duty, who have not the power to alter the sentence at all, to tell you that this sort of conduct will be considered as an aggravation of your offences; and if you have any hopes that your sentence will be altered, you had much better accept of the King's pardon now, and try what interest you have to get that sentence mitigated; but if you go from the bar now, you will remain under sentence of death; and you may depend upon it, that you will suffer death with the first culprits, at the next execution; I think it my duty to state this to you, and to remind you of the most dreadful situation in which you stand; if after this notice you chuse to suffer death, which the law has ordered, I have done my duty in stating it to you, and you must take the consequence; I have sent for you that you may know your situation, and not be hurried to that which may bring you to a most disgraceful end; I hope you will take the advice of the Court, and accept of pardon, if not it will certainly be too late hereafter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Burgess. I am satisfied with what I hear about it, I will suffer death before ever I will go abroad with them; I am very well satisfied with the death that was ordered for me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Akerman. Take her away, and put her into the condemned cell by herself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Tyler. I will never accept of it to go abroad.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cutler. I think it is very hard; I will not accept it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cowden. I will not accept it; I will die first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Storer. I will not go out of my native country.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mills. I will not accept it; I will sooner die in my own country than be sent abroad.</p>
               <p>Court. Let these women be confined in separate cells, and fed on bread and water.</p>

               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on Mr. Hodgson's Plan, wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing: Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice, (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
