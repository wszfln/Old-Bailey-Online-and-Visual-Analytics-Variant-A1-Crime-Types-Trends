                  </hi>. I am one of the ushers, and gaoler of Marl<lb/>borough Street Police Court. On 14th Aug. the prisoner was in my custody in order to find sureties, and as I was removing him from the dock to one of the cells, he said, to the best of my recollection, that he would be revenged; and as he was going along the area towards the cell, near where the office keeper lives, he was going to make water—I told him that it was a very improper place to do that, and with a little coaxing I persuaded him to come on to where I showed him, and under the tank were two pails; he up with them one after another, I avoided them, and they penetrated into the bricks of the wall—I opened the cell door, and called a man named Saunders, who was there for stabbing his wife; he came to my assistance—the prisoner threw himself forward, and commenced kicking me just here, and I suffered a great deal of pain for a long time, and have been away from my duty for three months, and have great difficulty in doing my duty now—my impres<lb/>sion is that he had been drinking very hard—he had not been in custody above an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in custody, and Welch called on me to help him—I came out of my cell, and saw the prisoner flinging a zinc bucket, and then a wooden one; I fastened him by the arms, and on pulling him into the cell he made three or four kicks at him—after he got into the cell he stripped all his clothes off, tore up everything but his boots, and then laid down and went to sleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Great Marlborongh Street. On 14th Aug. I was called to the prosecutor, and found him in excruciating pain, just on the region of the liver—he was not able to speak, and breathed with very great difficulty—I considered him in considerable danger; he was under my care more than two months, and is complaining of considerable pain still—I consider that the prisoner was labouring under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> from drinking, and that he did not know what he was doing—hewas quite naked; he stripped himself from head to foot in the cell; I went to him, and he decidedly did not know what he was doing—it is impos<lb/>sible to say whether that was from drink or insanity, but I understand that he had been drinking to excess the night before—he has been a soldier, and he says he received a wound in his head, and when he drinks he is wan<lb/>dering—hewas considered as not fit to take his trial, and was sent to an asylum.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach trimmer, of No. 1, Cottage Place, York Street, Lambeth. On Saturday evening, 19th Dec., about 6 o'clock, I was at the top of Strutton Ground; I was quite sober—I went into a public house, and had half a quartern of gin and some hot water—I paid for it, and got some change, but I cannot say how much—a sixpence dropped, and the prisoner assisted me to look for it, but we were not able to find it—he said that he was out of work, and with a good deal of persuasion I stood a pint of beer for him, and then got away as well as I could, but he kept pushing against me, and saying, "Stop a little bit, master"—I had drank about half a glass of stout with him before I gave him the pint of beer—I drunk some of the pint—after I got out I walked from one end of Strutton Ground to the other; I then heard a voice behind me, saying, "I say," or something like that—I turned round, and saw the prisoner; his hand was in my pocket in a moment, where I had got a pocket book containing 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a tobacco box—there were two half sovereigns, and the rest in silver, I cannot say of what kind—I missed my pocket book in a moment—he then said, "All right," and shoved me down—I tried to <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> him, but could not—I got up directly, and went up Pear Street; I did not lose sight of him till he got to the top of the street—I spoke to a policeman, and went to the station house; a policeman went with me to the Corner Pin public house, Strutton Ground, and saw the barman—the prisoner was in front of the bar; I gave him in charge.</p>

Ansell and Hobbs, of Gresham Street, City, on the night of the 3d, or the morning of the 4th of the present month—he said, after the caution I had given him, he should reserve his defence—I then proceeded to search the house—I found several things, but not connected with this indictment.</p>

I said, "No," and he went to the door and spoke to an officer—the prisoner knelt down behind the counter, pulled off his shoes and stockings, and I heard something drop which sounded like gold; but he held a two shilling piece in his hand and said that it was that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and live in Bermondsey Street. On Thursday night, 24th Dec., I was in Leadenhall Market, at the lower end of the poultry market, about 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there; it was rather in a dark place between the stalls—I was going to purchase an article, and did not like to pull out my money before the stall, and went a little further on—there was a great crowd—I stopped, and the prisoner came right in front of me, and put his fingers working away at my waistcoat—I looked down and saw his hand drop from my watch guard—I saw my guard hanging without the watch—I said to the prisoner, "You have taken my watch"—he said, "What, me?"—I said, "Yes"—I took him by the collar, held him that he could not run away, called a policeman, and gave him in custody—hestood pretty quiet when I had got him by the collar—I have seen my watch since—it is here now—it came to me by the parcels delivery—this is my watch—it is in the same state in which I received it—the chain is broken—therewere a great many people about, but no person on my right hand—Istood and let the people pass—the prisoner would not go by me—I saw him drop my chain from his left hand—I had had my watch not half a minute before I had left the stall—I merely went there, not a yard off.</p>

On the night of 26th Dec, I met the prisoner by the Eagle in the City Road—I had a glass of ale with him at the corner of Britannia Street—I afterwards went home with him to my room; he stopped there about half an hour—he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after he had stayed with me, he wanted to stay with me all night—I told him he could not do so—he then wanted his money back, and made use of very bad language—I told him he should not—it was in my pocket—he then threw me on the side of the bed, and put his hands round me, and said he would murder me if I did not give it up to him again—I begged of him to let me go, and when he let me go, I attempted to run out of doors; he went to the fire place and got the poker, and as I turned round he struck me on the side of the head—I had got just outside the room door, and he pushed me down the stairs—I got up and ran into the kitchen—he ran after me, threw me down in the kitchen, and knelt on my chest while he took my money—I struggled and got from him, and then he struck me on the back of the head with a piece of the tongs, and I know no more—I have been an inmate of the hospital ever since—when the prisoner first came in, he said he would stay all night; and then he preferred staying a short time—I submitted myself to him, and then he said he would have his money back.</p>

On the evening of 26th Dec., I was in the back parlour; I heard a cry of murder, and ran into the kitchen—I saw the prisoner kneel<lb/>ing on the prosecutrix's chest, fumbling at her pockets; she was bleeding very much from the front of her head—the prisoner said that she had better turn up his b—stuff—I ran into the street to call for help; Davis followed me, and the prisoner followed her with a part of the tongs in his hand; he struck her on the head, and she fell senseless at my feet at the door—I went and called the police, and when I returned, I found her in the room, lying sense<lb/>less on the floor—I got a cab, and took her to the hospital.</p>

She had two slight wounds on the scalp, one in front, the other behind; the bleeding had then stopped—the wound in front was about three quarters of an inch in length, rather jagged; the one behind was an inch and a quarter in length—they were dressed under my superinten<lb/>dence, and she went away again that same night—they were not serious wounds—she might have been insensible from loss of blood—I saw her again on the Monday, and I then took her into the hospital in obedience to the Magistrate's request—she complained of pain in the stomach, and of having spat blood—I admitted her from that reason, not on account of the wounds.</p>

I had been up rather late with my master, and was going to bed—I was half undressed, and heard a shutter fall—I looked over the window curtain, and saw a second shutter fall, and then heard a great noise of glass, and saw a man's head and shoulders going through, <hi rend="italic">grabbing</hi> at the watches—I hallooed out, "Police!" as hard as I could, and he got out of the window and was caught by a policeman—the prisoner is the man, I will swear to him—I saw the policeman pursue him.</p>

About half past 2 o'clock on the morning of the 18th I heard a great crash in the Edgware Road, and the falling of a shutter on the pavement—I saw the prisoner run from Mr. Tattersall's window, and heard somebody call "Stop thief!"—I pursued him—hewas not above a yard from the window when I saw him—I did not lose sight of him at all—after running some time, another constable, who was on duty on the other side of the street, ran across and clasped him round the waist, and they both fell together—they got on their feet and both ran; I kept the prisoner in sight, and he was stopped by Sergeant Edwards—I only lost sight of him for an instant, when he turned the corner of Chapel Street and ran into the sergeant's arms.</p>

               <p>I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running—I stopped him in Burn Street; he threw something out of his right hand through a cellar flap, within a yard of where I stopped him; in fact, we were on one part of the cellar flap—I told Bowden to examine the cellar, and took the prisoner to the station—I found this brass rod (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and some price tickets lying a few yards from the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I was in Bagnigge Wells Road in plain clothes, on 22d Dec.—I saw the two prisoners, and I called the attention of the last witness to them—I first saw Mary Ann Dnrrant smile, and beckon with her hand as a sign to Robert Durrant to keep back—Robert Durrant was standing at the corner of Swinton Street; Mary Ann Durrant went and joined him there, and I saw Robert Durrant take from his pocket a <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi>, and take something out and pass it to Mary Ann Durrant—she went to the corner of Acton Street, and Robert Durrant went into Mr. Williams' shop—I saw him come out of the shop, and the prisoners joined each other, and walked up Acton Street into Gray's Inn Road—I followed them from the tobacconist's to Mr. Payne's—Robert went into Mr. Payne's, and Mary Ann sat down on a step—I directed Little to go in and see what money Robert passed, while I kept sight of Mary Ann—I had told Little to make a sign to me if the money was bad—he made the sign, and I took Mary Ann into custody—I told her I should take her for passing bad money; she said she knew nothing about it—I saw her putting her hand under her shawl, I said, "What is it?"—I lifted up her shawl, and a paper dropped, which I took, and it contained this bad shilling which was passed at Mr. Williams' shop, the one that Partington had bent—she had a pocket handkerchief which I took from her hand, and there was something in one eornor—I said, "What is this?" she said, "Four sixpences, sir"—I took the other corner and found this bad shilling tied in it—I then saw that Robert Durrant was beginning to be very violent with Little—I went and said, "l am a police<lb/>man;" he then said he would go with me, but soon afterwards he seized me by the throat, and began kicking me, and treated me very violently indeed—whenat the station, <hi rend="smallCaps">MARY ANN DURRANT</hi> gave me 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her pocket—Robert Durrant said he did not know the woman, and when she was brought in we asked her if she knew the man; she said, yes, he was her husband—shewould have given her address, but he told her not to do it.</p>

I was on duty in Chapel Street, about half past three o'clock on 11th Dec.—I saw the two prisoners together walking on the pavement in the direction of Seymour Street—about an hour after that I saw Mr. Sewell; I went with him to Weir's Passage, and at the bottom of it I took Powell into custody—Mr. Sewell gave me this half crown, and brought Smithers to me—he said she had been in his brother in law's shop, in Seymour Street, and had offered a half crown, and also at Mrs. Blower's, in Charlton Street—Powell said, what did I take him for—I said, "For being in company with this woman passing bad money"—he said, "I don't know the woman"—she made no observation—as I was taking Powell along he put his hand in his trousers pocket, looked me in the face, and dropped a bag on the stones—Mr. Sewell picked it up, and gave it to me—it contained this money, which was so carefully done up that I could not replace it in the same way—there was tissue paper between each of them—I found in it twenty florins, eleven half crowns, fifteen shillings, and three 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces—amongstthem was this half crown, that Mr. Sewell identified—it has been chopped by a large knife—2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on Smithers, which Mrs. Blower had given her in change for the half crown—on Powell was found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some snuff, a <hi rend="italic">porte monnaie</hi> some Queen heads, a crochet collar, and some envelopes.</p>

This half crown that has been chopped, is a counter<lb/>feit of George IV., 1819—all the coins in this bag are counterfeit—the three crowns are of George III., and are from one moulds—three of these half crowns are from the same mould—the one that was uttered is George IV., 1839—of these twenty florins, thirteen are from one mould, and seven from another—five of these shillings are from one mould, two from another, and six from another, and two separate ones—they were all done up in the usual way with bad coin, to keep them from rubbing.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, D</hi> 16). On Thursday, 24th Dec, I took the prisoner at Kensington—I had been in search of him since three days, after his discharge by the Magistrate on 5th Nov.—Sankey was before the Magistrate on the day prisoner was discharged at Marlborough Street—I found the prisoner in a public house; I called him out and told him I wanted him, and he must consider himself in custody, charged with being concerned with Sankey and others, who were convicted in Oct., in stealing a great quantity of property, plate, jewellery, linen, and other articles, from No. 68, Great Portland Street—he said, "That is a bad job; I am glad I am taken; if I get twenty years I shall be easy in my mind." On our way to the Mary-le-bone Police Station, I had called another constable in uniform to my assistance, and he said, "Potter, I should like to speak to you personally;" that was in Bayswater Road—he said, "You are a d—d fine fellow I can see, you make me think of Sankey, we understand each other, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to square me in this job"—I said, "Is that all you have to say? if that is all we must go on"—he said, "Do not take me any farther, take my word I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in three hours"—I said, "You must come on to Mary-le-bone Lane police station"—on the road, he repeated the offer of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. several times—after I had lodged him in the station, I took Hammond, a constable, with me, and went and searched the prisoner's lodgings, a marine store dealer's, No. 18, Warren Street, and in a drawer in the parlour, I found this linen which has been identified, and a quantity more which could not be positively sworn to—I asked the prisoner coming along the road what account he gave of the bread basket and coffee pot which had been sold at his shop; he said, "that <hi rend="italic">licks</hi> you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you ever said that before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not state it at the police court, but this is not the first time I have said it—it slipped my memory, but I mentioned it at the station—it was about seven weeks after Davis brought him up, and charged him with making him drunk, that I apprehended him; it was in the evening, he seemed to have been drinking then—I did not have anything to drink with him, he very politely asked me to have a drop of gin and water; perhaps he thought he had got a Sankey to deal with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 34, Paradise Street, City Road. On 11th Dec. I was called in to see the child, Mary Coney—I found a discoloration on the right temple, about the size of a half crown—she was labouring under great difficulty of breathing, and fainting; I could not account for it at that time, I imagined it was from fright, from what the mother told me—she rallied, and got apparently well; but the symptoms were continually repeated, and I was continually fetched to see her, and administered medicines to her until Wednesday, 30th Dec., when I saw her last—shewas then in a worse state as to breathing and fainting than I had seen her previously, and she died in that state about 6 o'clock in the morning—I made a post mortem examination next day, and found on the right temple a discoloration about the size of a half crown—it continued much the same through the whole depth of the skull on that side, but no further—the inside of the head was perfectly healthy under that part, and all the brain until I came to the left lobe, where I found a clot of blood about the size of a hen's egg, about two ounces of extravasated dark coloured blood, and some soften<lb/>ing, or disorganization of the surrounding mass of brain—every other part of the brain was perfectly healthy, and so were the other parts of the body—I attribute the cause of death to the clot, and I believe that to have been caused by the blow on the right temple—the appearances always follow on the opposite side to the blow, it is a law in surgery—I know of no disease which would cause similar appearances—I should say the external mark was caused by some instrument; it might be by a fall, or a blow of the fist, or a strap.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 90, Fetter Lane, and am commission agent for Mr. William Simpson, of Birmingham. From a communication I received on 26th or 27th Sept., I called at Union Wharf, Limehouse, and saw a clerk who is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, from whom, on a second visit, I received this letter—I went again, five or six days afterwards, and saw the clerk again—(I was the person who spoke to Devoll before the policeman did; that was in Albany Street, Regent's Park, about four weeks ago—I said, "I believe your name is Devoll".—he said, "No; I am a stranger from the country, my name is Jones"—after I had given him in charge at Poplar Station, I said to him on the road to Harbour Square, "The clerk you had at the wharf was a very sharp fellow"—he said, "He was; it was no use engaging a fool"—I said, "He did very well the business that you engaged him to do"—he said, "He did, and I paid him very well for it; and all that he did, he did by my direction"—on 27th Sept. I called at the wharf, pre<lb/>sented my card to the clerk, and informed him that I was led to believe that Mr. Devoll wished to order some fenders, and I had called to submit my prices and patterns to him—he said that Mr. Devoll was not there, but expressed his own willingness to look over them; he did so, and said he approved of them, and that other parties had submitted their patterns to Mr. Devoll—one or two fenders were lying there, which he pointed to—we are fender manufacturers—he said that as far as he was concerned he preferred mine, and should use his influence to induce Mr. Devoll to take mine—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185801040048"/>
               <p>said that they were for shipping, and that if I would call the next day but one, the 30th, I should see Mr. Devoll at 12 o'clock—when I called on the 30th, at a few minutes before twelve o'clock, he said that Mr. Devoll had important business at Sudbury, which rendered it necessary for him to leave by train, but had instructed him to give me this order—(<hi rend="italic">This was for twelve dozen bronze and black fenders; six dozen ditto spear foots; six dozen ditto bright round ends; and three dozen ditto 4ft. to 4ft. 6in.; signed, Henry Devoll</hi>)—he said that we must send him up the goods in a fortnight's time—Iobjected, that being such a short period, but he said that they were to be shipped for the Australian market in a vessel of Mr. Devoll's, one which was then loading, and would be ready to sail a few days after that period, and we must execute the order in that time, or he would give it to some one else—I under<lb/>took to do so—there were eighteen or twenty tons of iron rails lying there—hepointed to them, and said that they were a lot which Mr. Devoll had bought; that he had sold them, and should supply their place as soon as they were removed—he mentioned that we must give him six month's credit with the fenders, to which I objected, and told him our terms were nett at a month—he said that six months' credit was usual in the iron trade—I said that it was not common—he said that he bought the iron which I then saw at six months' credit, and should supply its place on the same terms—I asked for one or two days longer to supply the goods, and stated that they should be there precisely on the day he mentioned—I went again, scarcely a week after, and saw the same person—I called to know whether the goods were to be packed in tin, or whether we should send them up in crates, as we usually do—he said we were to send them up in crates, as they had a packer themselves—I asked him how it would remunerate them to pay the freight on fenders to Sydney, they being bulky articles—he said that they had cases made expressly, which had three partitions, holding wire at one end, screws, or similar goods, at the other, and fenders and soft goods, such as hosiery, which would pack with the fenders, in the middle—on the receipt of this letter, dated 23d Oct., I went to the wharf and saw the clerk, and also a lad—I inquired whether the fenders had arrived—he said that nineteen crates had arrived, but five were deficient, and requested me to see after them, as the vessel would sail imme<lb/>diately, and it would be very inconvenient if the vessel sailed—en the morn<lb/>ing of 24th Oct., I received this letter, dated the 23d—I have seen the clerk write, and believe it to be his.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Union Wharf. Mr. Moseley. Sir, Mr. Devoll waited as long as he could for you.</p>

               <p>He desired me to say you could draw on him, provided you can allow three per cent. off. Yours respectfully, <hi rend="italic">p.p.</hi> H. Devoll.")—I was not introduced to Bristow as one of the firm—I mentioned to him that I had called, not hearing from him as to the settlement, as he had promised to write to me—hesaid that he had written that letter, and was going to post it for me, and that if I called a little later in the day, I should find him there—this con<lb/>versation took place on the step of the door in the public house—I asked the clerk if he would take a glass of ale; he said, "Yes," and we went in, and ordered a glass of ale each, and inside stood Mr. Bristow, but I was not introduced to him, or told who he was—he spoke to the clerk, saying he would call again on Friday—the clerk said, "No, make it Saturday;" Bristow replied that Friday would suit him better, as he wanted the money: the clerk said, "Still make it Saturday;" upon which Bristow left, and the clerk and I left almost immediately, I saying that I would proceed to Poplar, and call at the wharf on my return—I did so, but did not find Devoll—some days afterwards I was going down to the wharf with Mr. Taylor, and at the bridge across the road at Stepney Station, in sight of the wharf, I met the clerk, Mr. Bristow, and another person, who I believe to be Devoll—they dispersed as quickly as they could on seeing Taylor and me—we were on our way to the wharf to take the prisoners into custody, in consequence of information which we had received—the clerk endeavoured to get into a urinal, but I waited for him, and then he said that he had to go up by the railway, and darted from me—I had not asked for a reference, but one wag tendered to me, Charles McKinnell and Co., No. 9, Great St. Helen's—there were two offices there in the name of Charles McKinnell and Co., late Alfred Gibson and Co,—Iwas satisfied with the reference I got there, hearing a good account of them, and the goods were sent—they said that they had had several transac<lb/>tions which had always been settled satisfactorily, and inquired if the amount was large—I said about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said that we were perfectly safe in doing that—I went to Albany Street on 16th Dec., with the policeman Sheridan.</p>

                  </hi>. I have an office in Laurence Pountney Hill, and am agent to Paul Moore, a wire drawer of Birmingham—on 14th or 15th Sept. I received a letter at my office, in consequence of which I went on 15th Sept. to Union Wharf, Narrow Street, Limehouse; I saw a person who represented himself as Mr. Devoll's managing clerk, and who went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—Ishowed him this letter, and he said, "We sent you this"—(<hi rend="italic">This was a request to be informed of the price of brass and copper wire, and the discount for prompt payment, signed, Henry Devoll</hi>)—I gave him a printed list of brass and copper wire, which he said he would show Mr. Devoll, who was out—hesaid that Mr. Devoll was a merchant, that he came there of a morning and saw his letters, and arranged his business, was out all day in the city, and came back again and wrote his letters—I said that I should very much like to see him, and if he would write to me I would keep any appointment he chose to make, either at his office or mine; and that I could recommend a certain quality of wire, which I pointed out, very highly; I showed him patterns of it, and left—a day or two after I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and I wrote saying that I would call on Friday, the 18th—when I went, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> acknowledged having written the letter, and said he was very sorry that Mr. Devoll had been obliged to go out, but that he had left me an order for seventeen bundles of iron wire if they could be delivered on Saturday, as they formed part of an order which they had to send to Canterbury that day, by barge—I said that it was a very short time, but I would write down specially about it, and it ought to be there on Monday at the latest—I then took the order, and left—I said that I hoped we should do business together, and repeated my desire to see Mr. Devoll; he said that he was very sorry he was out, but no doubt he would write to me and make an appointment—on 24th Sept. I received another letter acknowledging the receipt, and about 14th or 15th Oct. I received another letter in reply—I called again on 30th Oct. to get the money for the seventeen bundles; I saw <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> again, and he told me that Mr. Devoll was on his eastern and north-eastern journey, and he was very sorry he had not got money enough in the petty cash or else he would pay me—on Thursday, 5th Nov., I called again for the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that Mr. Devoll had stopped at Sudbury on his way back, that he had written to him there, and that he would certainly be in town on Monday—I had not on 24th Oct. received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I had received information from Paul Moore, &amp; Co. of it, and it was afterwards forwarded to me—I never received my money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 433). On 16th Dec. I went with Mr. Moseley to Albany Street, Regent's Park; we met Devoll in the street, and I said, "Mr. Moseley, there is <hi rend="italic">Harry"</hi>—I was waiting inside for him to come—Iwent up to him and said, "Your name is Henry Devoll?"—he said, "No, it is not"—I said, "I will take you into custody as Henry Devoll, on a charge of conspiring with others, not in custody, to obtain goods by false pretences from William Simpson, of Birmingham, and others"—he said, "Who will take the responsibility of this charge upon him? it is a serious charge"—I said, "Mr. Moseley;" and Mr. Moseley said, "Yes, I will take the respon<lb/>sibility upon me"—he said, "I am not the man at all; my name is Jones; I am a stranger here, and come from the country"—I asked him where he resided; he said, "In Compton Street, Soho," but he did not know the number of the house or the name of the landlord—I asked him if he knew Mrs. Franklyn; he said, "No"—I said, "I am satisfied that you are Mr. Henry Devoll, and that you have come now from Mrs. Franklyn's, and I shall take you to the station"—I knew that lady, and went there to meet him, from information that he was sleeping there that night—she was at the house where I expected he had come from—I took him to Poplar station—on the way to the Court, Mr. Moseley said to him, "The clerk you had, Mr. Devoll, at the wharf was a sharp one?"—he replied, "Yes, it would be no use my employing a fool"—Mr. Moseley said, "You employed him for a certain purpose, and from my conversation with him no doubt he is the fittest man you could employ for that purpose; he did his business well"—Devoll said, "I gave him orders, and for obeying my instructions I paid him well"—on Saturday last I went to look for M'Kinnell and Co., at No. 9, Great St. Helen's, and a painter was brushing the name off the door; I could not find any one representing the firm at all; I went several times, and have never been able to find them.</p>

Bird and Co. to him—I told him I understood that could not be so, as the rails were allowed to remain by his permission, when he took the wharf—he said that he did allow them to remain there for a short time; but the understanding was that they were to be taken away soon after he took the wharf, and that I could not suppose he was to allow the rails to remain there fourteen weeks without some rent, and he had been put to some expense by moving them about from time to time—I was anxious to get the wharf, and asked him what he would take to give up the wharf, together with the iron rails; and ultimately he said that he would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I would see Messrs. Bird about it—after seeing them I saw him again, and agreed to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produced this bill to him, and asked him for the duplicate of it, and produced this paper to him—he cancelled it, and signed this receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the document admitting the iron rails on the premises to belong</p>

I did so; and in about ten minutes he came with 46lbs. of lead, for which I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account, and he was to bring me the rest in the afternoon; but before that he was given into custody by his master, on suspicion of stealing a coat—the prisoner told me, on the Saturday after he was remanded, that the lead came from the oil mills, that he did not take it, but Ward got up and took it and he was below—he told me where the remainder was, and I accompanied the sergeant, but could not find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Regent Street, Deptford, and am a porter in the service of the South-Eastern Railway Company. On Sunday, 29th Nov., I was on duty at the Deptford station at the time of the arrival of the train which left London at 10.12—I had charge of the semaphore and the tele<lb/>graph—onthe arrival of that train I left my room for the purpose of altering the semaphore, and the regulator then, for the down line, was "Block"—whenwe mark ours to "Block," the one on the Eastern Junction would do the same; the same action would move them both—I might have been out of my room about a minute; when I returned, I found the prisoner just coming out of the room—my attention was first called to the instrument by a sound on the gong, which indicated that it was an answer from the man at the Junction, that I had telegraphed "All clear down"—I looked at my instrument, and found it had been changed from "Block" to "Clear"—in order to effect that, it would be necessary for a person to move the second of these pumps—those things we move are called "Pumps"—it would be necessary to push in this second pump—I found also that the needle which referred to the Greenwich up train had been altered; that had been altered from "Clear" to "Block"—in order to do that, a person would have to move the third of these pumps—when I found the prisoner coining out of the room, I asked him what he had been doing to my instrument; he said, "Nothing," and he passed round by the side of me, to go to the next door to give his ticket—I put my hand on his shoulder, and said to the ticket collector, "This man has been at my instrument"—the policeman was sent for, and the prisoner was detained in custody—this instrument was fixed in my room, exactly five feet from the ground—when I left my room, I had pulled the door close to—the door which persons go out at, is three or four yards further than my room—a great many persons that were in the train had gone out at that door—when the policeman was sent for, the ticket collector told the prisoner to come into the room; and he said to him, "See what you have done to this instrument"—the prisoner said, "I have done nothing"—he said to him, "What business had you in this room?"—the prisoner said he had not been in at first, and afterwards he said he thought it was the way out—the ticket collector asked him where he lived; he said, "At Greenwich"—he said, "It is very strange, if you live at Greenwich, that you should get out here;" the prisoner said, "That is my business"—hethen said he came to see a friend—the ticket collector said, "Where do you live at Greenwich?"—he said, "I live at Mr. Gordon's, the grocer; I am assistant to him"—the prisoner afterwards said he might have fallen against the instrument—he appeared sober; he might have had a little to drink, but he knew what he was doing—the change made there in the</p>

I was on duty on the night this occurred—I think between thirty and forty per<lb/>sons were the passengers who got out of that train—I took the tickets of them as they went out at the ordinary gate, which gate is between me and the train—I saw the prisoner that night, he was in the act of giving me his ticket; he was followed by the last witness—all the passengers were gone with the exception of two, a man and a woman—the prisoner was behind them, he was the last person going out—the porter put his hand on his shoulder and said, "This man has been at my instrument, he has altered the needles"—I said to the prisoner, "What have you been doing?"—he said, "Nothing"—Itook him back to the room where the instruments were, I said to him, "You have been in here;" he said, "I have not"—I said, "That is wrong, for the porter saw you coming out;" he said, "If I have been in, I came in thinking it was the way out"—I said, "That is impossible for you to think, for the passengers all went out at the other door, and you ought to have followed them;" and I said, "Even admitting that you came in thinking it was the way out, you had no business to touch that instrument; you have done that which will endanger the lives of the passengers, and rendered yourself liable to transportation"—he said, "If I have touched it, I must have fallen against it;" I said, "It is impossible for you to have done that, for there is nothing to fall against"—I asked him where he lived, he said at Greenwich; I think he said at Mr. Barber's—I said, "It is strange if you live at Greenwich that you should get out at Deptford, and alter that instrument"—he said he had got to see a friend; I said, "It is a strange time of night to go visiting friends;" he said, "That is my business"—I was not satisfied with the address he gave, and I sent for a policeman—the prisoner said, "Do you intend locking me up?" I said, "I do indeed"—he put up both his hands and gave me a violent shove, and said, "I am off home;" I caught him by the handkerchief and said, "Indeed you are not"—a violent struggle ensued, the policeman came and locked him up—after he was in custody he said, "You can do the best you can now, and I will serve you out for it afterwards"—thereis no question that he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—I should say the room was 20 feet by 14, it is a very large room—it used to be the second class waiting room—the door is in the centre of the room, and on the left hand side this instrument was placed—you must go into the room and turn yourself quite round to see the face of the instrument.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner, residing now at Frederick Place, Limehonse. On 20th Nov. last, I embarked on board the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> at Ham<lb/>burgh, for London—I had been shipwrecked, and was a Consul passenger returning to London—I went on board About 8 o'clock on Friday night—I did not see the prisoner personally till he was down below, for I could not tell who he was in the dark—I was standing by the gangway a little after 10 o'clock, I think it was, when he came on board—the deceased officer, Thain, came on board by himself—three other gentlemen were behind him, and two porters carrying the luggage—the prisoner came on board after Thain, accompanied by two gentlemen—they all went down to the fore cabin toge<lb/>ther—Iafterwards saw the prisoner in the cabin—he then had the handcuffs on his bands—he was sitting without his trousers, and was complaining that the irons were hurting him—that might be about half an hour after seeing him on the gangway, I cannot say exactly—the other men who had accompanied him had not left the vessel; they left after the prisoner had his irons on—we sailed about 5 o'olock the next morning, Saturday—the two gentlemen were standing at the doorway when I saw the prisoner in the private cabin—they were the two gentlemen who accompanied him on board; Thain was in the cabin with the prisoner—I did not see who put on the handcuffs—they were on him at the time I speak of—the officer said if he behaved himself he would treat him as a gentleman—he complained that the irons hurt him, that they were too small for him, and the officer sent for the captain—he said to the prisoner, "I have been warned of you; but I will take them off when we get to England, if you behave yourself"—I heard no more conversation at that time—there were three berths in the cabin—we sailed at 5 o'clock on Saturday morning—on Sunday afternoon, about 4 o'clock, I heard the report of firearms; I was lying down in a berth close to the cabin door, where the prisoner used to stop—on hearing the report I jumped out of the berth; and with my feet I drove in the door of the cabin, in which the prisoner and Thain were—on getting into the cabin it was full of smoke—I saw the prisoner and Thain; the prisoner was sitting on a chest, Thain was standing up, holding on to him with one hand, and with the other on his own breast—he said, "The prisoner has shot me"—I seized hold of the prisoner by his hands and dragged him out of the cabin—Thain came out with him, holding on to one arm, the other he kept on his own breast—I saw blood on his finger ends when he took them out of his breast—on getting outside the cabin door I asked the prisoner where the pistol was—he said it was lying on the chest where he had been sitting—I went back into the cabin and found the pistol where he had said—there was likewise some loose powder scattered on the floor—I asked the prisoner why he had done such a thing—hesaid the officer had broke faith with him; he had not kept his word as a gentleman, and he would shoot him or any other man like a dog who broke faith with him—he said he loaded the pistol alongside of the bed berth where they slept, by holding it up against the side; that he put the powder in by guess; there might have been one charge, or two, or three; but there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185801040066"/>
               <p>quite enough to kill him—he said nothing further then—he was dragged on deck when that passed—he said he had got the pistol out of the chest he was sitting on; that he bought the pistol in Hamburgh, to shoot a man of the name of Miller who had swindled him out of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he got the pistol out of the chest by breaking down a brass thing that hung a lamp up—after that he was taken charge of by some of the crew of the vessel, and I had nothing more to do with him—since my return to England I have seen the dead body at Guy's Hospital—it was the body of the same person I saw onboard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after Thain came on board did the prisoner come on board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They all came on board together—the officer (Thain) stepped on board fint, and the other three gentlemen were behind him—that is what I call coming on board together—I suppose the gentlemen were foreigners—I had no conversation with them, I heard that they were foreigners—they looked like it—they spoke English, with rather a German accent—they appeared to me to be Hamburgh police officers, but they had no uniform on—I sopposed they were officers from their bringing the prisoner on board—I do not know whether they were officers or whether they were private gentlemen—I said they were gentlemen—I believed them to be foreign gentlemen—the prisoner was handcuffed before they left—do not know who he was complaining to about the handcuffs hurting him; he complained to them all—he spoke in English what I heard—I do not understand German; I understand nothing but English—I think it was a little after 4 o'clock on the Sunday afternoon that I heard the report of the pistol—that was ihe 22d Nov.—I kicked over the cabin door and went in—the conversation I had with the prisoner was in the fore cabin, after he came out of the private cabin—the cabin was full of people by that time—there was great confusion aid excitement on board—I cannot say about any alarm—the people were all talking at once—ther seized hold of him and dragged him out, and they wanted to Lynch him there and then—some were for hanging him, and some were for stretching him, and some were for throwing him overboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrates at the South<lb/>wark Police Court. I accompanied Mr. Combe, the Magistrate, on 28th Nov: last, to Guy's Hospital; I there found the officer Thain in bed, wounded; the prisoner was also there—Thain wai sworn; I swore him, in the presence of Mr. Combe—he then made a statement in the presence of the prisoner, which I took down in writing; this is the statement—it was read over in the hearing of the prisoner, and he was asked by the Magistrate if he wished to put my questions to Thain—he said, "No"—Thain signed the statement in my presence and the presence of the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi>"Charles Thain saith as follows: I am a City of London detective police officer. On the afternoon of the 19th Nov. instant I had the prisoner in custody at Hamburg, and this day week we sailed in the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> steamer, from Hamburg to London—we were in the cabin be asked me to take which I held the key of—on last Sunday, in the forenoon, the prisoner and I were in the cabin together—he complained of being ill—he aiked me to take the handcuffs off; I said I was not allowed to do it; he and I were in charge of the captain, who would not allow me to do it he said I had broken faith with him—I said that faith was not placed in my hands at sea, but when we arrived in England I would take them off if he behaved himself—we turned into our berths in the saane cabin—about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock, I got up and left the cabin, and went to the water closet, having locked up the cabin, and left him there—I returned in about a quarter of an hour—I went into the cabin, and found he was sitting on a folding carpet stool, directly opposite the centre of his berth—I said, "Mr. Sattler, <hi rend="italic">aint</hi> you going to have any tea to-day?"—hesaid, "No, I do not think I will"—I had a Mackintosh cape in my hand, and while I was in the act of placing it away, he stood upy and all at once he fired at me—I felt wounded on the right nipple, and cried out, "Murder!"—I laid hold of my bag, which was on my bed, and I laid hold of the prisoner and dragged him out, and told the men to secure him, as I was shot; and I was taken to the after cabin.'

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, residing at Manchester. I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi>, from Hamburg to London—I did not see the prisoner and deceased on the Saturday that we sailed—I saw them on the Sunday, they were near the fore cabin—nothing took place between them in my hearing on that occasion—I noticed that the officer was very kind to the prisoner; he inquired if he would take anything, and I thought it was very kind of him—about 4 o'clock that afternoon I saw the officer wounded; about twenty minutes after that I saw the prisoner; he was then on deck, seated upon a cover which covers a portion of the ship in which the cargo is placed—Idid not say anything to him further than apologize for stepping upon him, for it was then dark—I stepped on him and laid, "I beg your pardon, sir."</p>

               <p>and when I heard his voice I knew it was the prisoner—I am not aware that anything more passed then; shortly after he went down into the cabin—I went down immediately after—I asked him if he was aware what he had done—he said he had shot the officer—I said, "Yes you have, you have shot him in the right breast;" he said, "No, it was the left one"—I said, "No, you have shot him in the right one"—he asked me if the balls had gone through and through; I said they had not—he then asked me if I thought the officer would die; I told him I did not think he would—I asked him if there were more balls than one; he said, "Yes, there were two"—I said, "You are guilty of a very rash act; I am very sorry for it"—he said the officer had not kept faith with him; that when he was in Hamburgh he had promised not to iron him, but when he got him on board the ship he put the handcuffs on him; and that he told the officer at that time if he had him one half hour alone what he would do—he said he could not look over it, the officer had broken faith with him, and he would shoot a man like a dog who broke faith with him—he said he had bought the pistol in Hamburgh, to shoot a man who owed him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he mentioned the gentleman's name, but I cannot remember what it was—he said it was his intention to have taken him in his coach outside the town and to have shot him—he said, "I subsequently suggested that I would take my own life, but the officer came on me rather suddenly, and I told him,'The pistol is as well in your breast as in mine'"—Ibelieve he also said that he was a Deist, a robber, and a murderer; that he had shot the officer, and he supposed he should be tried for it—when I told him that I thought the officer would die, he said he ought to have done, for there was shot sufficient in the pistol.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">ought to be taken, as to whether the prisoner was brought by force and involun<lb/>tarily from Hamburg; he submitted, from the prisoner's own declaration, that he should not have done the act if the officer had not broken faith with him, that there was an agreement between them, by which he voluntarily undertook to come to England; in all the cases referred to by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">the question had been, whether the attempt to arrest the party at the time of his apprehension was lawful or unlawful, and if unlawful, whether the offence was reduced to man<lb/>slaughter; but no case could be found where, after a submission to the taking, the party had recourse to a deadly weapon, from some private motive of com<lb/>plaint, and then sought to reduce the offence below murder, by a subsequent objec<lb/>tion to the authority under which he was confined; he would suppose the case of a man in gaol on a bad warrant, and that before it was discovered to be bad, a new warrant was forwarded to the gaol; would not that be a new justification to the gaoler for detaining the man? so, supposing the river at Hamburg was not a place within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, which might be open to some question, yet, as soon as he came on the high seas, the officer would be in an analogous position to the gaoler; in that ease, the prisoner's being a foreigner would make no difference; he was on board a British ship, and therefore subject to British law, and the moment he arrived on the high seas, any person was at liberty to take or detain him, and bring him here to answer to a charge of felony, on the condition that that person, if not an officer duly authorized to act within his jurisdiction, proved the felony to have been in fact committed; it could not be suggested that this was an act done with a view to escape from the detention of the officer, the situation of the parties precluded that; and the inference was thereby strengthened, that the act was one of express malice; the case of Reg. v. Dadson, which had been quoted, went to show, that in any attempt to justify, it must be shown that the parly had a knowledge of his right to resist; now, taking the converse of that, it was a matter to be inquired into, whether the prisoner, at the time he discharged the pistol, possessed any knowledge of the illegality of his detention, for such knowledge must be proved to be present in the mind of the man who sought to avail himself of it. On these grounds he submitted, that the apprehension, if not legal in its inception, became so as soon as the party arrived in the jurisdiction of England; and that, as a private individual, the officer had a right to detain him, and bring him here to answer the charge, having shown the suspicion to be justified, by proof of the felony committed.</hi>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">"I believe we are both agreed upon the course that ought to be pursued in this case; there is very great difficulty about it, because there are two ways of looking at it,—the one, whether the prisoner was in lawful custody at the time the transaction took place; and the other, whether he was in unlawful custody. In my view of the case, considerable difficulty may arise upon that matter; at least, I entertain a doubt about it. My learned brother entertains a stronger opinion on the question than I do; but I believe we are</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">both of opinion that there is a question for the Jury, whether the offence is or is not murder. If the man was in legal custody, any attempt to release himself, which is the most favourable way of putting it, would in itself be an illegal act; and if in the course of that illegal act he killed the officer having him in custody, I apprehend, without reference to what his motives might be, that would be sim<lb/>pliciter murder; but assuming that he was not in legal custody, there would be then a question for the Jury whether or not the act which he did in taking away the life of the deceased, was done by him from a motive of revenge and bad feeling towards the man, or from a variety of mixed motives; one of which might be the feeling that he was wrongfully in custody, and that he had been put in irons contrary to the alleged agreement between himself and the officer; whether that state of mind might be induced by a continuous treatment of that kind for forty eight hours. If the Jury believed that the act was committed under feelings and influences of that sort, and they thought that was such a reasonable provo<lb/>cation to a man of firm and rational mind as to induce him to do this act, without attributing it to conduct which would be properly considered as indicat<lb/>ing malice aforethought, then the offence would be reduced to manslaughter. We were very desirous of having the question of lawful arrest submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal; but found it impossible so to shape the case as to take the opinion of that Court upon it; therefore, with the concurrence of my learned brother, I propose to deal with the question in the manner in which it was dealt with by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in his opening, and to take the opinion of the Jury, upon the facts which actually exist, whether this was murder or not; and I am clearly of opinion that there is evidence to go to the Jury, that the prisoner has committed the offence of murder.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I entirely concur thai in the latter view of the case there is evidence upon which the Jury must pronounce whether the prisoner is guilty of murder or only of manslaughter. With reference to the question of lawful custody, considerations of great importance are involved. It appears to me that it must be taken that there is no extradition or treaty with Hamburg; if it existed, it would of course have been produced, because that would have set the matter at rest. The inclination of my mind is to consider that there was a lawful custody, on the ground that an English ship is the same as English land; and if so, the case of S. Scott, 9, Barnewell and Cresswell, goes to show that the custody was lawful, one from which the prisoner had no right to escape, It appears to me that in that view of the case, it was material to prove that the felony had been committed; otherwise it would have been open to</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">to contend that no felony had been proved. It is unnecessary that I should say more on that view of the case, because I entirely concur with my brother</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">as to the extreme difficulty of bringing this matter properly before the Court of Appeal. It is a question upon which the Jury must pronounce (treating the custody as lawful or unlawful) whether the act was an act of murder or not. The case is now within their province, and I entirely concur in the course proposed to be taken.</hi>
