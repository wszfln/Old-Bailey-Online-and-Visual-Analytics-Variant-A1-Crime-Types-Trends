            . (Looks at a great number of pieces of thread lace produced by Driver) They have been cut off cards of lace, which I have in my possession, they tally exactly; I had all these things at the time the prisoner came to live with me; I counted them over by an inventory which I keep by me, and I am sure they were all there when the prisoner came; it is my general method to look over them once a month.</p>
               <p>Did you compare them with the inventory before the prisoner? - No; I missed all the things during the time the prisoner was in my service: there were 15 rows of pearls in the necklace, seven rows were taken away; I know them by their being on cotton thread as they came over from India; they exactly correspond with the eight rows left behind.</p>

               <p>How long had the prisoner lived with you? - This last time.</p>
               <p>No, all together. Whether when you was in France you did not send her to England to fetch some valuable things to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she bring them faithfully to you? - Some she brought safe, some she did not.</p>
               <p>You had a very good character with her from the place where she lived, after she left you, when you took her again? - I had; but afterwards the gentlewoman discovered she had lost some things, and was sorry she had given her a character.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. I object to this evidence; a constable being sent to a woman in order to ask her questions is exceeding improper.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of June last, between 11 and 12 at night, as I was going to my lodgings at No. 11, in Castle Yard, I went through St. James's Park, I was rather intoxicated with liquor; I sat down on one of the benches and fell asleep; I felt somebody near me which waked me; I found a man had taken hold of my hand and put it into an indecent place in his breeches, I drew my hand away; there was only one person there at that time who was the prisoner Stride; it was not moon-light, but the stars shone bright; Stride said, you had better not sit here, you had better get up and walk with me; he said, he would shew me the way out at the Green Park; we went a little way together, Stride asked me for some money to drink a glass of gin; I said, I had got no halfpence; Stride said, I am sure you have got other money; I pulled out my purse, as soon as Stride saw the purse in my hand he struck me over the face with his fist, snatched the purse out of my hand, and ran away; I saw nobody present at that time but Stride; I believe there were about 13 guineas and about five shillings in my purse; I was frightened: Stride had a red great coat on with his regimentals under it, I ran after him and pushed him down, upon which two men came up and followed me, they rescued Stride from me and beat me; I cannot swear to those two men; the place where I overtook Stride and pushed him down was about ten yards from the place where he snatched the purse from my hand; I did not perceive the other two people till they fell upon me.</p>

               <p>I am a serjeant in the guards; the prosecutor came to the guardhouse about 12 at night, he appeared to be much beat, he had lost his hat, the blood ran out of his ears; he said he had been robbed of 13 guineas and some silver, and thought it was somebody that belonged to the guard; upon which we shut the door and searched the guard, and found every body there but the prisoner Stride, who is a drummer; Stride came to the guard door about two minutes after, he was then in his drummer's dress, I immediately charged him with having robbed the prosecutor; the prosecutor was present, and said, he would take his oath it was him; he had given a description of him before that he had thick lips, and had a red great coat on, which I suppose he pulled off before he came to the guard, for when he came there he had not the red great coat on; but his regimentals; I went and acquainted colonel Duberg, and he sent for Stride up; Stride denied it positively; but the fact appeared so clear to the colonel, that he ordered him to be made a prisoner of; next morning Stride confessed that he had robbed the prosecutor, and had given the money to Miles; I think the prosecutor was something in liquor when he came to the guard, yet he was capable of remembering and knowing what he did.</p>

               <p>I am a printer: Mr. Becket rents a warehouse of me, the staircase of which is fronting my parlour window; I had an opportunity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020011"/> of course of seeing people go, up and down the warehouse stairs; I saw the prisoner bring down a very large load of books upon his shoulder at about half after ten in the morning last Monday week, the 23d; I believe I had left Mr. Becket at his own house not ten minutes before; seeing him turn a contrary way to his master's house with the bundle, I suspected he had robbed his master; I followed the prisoner to a Cheesemonger's shop in Blackmore-street; when he went into the shop I passed by the door; I did not take any notice then for fear he should see me dodge him, might take the books up, and pretend he was going to his master; I watched at the door and saw him weighing the books off in the Cheesemonger's shop; then I went into the shop and asked him whether his master gave him those books to sell for waste paper; he was confounded and could not give me an answer; I brought him back, after telling the master of the cheesemonger's shop, that I knew he had robbed his master of that property; I brought him to my house and sent for Mr. Becket; Mr. Becket was not at home, his son came; I went back with him to the cheesemonger's shop; the son owned the property.</p>
               <p>What said the prisoner? - He said nothing, but begged that I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Mr. BECKET. When I returned home I found the prisoner in my house in custody of my son; I went to the cheesemonger's that afternoon; I saw the paper there; the bundle was tied up, and there was marked upon it 102 pound.</p>
               <p>Was it printed paper? - Yes: it contained part of the numbers of the Monthly Review, which I publish; I believe there were near 600 numbers; they were books I printed which I am accountable to the proprietors for every number at nine-pence each, which comes to upwards of 20 l. and in another shop I found equally the same.</p>

               <p>What was the weight of it? - 102 lb. as I received the weight from the man; we were to pay 2 d. a pound for it.</p>
               <p>I suppose the reason you did not pay for it was Mr. Noys coming? - I certainly should have paid for it if Mr. Noys had not come in; I have bought of the prisoner before, and never had any suspicion of him.</p>
               <p>Was you by when he brought it? - No: I was in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner in your shop? - I did not see him that morning he brought the paper.</p>
               <p>To Mr. NOYS. Did you see the paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to that paper? - Yes: that is part of the paper; I know it by a mark which I put myself upon it at the time I detected the man, and at the same time I told Mr. Ward that was the property of Mr. Becket.</p>

               <p>I am a tobacconist, I live opposite Mr. Wensley's: on the 17th of May, between nine and ten o'clock, when I was sitting at my door, I heard a man say, he has got the bacon; on which I looked out and saw a man with a flitch of bacon under his arm; the man ran and I ran, but M'Credy stopped him; I laid hold of him on the other side, and we brought him back to the prosecutor's; he dropped the bacon in the street; I lost sight of him after I saw him with the bacon; I am not sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Upon Friday the 4th of April my house was broke open.</p>
               <p>Was the house fast over night? - I am always last up at night and first up in the morning; I fastened it that night; I went to bed about half after nine, at about two in the morning I heard the parlour door crack, then I heard the stair foot door crack; that door was fastened with a tibber, and I heard the tibber tumble down; then I jumped out of bed and called to Mr. Reeves; he jumped out of bed and threw open the window, and cried out thieves; I saw an uncommon light on the staircase, and heard a great many footsteps; I was then so frightened I had no power to move; they broke open Mr. Reeves chamber door in an instant; they threw me down, and I tumbled over a close-stool; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020025"/> got up again, I believe without any assistance; they trod upon my naked foot; I began to grow very sick; the prisoner came and put one hand over my eyes, and with the other laid hold of the back part of my head, and led me to the foot of Mr. Reeves's bed, and bid me lie down there, and no hurt should come to me.</p>
               <p>How came you to know the prisoner? - He came three times on the 4th of April to ask Mr. Reeves to employ him to work in the brick-fields; when he came the first time he had on a remarkable hairy cap that frightened the dog, and almost frightened me; I asked why he came in such a frightful cap? he said he had no other to come in; he threw stones at the dog; what he did to the dog I don't know, but it never barked when they broke the house open; he came the last time at four o'clock with another man, and asked if Mr. Reeves was at home.</p>
               <p>Had he that cap on when he put his hand over your eyes? - Yes, and I knew his voice; I knew him very well, I had a glimpse of his face before he put his hand over my eyes; Mr. Reeves made his way to my room, in order to get out of the window and get on the top of the house to hide himself from them; they immediately followed him, but stopped of a sudden, I believe the candle went out; afterwards I think I heard them strike a light, then they followed Mr. Reeves; I heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, shew us where the money is;" and another said, Let him alone, he is going to shew us where the money is; they then brought Mr. Reeves back and made him lie down on the bed, and a man stood over him with a cutlass and a pistol, I believe, but am not positive, and made him lie still while the rest broke open every box they could; Mr. Reeves shewed them where his breeches were, and the next morning I saw the pockets were turned inside out: the man that stood over us was a tall man; they took away the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them): when I came down in the morning I found they had got in at the kitchen window; they broke the glass and opened the casement; I am sure it was fast over night.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there all the time? - Yes, he was very busy helping them to break open the things, and lighting them with a dark lanthorn; they found a blunderbuss in the house, and cried out with a loud voice,</p>
               <p>"You old Reeves, you heep blunderbusses in your house;" he told them there was nothing in it but powder; they broke the slint to pieces and took the blunderbuss and set it on the outside of the house.</p>
               <p>LINSTEAD REEVES sworn.</p>
               <p>I had purchased an estate, which I intended to let out on a building lease, but being informed there was good brick earth, I was advised to make use of it in the brick way; I was awaked in the middle of the night by the tibber falling down; then I heard Mrs. Pollard call out thieves; I jumped up and went to the window and called out thieves; they immediately broke open my room door; I rushed out and went into Mrs. Pollard's room; one of them followed me; I believe the light went out; he did not catch me immediately, but he got a fresh light, and then took me by the nape of the neck, and threw me down, and said,</p>
               <p>"Blast' you, why did you cry out?" I said, I waked out of my sleep and did not know what I did; he then asked for my money; the prisoner came with a cutlass and held it to my throat, and swore he would cut my throat; the other said, Hold, he is going to shew us where the money is; the prisoner struck me over the shoulders with the flat part of the cutlass, and they took hold of the collar of my shirt behind, and led me into my own room; then they laid me on the bed and stood over Mrs. Pollard and me with a cutlass in one hand and a pistol in the other; they broke open and rifled all our drawers; every time any light were brought in, if we turned our heads the man that stood over us said,</p>
               <p>"Blast you, who do you look at? blast you, if you look I will chop your heads off:" then one of them below cried out, Holloa, and the man that stood over us said that they were going down to drink, and if we stirred he would come up and chop our heads off: they went down, I lay about five minutes; then hearing all quiet below, and finding it very cold, the window being open upon me, I crept from the bed to shut it, and saw them going over my land with a dark lanthorn: they took out of my breeches my watch, five guineas, and eleven or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020026"/>How do you know the prisoner was one of them? - When he came with the dark lanthorn and threatened to cut my throat, I looked wishfully at him; I am sure he is the man; he had the hairy cap on at the time; my men came in the morning and found the house broke open and the blunderbuss at the door; I described the prisoner, and heard he was sometimes in the brick-fields in Kingsland, at Mr. Brown's; I went and enquired after him and took him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>On the 26th of May, between twelve and one, the prisoner and another man came to my house, the other man said the prisoner had a watch to sell; I desired to look at it; he produced a watch and the movement of another, and bid me give him what I thought they were worth; I asked him where he got them? he told me he belonged to a ship lying off the Tower; I insisted on his giving a better account of himself; he offered to leave the watches and bring somebody to his character; I told him that would not do; he must tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020037"/> me somebody he belonged to, and I would go with him; then he said he had an uncle on Ludgate-hill; that his mother died and left him the watches; I took him before the sitting aldermen, and there was Mr. Payne, and as Mr. Payne and I were taking him to his uncle's on Ludgate-hill, I heard something jingle, and we took the spoons and other things out of his side pocket.</p>

I asked the man if he knew the woman that was in the coach; he said he knew her, this was the man that drove me; he said he would go and find her if he could; we drove down the town, and back again; I saw two men standing at the door, I told them I had been robbed, they said they would go with me and seek after the woman and coachman; we searched the coaches and stables that were open, but we could not find either of them; then the man brought us to London to the houses where the prisoner used; we came to a public-house in Tottenham Court-road; somebody mentioning the misfortune that had happened to me the night before, a watchman who heard it said, he saw the woman come to town early in the morning with a man, arm in arm; he said he knew her well, and would soon find her.</p>

               <p>I was at the Rose and Crown, Tottenham Court-road on the 2 d of June; the prosecutor came in and complained he had been robbed; Mr. Taylor came in with him; Lorrell described the woman to Taylor and me, and the watchman; by the description we knew her, she was a neighbour's child; we went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020040"/> in search of her and the coachman; I went into many two-penny lodging-houses in St. Giles's, but could hear nothing of her; I came back again to Mr. Porter's, the Rose and Crown: Mr. Lorrell and Taylor were there; they said the coachman was at the Blue Posts, the corner of Hanover-yard; I went there and they gave me charge of him; I took him to the watch-house and confined him there; then we went in pursuit of the woman; we went different ways, and one of the watchmen took her and brought her to me; I took her to the Queen's Head in Charlotte-street and examined her closely about it; she desired to speak with me in another room; we went into another room; then she pulled out of her pocket twelve guineas and a half and sixteen shillings; we sent for the coachman over from the watch-house, and he acknowledged he received a guinea of the girl; she confessed that she had given him a guinea out of the money that she had taken out of Mr. Lorrell's pocket.</p>
               <p>Did she say what she had done? - She declared she had taken the money out of Mr. Lorrell's pocket while he was asleep in the coach, and that she gave the coachman a guinea; the coachman, Sullard, acknowledged the same, and offered to put the money down again, which he did; but to the best of my remembrance I did not receive his money; he had changed the guinea; he paid half a guinea and the rest in silver at the office in Litchfield-street to me.</p>

I went to see if I could get in at my master's yard, I could not; she asked me to see her safe to town, and she would give me a guinea; she gave it me on the road; I did not ask her how she came by it; I never saw the prosecutor from the time I got out of the coach, till I was taken, which was the next morning.</p>

            , the prisoner, and the deceased. The prisoner and the deceased seemed to be in good friendship; I went down stairs, and then Hoy and Fenn and I went and stood on the steps at the door.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else in company any part of the time? - No, the valet de chambre came in to deliver a message, but did not stay. When we were on the steps the prisoner spoke something loud; but I could not comprehend what it was; I went into the hall, and desired her to be quiet; that, if she could not be quiet, she must go somewhere else to make a noise; she was then rather raised from her seat towards the deceased; she immediately sat down; the deceased sat on the table, she was in the porter's chair; the deceased's left side was rather to her.</p>
               <p>When you went in to check her, did you see any instrument in her hand? - I did not see any at that time.</p>
               <p>Were there any knives and forks? - There was a green-handled knife, which is here; when I went in and checked her, the deceased said to the prisoner, why don't you go? the prisoner said, will you come? upon which he answered, why don't you go? this passed while I was there; then I went out again: in about four or five minutes the prisoner came out and called somebody, I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any noise after you had been in, till the time she came to call you? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough, if he had given her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177707020043"/> a blow, to have heard it? - I think I was; I was not three yards from the door. I went in first; they followed me in. I saw the deceased sitting in the position he was before, leaning against the wall, with both his hands on his betty; I asked him, what was the matter? he made no answer, but seemed to be in agony; he fetched two deep sight; he raised his hand higher on his belly, I then saw the cut in his waistcoat; I turned to the prisoner and said, you blasted bitch, you have stabbed the man; she answered, God forgive you; and immediately said, I have done it, I have done it; if I go to the gallows for it, I have done it; I will die by the gallows for him sooner than that other woman shall enjoy him. I looked for the knife, but could see only a green-handled fork; I had seen a knife there before; the deceased raised himself up a little, and said, take that woman away from me. I put my hand on her shoulder to force her away; she dropped on her knees and laid hold of his strap, and said, I will not leave him, or I will never leave him, I cannot be positive which of the words she used. I asked the deceased, if I should send for a surgeon; he answered, no; he then opened his upper waistcoat, and I saw some marks of blood on an under flannel-waistcoat faced with blue sattin; he unbuttoned that waistcoat, and I saw a large quantity of blood on his shirt. I requested him again to let me send for a surgeon, but he answered, no; don't make a noise, don't be frighted, I am not much hurt. He walked out into the street, the prisoner followed; she appeared to be troubled, and cried: I followed him about twenty yards; then I was called back by

             is my lady's footman, I am my master's. When I came back I searched after the knife; there was nobody then in the hall; I found the knife on the hall-table, just behind where the deceased sat, rather to his right side: it was bloody; the blood appeared to be very fresh upon it; it had not been wiped.</p>

               <p>Was there a connection between the prisoner and the deceased? - The deceased told me, he had a connection with her, but had left off.</p>
               <p>He was not a married man, was he? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>He never had a child by her, had he? - I recollect her lying-in, and heard him say, he had a child by her.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his having any new connection? - I heard him say, since the child died, he never would have any more connection with her.</p>
               <p>Did you know how long the child has been dead? - I cannot say with any degree of certainty.</p>

               <p>Do you think this was the effect of her jealousy? - I do think it was such; for I have heard her threaten the deceased.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at St. George's hospital: the deceased was brought to the hospital on Friday night; he was delivered to my cure; one of the apothecary's people saw him first; I saw Pearce in the ward afterwards; he came to enquire about him.</p>
               <p>PEARCE. I went to see him; he was under that gentleman's care.</p>
               <p>GRIFFITHS. I saw the deceased about seven or eight at night; he had a wound above the navel, it appeared to be made by a round pointed instrument; it was on the left side of the navel, about three inches deep; it passed obliquely downwards, I cannot say how broad, because a wound contracts, it was about an inch in length; I thought it mortal, as all wounds penetrating the cavity of the abdomen are generally mortal.</p>
               <p>Did any other surgeons attend? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the deceased appear to be a porter? - Yes, he had straps about him.</p>
               <p>Did he answer to any name? - Yes, that of Randal Perry.</p>
               <p>That was the man Pearce came to see? - Yes; the omentum or caul was obtruded about a handful; it was returned into the abdomen; which is frequently fatal.</p>
               <p>How soon did you despair of his life? - On Sunday morning; he died on Sunday night; every thing was done for him that was proper.</p>
               <p>Did he die of the wound? - I am certain of it; he said a woman gave him a stab with great force back handed; he said he had two children by her, and she was jealous.</p>
               <p>Did he say there was any provocation given at the time? - No, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor when he was brought to the hospital? - He appeared to be so, but that appearance might be occasioned by the omentum obtruding the nerves, which is frequently the case.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him say whether he had given her any provocation that day? - He said no, he had given her none; I asked particularly whether he had given her any provocation that day; he said he had given her none; that was the same night he came in.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The deceased used me very ill for a long time; when the man was gone out for the porter, there was nobody there but him and me; he gave me a kick on the hip; when the three men were on the steps, after Pearce had been in to tell me not to make a noise, he gave me a blow on the temples with his fist; I had a knife and bladebone of mutton in my hand, which I was picking; I threw the bone and knife out of my hand and said, D - n him, I would never eat with him any more; I did it without any intention to hurt him: there are the marks of his blows now.</p>
               <p>'The surgeon examined her hip and temple,</p>
               <p>'and said there was a confusion on her</p>
               <p>'hip; that by its appearance the blow might</p>
               <p>'have been given her that night; that it</p>
               <p>'appeared to be a kick, and that there did</p>
