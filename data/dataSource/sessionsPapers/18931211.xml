                  </hi>. I am a fruit broker, at 37, James Street, Covent Garden—Taylor was in my employ about eighteen months ago—he left about July or August, 1892—on the 30th September this year, I received a communication from the manager of the Capital and Counties Bank, where I had an account, and in consequence I went and saw him—I was shown this cheque for, £200, dated 30th September, 1893, drawn in favour of A. R. Low—it was not signed by me, or by my authority—I did not recognise the handwriting on the face of the cheque—I believe the endorsement to be in the handwriting of Taylor; I had frequent opportunities of seeing him write—to the best of my belief it is his writing, but I am not prepared to swear to it—I found that the cheque was missing from my cheque-book, along with seven others—after seeing the manager I returned to my office—this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), addressed to R. Lomax, Esq., appears to be in Taylor's writing—this cheque, number 2588, is a genuine paid cheque of mine; it was drawn on 4th July, 1893—it was enclosed in a bundle of cheques recently returned from the bank, and was kept in a pigeon-hole in the office, and was stolen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). On 30th September I was called to the bank, and apprehended Lomax—I afterwards went to 17, Ladbrook Road, Balham, where I found these two other cheques, Nos. 2518 and 2588, one blank and the other a paid cheque, and this letter torn in pieces, which Taylor afterwards admitted to me was his writing; also this telegram of 30th September to Lomax, 17, Ladbrook Road, Balham, "Waiting to see you; immense.—<hi rend="smallCaps">DICK</hi>"—I also found some envelopes with the name of Dennis and Sons printed on the top, and some slips of paper torn from a diary, with a number of fac-similes of Mr. Dennis's signature—No. 17 was the house of Lomax, who is now undergoing a term of imprisonment—on 14th November I saw Taylor when he was in custody at Westminster Police-court—he made a statement to me, continuing the statement which he had previously made to another officer—this is what he said: "I obtained the cheque from <hi rend="italic">Gus</hi> Sendall, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, the foreman" (that is Roberts); "the cheque was forged by Lomax, who presented it at the bank"—I said, "What did you do with the others?"—he said, "The others I destroyed; <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> got me the paid cheque also"—I said, "How came you to speak about it?"—he said, "The proposition came from <hi rend="italic">Gus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>; they knew about Morgan's affair, and asked me if I could do anything in that way" (there is another indictment in connection with that matter)—I said, "When did you get the cheques?"—he said, "They were given me one night, the same night the forged one was presented, outside, about the time the <hi rend="italic">pubs</hi> were closing. They were given to me by <hi rend="italic">Joe.</hi> I went to Lomax on Sunday morning; he said his hand was too shaky; he practised for a time and then got it done. I was to meet him afterwards. <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gus</hi> were to have a share"—I showed him a telegram and a letter torn in pieces—he said, "Yes; they are mine"—I showed him the endorsement, "R. Lowe," on the back of the forged cheque, and he said, "Lomax wrote that"—he continued, "I waited at the corner of King Street and saw Mr. Dennis come back with a bank messenger." (<hi rend="italic">The torn letter was read as follows</hi>: "Dear L.,—<hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> has just left me, and will call on you to-morrow, Monday, and tell you the pith of our conversation; remain in till midday.—Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">DICK</hi>")—after the remand at Westminster Police-court I saw the man <hi rend="italic">Gus</hi> (Sendall)—at that time I only knew him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Gus</hi>; he made a statement to me, and in consequence I arrested Roberts <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the morning of November 23rd, outside his house in Cornwall Road, Lambeth—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, I am going to take you into custody for stealing those cheques from Mr. Dennis"—he replied, "Yes, sir"—I said, "And there will probably be a further charge of being concerned with Taylor in forging and uttering a cheque, and obtaining £200 thereby"—he said, "I don't see how that can be"—I took him to the station, and he was charged; he made no reply.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been a detective six years—I did not caution him that what he said might be used in evidence against him; there is no order to that effect—Sendall is not in custody, and never has been—I took Roberts in consequence of what Taylor and Sendall said.</p>

I have been six years in Covent Garden market—I have done night work—I only saw Lomax twice—the first time I saw him was when he came to my house with Taylor—I did not know he was "the old one"—I did not know who I was going to see, and I asked Taylor and he said, "Lomax"—I did not ask him, "What are you going to see Lomax for, with forged cheques in your possession?"—I should say I certainly knew they were doing wrong; I can't see that I was helping them—I got a shilling for sitting on the two bushels of apples, to treat myself; not. for looking out for the police—I was doing nothing—I don't know what they were doing; I sat there smoking; I did not trouble myself to know what they were doing—the police came to me first about this at a public-house that I use—they did not tell me I had better make a clean breast of it or I should find myself in trouble; they said I stood in a very serious position—he did not tell me that I had better make a clean breast of it, or I should be in the dock—he said Taylor had told all about the cheques, and what I knew about it would I tell, and I said, "Yes"—he did not tell me that I was in a serious position—I have not said so—I told him something similar to what I have said to-day—I got nothing for going to Balham; I spent three shillings on a couple of forties going there; I mean drinks—Taylor told me he had not got a penny—I expected to get what he owed me, £4 or £5, out of his money that he was going to get from the bank—I knew he had no account there—I was told if I saw the. messenger come out I was to come and tell him—I was not told to do anything if I saw the police; I could go home if I liked—in case the affair came off I was to get the money he owed me; how he got the money was nothing to do with me.</p>

               <p>native of Uxbridge, fifteen miles out of London, say, 'On 16th or 17th of last August, I, in company with three others, threw a police officer over the Thames Embankment in London. I wish to give myself up to the custody of the police'")—he was sober—later in the day, about four, I took him before the Petty Sessions, and he there made a further statement in my presence; it was taken down, read over to him, and he signed it—this is it, "About 2. 30 a. m., I and my companions were lying down on a seat on the Thames Embankment, when a policeman came up and ordered us off, and we caught hold of him and threw him into the river, and then went away. I have had no rest in my mind since we did it, and so resolved to give myself up. I did not know anything of the three men that were with me, and I don't know now who they were, but I saw one of them in Bristol this morning, and I told him I was going to give myself up; he and I were together ever since the morning we threw the constable into the river. I came by boat this morning from Cardiff to Bristol. I heard him say his name was Watkins, but don't know whether that is his right name or not"—he remained in custody at Keynsham from the 7th to the 10th November—I was in charge of him the whole time—he said on different occasions that he was very sorry for what he did, he could not help it at all; he would not have done it for £50, had he it.</p>

               <p>I did so. He said he was going to make a book for Mr. Graham, at Tun-bridge Wells, and if I would go he would pay my expenses. We went there and he told me to order a pony and trap to drive to Chislehurst, and gave me his employer's card; we got into the cart together and went to Sevenoaks when he gave me a sovereign and told me to go to London I did so, and in the evening received a telegram from him telling me to meet him at the station. I met him between ten and eleven with the pony and trap and a friend. He was very drunk, and asked if I could take care of the lot for the night. I said, "Yes," and next morning he went and got it. He was arguing with his friend about the value of it, and I took it to Mr. Wingrove to ask him if he would gave £25 for it. He said it was not worth it, and Davis said, "Will you give £15 for it?" and then said to me, "He has gone for the police." I walked by the side of the trap, and the detective arrested me—I was acting under orders from Davis.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Davis's defence.</hi> I only wanted to find the proper value of it; I had no intention of stealing it. It would have been returned in the afternoon, but the pony was in a bad condition at Groombridge and unfit to go back; so I went to London and put it up, and in the morning I found the pony in a very bad condition, and it could only be sent back by train. I knew I should have to pay the value of it, and I went to Wingrove to find the value.</p>

               <p>me, but you have just come into my shop from Miss Farwell"—she said, "Oh, no; I will take my oath I never did"—the man said, "Oh, no; it is very funny"—Proud said, "No; she is my sister, and has been with me all the afternoon"—they crossed the road, and spoke to a cabman, and then walked to the corner of Bishop's Road, and returned—I crossed the road; they spoke to a second cabman—I asked the first cabman whether he was engaged—he said, "Yes"—I crossed the road to the corner of Alsopp's Terrace, and the three separated—I followed Williams, who ran down Alsopp's Terrace alone—I caught her up at the bottom end, and she then went back to the other end, calling out to someone—I got up in time to see her run down the livery stables—I asked a young fellow to go for a policeman, and went down the yard, and saw two or three men cleaning carriages, and they went into a stable—one man came out, and I spoke to him—I went with the policeman, and found her—she said to the policeman, "Here you are; let me go off," offering him a £5 note and a gold coin—neither I nor the policeman had said anything about that—the policeman said, "Wait a moment, and see what you have given me"—she said, "Yes; a £5 note and a half-sovereign.

I hesitated, but lie assured me it was all right, and I ultimately cashed the cheque for him"—she was remanded for a week, and on 23rd November I saw Proud outside Marylebone Police-court, and I arrested her, placed her with others, and she was identified as having been with Williamson the night of the 15th—she said, "It is rather mean of you to get me here like this; I will not tell you now who the man is."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 388, High Road, Chiswick Green—about eleven p. m. on 21st November I went to bed, leaving my premises securely fastened—about three my wife woke me, and I went down in the dark, lit the gas over the door leading into the shop, and I could see that the door we had left closed was open—on going through I found a faint glimmer of light in the kitchen; it came from a bull's-eye lantern placed under a chair—on going out at the back door I found the window had been cut out of the warehouse, and the iron bar removed—I went outside and saw a man, and gave chase and caught him up, but I left go of him—the prisoner and another man came from my warehouse, from, behind me, and followed the first man—I recognised the prisoners he ran past me at a moderate rate—I have known him by sight for years living in the neighbourhood—my till was opened, and coppers had been extracted from it, amounting to about two shillings; I had not counted them the night before—a small packet of chocolate and about six cigars had been taken from a box in the kitchen cupboard—three old boots had been left behind—my neighbour went and found three policemen—on the following night I went to the station and recognised the prisoner at once, and said to him he might as well speak the truth as I knew him, and likewise the other two—afterwards I was taken and picked the prisoner out from six or seven others—I did not recognise anyone else as having been there that night—the prisoner lives three minutes' walk from me, at 5, Mill Road, Acton Grove.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 55, Arundel Square—on Monday, November 13th, about a quarter to six, I was at home having my tea, when the street door bell was rung—the servant came in, and said the prisoner wanted to see me—I went into the area, and saw the prisoner standing in the footway—he had previously been in my employ—I said, "What do you want?"—he said, "I have come to look round"—I said, "I can do nothing for you; you left my employment voluntarily"—he said, "I am right down on the rocks, and have nowhere to sleep to night"—knowing that he was connected with the Roman Catholic Church, I referred him to Father Carey for assistance—he then said, "I will; here goes"—drawing his right hand from his overcoat pocket he produced a revolver, levelled it at me, and fired—I dodged in the doorway, and ran inside, and went to an upper window, and seeing nothing of the prisoner, I went to the station and gave information—I did not see him again till I saw him at the station—the bullet passed through the door exactly where I was standing, and penetrated the door about three feet six from the ground; it came on the slant, or it would have Struck me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been in my service about four months—he left of his own accord; he was not dismissed—he was a labourer; he did rough work, and sometimes a little rough carpentering—he made no complaint whatever against me; he had no ill-feeling against me as far as I knew—he was under my personal supervision the whole time—I frequently saw him and gave him instructions—I noticed something odd in his demeanour—he used to mutter to himself a lot—I spoke to him about it, and requested him to desist, because it annoyed me, and he said, "I suppose I must have the devil in me"—he came to ray house one morning when I was not very well to know what he was to do—I gave the servant a half-sovereign, and told her to give it to him to get some match boarding, and go to Windsor Road with it, and he went to the job without the match-boarding, and then went away, and next day he bought the match-boarding, took it to the job, and went away again, and did not show up to work till the Thursday morning—I then said to him, "You have got over your holiday?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Have you got the change from the half-sovereign?"—he said, "Not till Saturday!—on the Saturday I asked him for it, and he stood out that he had not received it—the servant said, "You put it in your waistcoat pocket; feel if it is there"—it was there—I asked what he had bought the match boarding with—he said, "With the half-sovereign"—I said, "Whose half-sovereign?"—he said, "My own"—I said I could not believe that he had not had the half-sovereign, and I should deduct it from his wages—that incident passed off—his conduct was eccentric in that way—I did not treat this as an act of dishonesty; I always found him particularly honest—he said he forgot all about the half-sovereign—prior to this occurrence he had always been quiet and inoffensive.</p>

               <p>November I saw the prisoner in Eden Grove—I told him I should arrest him for attempted murder—he said, "Is that so?"—I asked him if he had a revolver—he said, "Yes, in my coat pocket; it is loaded in six chambers"—a constable who was with me put his hand in his pocket and pulled it out—it was loaded in six chambers—I found in his pocket one cartridge discharged and a box containing thirty-three, it was constructed to hold fifty—I afterwards went to the prosecutor's premises—I discovered a hole through the glass panel of the area door, also a hole on the wall corresponding with the same height—I have a plan of the premises, which I made—I found this spent ball lying on the ground of the area.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I asked the prisoner where he had been—he said "I have been walking about all night"—I arrested him at twenty minutes to six in the morning—he had one farthing on him—I saw nothing unusual in his manner—I have made inquiries about him—he is a native of Barbadoes, and has been in this country since January—he bears the character of a quiet, inoffensive man—he has been in the Church Army Home, and his conduct there is marked good—I met a man who had been to sea with him for fifteen months, and he said he was very inoffensive—I found he had been lodging for fifteen months with a Mrs. Green, of 64, Goodinge Road—I made inquiries of her—she said he was in the habit of walking about and talking to himself, and after he left she found he had turned the pictures with their faces to the wall and put indecent sketches on the frames at the back, and on two occasions he had burst into fits of passion without any apparent cause—she once heard him throw a chair across the room when he was alone—she said she had once given him notice to go, and he replied, "I shall not go; it is only faces bidding me go"—she allowed him to stop on till 12th November.</p>

The prisoner has been under my observation since he has been at Holloway—I have only seen him on ordinary occasions—I do not consider him insane, but in my opinion he is rather dazed and confused—I should not say he was irresponsible for his actions; he is of dull intellect—in other respects he certainly knows what he is about; I should hold him responsible.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He has been in prison for a month, I believe—I should not call muttering to himself a symptom of insanity; it often goes with insanity, taken with other things—it is a fact known to medical science that a person is sometimes subject to homicidal influence without any apparent motive—a man might have his mind to some extent damaged a month ago, and yet not show a trace of it to-day.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The Inspector</hi>: "He told me he had bought it a fortnight ago")—he said he had it as a sort of personal ornament, not to protect himself; he suspected nobody of wishing to hurt him—I asked him if he had visions of any kind, he said, "No"—he does not speak freely, he is distinctly reticent, you have to get it out of him.</p>

I am a Post-office carman—I got home at a quarter past twelve on 17th October—a little after two I was aroused by an alarm of tire—I got up and went down to the cupboard where the fire was—the prisoner was there; he came down while I was getting the water—he took the basket, which was ablaze, out into the yard—I put the fire out—I afterwards went upstairs to the prisoner's room, and said, "I believe you set the house on fire, and no one else"—he said, "This is all right, ain't it?"—T said, "No, it's all wrong; you can't stay in this house another minute"—he picked up his coat, hat, and collar, and came downstairs, I behind him, and he went out—I don't know what became of him—I complained to the police the same morning.</p>

I was smoking a pipe when I went upstairs, which was at twenty minutes to two; there were other people there when I pulled the basket out."</p>

               <p>the business—two lady customers were in the private bar, and several persons were in the public bar—the prisoner, whom I had known as a customer for about two months, was in the public bar—we have a urinal for customers in the basement; it is not a properly constructed one—in order to get to it it is necessary to go down some steps leading from the private bar—the urinal is next to the beer cellar, and is lighted by a gas jet over the cellar door—the gas pipe goes inside the beer cellar, which is kept locked—when I went down to the urinal about half-past eleven, to relieve myself, the gas was burning, and all was right—I returned by the stairs again and re-entered the private bar, and then passed by the stairs into the room marked "A" at the back of the house; it is a room in which people can sit down—we use it in the evening for customers; it is a kind of club-room—when I left the cellar at 11. 30 no one was there—when I got into the private bar no one was there but the two women—at that moment I saw the prisoner go from the public bar and enter the private bar from the street, and go down the cellar steps—I remained in room "A" for four or five minutes, and then I returned to the private bar, behind which my wife was—I stood in front of it—some half-dozen men were in room" A" when I went in, sitting talking and smoking, and I left them there—you have to go to room "A" from the private bar, and there is no way of getting out of room "A" except by passing through the private bar, and out into the street that way.</p>

I think there is a leakage in the gas'"—that is true—I thought at the time there was a leakage in the gas; I did not trouble any more about it so long as the fire was out—the tap that I found turned off was outside the cellar underneath the pipe, which was cut on the left-hand side—I did not see you go down to the urinal again after I said you could not go.</p>

I am a plumber and gasfitter, living at 21, Sloane Terrace, Chelsea—on Saturday, 4th November, I went, by the landlord's direction, to look at and repair the gas in the cellar of the Rising Sun—the gas-tap over the cellar door was turned off—this piece-of pipe was fixed to the woodwork—I cut it off—there was a stop-cock in front and one behind it—it is in the same condition now as when I saw it—this cut in the pipe has been made by a sharp instrument or knife being stuck in the top and brought down—it is a leaden or composition pipe—there are also scratches on the brass-work—assuming the tap to be turned off, and this cut to be made, the gas would escape from this hole, and if it were lighted and burnt for four or five minutes I should expect to find the lead fused—I do find indications of fusing; the solder has just begun to run—the pipe was cut by a knife or other sharp instrument; a light has been put to it; I say this because the solder has begun to run—if it had been left for some time longer the union would have dropped off, and there would have been a flare right out of the pipe—it may have been burning four or five minutes—I was in the public bar of the Rising Sun on the 2nd November; the prisoner lighted the fire in the grate; the landlord was angry, and came round and raked it out, and threw water over it, and told the men in the bar if he knew who it was he would not serve them again—he did not see who it was—then the fire burnt up again, and the landlord was angry again, and came and put it out—he did not say anything to the prisoner or anyone, but walked straight back again—I heard the prisoner say after the landlord had put the fire out the second time, "I would burn the house down for two pins"—I was in the house on the Friday evening, but I left at ten—there was a little space between the door and the gas-pipe, and a knife could have been easily put under and the pipe cut—you can stand upright in the cellar, and you can easily reach to the place where the cut was—if this place had been cut earlier in the evening it would have affected the light in the front, and the fire would have been worse—it was cut in the evening—if it had been cut before and not lighted there must have been an explosion.</p>

I am the wife of Edward Reeve, a master mariner—my husband rents 116, St. Stephen's Road, East Ham, and I occupy the top half of that house, and let the lower half—both prisoners are my cousins—previous to 23rd November I had not seen Pash for some six years—about nine or ten months ago I left my address with a friend of Pash's to give him, that he might call at any tame he should be coming to oar part—Pash is a cab-driver—at 9.40 p.m. on 23rd November there was a knock at the door; I went downstairs, and saw Pash at the front door—there was a little man, I thought, also standing there, but I did not take any notice of him—Pash asked if Mr. Reeve was at home—I said "No"—he said, "Don't you know met"—I said "No"—he said, "I am Harry—Harry was the name I knew him by—I said, "I am pleased to see you; come in; I live upstairs "—I saw a hansom cab at the door; I don't think I saw anyone on the box—I went upstairs, and Pash came up in a few seconds or so—Mr. Welstead, a friend of my husband, was there, and he was on the eve Of going, and I introduced him, and said, "This is my cousin, Mr. Welstead"—Welstead left in a few minutes—the prisoner said something about putting the nosebag on, and went down, as I thought, to do so—he came back and sat there a few minutes, and I said, "Will you have a little whisky and water, Harry?"—he said, "I don't mind, but, if you like, I will take a drop downstairs to the man in charge"—he took some whisky and water downstairs to someone at the door—he came back—I heard a voice in the passage, but I thought it was a man belonging to the house—I said, "Have you shut the door, Harry?"—he said, "Yes"—he said something about a fare to Stratford, and that he thought he would come D</p>

I went to see my cousin at St. Stephen's Road, and when I got to Upton Park I saw a fellow who I asked to drive me to St. Stephen's Road. I paid him two shillings. I afterwards went to Romford Road, and to the car. It was a little short old fellow I hired a cab of"—it is a matter of three minutes' drive from Upton Park Station to 116, St. Stephen's Road, or five minutes' walk—it was a fine moonlight night—there are no cabs at Upton Park Station—unless you ordered one you would not find one waiting outside the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gamekeeper to Mr. Cosmo Bonsor, at Kingston Warren—early in the morning on November 26th I was watching in Beacham Copse with George Blunden—we had begun watching about 9. 20 p. m., and about 1. 12 on the Sunday morning I heard a shot—we went to where the gun was fired and saw three men—that was about seven or eight minutes, or it might be ten minutes, after I heard the shot fired—(at the time I heard the shot fired I saw a cock pheasant fall, which had been roosting on a tree)—two of the men had guns—those were the two prisoners—Bloomfield had a gun; I cannot say whether King had anything in his hand—I ran towards them, and King turned round and said, "Let us go for them," and struck me on my face with his fist—he was about a yard from me—I fell to the ground with him; I was underneath, and he struck me several times with his fist—the other men were standing close, and Bloomfield, who was close by, struck me with a gun-barrel—I could see his face—they all ran away—Card, a policeman, came up—Blunden got up—I searched the ground round there and found a cap, two sticks, and a cock pheasant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BIRON</hi>. These are the sticks and the cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and the pheasant is here—King was wearing the cap, but I cannot say whether it was off or on when he was on the ground with me—this was on the 26th, and on Tuesday morning, the 28th, I went to the Police-station at Reigate, and was shown seven men, and picked out King from among them—I also picked out Bloomfield, but said that I could not identify him; I was not sure.</p>

The cock pheasant was under the tree which I saw it fall from—this was an open space—we were struggling three or four minutes—I could see their faces distinctly—there was moonlight, but it was rather overcast—I got a severe wound on the top of my head; it had to be sewn up—I was in the surgeon's hands some time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know whether there was any blood on the ground, but I bled so freely that I had to hold my handkerchief to my head to staunch the blood—the night was cloudy, and there was a drizzle on—a man named Grabbett was there; he came up into the wood with us, and was coming up after us, but I got there first, unfortunately for myself—I was about twenty-five yards from the open space when I heard the shot—Grabbett and I started to do the twenty-five yards together, but he does not come here as a witness—I had never seen the men before that night, so that I did not know them—it was a short and sharp encounter, but it did not last very long—I should say that this is a fashionable cap for poachers; it has got a peak in front which can be pulled over the face, and would serve him to conceal his identity—I do not object to putting it on (<hi rend="italic">Doing so</hi>)—there are one or two trees in the open space, but they did not cast a shadow—there was a thick undergrowth and bracken bushes and furze—I know a gipsy named Uphold—I did not go the next morning to arrest him; he was brought to my house by a constable—</p>

               <p>under arrest—I had given a description of the person to the police—I said he was a short man, and had a cap on similar to this, and a short brown coat—I did not say anything else—the constable asked me if he had any whiskers, and I said, "Yes"—he asked me if I could identify the man if I saw him, and I said, "Yes"—when I saw Uphold, the gipsy, I was asked if that was the man, and I said, "No, I don't believe it is"—I said at first that I was not quite sure, but when I looked at him I was quite sure—I tried by putting my arm round his neck to see if he felt like him—when the constable expressed surprise I did not say, "Well, they did not rive me much chance to see them"—Inspector Marks was with us—he said, "Do you think you should know the man "but I did not say," He never gave me a chance to know him"—King has been a gamekeeper—I do not know that he has been in three situations as a gamekeeper until recently—it is the fact that frequently gamekeepers' pockets have dry blood and feathers in them—I was hit chiefly about my face while, the struggle took place; I did my best to defend myself, and King, as I say, was on the top of me—the light would not be on his face then—I am not sure about Bloomfield, as I was engaged struggling with King—I was actually engaged in the struggle when I got the whack on top of my head.</p>

I am an inspector of the Surrey Constabulary—I arrested a gipsy named Uphold because he is a well-known poacher, and the constable met him going in a contrary direction to his tent—I discovered that he had been out that night—he was not arrested, but I asked him to go with me to the warren—I first saw King on Monday night, the 27th; about 10. 30, Shirley, a Metropolitan policeman, brought him to me, and I told him I should charge him with night poaching on Mr. Bonsor's estate on Saturday night, and also with assaulting the keepers—he said, "You are mistaken, I Was playing at dominoes at the Sandrock with Harry Poole"—the Sandrock is about nine miles from Beacham Copse, but if you went across the fields it would be about seven miles and a half—on the same day, a few minutes later, Bloomfield was brought to me, and I told him the same as I had told King—he said, "I am innocent; I was in bed by ten o'clock"—I took them to Reigate, and found on King some pheasant's feathers, a gun-cap, and a gun-wad; his coat-pockets were smeared with blood—I was present when the prisoners were put with the other people for the purpose of identification, and when they were picked out by Turner and Blunden; they both said they had made a mistake, that they both left the Sandrock at half-past nine, and went home to bed—I went to Shirley the same afternoon, and searched Bloomfield's house—his wife was there, and on making a search I found this gun (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) up the chimney; it was very clean—I have made inquiries about the prisoners—King was discharged as a gamekeeper on February 4th, this year.</p>
