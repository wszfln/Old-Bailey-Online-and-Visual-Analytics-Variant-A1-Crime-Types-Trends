               <p>Were you a good deal alarmed at this time? - Yes, my child was crying and screaming; I must be sadly frightened no doubt, when the chap was threatening to pull her out of the chaise; it was just on dusk, but it was plain enough to distinguish one person from another; I know the prisoner Roberts to be the person that robbed me; he stood at the horse's head the whole time; I took particular notice both of his coat, and his face, I believe it was the same coat he he has on now; it was much the same colour; I saw the prisoner again in about an hour; he was in custody when I came to Highgate; immediately after they had got the money, they desired me to drive on, but the horse rather run back; says they, do not you presume to look back, for if you do you are a dead man; I touched the horse with the whip, and he ran back; says I, gentleman, I will be much obliged to you to take hold of the horse, and lead him on; Roberts did so, and they went back from London after the robbery; I came to town; I first saw the prisoner at the Bull, at Highgate; they were both in custody; I was immediately asked what money I lost; I described a new guinea of the year 1777, and some shillings, and they were searched, and on Roberts was found just such a guinea, and three or four shillings; I had only that guinea about me; I am sure of Roberts; I cannot presume to say that the other was the man that took the money from me.</p>

               <p>It was about seven, and getting dusk; you had never seen any of the people before, and very much alarmed for your little girl? - Yes, I dot not know I ever was at Finchley above twice in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. Did not you look at my guinea that I pulled out of my pocket, before you described the date of that you had lost? - I might turn over his guinea, but before I saw it, I said the date that was upon it.</p>

               <p>What might you be doing thereabouts? - I had been at East Barnet about buying some pigs? - I take it, that the Horse Shoes, is about a quarter of a mile from the Bald-face-stag? - More than that now, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240009"/>the Bald-face Stag, and the Horse-shoes; there is a hill, they were not on the hill.</p>
               <p>If a man stands at the Bald-face Stag, can he possibly see what was done at the Horse-shoes? - That is impossible.</p>
               <p>So, that if a chaise was coming up the hill by the Three Horse-shoes, a man standing by this six mile stone could not see what passed? - It was but the half way.</p>
               <p>You know the hand-post that goes off to the Hog-Market? - I cannot say I do; I have been a labourer about two years.</p>
               <p>Do you know the road that goes to the Hog-Market? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One road goes by the Bald-face Stag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was you when you saw this? - I was about, may-be four hundred yards from the Bald-face Stag.</p>
               <p>How far was it from where the coach stopped, that the chaise was stopped? - it might be five hundred, or six hundred yards, or more.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, can any man alive see from the distance of five or six hundred yards, on from the Bald-face Stag? - I was about the middle of the road.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that a man standing in the middle way between the Three Horseshoes and the Bald-face Stag, can see to the hill; suppose a man was in the middle, between the Bald-face Stag and the Three Horse-shoes, can he see any thing that passes upon the hill that comes up from the Horse-shoes toward London? - What I saw I can swear to.</p>
               <p>It is a quarter of a mile? - It may be half a mile from the Three Horse-shoes, to the Bald-face Stag; I did not mark the ground.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was stopped on the rise of the hill, some distance from the Horseshoes.</p>
               <p>Court to Hall. Was the coach out of your sight? - Yes; I suppose it was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, before I met the boys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. I refer it entirely to the Court; the principle witness I should have called, is at the point of death, which Mr. Sims can testify, he saw the people come by at the time the robbery was committed, and he said at Highgate to Mr. Morgan; why, you are swearing false!</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Sims. Did you hear that? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You know that Becket is ill? - Yes, he is unable to attend, he was sent for as an officer, he came down to the Office; he said, he saw some suspicious persons along with Hall; Beckett was in company with Hall, they had been together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harvey. I leave my defence to my counsel; I am very innocent of the affair.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You I believe are the prosecutor mentioned in this indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Tell my Lord and the Jury all that passed at the Sun in St. Catharine's?</p>
               <p>We were drinking at Mr. Wilkins's at the Sun at St. Catharine's, and two women were wrangling in the house; I took one of them and led her out to the door, and she took off her patten and she hit me on the nose, it cut me, I had a stick in my hand, and gave her a slap, not to do her any harm; she went into Mr. Wilkins's, and was going to bring one of the measures to knock my brains out; she said she would get a warrant for me; I was at the same house the next day; I remember Whiteway coming into the house; I was sitting drinking with some of the gang, and he came and told me I should go with him, I told him that I would not go with him, that I belonged to the King; I told him there was some beer to drink, and I would not go with him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Dawson's coming in? - No, I know nothing about Dawson; the prisoner told me, that if I would not go along with him he would shoot me; indeed I do not know what I said, but he said immediately, clear the way, and did shoot at me with a pistol, I believe it was loaded, but I had a wound; he never took me up nor laid his hand upon me on the warrant, but said I should go along with him.</p>
               <p>Was you wounded? - Yes, he laid the bone bare; I fell down under the table, and I got up and walked two or three steps, and fell again under the table; then I cried out murder, and went into the street, and walked down to the rendezvous; I never struck him, nor he never touched me; here is the hat I had on, (an oil-skin hat with a large hole in it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's Counsel. You was what is called master of the gang? - I do not know, the Lieutenant told me I should be the captain of the gang.</p>
               <p>How many of your gang were there? - I know there was not a dozen.</p>
               <p>Were there several? - There were only eight in the whole, but I do not know how many; whether they were all there I do not know, nor how many were there.</p>
               <p>How long had you been drinking together? - Not long; we had two pots of beer, I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the prisoner before in the course of your life? - I do not know that I had.</p>
               <p>You never had any quarrel with him? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Nothing that should occasion any spite between you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>What weapons had you, and the rest of your gang? - Nothing but sticks.</p>
               <p>Bludgeons for the purpose of defence? - Defence! we did not need any defence.</p>
               <p>Have you one of them here? - No.</p>
               <p>They were such sticks as press-gangs usually carry with them? - Yes, Sir, we had sticks; I had a stick; I do not know whether all the rest had sticks a-piece.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to him, that you would not be taken by any b - y b - r of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240024"/>thief-taker, and that you would knock his brains out, if he offered to take you? - Indeed I did not, nor any expression of that sort.</p>
               <p>Did not you raise your stick to prevent his taking you? - No, I did not, but I had the stick in my hand, and I lifted it up; I do not know whether I did not do thus; I stretched the stick between me and him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, what was the expression that you used when you raised the stick? - I used no expression at all; I did not raise the stick any higher than this; I did not raise it for any purpose to strike him, or to do any harm with it.</p>
               <p>You have told us already you had once refused to go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But this man repeated that you should go with him, or he would shoot you? - Yes; upon which I told him, I would not go; he first said, young man, you must go along with me; I said, I will not; then he said, if you will not, I will shoot you; and he said, clear the way, and he shot me; I did not raise the stick at that time; I did not say, if you attempt to take me, I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you would not be taken by any b - y b - r of a thief-taker, and that you would knock his brains out if he offered to take you? - As I wish I may be saved, I did not say such a thing, I had not time to say much, that was all I said; when he came in, he said; young man, you must go along with me; no says I, I will not; says he, if you do not, I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>The rest of the gang had sticks? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not they all raise their sticks? - I do not know that they did; I do not know that he was desperately beat afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did you ever strike him, or hold up your stick to strike him? - No.</p>
               <p>Tell us, and repeat it, that it may be fully understood, what conversation passed when you said you would not go? - He came and said, young man, you must go with me; he said, he did not care what I belonged to, snapping something; I do not know whether he said again, I should or not; but afterwards he said, if I would not go with him, he would shoot me.</p>

            , another of the runners; then William Pickett went to the door, and said to Dawson, will you take my word for his appearance the next morning; Pickett is one of the gang; Dawson was very agreeable to take it.</p>
               <p>Did Dawson say any thing? - Nothing that I heard; he was agreeable to take it; then Pickett came in, and spoke to Whiteway, and said, that Dawson had taken his word for his appearance the next morning; Whiteway said, I will take nobody's word; he clapped his hand on his left hand pocket, and took the pistol out of his pocket; and said, take care, take care, I will blow your brains out, and fired immediately.</p>
               <p>Did Philbin strike him, or was he near enough to touch him? - He was near enough to touch him, but he did not strike him, but he held out his stick in this manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Describe the manner, (describes it, by holding out a stick rather slanting down) Philbin had his hat on, it was tore in the manner it is now by the shot; it was a new hat; Philbin fell underneath the table; I stood close along side; he did not strike at Whiteway, nor did any of my comrades make any resistance at all; this is the pistol which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I want to see whether I understand you right; all that passed after Whiteway came in, was Pickett's telling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240025"/>him, Dawson had taken his word; Whiteway's saying, I will take nobody's word, and taking out his pistol, saying, take care, and firing immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No conversation passed between you and Philbin, after Whiteway said that he would fire.</p>
               <p>Had there any conversation passed between them before? - Yes, when Whiteway came in, the prisoner said, Philbin must go with him; Philbin made answer, and said he would not go; Whiteway said he should go; I heard no more.</p>
               <p>What did he say, when he said the second time he should go? - I did not hear Whiteway say any thing more; Philbin said, he would not go with any b - y runners; he held the stick in the manner I have described from the first to the last; we were all standing up, Whiteway ordered us to stand up; Philbin said, he would not go; Whiteway said, he should, and Philbin said, he would not go with any b - y runner; that was afterwards.</p>
               <p>So then Philbin always refused to go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The woman came in, and she charged him as her prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the assault between the woman and him? - Yes; there were four of us there; we had no sticks with us, only Philbin had a stick.</p>
               <p>He said he would not go with any b - r of a runner? - Yes; that he said just before Whiteway shot him.</p>
               <p>How many other persons were there in the room besides your gang? - That is impossible to tell; Whiteway had nobody with him, but Dawson.</p>
               <p>And you were four of you? - There were about four of us, at the time he came to serve the warrant; there might be eight or nine of the gang, at that time we were all sitting down; I never saw the prisoner before; never had any quarrel or ill-will with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did these eight or nine of the gang, or any of you, attempt to rescue the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you call rescuing? did you strike, or attempt to strike? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is the captain of a press-gang with a bludgeon in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Surely that will reduce murder to homicide.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. An officer who is resisted in the execution of his office, may justify the fact of killing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Do you think he is resisted (by saying he would not go,) by the captain of a press-gang holding a bludgeon in his hand this way, and saying he would not go.</p>
               <p>Court. If a man holds a bludgeon any way in his hand, and declares he will not obey the warrant of a justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. He said, I will not go without any other resistance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. It could not at the most, have been more than man-slaughter, if death had ensued.</p>
               <p>Court. I will not say, whether it is justisiable, or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. It seems to me, that that fort of shooting which, would have amounted to murder, if it had been followed by death, is a malicious shooting, and vice versa, that if it would not have amounted to murder, if death had ensued, it could not be a malicious shooting; it would be a strange construction, if such a firing, as tho' not being justifiable, would have amounted only to manslaughter, if the party had died, could be within this statute, for then he would not have been deprived of the benefit of clergy, if the man had died.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is a constable comes with a warrant, and a man standing at the head of a press-gang, declaring, I will not be taken, and held a weapon in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Why are eight men who are in habits of peace, without having a weapon in hand, without uttering a word, to be considered as a gang.</p>
               <p>Court. No, but any other men that were so armed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. But they were not armed.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240026"/>Court. The captain was armed, and he repeats his declaration in words, that he will not go.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. They are not under his command for any such purpose, or inclined to act improperly.</p>
               <p>Court. There are seven or eight companions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. We wish to proceed in our case.</p>
               <p>Jury. How many were there of your people at that time? - Eight or nine; there were a great many men and women in the room.</p>
               <p>Jury. We live near that spot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Your gang were not armed you say, nor interfered at all? - I did not mind that any other of us had a stick.</p>
               <p>Jury. He did not offer to strike? - No, it was almost as thick as a broom stick, with which we used to go out a pressing, but it never was attempted to be used for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the warrant produced? - I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Court to Philbin. Did you see it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he touch you, or take you? - No, if he had touched me, I would have gone with him.</p>

            , and she sent a girl to get Whiteway to take Philbin, and I told him to get out of the way, for there was a warrant against him; and he said he would not be taken, for he would go and fetch a gang; this was in the day time; Whiteway did not come at that time; at night Philbin came with this gang; and then Whiteway came to take him away; Whiteway said he was his prisoner, and he said he would not go with never a d - d bloody b - r of a thief-taker in England, and he raised his stick, bearing it high.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it was possible for him to have taken Philbin at that time, if he had desired it? - No, I do not, because there was so many of his side; he told me in my bar that he would not be taken, and that he would have his gang down.</p>
               <p>For what? - To take his part.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did it appear to you that the stick was raised? - To defend himself against Whiteway, as I should imagine.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Whiteway? - A great many years.</p>
               <p>Is he an ill natured man? - A very honest man I believe; he is a man I never had any words with; he uses my house four times a week I suppose; I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Did any of the gang that were there at all interfere, or attempt to strike at Whiteway? - They were all armed with sticks; and they all got up in arms; they all stood up round him; they were all in a box together.</p>
               <p>Were they so before Whiteway came? - They had been in I believe the course of five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they attempt to hinder Whiteway from executing his warrant? - The man that he wanted, said he would not be taken; the rest stood round him; Whiteway ordered me to aid and assist, and I begged for peace; upon my oath I believe it was impossible for Whiteway to have taken him.</p>

               <p>(Produces the warrant.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. Is that the same warrant that you had? - It is the warrant that the prisoner produced to Mr. Staples, and said it was the warrant he went to execute.</p>
               <p>Is that he warrant that Whiteway had when he went to take Philbin? - He produced the warrant the next day, when he examined he produced this; I went with him for the purpose of executing it. (The warrant banded up, addressed to all constables and headboroughs.) I went into the house after Whiteway.</p>
               <p>Did you see Philbin there? - Yes, Pickett applied to me to take his word for the prisoner's appearance in the morning; I agreed to it.</p>
               <p>Was there any resistance made to Whiteway by any of the gang? - I saw Philbin standing up, and saying to Whiteway, he would not go, and Whiteway said he should; immediately upon that, I called in Wilkins, and some others to come in to keep the peace; all the people said he should not go.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, I will not deny that; I mean all but Pickett; he was talking to me.</p>
               <p>Did Leach say so? - I do not recollect Leach; it was a general voice; he is the Captain of our gang, and he shall not go; Pickett said, if you will take my word, I will produce him in the morning; my reason for taking Pickett's word, was as much because I saw it was impossible to take him away by force; I did not see the warrant produced; it had been intimated to me by the companions, that he should say he would not come with any body; I had been about some business, and I met the woman with Whiteway; he applied to me, and said I am afraid he will not come; I said I will go down with you; I did think it morally impossible from the manner in which these people behaved that Whiteway could have brought the man away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baldwin. I have done.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall not trouble the Jury with any defence.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the construction of this act has not been, that such shooting has always been held to be malicious, as would have amounted to murder, if it had killed the party; now considering this case, suppose that instead of only wounding the prosecutor, that the prisoner had in fact killed him, what would have been the consequence? Serjeant Hawkins says, that when an officer kills one who resists him in the execution of his office, he may justify the fact: this man was a constable acting under the authority of a warrant granted by a Justice of peace, for an assault and battery, by Philbin; he comes there, and Dawson is prevailed on to give his consent at the request of Pickett, that Philbin should appear the next morning, and Dawson tells you he did not think it safe at that time to execute a warrant, otherwife he certainly would; it was his duty, he ought to have executed the warrant, and taken Philbin before the Justice; it was the prisoner's duty, and he was punishable if he neglected his duty to have executed that warrant: here is a press gang, consisting of seven, and Philbin at the head of them; he lifts his weapon as the press gang say, with the end of the weapon towards the ground; that alone would not be an assault, but coupled with the declaration that he would not go with the constable; it would justify the officer, and reduce the crime to manslaughter, if he had killed him on that occasion; but on the evidence of Wilkins and Dawson, it appears that all the press gang resisted; they all declared with one voice, that Philbin was their Captain, and that he should not go, that he should pay no obedience to the warrant of the Justice. Gentlemen, it is not an offence within this act, and it is not necessary for me to say how far it was justiable, it is sufficient for me to say, I think in point of law, the prisoner must be acquitted.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240029"/>Jury. Is the prisoner at the bar a regular officer? - Yes, he is a constable of the parish.</p>

               <p>I was going from my work about six at night, and in Holborn, there a came a strange man to me, and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, how are you countryman; I said pretty well; he gave me share of two pots of beer, and three glasses of gin, and he asked me to buy a watch; I do not know the man; he said he would let me have it for three pounds ten shillings; there was his wife with him, or a sister, she had the ring on her finger, and he said he would give me the ring into the bargain; I gave him the money, and took share of two pots of beer; he said he lived at No. 16, in Holborn; I enquired there, and there was no such person lived there; I was but three days out of the country.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is word for word; it is a mere story.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner Wilson, lodged and worked most part of the time with his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240038"/>fellow-prisoner; after he lodged in my house, I found I had been robbed; he begged the favour to lodge with my aprentice a few nights, because his shop-mate's wife was come to town; he certainly lodged there one night; about three weeks after, I missed some goods out of the room where he slept; I will not be sure of the day; I found most part of these goods at his sister's with the constable; the things were tied-up in James's apron; I could swear to the goods, they are in the Court; he confessed his shop-mate had induced him to commit the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise of favour made him to tell? - Yes; we went into the room to him, I told him, if there was any thing more and he would confess before I went out of the room, I would shew him all the mercy I could; he would not; but after he went out of the room I told him I would not forgive him if he did not tell the whole; when he came to the Justice's, I do not recollect any promise being made him; he confessed before Sir Sampson, that his shop-mate had induced him to commit the robbery, and we found the rest of the goods in Hollier's room; Hollier worked for another master; at Hollier's were found a pair of boot-legs, and some odd pieces of leather besides; they were marked with a G and B, the currier's mark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In what part of his house were the things found? - Hollier took part of them out of a closet in his room; he produced them there as things brought by the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was in the habit of taking things there that were to be worked up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did Wilson say any thing about the things that were found at his brother-in-law's? - I do not recollect he did; he acknowledged the whole of the robbery, and said the other persuaded him to it.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the parish of Hayes; I took this horse as I was going along with the prisoner in a cart, I saw the horse in a field; I was going to take the prisoner to London, as Mr. Martin was not there, I went no further than Kensington; the prisoner said, that was the horse which he sold to Mr. Wycherlae.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise or threat to induce him to make that confession? - No; then I stopped the cart, and the boy said, he was sure that was the horse; I knew the horse, and I was satisfied it was him; it is a very remarkable horse.</p>
               <p>Wycherlae. This horse was bought by Price for me; I sold it to Mr. Sadler, at the Crown at Kensington, for two guineas and a half; he was broke down very bad behind, and could not go above a mile an hour.</p>
               <p>Of no great value, I suppose? - I should have thought at that time, he was worth about 4 l. I took the horse and led him up to grass; the prisoner said, that is the horse that I sold to Price, and the prisoner said, that Price ordered him to bring another if it was a grey one; then I enquired who the field belonged to; and I found this horse belonged to the gentlewoman of the house; Mrs. Sadler, the Crown at Kensington; the gentlewoman gave me the liberty to take him back to Mr. Martin's; Wycherlae had sold him to her.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Do you remember Cook bringing the horse to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it the same horse? - It is; it is a very remarkable horse, he had a sore back, robbed by the cart saddle; he was wrung in the shoulders, and let down very low behind, and a little before, he had a wart on the shase; the constable brought him home, and kept him in custody for a week; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240044"/>have had him four or five years; I have no doubt of the horse; the prisoner lived at Hillingdon, about a mile and a half off; he is a <rs id="t17871024-36-deflabel198" type="occupation">labouring boy</rs>

               <p>Court to Price. You appear here in a very bad light, buying this horse, and if it can be proved what one of the witnesses has said, that you ordered him to bring another horse, and that could be brought home to you, I certainly should order a prosecution against you; it is owing to such people as you, that servants are induced to rob their masters.</p>

               <p>Mr. King. There is some of my writing on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Dixon. The prisoner told me his great coat was there, there was no promise of favour made to him at all; he did not hesitate a moment about telling, and in another coat pocket there were some pearls, and gold beads; these things I found in the receiver's pockets; he is not in custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if you deliver them to Mr. King, they must be marked now, if they should be wanted to be produced in evidence against the receiver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. Have you ever seen this young man? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to King. You have seen these things that were found at the receiver's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What may the value of them be? - About three pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Let them be sealed up after this trial, and let the officer keep them till the next sessions.</p>
               <p>Dixon. I searched him, and found five guineas in a purse, and the prisoner said that was the produce of his master's property.</p>
               <p>- DEAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce a pint mugg, which I bought of a young man that said he came from Hertfordshire; it was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. This is my mug; he was very genteelly dressed; I paid the full price for it; I can swear to the mug at any time; it has had a false bottom; it has several holes in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How did you come by this young man? - I advertised for a servant, and this young man came; he mentioned his friends; his father keeps a house of industry at St. Ive's, and his brother who belongs to the excise, gave him a good character; I enquired of the brother's character there, and I heard he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240047"/>in the excise, and had a little estate of his own in the country.</p>

I can never disapprove of any thing that arises from a motive of humanity, but compassion must not interfere with public justice, and the public safety; this offence is of so dangerous a kind to society, that no tradesman, no merchant, no gentleman can be secure, if confidence cannot be placed in their servants, and especially in those servants that are entrusted, particularly this unfortunate young man was entrusted by you to sleep in that shop for protection of your property, and he has availed himself of that opportunity to plunder you of that property which he was entrusted to protect; under those circumstances, it would be impossible for me, as a Judge to interpose at all, or to recommend him to his Majesty's mercy; the King will dispose of him as he thinks fit.</p>

               <p>The case opened by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am counsel in this prosecution against the prisoner, who is charged as you have heard, with the offence of wilful murder. Gentlemen, of course, when that is stated to you, you will fell that it is a subject that calls for your best attention, and if cases of murder generally call for attention, the present peculiarly calls for it; I am aware from what has passed before the Coroner, that the question will be, whether he has been guilty of murder; or if not, whether he has been guilty of a very bad, and a very unprovoked manslaughter, at the least before the Coroner; there has been an enquiry, and the Coroner's Jury have returned, that this man killed the deceased in his own defence. Gentlemen, you are by no means bound by that finding; if they had found him guilty of murder, you would have been bound by that. Gentlemen, I shall call to you, all the witnesses, persons that will tell their own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240048"/>story to you; and the only object of those that sent me here, is, that public justice may be done, after a full, and a fair investigation between the parties. I need not tell you, that in order to constitute the offence of murder, there must be in the mind of the perpetrator of the act, some malice, some actual, clear, palpable malice towards the person, the object of resentment, or some implied malice from that sort of gross misconduct that has a tendency to the prejudice of his fellow-creatures. I have it not in my power to lay before you any circumstance, from which I can state an inference of any malice pre-subsisting; as far as it came to my knowledge, they were entire strangers to each other; but still, the case stripped of actual malice towards this man, demonstrates a savage and brutal disposition, a brutal and unprovoked attack. My Lord will tell you, I apprehend, that such a case might under the particular circumstances be constituted a murder.</p>


               <p>Gentlemen, I proceed to state to you, the circumstances as shortly as I can; I do not affect to state them with great particularity, because, I would wish you rather to hear them from the witnesses. Gentlemen, the prisoner was <rs id="t17871024-38-deflabel210" type="occupation">gardiner</rs>

I own, I cannot bring myself to see any thing like a justification; any thing that shall reduce this to what the Coroner's inquest have found it: My Lord will tell you, that if in the street, a coachman was to meet me and beat me, I am not justified in drawing out my sword, I must retreat and avoid the danger; I must be in eminent danger of my own life; in order to do that, you would have this to enquire; whether one unarmed drunken foolish man, coming to claim with circumstances of disorder, the possession of his wife, could have been an object of terror, to two or three men armed with fire-arms, in a neighbourhood, where they might call in other assistance from the patrol and the neighbourhood? whether the deceased had assaulted the prisoner? whether the prisoner had been in danger of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240049"/>his own life? whether there was any thing that in the mind of a man of common fortitude could have induced him to fire? if you think it was wanton, if you think it was unprovoked by necessity; it will at least be your duty to find him guilty of manslaughter; if you think a man, could be in circumstances of actual danger; from such an armed man, of which I have no conception, you will find your verdict accordingly. There are circumstances in this case, which seem to shew that the prisoner found no such necessity; I am told that he actually desired that the prisoner would not fire, and he replied, here are enough of us, we will take him neck and crop, and bundle him out of the house; that will make it extremely difficult to say, he is not guilty of some offence; it is very clear, a very melancholy accident has happened; it is necessary that accident should be enquired into; as for myself, I and the rest of the public will be satisfied with your judgment. Gentlemen, I will call all the witnesses, and you will act according to your consciences.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner, in Duke-street, St. James's; I sleep at present every evening at Kensington-house; the steward is in France, and I go by way of safeguard to the house. Last Tuesday was a fortnight, about half past ten, I got to the house of Mrs. Drake, when I crossed over the road, I found the deceased on the outside of Mrs. Drake's gate; he was rushing in a very violent manner; he had got hold of the handle of the gate, and was pulling it backwards and forwards to force himself in; he took no notice of me; says I, my friend, in the name of fortune, who do you want, or what do you want here; says he, I want my wife; are you sure she lives here; he came two or three steps from the door, and said, my wife lives wet-nurse to the Duchess of Devonshire; says I, this is not the place; I told him where the Duke lived; then he went to the gates, and rushed in the same violent manner; I went up to him, and desired him to desist, he was certainly mistaken; in the mean time, the prisoner came up with a blunderbuss in his hand; I saw them come from Knightsbridge; then the prisoner rung at the bell; Mrs. Drake, watchman, opened the gates; the prisoner went in; the deceased man rushed in after him in a violent manner, and put his foot over the gate; he looked over his shoulder, and said to me, come in, Sir; I did not go in directly, till the prisoner, and the house-watchman intreated me to go in; when I stepped within the gates, I found the deceased going up the steps to the front door, there he knocked in a violent manner with his hand; there was no knocker there, and he swore that this was the house where his wife lived, and he would go in; then I persuaded him again; I found all was to no effect; says I, it will be of no use to go in, if you will not go away, we will take you by the shoulders and turn you out; the deceased made no more to do, but he hit me a very violent blow on the under jaw and stunned me; then he ran down the steps again, stripped himself naked, and swore that he would lather me, them were his words; I went to Mrs. Drake's watchman, who had a soldier's piece with a bayonet fixed to the end of it, and desired him to lend me that piece that I might defend myself; and told him, I should be able to keep him off at arms length by it; he lent it me; the deceased by this time was stripped, and the prisoner told him; if you do not go away, you may depend upon it I will I will fire upon you; by this time I had the watchman's piece, and I told the prisoner, by no means do not fire whatever you do; then the deceased ran with his breast against the bayonet that I had fixed on the piece, and he says, fire away and be d - n'd, for I am the lad that can stand twenty balls; fire away, blast you!</p>
               <p>He was at this time naked? - His jacket and his shirt were off.</p>
               <p>He had some arms? - I saw none; I said then, my friend, if you do not desist,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240050"/>I will make you; he took no notice of that, but immediately struck at the bayonet, and knocked it on one side from him, and then I moved on the opposite way to keep myself in opposition to him; then he struck it backwards and forwards two or three times, and in this struggle, the prisoner fixed, I apprehend, the intention of the deceased, was, to obtain the piece from me; he knocked my piece backwards and forwards with his arm; at that time without any thing said to the prisoner, he fired; the last words I said to the prisoner at the bar, was, whilst the man was stripping himself; I desired the prisoner not to fire; after the blunderbuss was fired, I perceived the deceased not so violent as before; so, I immediately said to him, my friend, what a silly man you must be; had you gone about your business, nothing of this would have transpired; he said nothing, but went and sat himself down on the steps; I took up his shirt and jacket, he up with his left hand, and hit me another blow on this side the face, and says, yes, b - st you, I am wounded in that manner: I left the prisoner; I saw the blood on the steps; I apprehended it came from him; I left word with the watchman and the prisoner, where I slept, and that I should be ready to appear; I went away then; I never saw the deceased before or since, nor never saw the prisoner before that night.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing at the time this man fired, that made it necessary to discharge any piece? - Yes, I certainly did; because I had every reason to suppose, that if this man, the deceased, had got possession of the piece, every man would have been in danger; he pushed it to and fro' in that manner, with intention, as I supposed, to take it from me; I thought so by his manner of conducting himself, swearing and blasting; he swore vengeance to every body; I cannot say whether he was sober or drunk; I thought he acted very indiscreetly; he must be either drunk or mad, but which I could not say.</p>
               <p>How many of you were there present? - When the prisoner fired, there was me with the soldier's piece, that was all the armed men that was there; the watchman had no arms; his name is Davis; the other watchman came, but as soon as he found the man was troublesome he went away, as he says, to fetch another watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. This was about half after ten? - As near as I can recollect; nobody was armed, but me with this musket which I have in my hand, which I suppose was loaded, and the blunderbuss which the prisoner had in his hand; I apprehended he was going to take this piece from me; I had no other reason to suppose it at at that time, he was vowing vengeance against every body; I do not know, whether he was hit on his thighs as he lay; I saw the blood on the steps; I cannot say how the prisoner's piece was fired.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the Bow-street patrol; I came up after the accident; I found him in the yard on the front steps leading to the door, laying naked and bleeding, nobody was near him; I asked what was the matter; I saw the prisoner there with the blunderbuss at the time; I asked who it was that had shot the man; he said, I have; I said, could not you get assistance to take the man, do not let the man lie here and die; I went with the man in a coach to the hospital, I never saw him after that night, I saw him after, he died on the Monday night following, Hughes is my partner, he knows no more than me.</p>
               <p>- MONTAGUE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon belonging to St. George's hospital; I attended this man when he was brought in, about half past twelve on Wednesday morning; the morning of the accident, he was brought to the hospital, and every thing necessary was done for him; he was put to bed, he had lost a great quantity of blood, it was not necessary to take any more from him; I saw him at half past twelve, he seemed as if he had been asleep and recovered from a drunken fit; I asked him how it happened, he could not tell me; he continued on Wednesday and Thursday, and Friday he died; there were three wounds, one on the left thigh, and one on the right, gun shot wounds; I extracted the balls the day after his death.</p>
               <p>In your judgment did these wounds occasion his death? - Yes, it was not thought necessary to extract them in his life-time, I had the advice of other people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I have a vast number of witnesses here to the humanity of this man.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is not, whether this is a murder or no, I think it is very clear it is not; here was a scuffle, and in consequence of that the deceased was slain; but the question is, whether it was a manslaughter; he was justified in killing him, if he either thought him to be a thief attempting to break open the house of his mistress, or to preserve his own life, or the life of the person who came to his assistance; in either of those cases it reduces it to self-defence; if you think that that firing was rash, and that that violent measure need not have been made use of, you will find him guilty of manslaughter.</p>
               <p>The Jury withdrew for some time, and with returned with a verdict,</p>

I went with my brother in pursuit of him; it was about five hours after the robbery; when we took him we said, we have got you now, you have taken the things away; and he said, now you have got me, what will you do with me; we first saw him in Long-alley, Moorfields, about twelve yards distance, at a public-house door; I was past him; I looked behind me, and saw him come out of the door of a house in Long-alley, and cross into a passage; I said Josh! Josh! here he is! he saw me; he had his face over his shoulder, watching me for some distance; when I got into Moorfields, I lost him; he ran all the way till he was taken; nobody else was running; I found eleven shillings in his pocket.</p>

I have as many pistols as you have; the first pistol did not go off, the second did; I returned it; one of them clapped his hand to his side as if he was touched, and then to his face; there was a ball, with eight or nine slugs; the persons I imagined were wounded, they set off; I then went and called two of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240056"/>Mr. Hughes's people; all this time Mr. Hughes's people were in the house; having discharged one pistol, and having no more ammunition, I thought it not proper to follow them; I went and searched the house; there was a pistol lying between the parlour door and the street door, and two bottles of spirits; they had broke into the house, and had wrenched out the iron bar of the cellar, where I suppose liquors are kept, facing that was the kitchen, where there was a quantity of linen; I saw no more of the prisoner till about four weeks afterwards; I heard he was in the New-bridewell precinct, St. George's-fields; I got our under inspector to go over with me, I gave him a description of the prisoner; I said as soon as I saw him, that is the person; he had a blue coat on, a flannel waistcoat, and a blue apron wrapped round his body; I saw him about four weeks after; says I to Mr. Knight, that is the very person I had hold of; the prisoner denied it strongly; I went away, and some time afterwards I went to the Rotation-office; I was subpoena'd down to Ryegate in Surrey, and there was bound over to attend here.</p>
               <p>Had you a lanthorn with you? - No; it was quite star-light, and getting upon the bank, it casts a great reflection.</p>
               <p>Could you swear, at the distance of four weeks, that you know that man again, having only seen him by star-light? - He was so remarkable, that I gave a description of him to Mr. Hughes, and they told me his name, and where he lived; Mr. Hughes would not go over with me; I even told them he was about as tall as me, if not taller, and a great deal lustier.</p>
               <p>Was there any advertisement of this man put in the papers? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As they all knew where I lived at the time, why did not they come after me?</p>
               <p>Elliot. Mr. Hughes's men who worked for him, knew where he lived, and by the description I gave, they told me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Are any of your servants here? - No.</p>
               <p>And you was not there at the time? - I was not in the house.</p>

               <p>All the reason you have to say that he broke out was, that you do not know how he could get out otherways? - I saw no marks of violence, but the yard door unbolted and half open, and near to it a pair of step-ladders placed against a wall in my yard; I bolted the door myself before I went to bed, I do every night of my life.</p>

               <p>You saw a person in a neighbouring yard that you supposed to be the same, and apprehended him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. This witness has been under the predicament of losing his licence; this is through spite and malice.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>What trade is the prisoner? - I knew him to work in the gardens.</p>
               <p>Was he a blacksmith or a carpenter? - Not that ever I knew, he was only a gardner, such as ditching, or so; the night that these things were taken, I alarmed the whole neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. She said, if you do not hurt me, I will tell you where they are; I said, I do not want to hurt you, produce my property; she said, she had pawned them at three different places.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not the woman instantly say, no, I keep the house? - No, she did not; she did before the magistrate say so, and that Thompson had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Were not both the women, women of the town? - I do not know what the woman prisoner is; the pocket-piece was found under the rugg.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I know them scales to be my property, I can swear to them, the weights are new; I know the bowls to be my own, I have had them these seven years and more; the pocket-piece, I am upon oath, I saw in my till, when I locked up the drawer.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. What do you know the pocket-piece by? - I have given it to the child to make her take physic, and made her believe it was a guinea, and she got somebody to weigh it, and she found it was not weight.</p>
               <p>Now look at this, and tell me in what they differ? - That is very different.</p>
               <p>What is the difference? - One is very good, and that is very indifferent; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240064"/>is a particular mark on the head of the one, a little bit of a straight stroke on the head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will shew them to the Jury that they may see whether it is possible to swear to such a one.</p>
               <p>Court. What halfpence were your's? - There were fifteen shillings worth of bad halfpence tied together; those that I saw were not in papers, those that I lost were; this pound of tobacco I bought on the Saturday night; I never untied it; there is no mark on the paper.</p>
               <p>Mayne. I apprehended the prisoner, Cozier, the night after the house was broke open.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant of Mr. Newman's, in cutting rods for him; I know his ozier grounds at Battersea very well; I cut for him last year, I began a little before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Should you know these rods again, if you was to see them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you dispose of any of these rods by order of Mr. Newman, or on your own account? - No, never; I saw Green before the Justice; I was present at the examination; I cannot say whether it was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been an ozier-cutter? - I worked for Mr. Newman about two years; I served my time to the trade of basket-making.</p>
               <p>These were the rods, were they? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If I was to shew you a bundle of Oxfordshire rods, should you know them? - I never was there.</p>
               <p>Suppose I talk of my own country, Hertfordshire?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240066"/>- If I was used to the ground I could soon tell them.</p>
               <p>Tell us your reason for knowing these rods from any other you have never seen? - I would not.</p>
               <p>You would not be able to distinguish them from the others? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you distinguish them from the Battersea rods? - Yes; some rods grow very rough, and some not quite so rough.</p>
               <p>You cut them down with the bark upon them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see these with the bark upon them? - Yes, most undoubtedly, it gets browner.</p>
               <p>The quality of the rods depends in some sort upon the moisture or drains of the ground upon which they grow? - The more moist the better for the roots.</p>
               <p>Therefore any grounds of equal moisture, would produce the same sort of rods? - I look upon it to be so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman has grounds at Chiswick? - Yes, all in one line by the water-side.</p>
               <p>There is very little difference between them? - There is enough difference to distinguish between them, though you might not, one runs knobbly, and the other runs smooth.</p>
               <p>Does the river Lee oziers run knobbly? - I never saw any of them.</p>

               <p>Do you know the examination if you was to see it again? - If I was to hear it read.</p>
               <p>Was you employed by Mr. Newman? Yes, I sold some after these were lost, but not before; it was my business to sell; I sold them after the month of February; I never sold any before.</p>
               <p>How many ozier twigs have you sold for your master? - Many hundreds of bundles; I have sold for very near a year before that, but none of the produce of that ground, nor none of that year's growth; I have been with my master eighteen or twenty months.</p>
               <p>Have not you sold during that eighteen or twenty months, any other twigs off the Battersea grounds of that year's growth? - I am convinced of it; I am clear of it.</p>
               <p>Where is your book? - It is at home; I sold none off that ground before February; I sold some in March.</p>
               <p>What day in March? - I cannot say, I sold them when they were enquired for.</p>

               <p>I was present when the house of Neven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240070"/>was searched; I saw, found there, a callico napkin, the same thing as a towel, a chintz muslin shawl; I think there were two calico handkerchiefs; I do not recollect any thing else, any more than some patterns which we used to sell the handkerchiefs by; no pieces of handkerchiefs; they were found in the drawers of a bureau up one pair of stairs in a bed-room.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from Neven himself, that it was his apartment? - I do not know that I did; I took it to be so; he said, he knew nothing of them, he supposed his wife bought them.</p>
               <p>Were you present in Court when Gilbraith was tried? - I was.</p>
               <p>Were those things produced on that trial? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether they were a part of the things for which Gilbraith was indicted? - They were not; we supposed them to be things stolen by Gilbraith.</p>
               <p>But were they included in the indictment against Gilbraith; how many chintz muslin shawls were there in that indictment? - Two.</p>
               <p>How many altogether were found? - I I do not know; Lavender has a list.</p>

               <p>Do you know of any connexion between the prisoner Neven and Gilbraith? - Only by intercepting a letter addressed to Neven from Gilbraith.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I live in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Who with there? - With a lighter-man and waterman, with Mr. Mills, he is foreman to the Phoenix fire-office: I know the prosecutor, I was going to live with him in the country; before I was bound apprentice, I used to go to the prosecutor's every market morning; I was his boy at that time; I did not see the prisoner pay for the plumbs, I saw her take one half sieve of plumbs, and put it under her cloak; I did not see her take away any more; she gave them to a woman to take away, and desired her to carry them home; she did that in the open market.</p>
               <p>Whether they were the plumbs that she had set aside behind your master's stand, you cannot tell? - No.</p>

               <p>What did she say after she took away the second basket; did she ask you to give her back the nine-pence? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>When was that? - I cannot tell you justly the day.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Was not it last Saturday? - I do not know whether it was not; I believe it was; I was there above half an hour.</p>
               <p>Not two hours? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to dinner there; he is one of the bail? - She wanted to make it up.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you offer to give money if the woman would make it up with you? - No.</p>
               <p>I have here three witnesses to prove it, if you dare to give that answer: did not you say that you did not mind giving a triffle to make it up? - I never offered any money at all to make it up; for I always said, I could afford to spend one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>I know you said you could spend one hundred pounds; did not you say last Saturday, at Tanner's, that you did not mind giving a triffle to make it up? - No, no such thing.</p>

               <p>Did not you there say that if the woman was to go to her attorney, you supposed he would not let her settle it; but if you have taken a false oath, God forgive you? - No.</p>
               <p>You never said, I am sorry for what I have done, and if I have taken a false oath, God forgive me? - Lord have mercy! I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did you say this, that the woman must not expect to make two great a property of you; but, that such a matter as four guineas you would give? - No, I never said so, they asked me to give four guineas.</p>
               <p>What business had you at Tanner's house? - He was one of the bail for this woman; she asked me to go in there.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you at Tanner's? - About the woman; whether I would make it up or no; I said, we cannot make it up now.</p>
               <p>You said that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But if I could, I would give something to make it up? - No, by the living God.</p>

               <p>Do you know Mr. Aldus in the market? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you applied to a woman that you knew very well by the name of Aldus, to ask her to get the prosecutor to make this up with you? - I never asked any body, I will be clear upon my own conscience; they came and talked to me about, this, that and the other, but I never desired any body to make it up; I could not make it up without money; they are a parcel of scoundrels; they all hang together.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>Prisoner at the bar. You have in this case, in the first instance, been guilty of a crime, which certainly would have brought you within the description of those laws, that punish resistance against the officers of the revenue with death: You have in the first instance, in strictness of law, most unquestionably forfeited your life; and it is highly necessary for the public, and for the preservation of the revenue, that those laws should be carried into pretty rigorous execution; but you have in a considerable degree, atoned for the crime in which you have engaged, by saving the life of a fellow-subject; which is a circumstance of merit, which ought always to be considered in the administration of justice; those who prosecute on behalf of the crown, have proceeded with great candour and lenity in this case; they have brought the offender before the Court, and have themselves stated to that Court, the circumstances which induced them to think you an object of lenity and favor: these circumstances therefore, the Court think it right to follow up the merciful intentions of the crown, and to pass such a sentence on you, as compared with the nature of your original offence, will certainly wear the appearance, rather of a reward than punishment; you have saved your life by the circumstance I have already mentioned; but for your own sake, as well as for the sake of the public, it is necessary, that this Court, in following up the merciful intentions of the crown, should at the same time teach and convince you, that you have grievously offended against the laws, and therefore the Court think it right to inflict some punishment upon you, though it should be of short duration; and as you have a good character, the Court would not wish, for your own sake, to mix you with the felons in Newgate; therefore, I shall shorten the term, that otherwise would have been thought necessary to have confined you; and instead of ordering you generally to be confined for six months; I shall order you to be <rs id="t17871024-67-punish350" type="punishmentDescription">

               <p>Your daughter Cornelia received an injury, did not she? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - I cannot justly say the day of the month.</p>
               <p>When was you apprised of it? - On Monday, the 19th of September; I know the child was in great pain.</p>
               <p>Did you search her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe? - I found her linen very much disordered, an appearance of great running and stain.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any marks of violence? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had she any disorder in consequence of it? - The running, I supposed it to be the venereal disorder, but there is a surgeon who can speak to that; the child, when I was first alarmed of it, could not make water by any means in the world; I could not attend to the child, a servant attended her; in the morning I examined her, and she could not by any means make water, and when she attempted it, it was in such extreme pain; I told one of my brother's acquaintance of it, and he went with her to the Middlesex hospital; I live, No. <placeName id="t17871024-78-crimeloc399">14, Monmouth-street</placeName>

             bringing me a child to the Middlesex-hospital, to be examined, whether she was injured by a man, or not; I found a discharge in the private parts, but as that is common to children, I could not be sure; I proceeded to examine the hymen, but the child was in such pain, I was obliged to desist; I gave the person a lotion; the child was brought again the next day, when I examined the hymen, I found it in a tolerable perfect state; she proceeded with the lotion two or three days longer, and the child was better; I was then summoned to attend Justice Walker.</p>
               <p>Could there have been any penetration of the hymen in that condition? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>There could not? - No way, it was impossible.</p>
               <p>The apothecary deposed to the same effect; that the prisoner had the venereal disease, and the girl had such an infection, but no penetration had, or could have taken place.</p>
