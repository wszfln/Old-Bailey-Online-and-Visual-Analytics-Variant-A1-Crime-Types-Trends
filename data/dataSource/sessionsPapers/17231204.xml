             deposed, As he was going through the Privy Garden between 12 and 1 a Clock, he was told by a Boy, That there were in such a Place, near the Duke of Richmond'd House, two Men a fighting. That thereupon he made up to them, and seeing them with their Swords drawn, making Passes at one another, and, that the Deceased made two or three Passes at the Prisoner; he called to them, saying, What are you doing? Have you a mind to be hang'd? That upon this the Prisoner dropp'd his Sword, seeming willing to desist. That then he went to the Deceased, and desired him to desist, asking him, If he had a mind to be hang'd? To which he answered, No; and desired that they might be let alone to fight it out. But he getting behind him, endeavouring to secure him from doing Mischief, he let his Sword fall, and it was taken up by the Prisoner, who returned it to the Deceased, and he put it up himself. And as they were carrying them to the Guard, the Deceased desired him, and other Persons that were there, to take Notice, if any Mischief came of it, that he forc'd the Prisoner to it. Mr. Wellbeloved deposed, That as he was Passing through the Privy Garden, being told that there were two Men a fighting, he went, and saw the Deceased stand leaning against a Wall, and bloody, and the Prisoner having the Deceased's Sword in his Hand; and the Deceased said, D - n you, give me my Sword. That he, this Evidence, bid the Prisoner not give him the Sword, lest he should do him some Mischief. That the Prisoner told him he would give him his Sword, if he would let him put it up for him. But the Deceased said, D - n him, he would put it up himself; and he did return him his Sword, but with great Caution, and he put it up. And as they were going away he turned back, and said to the People there, That they had quarrelled, and only went out to Box and that if any Mischief came of it, he forgave the Prisoner, for he forc'd him to it. And, that having gone fifty or sixty Yards he fell down. The Surgeon depos'd, That he going by at the same Time, went home with the Deceas'd, which was not far off, and search'd and dressed his Wound, which he found had penetrated below the left Pap about five Inches, into the Liver, and he believed to the Diaphragma, which he suppos'd was the Cause of his Death. And he died in about 28 Hours. The Prisoner pleaded, They having been drinking together, the Deceased, pack'd a Quarrel with him, and challeng'd him out to Box, and when they came to the Place he drew his Sword, and swore he would stick him if he did not draw. He also called some Persons to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a quiet, peaceable Person. And the Prisoner likewise pleaded, That the Deceased was a quarrelsome Person, and had before Killed two Men: and for one of the Facts had been tried at the Old Bailey.

The Prosecutor's Servant depos'd, That she being call'd up when her Master was in the Bed, she met the Prisoner coming down Stairs, with the Tankard and Money in a Trunk, and the Keys in her Pocket, and said she would carry it away, for that the Prosecutor had given it her. The Watchman depos'd, that he being call'd, found the Trunk by her which she had brought down, in which was the Tankard, and that she said the Prosecutor had given it her. Another Watchman depos'd, That after she was brought to the Watch-House, she was search'd, tho' she said she had no Money, they found 9 s. and half Pence. &amp;c. about her. The Prisoner pleaded, That the Prosecutor having pretended to lose a Sauce Pan, he made them pay 5 s. for the Sauce Pan, which occasioning some difference between her and her Husband, he bid her go into his Room and sleep in the Great Chair; and that the Prosecutor came in and began to be rude with her, would have her come to Bed, and threw some Money into her Bosom, but as to the Trunk and the Tankard, &amp;c. she knew nothing of them, and she had not meddled with them.

The finding the Goods upon him was confirm'd by the Constable, but the Prisoner would give no Account how he came by them. The finding the Goods upon the Prisoner was further confirmed by Mr. Porter; and, that the Purse was taken up under his Chair, where he sat; and, that he said afterwards, if the Prosecutor would not hang him, he should have the Clothes he had bought with his Money, and he would pay him weekly to make him Satisfaction as to the Remainder.

Another Evidence depos'd, That he knew the Prisoner to have the Awl that was found in the Prosecutor's Lodgings, after the Fact was done, on Board of Ship. and also the Sheath of the Knife, they being Ship Mates. He likewise depos'd, That after the Commission of the Fact, he met the Prisoner at Graves End, and ask'd him what he had done about his Landlord's Business, and that the Prisoner answer'd him, he had made it up, having made two Trips to France, and run Brandy, and had paid them 40 l. at two Payments, 20 l. at a Time.

             depos'd, That Mrs. Maycock having been at Mrs. Leek's, to visit one Mrs. Edwards, who was sick, when she went away, desired Mrs. Leek, that if her Friend Mrs. Edwards grew worse, she might be sent for; and Mrs. Edwards growing worse, accordingly about 10 a Clock at Night, her Couzin Mrs. Leek desir'd her to go for Mrs. Maycock, and Mr. Hammond went along with her, to Mrs. Maycock's Lodgings, in Burleigh Street, that as they were all three coming back, near the King's Head Tavern, at Chancery Lane, there came to them two Gentlemen, who clasp'd their Arms round Mrs. Maycock and her self, and said they should go a long with them. That upon this Mr. Hammond seeing them stop Mrs. Maycock and her self, desired them to let them go, telling them we belong'd to him. That then the Gentlemen swore that we should go with them, or they would go with us, saying, they would know who we were, and whether we were going. That while Mr. Hammond was disputing with the Gentlemen, and they were desiring them to go about their Business, Mrs. Maycock looking into Mr. Stanley's Face, knew him, and said to him, what, <rs id="t17231204-43-deflabel228" type="occupation">Captain</rs>

That then the Prisoner said he was glad he had met with her, and he would go with her, for which she thank'd him, but telling him there was no Occasion, since Mr. Hammond was there himself to take Care of them. But he being resolute, would go with them; and being about St. Dunstan's Church, the Prisoner spoke to the other Gentleman who was with him, and bid him go back to such a Place, and he would come to him presently; but he not going back, he said to him, why don't you go, and adding something in a Language unknown to her, which she suppos'd to be French, he at last did go away, seemingly with the utmost Unwillingness. That then the Prisoner bid Mr. Hammond go before, but he would not; and the Prisoner went with Mrs. Maycock, and she follow'd them. That as they were going along, the Prisoner struck a Man he met, and near Fleet-Bridge, a Woman that was crossing the Way: That when they came to the Old Bailey, to Mr. Hammond's House, they thank'd the Prisoner for his Civility in waiting upon them home, desir'd him to go home, but he would not, but would go in, which they endeavoured to disswade him from, saying, Mrs. Maycock was going to stay all Night with a Gentlewoman that was sick, and they had not any Conveniency for his staying; and that the Deceas'd rush'd in, and the Prisoner after her, Mr. Hammond after the Prisoner, and she after Mr. Hammond; that they went into the Kitchin, where she saw them standing, the Prisoner on one side of the Door, and the Deceased on the other: That soon after Mr. Hammond went into the Yard, and she having pull'd off her Cloak, and the Head of it, went into the Shop to fetch some Milk she was going to boil for her Supper, but was no sooner got in, and had taken the Milk into her Hand, which was not above the Space of two or three Minutes, before she heard the Deceased cry out, Mrs. Leek, Mrs. Leek, I am stabb'd, I am murder'd; upon which in a Fright, she threw down her Milk, and ran to the Kitchen Door, asking what was the Matter to which the Prisoner reply'd, nothing: That the Deceased was then standing on one side of the Table, with her Hands cross her Break, looking at the Prisoner with all the Innocence imaginable, and in a little Time fell down on the Ground, and said to her, dear Mrs. Morehen, I am stabb'd, and the Prisoner on the other side of the Table flourishing his Sword, Swearing, that whatever Man or Woman entered the Room he would kill them; upon which she fell down on her Knees in the Door Way, entreating both for her own Life, (he directing the Sword to her Breast) and that he would permit some Help to come, that what Injury had been done might be repair'd, and crying out for a Surgeon, Mr. Hammond came in, out of the Yard, but could not enter the Room, she being on her Knees in the Door Way, but afterwards some other Persons coming, and slipping by into the Room, and attempting to disarm the Prisoner, he suffer'd his Sword to be taken away, and submitted, saying, his Name was John Stanley: That then she ran and fetch'd Mr. Snowd the Surgeon, who coming in, the Prisoner lay'd himself over the Deceased, and said, My dear Hannah, won't you speak to me? That Mr. Snowd said to the Prisoner, what, Captain Stanley, will you never have done with these Tricks? And viewing Mrs. Maycock, said she was dead; that then they got her up Stairs, cut her Lace, Strings of her Cloathes, &amp;c. and got her to Bed; that in a little Time after she came to herself, and said she was stabb'd she was murder'd she was a dead Woman, and calling upon God for Mercy, died in about an Hour and half after the Wound was given. Mr. Hammond depos'd much to the same Purpose with Mrs. Morehen, adding, that the Prisoner did not seem to be drunk, but walk'd very well as they came along. That after they had come in to his House, he having set a Candle in the Kitchin, went into the Yard to the Necessary House, and saw through the Window the Prisoner and Deceased stand leaning near the Window, and talking together friendly, as he thought, but he was no sooner set down on the Vault, but he heard an Outcry of Murder. Whereupon he ran in and saw the Prisoner with his Sword drawn in his Hand, standing upon a Parry, and swearing that if he came into the Room he would kill him, and every one that entered the Room, come as many as wou'd. That Mrs. Morehen being kneeling in the Door Way, he could not get to him without going over her, so he went to the Shop to get a couple of Broom-sticks, designing first to throw in one at the Prisoner, and so put him in Disorder, and then to rush in and knock down his Sword with the other, but some Women getting into the Room, got hold of him, and he quietly let go his Sword, and said he would do no Harm, that he had kill'd the Woman, and he must be hang'd for it. That then they got a Surgeon, and Things afterwards were as Mrs. Morehen had depos'd. Mrs. Hammond depos'd, That hearing an Outcry, of Mrs. Leek, Mrs. Leek, I am stabb'd, and a faint Shriek, she being lame, made what Haste she could down, and slipp'd in between the Door and the Prisoner, and found the Prisoner with his Sword drawn, and the Deceased on the Ground all bloody; that she caught hold of the Prisoner's Arm, as did another Woman, Mrs. Addesey, and took his Sword from him; and the Prisoner looking on the Deceased, said, I have wounded her, if she be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172312040008"/> not dead, I hope she will. That he afterwards lay down across the Deceas'd, and said to her, Dear Hannah, speak to me; Hannah, for God's sake speak to me. Then getting up, said, You have been a damn'd Bitch. That when the Surgeon came in he spoke to the Prisoner, as had been before depos'd; and, that looking upon Mrs. Maycock, be said to the Prisoner, I will give you my Word you have done her Business. That he reply'd, He had had a Child by her that was three Years and a half old, and if Mrs. Maycock was dead, he must die, and the Child should die, and there would be an end of them all. That they sent for the Watch, and the rest was as before depos'd.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Addesey depos'd, That Mrs. Hammond and she coming down upon the Out cry, found the Deceas'd and Prisoner, as had been before depos'd, and slipping in by him, and taking hold of his Arm, he deliver'd his Sword to her. And as for what follow'd after was as the other Evidences had depos'd. Mr. Snowd the Surgeon depos'd to the same purpose, to what the other Evidences had depos'd. As to his saying to the Prisoner, What, Captain, will you never have done with these Tricks? That he answered, No. &amp;c. That he found the Wound mortal, and told them, though she did come to her self after having been put to Bed yet she would not live till Morning, though, for Decency sake, he did dress the Wound. The Constable depos'd, That having apprehended the Prisoner, as he was carrying him to the Watch-house, he swore outragiously, and said, If she was not dead he hop'd she would be. The Prisoner, in his Defence, deny'd nothing as to the committing the Fact, nor the Manner of it, but only in Palliation said, That he had had a Child by the Deceas'd, which was now three Years and a half old, and speaking to her, and upbraiding her with Unnaturalness, in not taking care to make and provide some Clothes for the Child, telling her, his Circumstances were such, that he was now oblig'd to leave the Kingdom, she (he suppos'd) was provok'd, that he should speak of it where nothing of it was known, struck him, gave him ill Language, &amp;c. which rais'd his Passion to give her the Wound, not knowing what he did. He called several Persons, who would have perswaded the Court to look upon him as a Person lunatick.

That they came to the House of a Neighbour of his, Mr. Jones an Apothecary, making a great hissing, and shaking and rattling of their Clubs; and did in the like Manner at the Crown Tavern and Crown Coffee-house, marching backwards and forwards, and in an Hour's Time got a great Number together, and about eight a Clock they made two Bonfires, one on one side of Cripplegate, and the other on the other. That when one of their Fires was pretty well burnt, they came again to the Crown Tavern, and he saw a great Club thrown from among the Mob, which hit a Man and knocked him down. Then they throwed Stones and broke the Lamps at the Crown Tavern Door, and afterwards retreated to the Bonfire. Then some Gentlemen went out of the Tavern, and went as near the Bonfire as they durst to venture, and read the Proclamation, after which they were quiet for some Time; but afterwards they came up again in a great Body, he thinks some Hundreds, many of them with Clubs and Staves; and as he was standing at his own Door, some of them came up to him and struck him. Whereupon he retired to the Inside of the Door, and bolted it, then they broke his Windows. That there were in the Coffee-Room about four or five Persons reading the News, who being frightened at their breaking the Windows, and throwing in Stones, they ran up Stairs, and before he could bolt the Back-door, they came to it, burst it open with great Violence, broke his Sconce which hung in the middle of the Room, heat and bruis'd him very much; and as he held up his Hand to save his Life, was struck on it, so that it broke the Bone, of which he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172312040009"/> lame, and like to be so as long as he lives. They having continued there about two Minutes, some Gentlemen that were at the Crown Tavern came down, and they went away. That there was no Provocation given the Mob, that he knew of, and what was done afterwards he could not say, being so battened and bruised, and wounded to the Scull, that he was render'd insensible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adams depos'd, That between nine and ten a Clock, the 23d of July aforesaid, he heard at his Door a very great Noise of hissing and following, but they went away, and about an Hour afterwards came again with a greater Number, hissing and hollowing, and crying our, Down with the House, but went away again. After which he went to some Gentlemen who were drinking in his House, having been upon Exercise with Captain Saunders in the Artillery Ground, whose Company had mustered there that Day; and be himself also being Major of the White Regiment, they being at his House at Supper, he acquainted them with the Danger he apprehended he was in from the Mob, and desired them to assist him in case of need. That afterwards the Mob came again the third Time, broke all his Lamps, his Lanthorns and Windows, almost half way in his Passage; and he having sent up for them to come to his Assistance, being afraid they would have pull'd down his House, according as they had cry'd out, the Gentlemen came down and drove them out.</p>

But when the Men in Buff and Scarlet were gone, and retir'd to the Crown Tavern again, they at the Bonfire pick'd up the Sticks and put it together; and, that they never went near the Crown Tavern, that he saw; and, that the Soldiers were half of them drunk, and he thought they would have kill'd one another, for they had a great Mob of their own Party, and at last they came out and fought; then the Mob at the Fire met them, and then the Soldiers run away, and retired to the Tavern, and shut the Tavern Door; and there was none about the Bonfire but Women and Children.</p>

             depos'd, That the Bonfire was lighted about duskish, and he stay'd at the Castle Tavern, and there were about twenty or thirty that went round the Bonfire very quietly; then a Party of the killing Captains sallied out of the Crown Tavern and came to the Bonfire, and kick'd the Fire about, all that were about the Fire being gone away; and then having vapour'd round it, they went to the Crown Tavern again. And when the People were got round the Fire again, Men in Scarlet and Buff came out again with about seven or eight Guns, and two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172312040011"/> Swords drawn, and the Bonfire People met them, and the Captains ran away first, and then they came out again and read a Proclamation, about ten or twelve Words, and then it wanted about a Quarter of an Hour of eleven a Clock. And the Gate was shut, and they went round.</p>

             depos'd, He saw two Gentlemen in Scarlet, one with his Sword drawn, and another with his in the Scabbard, and eight or ten with Sticks, they about the Fire being run away, they push'd the Fire about, but he did not know where they came from. They retired thro' Cripplegate, and by and by there came out four or five with Muskets, and the Gates were shut.</p>

             depos'd, That he heard a following, saw a Bonfire, and a great Company of People gathered together about the Crown Tavern Door, and the People were hurrying about in the Crown Coffee-house. That some Gentlemen in Scarlet came out with Swords drawn in their Hands, and walk'd towards the Bonfire. That those at the Bonfire drew up towards them, but seeing their Swords drawn they ran away, and they demolish'd the Bonfire. Then the Gentlemen went in to the Crown Tavern again, and in half a Quarter of an Hour he saw two Mobs a fighting cross the Kennel, near the Tavern Door, and they made up to the Crown Tavern, and he heard Windows break.</p>
               <p>Mr. Battin depos'd, That he saw Captain Stray come out at the Head of his Granadiers, and they threw the Bonfire about: and there were some with Constables Staves. That there was one Sword drawn, and one in the Sheath, the Mob ran away, and they kick'd the Bonfire about, and then went into the Crown Tavern again, after which the People return'd, and put the Bonfire together again. That some came out with Bayonets and Muskets, made a halt, and cry'd, Fire, and the Bonfire People ran away, and they came and read the Proclamation; and, that the Soldiers made the Battle. That they went to go through the Gate to read the Proclamation; and this was about Nine a Clock.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown depos'd, That she saw it from the Beginning to the End. That they made a Bonfire, and rejoyc'd about it, and when it was about half burnt out, two or three came in Red Coats, and one with his Sword drawn, and one said, There should be no Bonfire. One of them was Captain Stray, and they put the Bonfire out, and went into the Tavern again, and stay'd there about half an Hour, and in the mean Time the People put the Bonfire together again. And afterwards the Captains, and Men in Caps, and two or three in red Coats, came to the Bonfire, and said, There should be no Bonfire. And there was hardly any Body at it but Boys and Girls, and they threw it about, and one Stick of Fire lay in the Front of the Passage of the Crown Tavern. That a Man came by, and said, What do you throw the Fire about for? And kicked the Billet, and it broke Adam's Lanthorn. That the Soldiers stood in the Passage of the Tavern, and there was a Fight there, and then they went about to take whom they could; and, that there had been no Assault upon the Crown Tavern, before they had been out twice, and there had been one Gun let off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard, a Constable, depos'd, The Beadle came about half an Hour after nine a Clock to him, and told him, That the Soldiers came out of the Crown Tavern, and kicked the Bonfire about, and he believed there would be a Quarrel. That he went to Cripplegate, and the Bonfire had been kick'd about, and they were making it up again. That there was a great running through the Gate, and there were Persons in Scarlet Coats, and there was knocking down of People. That he saw one with his Piece levelled to shoot; that he commanded the King's Peace; that he saw Captain Stray there, and that another came with his Sword drawn, and he thereupon commanded the Gates to be shut.</p>
               <p>This being the Substance of the Evidence, as to the Fact, the Prisoners call'd Witnesses as to their particular Persons.</p>
               <p>As to Kite, some Evidences appear'd, who depos'd, That he had been drinking from about five, and was with them till half an Hour past ten.</p>
               <p>As to Ayres, one Witness depos'd, That she saw him about another Bonfire at the three Tuns in Woodstreet till half an Hour past 10 a Clock, and he was taken up by 11.</p>
               <p>As to Ambler, That he was much in Liquor at five in the Afternoon. And another Evidence, That she parted with him between nine and ten a Clock in Forestreet.</p>
               <p>As to Lant, There were several Evidences who spoke as to him; but none that could prove him not there at the Times of these Attacks; and one insisted, That Lant told him, he was employed by Mr.

             to aid and assist him in keeping the Peace. Upon this Mr. Willis was call'd, who depos'd, That being at a publick House, he heard of a great Disturbance, about seven or eight a Clock; that Mr. Jones's House was assaulted, that he went, and they said, those that assaulted Mr. Jones's House were gone. That he afterwards saw Lant among the Mob; said he was sorry to see him there, advised him to go home, and gave him half a Quartern of Brandy to do so. and, that he did afterwards charge him to aid and assist him, but he could not keep him in his fight for above two or three Minutes, and afterwards he heard he was taken up. Being ask'd, for what reason he charg'd him to and and assist him? He reply'd, To keep him from running into Mischief.</p>
               <p>The Course of the Evidence, on both sides, being finished, and the Council for the Prisoners having made their Remarks upon them, Mr. Attorney General reply'd, That as to the Evidences for the King, they were Persons of Reputation; which had no wise been impeached, or called in Question. That they were to the Number of ten or twelve; who were uniform in their Evidence. That they being generally there upon the Spot at the very beginning of the Riot, and where the Injuries were done; and many of them had suffer'd great Damage, they must of necessity be able to give a more exact Account, than those Persons, who; some came by accidentally, some stood at a Distance, and some saw through Windows, and some saw one part; and others another; and, as it appear'd, not one of them the whole; so that their Evidence must needs be imperfect, and perplex'd as to Time, scarce one of them speaking to any Thing that was done before nine a Clock, when it appear'd by several Evidences for the King, that the Disturbance was begun before eight a Clock. The Judge having summ'd up the Evidence on both sides, the Jury went out, and after a short stay, found John Lant guilty of the <rs id="t17231204-52-verdict276" type="verdictDescription">
