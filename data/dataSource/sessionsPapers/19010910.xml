On November 7 th, 1898, I went with Detec<lb/>tive Tritton and another officer to 43, Sigdon Road—I knew that the prisoner was living there then, and that a warrant had been granted—I did not know the date of it—I went to the area door—I saw Sir. Potter, the landlord—I went round into the back garden—the prisoner was in the adjoining garden—I got over into the garden and went towards him—I was in plain clothes—I said to him, "I am a police-constable, and shall arrest you for failing to report yourself"—he was four or five yards from me then—he replied, "Will you?"—he made a running kick, and kicked me on my left knee, and again several times on both legs—he caught hold of my privates with his right hand, and of my throat with his left hand—we both fell—we struggled together, and he kicked me again—we struggled for several minutes—he got away from me, and when he was four or five yards off he pointed a revolver at my head—I saw the shine of it, and also a flash—after he had fired it he got over a wall into a garden in Amhurst Road—I followed him—he fired another shot—I was about nine or ten yards away from him, and in the same garden as he was—before he fired the second shot he was running away, and he turned round and faced me, and then fired—he then escaped into the backs of the Amhurst Road houses—while the struggle was going on I called out several times, "Hurry up, men!" or some expression like it—I did not see the prisoner again after that night till August 1st last, at the Police-station—I was off duty for over a week in consequence of the kick on my knee.</p>

I am superintendent writer to the Army Clothing Department—I lived at 210A, Queen's Road, Battersea, in July—on July 13th, shortly after 7 p.m., I went into the wine bar of the Windsor Castle, near Victoria Station, and from there to the Duke of York, with a man who made my acquaintance in the Windsor Castle—whilst having a drink in the Duke of York the prisoner and another man came in and joined in the conversation about nationality—I disputed that the man I was with was an Irishman—he appealed to the prisoner, who insisted that he was a genuine Irishman—among other matters, the prisoner pulled out his watch and chain, and said, "My watch is a heavier watch than yours"—in a moment of forgetfulness I took out my watch and chain, and handed them to the prisoner, who handed it and his own watch and chain to the man who came in, and the man <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> out of the bar with the watches, and the prisoner, with the man I had originally met, and another man I did not see, pinned me to the counter—the man I had met held me by my left hand, and the prisoner by my right, and put his foot on my ankle, and the other man held my head—immediately I was released I appealed to the manager, and said that I had been robbed—he said he saw nothing of it—they all <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>—I followed them, and saw the prisoner turning a corner sharply 70 or 100 yards from the public-house—I ran and held on to him—I said, "Give me my watch and chain; you know where they are gone to"—he replied that he had lost his watch and chain too—I said, "I will hold on to you, and give you in charge"—I held him till I handed him over to Police-constable Bell, and charged him with stealing my watch and chain—I value them at £30; they were gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were about half-a-dozen in the bar—I was in the Duke of York five to ten minutes before the prisoner came in—the prisoner drank with the man who came in, and with the man I originally</p>

               <p>met, who paid for the drink—the prisoner found surety for £200—only the swivel, or the ring, of my watch could be seen—I have been seven years in London—this was all done like <hi rend="italic">steam clockwork</hi>—the prisoner said at the station, "I have lost my watch, value £5"—I was sober—I had left the Clothing Department at 1.30—I had been home.</p>

About 7.15 p.m. on Saturday, July 13th, I saw the prisoner in a crowd in Brewer Street, near Victoria Station—I went to see what was the matter—the prosecutor said, "I want to give this man in charge; he took my watch and chain"—I arrested the prisoner—he said, "You have done wrong; I have got no watch and chain, so you had better let me go"—this is my note—on passing the Duke of York public-house on the way to the station, the prisoner said, "We were in there in conversation with the landlord"—I took him into the bar—we came out of the private bar and asked the landlord if he heard the con<lb/>versation with this man, and the landlord said, "I know nothing about it"—when charged at the station the prisoner said, "I have lost my watch and chain, valued at £5"—I searched him, and found on him £2 in gold, 13s. 6d. silver, and 4 1/2 d. copper, two latch-keys, and a pair of scissors—he refused his address—he gave his name as William Ryan—both the prosecutor and the prisoner were sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said he refused to give his address because he did not wish his people to know it—the Magistrate refused bail—prisoner was outside, and I was looking for him this morning—he has a good cha<lb/>racter—on the way to the station he used the words, "I know nothing about his watch; all I know is, I have lost mine"—I said before the Magistrate, "Coming through Allington Street, the prisoner said, 'The barman knows all about it; I was in conversation with him' "—he said, "The landlord."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Frederick Daniel Haylock, a cabman, of 35, Outram Street, Islington—about 1 a.m. on August 20th, I went to bed—I had been round the house and seen that everything was right, and had fastened the windows—I saw that the parlour door was fastened on the outside—we only occupy the lower part of the house—my husband came home from work about 2.5—I heard nothing till 5.30 a.m., when I was knocked up—I found the parlour key gone from the kitchen shelf, and I missed from the parlour a cape lined with silk, an overcoat, a Sheffield plate cruet, and a bodice, value together £5—someone seemed to have got in by the window, which opened on the street, with no area in front—the window was wide open, the catch had been pushed back—I went to the Police-station—about 11.30 a.m. I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190109100026"/>
               <p>called there again, and was shown a cape, black bodice, and alpaca shirt, which I identified as part of the property that was stolen—I had not seen the prisoner before I saw him at the station.</p>
               <p>— <hi rend="smallCaps">HUBBARD</hi> (642 <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>). Just before 2 a.m. on August 21st I was on duty at the bottom of Outram Street, and saw the prisoner and two others go from Outram Street to a coffee stall in York Road—the prisoner had a cup of coffee, and the other two stood on the footway—I went towards them, and as soon as I got to them the prisoner set down his cup, and they all went down York Road towards King's Cross—I was in uniform—I had never seen him before—about 2 p.m. I saw the prisoner at the station, and identified him immediately—I did not pick him out from others—it is about 300 yards from the coffee-stall to 35, Outram Street—the prisoner came from the direction of Outram Street.</p>

At about 6 a.m. on August 21st I was called by Mrs. Haylock and her husband to 35, Outram Street—I went and found this small piece of wire lying under the window sill, as if it had been passed over the catch, and the catch forced back; several spent matches were under the window sill—a small table was moved under the window—the parlour door was locked from the outside—it is a very dark place, and it is quite possible that anyone going by would not notice the window being open; there is a lamp at the corner, and another at the end of the street, that makes this place very shady—no report was made at the station by the policeman on the beat that the window was open, so he had not noticed it—when I saw it the window was closed.</p>

About 10.40 a.m. on August 21st I was in Caledonian Road, and I saw the prisoner and some other men going at a very quick rate—in consequence of some suspicion I followed them—the prisoner was carrying this bundle, and he gave it to one of the men with him—they went through Charlotte Street into Barnsbury Road and Penton Street—one man left the prisoner and a third man, and went into Chapel Street, Islington—I was covered by a barrow in the road, knowing that the prisoner and one of his confederates knew me—I kept them under observation for 10 minutes—a whistle came from the direction of Chapel Street—the prisoner and the other man left the place where they were standing and were proceeding towards Chapel Street, when I bounced out and seized the prisoner who had the bundle—the other man ran away—I asked the prisoner what the bundle contained; he said some clothing, and that two men gave it to him, and asked if he wanted to earn a couple of <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> to pawn it—I said I had seen him pass two pawn shops—he said, "I will plead guilty to having it in my possession, but not to stealing it"—not a word had been paid about steal<lb/>ing it—he said, "I don't know who the two men are; I never saw them before"—I took him to the station, and called the prosecutrix, and showed her the property—I told the prisoner I should charge him with committing a burglary at 35, Outram Street that morning—he made no reply—as I was searching him he said, "I suppose I shall have to go through it."</p>

I am Deputy Registrar of the Royal Naval Reserve at the Mercantile Marine Office, Bock Street, East London—I know the prisoner as a Royal Naval Reserve man—such men have not necessarily been in the Royal Navy, but they have joined the Naval Reserve, and have had naval training—some of them have served in the Navy, and some in the mercantile marine—they are entitled to £6 a year, payable quarterly, or if they are on a long voyage they can get remit<lb/>tances—to get that payment particulars of their voyage in a British ship must be submitted to me—I should enter the particulars and the date of the voyage—the deputy registrar initials the articles at the time the man signs, when he starts on the voyage and when he finishes—Naval Reserve men are not bound to be constantly at sea, except for reasonable intervals—men of the prisoner's standing may elect to serve on land, but he would have to comply with the regulations whether on land or at sea—if he goes to sea it must be on a British ship—these are the articles of the <hi rend="italic">Morocco,</hi> in which, opposite No. 7, I find John Lomas signed on as an A.B., and there are the initials "J. R. G." of a deputy registrar—the articles in blank are supplied by the Board of Trade, and the whole crew signs before the ship goes away, at an office in the presence of a deputy registrar; then the captain keeps the articles during the voyage—on the voyage an official log must be kept—this is the official log of the s.s. <hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi> and I find in that, opposite "John Lomas," No. 7, the entry, "Failed to join," and then on a subsequent page a statement is made by the master or mate that that person failed to join—the master would write that after the entry is made in the log, because he has to account for all his crew—this is the certificate book, RB 2, for the Royal Naval Reserve, that records the dates of the prisoner's engagements and discharges—I find an entry here purporting to show that he took his discharge from the <hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi> on June 22nd, and at the end of the entry are the initials "I. V. B."—the <hi rend="italic">Morocco</hi> was going to North African ports, and the voyage took 25 or 26 days—these initials are mine, but are not written by me or with my knowledge or authority—on the articles there are the amounts of the wages the men earn during the voyage—they are paid at the end of the voyage, and on coming up they put "Received," and we sign it—the fact of their receiving the money is itself a proof that they have taken the voyage—if I had known of the "Failed to join" I should not have initialled it—this book, if it had been properly signed by me, would be</p>

                  </hi>. I am a deputy registrar in the employment of the Board of Trade at the Poplar office—it is part of my duty to pay the retaining fee to Reservists—for the purpose of seeing whether the money is payable I require the production of the man's certificate, a book like this—I have to see whether the initials of the representative of the Board of Trade are in this book against the man's service before I pay the money—the prisoner brought this book to me on July 1st; I knew him—it was not necessary for him to say anything, and I do not remember him saying anything—I looked at it and paid him 30s.—he signed this receipt for 30s. on a separate paper—at the time I handed him the money I be<lb/>lieved the entry in the certificate to be a true entry signed by Mr. Bloom<lb/>field—from time to time the prisoner had been in the habit of coming to the office to receive money, principally he went to Dock Street—other gentlemen besides myself paid—if there is a good reason for a man not joining a ship, there is a proper form which a man should fill up explain<lb/>ing why he did not join—that would be forwarded to the Registrar-General, and it is in his discretion to allow or refuse the payment of the gratuity—if he missed his ship through illness or any reason the gratuity might be paid, although he did not serve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have told the Jury absolutely everything—before I was a wholesale tobacconist I was in the Army eight to ten months—I was a Volunteer—before that I was a commission agent, at 22, St. Mary Axe—I tried to buy and sell businesses—I never bought or sold one—I lived on money lent me by a friend—Mr. Beazley is a friend—I do not know what he is—I knew him about two months before I went to South Africa, and since I have come back—I have lived in the same house since the beginning of March—I knew nothing of the tobacco business, but the prisoner stayed with me at £2 a week salary to teach me at 67 and 70, Mark Lane—he taught me nothing—he did not try—I paid him £6 for my month's instruction—he did not sue me for that—Mr. Morley is the friend who advanced me money for this business—the Finchley Road business I paid for myself—Morley gave me the cheque for £50—I still owe him for it—I mean the Finchley business is my business—I shall pay the costs of this prosecution—Mr. Rose was my solicitor in the purchase—I examined the business at Finchley Road on the Friday before June 3rd, before I purchased—Mr. Beazley was with me—I took stock with Beazley—according to the figures Beazley put down, the value was a little over £100—there were discrepancies—he charged me too much for stock—the value of the fixtures was about £25; I was told £40, but I do not believe it, nor admit that he told me they were worth that; what do I know about taking stock?—Beazley knew nothing—it was valued at £100 by the prisoner, and I accepted it—700 dummies were charged, and there were only 300, and there were other discrepancies—he was going to charge £110, but he came down to £100—I took his word—I have not paid for all the stock—I have sold some retail—where was I to put the money but in my own pocket?—the prisoner is a foreigner, but he speaks English well—I have had nothing back, acting under instructions—I applied for a warrant on June 6th—I settled the business on the Tuesday and the Wed<lb/>nesday—my manager was supposed to open the shop—I came about 1.30 a.m. on Tuesday—I got to Mark Lane from 8.30 to 9 a.m.—I served behind the counter at Finchley till about 5.30 on Tuesday—I went about 1.45 on the Wednesday—I left between 4.30 and 5.30—I smoked Danish cigar—the warrant was executed in about three weeks—the pri<lb/>soner went abroad—I have had nothing to do with trying to induce the prisoner to pay back the money and costs of this prosecution—I believe that was mentioned by Beazley—he told me the prisoner had been trying to settle, and that I might have my bill back and costs—I said, "Do not bring me into the matter; it has nothing to do with me; I leave it in the hands of my solicitors"—Mrs. Sekjer saw me at Beazley's house about it—I believe Mr. Rowell was there—the bill has been discounted—I did not say I should be satisfied with the return of the bill and £90 costs—Mrs. Sekjer said her husband was wrong, and she would pay me my money back—I did not buy for stock and fittings, but because the takings</p>

I am a tobacconist's manager at 81, Chaplin Road, Parliament Hill, the business sold by the prisoner—I received this note in the prisoner's writing: "Please make your book up at once with a little increase weekly; I will sign it on Monday morning, when I am at Finchley again. <hi rend="smallCaps">SEKJER</hi>"—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and he instructed me how to make it up with figures which do not represent the real takings—I made my accounts right with this other book, which shows the real state of affairs between me and the prisoner from May 17th to 24th, and signed by the prisoner, showing a credit of £7 7s. 6d. and a debit of £6 14s. 3d., leaving a balance of 13s. 3d. as against 18s. 6d. in the book, which on May 17th showed 19s.—that and the other periods show a balance of about double the real figures in the papers produced, which I kept—I had no idea the business was going to be bold, I did not think of the purpose of it—when Beech bought the business I continued as his manager—on his complaining of the takings I gave him these papers.</p>

               <p>the prisoner's office—I called out the goods at the stock-taking for the sale—Beazley was there part of the time—Beech was not there the whole time, only the prisoner and I—this large book was the stock book—the total is £99 7s. 2 1/2 d.—the stock was put at £110—that was afterwards reduced—there were not very much fixtures—I opened the shop about 9, and about 11.30 on Sundays—I lived at 81, Chetwynd Road, Parliament Hill—I discussed the book with Beech after I had seen the prisoner at his office in King William Street about my balance of salary, which he never paid—he told me he would pay me later on, and would call on Friday, and I asked him the reason for the book—I said the new proprietor was displeased with the amount of sales, and when I got back I told the new proprietor that if he expected the sales to be equivalent to the book, that was an impossibility, and that there were no such sales at 10, Market Parade—he said he believed that book to represent the sales, and then I showed him the real book, which I always kept—the prisoner owed me £1—I did not tell him what I would do if he did not pay—then the intention of the books became apparent—that was the day after the new proprietor took possession—I did not want to create a disturbance—I went to him in answer to his letter, saying he would call on Saturday and pay me the sovereign—the pri<lb/>soner's reply about the new proprietor was, "If that is the case, the business is sold, and I have nothing more to say about it"—I have not a clear recollection of what he did say—he gave me no reason for making up the book, nor said what the difference represented.</p>

I live at 150, Brixton Road—I have no occupation—I introduced the prisoner to the prosecutor for the purpose of purcha<lb/>sing his wholesale cigar business, and the business at Finchley—he said the takings were between £10 and £12 a week, which would leave a profit, after paying all expenses, of about £2 or upwards.</p>

I will do all I can," and I said, "Make your husband re<lb/>turn the money, and leave it to the lawyers to agree to the arrangement to stop the prosecution on the return of the money and the bill"—(<hi rend="italic">The letters and post cards were dated after the arrest on August 14th.</hi>)—I do not see that there was any compounding a felony in it—"L." means your solicitor, Mr. Lumley, and "R." means Mr. Rice—I referred to them, as Sekjer tried to get me to write to them to settle, and I said, "No; I cannot go and ask them to do anything of the sort," and I have his letters at home saying he cannot do this, that, and the other; would not you take an interest in a matter if you had deposited £390?—I wanted to be a friend to both—I was not posing as his friend; I was sorry for his wife—I told him in those letters that I had done all I could, and that the matter rested with himself—I wanted him to act honestly, and not play a game of <hi rend="italic">bluff</hi>—I wrote, "Act honest, pay the money, and so be wise in time; I shall be in by eight"—that did not refer to £30 costs and "no prosecution"—I did not know he was com<lb/>mitted for trial—I am more than 60 years of age—when I wrote, "Pay the money," "be reasonable," and about satisfactory results," I meant that he owed the money, whether he was guilty or not—I said the costs had to be paid, but Mrs. Sekjer suggested the undertaking; I know nothing about costs, I only wanted to see the £140 paid back—on the first business I had £20, after interviewing 45 people and two months' work for him.</p>

I am manager to my father, a hatter, of 47, Old Bond Street—on July 8th I was walking in the neighbourhood of Brixton, wearing a watch, which I value at £25, and a chain—several people pushed up against me—I noticed two men, but cannot recognise them—I went on, and about 20 minutes afterwards I missed my watch and chain, but a sovereign purse, which was attached, was left in my pocket; the ring had been broken, and fastened with a small piece of twine—I informed the police—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is by the same maker, and bears the same number—I saw it at Mr. Avant's shop, a pawnbroker's, but not the chain.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>).. I received information of the loss of Mr. Croker's watch on July 17th—he is wrong in the date—I went with him that day to Joseph Avant, a pawnbroker at 114, Fleet Street, where he identified his watch, which I had seen a description of circulated by the Metropolitan police—I first saw Buchannan on July 13th at the Police-office, Old Jewry—he was asked to come there to explain about a</p>

               <p>watch—he was not arrested, but he was accompanied by an officer—I then took him for another offence, and took him to the Minories Station, where I searched him, and found these three contract notes and two pawn<lb/>tickets, one of which relates to a watch pledged on July 15th for £13 by Thomas Morton, Esq.; no address is given—he was wearing a gold watch and chain, and had a silver one loose in his pocket—I said, "How do you account for this contract note?"—he said, "I got it, with the others, from a man"—I said, "Who is he?'—he said, "I don't know his name; I don't know where he lives, but I got it from him in a club in St. Martin's Lane"—I said, "What club?"—he said, "I don't know"—he gave the name of Scott Buchannan—he declined his address, and referred me to Dr. Pedrick, Mr. Sedgwick, and Mr. Biddle—I went with Mr. Croker to the pawnbroker's on the 17th with the note, and saw the watch—Buchannan said when he was charged that he got it from a man outside a sale room—I arrested Morton on July 18th, and said, "You will be charged with Buchannan with stealing and receiving this watch"—he said, "Buchannan gave it to me to pledge for him for £13, and I received my commission; I have pledged watches for him before"—I took him to the Minories Station.</p>

Deathridge, and I took Young—on the way to the station Young said, "What is the charge against me?"—I replied, "Being concerned with 
Deathridge in forging and uttering a cheque for £191 14s. 6d. on the shoreditch Branch of the London and County Bank"—he said, "I had made up my mind to go away, and he came to me and said, 'I have money to take us both to Australia, and keep you there six months.' I said that I would go. We left Liverpool Street last Tuesday, and went on board; but when we got to Gravesend we came off; the reason was that 
Deathridge had not said good-bye to his young lady. He told me before he went to the bank that he had got money from his father"—he was taken to the station and searched, and had a passage ticket for two to Sydney, and an embarkation notice—he made no reply to the charge—there was also this letter of August 13th to James Swinton, Walton-on-the-Naze, from George Thompson &amp; Co., shipping agents, acknowledging the receipt of the passage money.</p>

I am manager to Louisa Fisher, a pawnbroker, of 116, Commercial Road—the prisoner came in at 1.30 on August 30th, and asked if we would take a piano—I asked what kind of piano it was—he said it was a good one, and asked me to go and see it—I went to his place, 18, Settle Street, facing our street—he took a key from his trousers pocket, and opened the door—he showed me the piano, and I asked him whose it was, and if there was any bill of sale, and if it was on the hire system, and if it was paid for—he said that it was, and showed me this receipt—I asked him if the name (<hi rend="italic">Isaac Greenstein)</hi> was his—he said that it was, and I wrote it down—I examined the piano, and agreed to lend him £20 on it on the condition that it was paid for, and that there was no claim on it—he said that he paid cash £35, and could get £10 from his father or father-in-law on it, but did not want to trouble him, as he only wanted the money for a few days, or a short time—I went back to the shop and then to R. Fisher, of Osborne Street—I showed him the receipt and said, "Did you sell this man a piano?"—he said, "No," and then I saw Messrs. Garrett &amp; Gooch—I then had some conversation with the prisoner, who told me that he was a dealer in live poultry—I did not speak to him of my interview with Garrett &amp; Gooch—I then gave him into custody—I went to the station with them—the prisoner dropped a key which fits the piano.</p>

"C" written by Caroline Dyer at Portsmouth on July 25th, stated that she had been the victim of outrage and attempted murder by some Jews in Portsmouth, in conjunction with Jews in London; that she charged Mrs. Norbury and Mr. Lewis, and no doubt there were others unknown, with entrapping her to 52, Green Lanes, and charged Mr. Lewis with setting fire to his shop, with intent to murder her; that they outraged her in her sleep, to do which they must have drugged her; that she was in hopes to meet one of the people, and would thank the Lord if she got hung for it; that she had not the least idea of such a thing till she got home, when her mother said that she ought to be examined; and that she accused the fireman of being as deep in it as anyone, as, though not a Jew, he was no doubt paid by them</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I practise at 12, Queen Street, Mayfair—I have had many years' experience in cases of mental disease—I went to Holloway Prison on August 8th, and examined the prisoner and his sister—I have had the letters and depositions before me—I formed the opinion that the prisoner on July 26th was mentally, but not very, sane, but was legally a person of sound mind—that he knew the nature and quality of his acts, and he knew what he was doing at the time he attacked Mrs. Norbury, and knew that it was wrong—I found traces of suspicion in him—he is of an exceedingly nervous disposition—he suspected the Jews, and thought they had been concerned in the disturbance at Newington—he entirely believed what his sister and mother had said with regard to the outrage—he said he thought Mrs. Norbury was a procuress in the matter—his not firing the pistol shows that he had self-control at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a fact that when a person has been actuated by delusions resulting in violence, they become much calmer afterwards—the prisoner's mental condition might have improved in the fortnight after the act—people may be perfectly sane except on one subject—the prisoner said that he would rather believe his mother and sister before all the world—I think he suffers from a profoundly morbid and almost insane suspicion, and so could believe all his sister told him—constantly harping</p>

               <p>upon one subject would be a mere formation of insanity—he never mentioned his brother's name to me at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My opinion as to the state of the prisoner's mind on July 26th was made on the whole circumstances of the case—I do not know if be himself thought that what he did was wrong, but he knew that the world in general would think it was wrong—he said that if he lived in France he would certainly be acquitted—he thought it a fair and chival<lb/>rous act to avenge his sister's wrongs.</p>

               <p>—the other constable came back, and it took quite half an hour to take him to the station, as he struck and kicked.</p>

I am a school teacher, of 214, Globe Road, Bethnal Green—on July 28th I was with Lawski in Whitechapel Road—several young men attacked us, and Lawski's hat was knocked off—we both ran away together, and came back with two constables, and charged the man who was wearing the hat—as the constable took hold of him he laid down on the <hi rend="italic">floor,</hi> and his friends gathered round me—I thought that discretion was the better part of valour, and that I would get home—I recognised the man wearing the hat as one of those who attacked us.</p>

McMay took my daughter to music halls, dined with her, and went about with her, and although I objected, I thought there was no harm—she was engaged to be married to a gentle<lb/>man at Melbourne—she did not like this man, and said that she would never marry him, and she wrote to break it off—when I came over here I had £1,000 to £1,500 worth of jewellery—I used to wear a lot of it—Thompson only had the chance once or twice to open the boxes, although he carried the keys, as I locked the bedroom door—I believed his proposal to marry was sincere when I received his note—I accepted him in London—on board ship he looked a nice, decent sort of man—the fact that he came from Bendigo, and was coming into money, had nothing to do with my intention; I had enough for both—I think he showed me a cheque;—I fancy it was on the Bank of Australasia—the £100 was not advanced to pay our expenses in Paris—I suppose he did pay them, and three or four bills at the Russell, but not at St. Ermin's—he took the diamond ring off my finger by force—we were staying at the Russell—we were at a restaurant one night, having dinner—I did not call anybody, because he made me believe we were going to be married—I never said to him about the nugget, "Look here, you can take this, and have a ring made of it"—I have given to the poor who need it—I gave a diamond stud to Mr. Parks—he was a passenger—I never said at the Police-court that it was a set—I gave a brooch to a lady who was kind to me when I was very sick on the <hi rend="italic">Oceana,</hi> going back to Australia—I told my daughter about the £47—I said before the Magistrate, "Had Thompson married me there would not have been any of this whatever; I should never have gone against him as to the £100 or the £500, or anything else."</p>

               <p>Thompson by accident in Charing Cross Road or Leicester Square—I think we first met McMay at the Howard that night—I thought he was an honourable man till Thompson gave him my money in Paris on Satur<lb/>day, June 15th—I did not like my daughter going out with McMay, but I did not want to stop her pleasure; she had not much pleasure, and I did not like to stop it—I am scarcely ever well—on Derby Day I did not suggest that my daughter and McMay should go out and that Thompson should keep me company—going to Paris was not mentioned till after Thompson got the £100, and about a couple of days before we left—I never gave my boxes to Thompson to store—he said we did not require so much luggage in Paris, and he would store some of my boxes, and he stored them at Charing Cross, and gave the ticket to my daughter—I cannot read—I do not remember any hot words about a coin being lost, nor about the chambermaid finding it—she could not speak English—I could not tell what caused our leaving the hotel; they did it—I slipped on the stairs—Thompson did not hold up the nugget to McMay and my daughter and say, "See what Madam has given me," and I never gave it him—I never heard my daughter say she was entitled to that nugget, to make a ring out of, as it was the first piece of gold her father had picked up in Australia—she never complained of my giving my property away—I have given away to those who deserve it, to poor people who were honest—we were both sea-sick—McMay did not find and restore my daughter's purse—I may have surmised that the defendants were bad men, but was never sure of it till the day Thompson broke off the appoint<lb/>ment—after that, on June 18th, McMay continued to call on us at St. Ermin's and at the Russell Hotel, to see what we were doing—I did not treat him on friendly terms—I did not invite him to the bedroom where my daughter and I were—he came, and she said if he did not go out we would call the porter to put him out—we were not having champagne to<lb/>gether at the Russell as late as July 3rd—my daughter never tasted it—she may have tasted it; I can not tell you—McMay was not with us a couple of hours, he might have been an hour with us—coming from Paris, I may have seen McMay eight or nine times—my daughter accepted McMay—she would have married him if it was not for my non-consent—I think she would have run away with him—she knew I did not consent—I said, "If you marry against my will you leave me for ever"—she wants a good man, not a common thief—he has only been in the room twice—I went to the police the day after Thompson did not keep his appointment on Wednesday, June 19th—I obtained a warrant on July 3rd—he stopped in a corner of the room, and Miss Annie and he had very high words about what he had done to her, and turned out such a wretch—he tried to deceive her and ruin her—there would have been no prosecution by me if I had married Thompson; how could my daughter marry McMay when he was married? that shows what a fraud he was to deceive the young lady, who had never been among thieves and robbers—I never told McMay I was sorry I had taken the warrant out, but I was so pestered by the police—my daughter never told me she was imploring McMay to come to her, and that she could not live without him—when I came from Colombo I was met in the docks by two detectives, who saw me to an hotel in</p>

                  </hi>. I am House surgeon at St. George's Hospital—on the early morning of August 12th Bercasin was brought there suffering from a great deal of haemorrhage; he had lost a lot of blood—he was stabbed in 12 places; there were seven stabs on his left arm, from shoulder to wrist—the other five were on other parts of his body; only three of any real importance—one had opened his elbow joint, one had opened his thorax on the left side, and another had injured a large nerve in his fore arm—one of the wounds just missed some large vessels on the top of the shoulder—most were stabs, varying from 2in. to 3in. deep; some were cuts—he was in a very serious condition—I think that but for prompt attendance he would have died—he was in the hospital about a month altogether—the stabs would be likely to be caused by this knife.</p>

I am a barber at 66, Cable Street—on August 6th I was at the corner of Shorter Street with Goldenberg and another man—I saw the two prisoners—Cosgrove took Goldenberg's watch and chain, and knocked him down—Goldenberg held him, and Cosgrove fell on the top of Goldenberg—I wanted to take the watch and chain from Goldenberg—Pollard struck Goldenberg with a knife on his brow—he was standing behind him; then Pollard gave me a severe blow, and I fell down, which gave Cosgrove a chance to run away with the watch and chain into No. 8, North-East Passage—I could not see Goldenberg, because I was chasing Pollard.</p>

I was assistant House surgeon at Poplar Hospital on August 9th, when Williams was brought there at 10.15 p.m.—he had several wounds; both nostrils were torn through, the left rather more than the right, and the septum, the division down the nose, was torn through—he had 10 wounds on the scalp; there must have been re<lb/>peated blows; the longest was about 1 1/2 in., and the shortest about 1/2 in.—he had a lacerated wound over his ear about 1/2 in. long; several shorter wounds and some abrasions, and extravasation of blood below the skin—all the wounds could have been caused by this piece of iron—they might have been serious—he has recovered; I do not think that we thought at any time that he would not recover—I did not hear about his deafness till I met him here a short time ago; he never mentioned it when I dis<lb/>charged him—the wounds might accelerate or increase his deafness.</p>

I was in the Fiddlers beer-house, Beacontree Heath, at 2.20 on August 3rd—the prisoner asked me if I would buy his machine—I said, "No; I have just sold my own"—it was outside—he asked me to lend him £2 on it—I said, "I have 30s.; you can have that, and leave the machine, and when you bring it you can have the machine back"—he said that it was his machine.</p>

On August 11th I received information, and went to the prisoner's house—he was in bed—I asked to see him—he came down—I told him I had seen him with a bicycle, on which he had obtained 30s., of the description of one which had been stolen from Barking, and as it had been in his possession, I should take him into custody on the charge of stealing it—he was taken to Dagenham Police-Station, and afterwards to Barking—on the way to the station he said that he bought it of a man whom he did not know for 30s.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate:</hi>" About 11 o'clock on Saturday I took a walk on the road to Ilford, and stopped at a beer-house; I do not know the name. Whilst having a drink I got into conversation with a young fellow who had a bicycle outside. As he went out I went out. We stood talking for a little while. He said, 'That is my machine;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190109100100"/>
               <p>it is for sale.' I asked him what he wanted for it. He said, '£2.' I said, I had not got it, or should buy it. All that I had was 25s. in my pocket. He would not let me have it for that. I said if he would call at my house on Sunday morning I should give him 10s., to make 35s. He agreed to let me have the bicycle, and I gave him 25s., intending to call with the 10s. Monday morning (to-day) I took the bicycle away, and wheeled it to the Beacontree Heath. As I could not write I went into the Fiddlers, and asked Parish to buy it. He said he did not want it; he had just sold his own. Not having any money, I asked him to lend me a few shillings on it. I intended to sell the machine again. I had no idea it was stolen. He gave me 30s. on it."</p>

               <p>over the rope and bashed into the log as hard as possible, and so a number, called a float, are fastened together, and another rope is made fast to the rope nearest the water edge, to prevent them getting away—they can only get away then by someone cutting the rope, and you cannot cut it except by a chopper—it is the same rope as the Surrey Commercial Docks and all the other docks use for rafting purposes—it is a special kind of rope for securing these things in the water—I examined the logs floating there on the 14th, and had 33 logs of walnut—they average from 8ft. to 14ft. long, and from 1 to 2 tons weight—on August 21st, in consequence of what Thomas said, I went with him, and followed a pony cart to Bethnal Green—on it was a log of walnut, which had the marks "DB" in a diamond, No. 158, 27ft.; that means 27ft. cubic foot contents—DB in diamond, and No. 158, is the dock mark—it was one of our logs—its value was £8—Freeman was in charge of it—I followed him, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Freeman.</hi> If a lighter or barge came up against these logs and cut them, they would tell us; it is possible that a barge running into the float might sever the rope; it would have to be a terribly severe blow to do it, and it would not make a mark like a knife or chopper—this looked like a clean cut.</p>

Shortly after midnight on August 19th Mr. and Mrs. Welch came to the station—I had not been sent for on the 18th by the Ormerods—I do not know that they had sent for some<lb/>one to go to their house on the Sunday evening; I had not heard of it—Mrs. Welch, when she came to the station, was bleeding from a scalp wound on the top of her head; Mr. Welch was bleeding profusely—I cannot say whether her clothes were wet or dry—I went to 66, Scott Street, where I found the Ormerods—I did not notice whether Mrs. Ormerod's dress was wet or dry—the three bottom stairs ware very wet; water appeared to be trickling down them—so far as I could judge, none of the prisoners were suffering from personal injuries, nor did they com<lb/>plain of doing so—another boy, Ernest Ormerod, complained of injuries—I told the prisoners I should take them into custody for being con<lb/>cerned in unlawfully wounding James Welch and his wife—James Ormerod the elder said, "I did strike him with this," producing a Bombay cane, "I must protect my home"—Mrs. Ormerod said, "I did not strike anyone; I had got my head out of the window, shouting 'Polic!'"—I was in the neighbourhood on that night; I did not hear any call for police—the younger Ormerod said, "I struck him once"—before the Magistrate, the gist of what the elder Ormerod said was that he had a witness, and that his child had bad his head out—Mrs. Ormerod "I am innocent," and the younger Ormerod said, "I have nothing to say."</p>

                  </hi>,M.R.C.S. I live at 143, Victoria Dock Road—at 11.50 p.m. on August 30th I was called by the police to canning Town Police-station, where I found Mr. and Mrs. Welch—he had three scalp wounds about lin. long, one on the upper part of his forehead, one on the back of his head, and one at the right side of his head; three slight wounds on his right cheek, and a punctured wound over the point of his right shoulder, which would appear to be caused by a blunt instrument—I do not think a hammer would cause it—the injuries were consistent with the use of a stick such as this—he also had a con<lb/>tusion on his left shoulder—Mrs. Welch had a lacerated wound on the top of her head about 1 1/2 in. long, extending to the bone—that was not con<lb/>sistent with the use of a hammer, but it might have been caused by this stick; she had three other contusions on the top of her head, bumps raised by blows—they might have been caused by that stick, but with less violence than caused the laceration—her clothes were wet with water and blood—parts of the dress where the blood had not come were wet—I was not asked to examine the prisoners.</p>

The child seemed fairly well up to the morning it died. I am not at home during the day; I am either out at work or looking for work, and I don't know if my wife is in the habit of leaving it.
