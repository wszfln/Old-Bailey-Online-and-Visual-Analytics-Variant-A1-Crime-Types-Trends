             followed Coverdale in; Coverdale had a clock and a coat thrown over his arm, with a fur collar, a bundle with a table-cloth about it, a white hat, a black coat, and several other articles - Tebbutt had a clock, and a bottle with the neck of it broken, containing white wine; I tasted the wine - at the time this happened, I had two rooms at No. 8, New-street, Cloth-fair, two doors from Mr. Asher's - I had let one of those rooms to John Coverdale and another person - the street-door of the house I live in, stands on the latch, and is seldom bolted; my bed-room door can be opened by a person from outside; it has no lock to it - it would push open; the bolt is so slight - Tyrrell got up when they came in; he asked Coverdale what he had there - he swore at him, and told him to go about his business - I thought I had seen the clock before - I was a customer of Mr. Asher's; I made an observation about it - Coverdale said, "Hold your tongue, I will go away directly; I only want my basket" - and I said, "That clock has come from next door" - the prisoners were present; they at first said it had not, and that I was foolish; but I insisted on it, and said I should tell the people - Coverdale persuaded me that it was not, but I persisted in it, and Coverdale leant over on the bed and said he would murder me if I said any thing about it, but if I did not he would make me a present of a new gown - I had an old baker's basket belonging to Coverdale in the room - he asked for it, and put into it the things I have described, and one of the clocks, the fur-collared coat, the hat, and other things I have mentioned - I saw something which I found afterwards to be a dress - he took the baker's basket away on his back - Tebbutt was not so harsh as Coverdale, and told me to take a glass of wine out of the bottle; I said I was not fond of white wine, but he pressed it, and out of fear I took it - he left the room with one of the clocks and a sack thrown round it, which had been in Coverdale's baker's basket - Tyrrell came to bed when they left; I had not seen Tebbutt before - we got up at eight o'clock in the morning, and in about an hour Tebbutt came to the room again, and said, with an oath, that he had missed Jack, and asked me to have some gin; I refused, but he wished to have some, and I went to Asher's to get some; Mrs. Asher was crying, and it was said they had been robbed - I brought the gin to the lodging, I merely tasted it - I afterwards saw a Mrs. Childs; she knocked at my door, and asked if a person named Day lived there (Tebbutt heard this); I said, "Yes, my name is Day" - when my door is open you can see all over the room - she said to Tebbutt,"You are the person I want" - she took a little of the gin, and Tebbutt left the room - she said Jack wanted him at her house, for the property was there, and he was to come immediately - she thought he would have been there before - Tebbutt called again the same evening - I saw Coverdale on the Sunday, about one o'clock in the day; it was Whit-Sunday; he called with a little boy - that was on Whit-Sunday; (this happened the day before Whit-Sunday) - on the Monday I was with Tyrrell the greatest part of the day - we called at Mrs. Child's in Brewer-street in the afternoon, and saw her, and took tea there; she showed me a table-cloth and some tea in it, and I observed a paper with a quantity of tobacco in it, and a great coat, and the basket which Coverdale had at my place - after we had had tea, I saw Coverdale and Tebbutt there; while they were together, I said to Coverdale, "You have brought a fine disgrace on me by this business;" that I had always been looked on as honest, and was now looked upon quite different - he said it was all nonsense - I said Asher had offered me 10l. to discover who committed the robbery, and he had told me on Sunday, if the property was brought back, he would give 5l., and it might be sent back any way they pleased, and he would send the 5l.; then Coverdale and Tebbutt began to be very angry and abused me, and told me to mind myself - Tebbutt was more angry than before; Coverdale said the property fetched 2l., and that it could not be got again if 50l. was given for it - they wished to join 1s. each to have refreshment; I said, "I shall not stop," and they went to the adjoining room - I went down stairs; Tyrrell followed me a short time after - Coverdale never came to lodge with me after that - I have seen Coverdale three or four times since that, but never Tebbutt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now, on what night was this? A. It was not night, but on the Saturday morning before Whit-Sunday - I cannot tell the day of the month - I am quite certain it was the Saturday before Whit-Sunday; I was in bed that night, not with my husband - he is alive; he was not with me - John Tyrrell was with me; I am a married woman, and I was sleeping with Tyrrell - I believe him to be an honest man; he is now in Newgate on a charge of robbing his master - I had lived with him some length of time - on this night my husband was in another room in the same house - I was never under charge for any dishonesty, that I swear - I was never charged with any felony, never taken in custody by any officer on a charge of felony, nor any charge at all - I had lived with Tyrrell from the 17th of February last.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw all these different articles - you must have minutely inspected them? A. The bed was so close to the door, and it was day-light - part was in a bundle with a table-cloth; I did not open the table cloth - I speak to the loose things - I did not see the tea in my own room - I had seen the clocks a number of times before, and told them they had been stolen - I had not the least doubt they had been stolen, nor from whom they had been stolen - I was afraid to tell the prosecutor of the robbery when I went for the gin; I did not then tell him that I knew the party - I told the story I have told here to day, at Hatton Garden - I never told of it from the time I saw the clocks till the week before last - my fright had not gone off at all at that time - I always said, if ever Coverdale was in custody, I made a vow in my mind that I would tell of it, and I heard he was in custody, and told - I believe Tyrrell was taken in custody last Tuesday week - I believe Coverdale was taken before.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you not know that Tyrrell himself was the person who committed the robbery? A. I do not believe that he did commit the robbery - he could not for he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280006"/>in bed with me; and from the way he talked to the prisoner when he came to the door, he could not have been the guilty man - I did not sleep sounder that night than usual - I cannot say how long I had slept - I went to bed very early in the evening - I cannot tell what time, whether it was four, six, eight, or ten o'clock; I went to bed first - I cannot say how long after I went to bed Tyrrell came, but he was in bed before eleven o'clock that night - I was not exactly sober when I went to bed - I was sober when I awoke, quite so - I awoke and found myself sober, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I hear the church clock go every quarter of an hour, when I am in bed - I heard the clock strike twelve; I counted it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for counting it? A. I asked him what o'clock it was, and he said twelve, and I heard the watchman go twelve, and I could count it - I went to bed very stupid and wished to know the time, and it was before I heard it strike that I asked the time - I heard the clock strike the quarters and I inquired the time - when the quarters went, I said, "What time is it?" and he told me - I went to sleep again - Tyrrell did not leave the bed that night and return early in the morning - I did not awake again till the prisoners came to the door, which was between four and five o'clock - it was daylight, and the Close-gates open at five o'clock - I am certain that Tyrrell did not commit the robbery, on my oath - I drank a little of the gin I got from the prosecutor's; there was such a small quantity - I had never seen Mrs. Childs before; she was an acquaintance of Coverdales's - she made the statement I have told you; - I was offered 10l. to tell of the robbery - the reason I did not tell of it next morning was, because I had been threatened; my reason for telling was, I always said if ever Coverdale was in custody, I would tell of it, and so I did - Coverdale is the only man who threatened me - Tebbutt threatened to knock me down and called me bad names; but Coverdale threatened me more; he threatened my life - I never told the story till Coverdale was locked up - I never heard of any warrant being out against Tyrrell before Coverdale was apprehended - the charge against Tyrrell was for robbing his master; that was the only charge against Tyrrell that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get your living while you lived with Tyrrell? A. I am a book-folder and sewer, and got my living by that, I worked with my father, John Horns Baker, a book-binder, 21, Gee-street, Goswell-road; and another gentleman, Mr. Hodson, of Cloth-fair, a bookseller; my father is a binder - when he is not busy, I go out to work - I never had occasion to walk the streets; I do not; I never did in my life; I swear that - I earned sometimes 10s. a week, sometimes 18s. and sometimes 20s. according to the work - I have two rooms of my own which I paid rent for; those were the rooms I was in with Tyrrell - my husband was sleeping with Coverdale at that time - Tyrrell was not placed at the dock at Hatton Garden to my knowledge on this charge; I do not know whether he was or not; I saw him at Hatton Garden alongside the prisoners; I suppose he was placed there on the robbery of his master; on my oath, I do not know that he was placed in the dock on this charge - I was there; I was ordered to be there by a policeman; I was examined as a witness - Tyrrell was in the dock with the prisoners when I was examined on this charge; he was discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he discharged at that time? A. He was discharged on this, and committed on the other - the magistrate said he was not committed as prisoner at present.</p>

            , and live at No. 14, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell; the prisoner Coverdale, came to my house to lodge on the Saturday before Whit-Sunday - he came to my house from Tyrrell's, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; he lived at Tyrrell's, at that time - he came a little before seven o'clock; he brought a baker's basket with him; I had no reason to know what was in it till I went to Tyrrell's; I did not know what was in it, till Mrs. Tyrrell, who is called Mrs. Day, let me into the robbery; she let me into the fact, that the house had been robbed; she (Mrs. Tyrrell,) produced a tinder box which stood empty in the garden; she used very foul language - I did not oversee the contents of the basket Coverdale brought home - I saw part of the things, but what I saw I cannot state; I saw the table-cloth and some tea in it, some tabacco in a paper, part of a bottle of rum, and one table-cloth; a great coat, with a fur collar, and a buff gown; I went to Tyrrell's lodging that some morning after breakfast, for Coverdale, to tell Tyrrell, (not Coverdale) to come; I found Tebbutt, and Mr. and Mrs. Tyrrell very tipsy - I did not give any message to Tebbutt, further than that Coverdale wanted him; I told Tyrrell, Coverdale wanted him, and Tebbutt went out with him; they both heard what I said; when I got home, the things were taken away - the clock and gown were left, and about half-a-pound of tea - the clock was removed on Monday - I cannot say by whom; the gown was given to me; I pledged it at Walker's, in Goswell-street - I considered it my own; the gown was given to me before I went to Tyrrell's, and heard of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect the day of the month you went to Mrs. Day's in the morning? A. It was the day before Whit-Sunday; she was very much in liquor, I could see that - she made use of some foul language - she did not appear at all alarmed when she gave a description of the robbery; when I came to the lodging, I came to enquire on the part of Coverdale, for Tyrrell; (not Tebbutt) I did not say I wanted Tebbutt, nor that Jack wanted him; I was sent for Tyrrell, to say John was waiting in the road, and wanted him - I did not say the property was at my place; I went from Coverdale, to Tyrrell, for him to come into the road to speak to Coverdale, who was waiting; I did not mention where the property was; I returned to my house - I am quite sure I did not carry the message for Tebbutt, to come to my house, nor that the property was at my house; Mrs. Day told me first of the robbery having been committed.</p>

             (policeman G 5). I lodge at No. 55, Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell. I apprehended Tebbutt on the 23rd of November, at No. 13, Paul-street, Finsbury - I afterwards returned to that house, and brought away some stair carpet - I had seen it there when I took him into custody - I afterwards received this clock from Mrs. Denham - Coverdale was taken into custody on the 15th of November in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell - the prosecutor said it was his - I found Tebbutt in the house; he came down stairs; he told me he lived there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Tebbutt lend you every assistance to examine the premises? A. His wife did after I took him - there was no difficulty thrown in my way - she opened every door, box, and drawer, about the house - the carpet appeared to be quite worn - it had been on the stairs a long time, and was very much stained - it was nailed down on the stairs - it is quite a common pattern - it exactly fitted the stairs - I should think from the manner in which it was laid down it was done by a person who understood the business; it was properly laid down; there was not the least hesitation made to my taking it away.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did you buy the carpet? A. Of a young man man who visited my house; he is a general dealer; I don't know whether he had any more of it; he might have more of it; he was in a general line of business, there are others of the same pattern no doubt; whether he sold any more to any body else; I cannot tell; I lost two clocks.</p>

In May and June I was confined by illness; I was totally confined to my bed during those two months - Tebbutt worked for me nearly the whole of those two months as journeyman - I called on him for assistance the first week in May, and he continued to work for me till I got better, which was nearly till the latter end of June - I had no other journeyman; it was necessary for him to be up early in the morning but not late at night; he slept in my house to be ready in the morning; it is usual to commence business about four o'clock in the morning; his wife was also attending me during those months; he slept in the adjoining room to me with my children; one of my children is named Martha; she is twelve years old; the other is Willliam, he is eight years old; it was the habit of his wife to set up with me during the night she laid down occasionally in her clothes, with that exception she attended me night and day; I used generally at four o'clock in the morning to make him hear by knocking at the pannel, provided his wife was asleep, and I did not like to disturb her; the business could not have gone on unless he had been there at that time in the morning; it would be entirely lost; my business was not at all interrupted by his absence till I was able to attend to it myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make the bread afterwards? A. It is not exactly bread making; it is in the small way - I bake every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Whit-Sunday? A. Yes; the prisoner slept at my house on the Saturday night before Whit-Sunday; he is hardly ever later home than half-past ten o'clock; generally between half-past nine and ten o'clock - I cannot say whether he was home by ten o'clock on that Saturday night - I think it was after eleven o'clock when he came in - my premises are a mile and a half from Cloth Fair I should consider - I live near Sadler's Wells - he dined with me on Whit-Sunday - I saw him on Sunday at breakfast and dinner; he went out in the afternoon; I remember the Friday before he came home between ten and eleven o'clock on Friday night - he had no room to sit in except the bed-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280008"/>room next to me; I could hear him go to bed; he went to bed on that Friday night a little after eleven o'clock - he had a little bit of supper, and went to bed directly - his wife sat up with me that night; I was very bad that night - I always bake double on Saturday - his wife called him herself that morning, between three and four o'clock; I myself saw him on Friday night; he generally came in to bid me good night, before he went to bed - my business was carried on as usual, and my customers supplied on that Saturday; that could not have been done unless he had attended to the business or found somebody to do it for him - I must have known if he employed anybody to do it for him; I could hear him at work as I laid in bed that morning; I slept in a parlour on one side the shop in which he worked; I had a temporary bedstead put up at the back part of the shop, with a screen for him; he slept in part of the shop; the shop and bedstead, are altogether; there is a screen - he slept in the same bed as the children; the girl of twelve years of age sleeps on one side, and the boy in the middle, he having known them from their infancy; he is a well conducted man; I never heard any harm of him; I employed him several times in my business - he had a home in Paul-street, Finsbury - but my work is very particular early in the morning, and I was fearful of his not coming; I could not employ a journeyman who lived so far off.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you recollect so many months ago, the hour a man got up? A. My illness made me awake so much; he got up at that time almost every morning; but on Saturday's perhaps half an hour earlier; he came to me the first week in May; I bake muffins; he generally got up between three and four o'clock - I first heard of this offence one day last week; there were lodgers up stairs in the house; none of them are here - I sent for him to No. 13, Paul-street; his wife laid down alongside of me, and the man slept in the bed with the two children; it is a turn-up bedstead with a sort of half-tester; it was only put up temporary; if I had been well the children would have slept with me - the door is open all day; if the lodgers wanted to go out past my hours they take the key of the street-door - I must have heard the door opened if the prisoner had taken the key - my lodgers are all working people and seldom out late; I am certain the prisoner was in my premises between three and four o'clock in the morning of the Saturday before Whit-Sunday, and he had come there at eleven o'clock the night before - I have a recollection of the fact on that particular day; I have not heard it sworn he was elsewhere - he remained at work from between three and four o'clock to a little before dinner, making muffins all that time - we serve several hotels and send them early in the morning; they will have them new; he had his breakfast at his work; he was generally done at dinner, and sit down to dinner - I have lived in the house five years, carrying on the same business - he was never one morning absent from the beginning of May to the end of June - the work was always done; a day never passed without my seeing his face - he came into my bed-room; his wife and the family dined in the room I slept in - I have only two rooms - the muffins were made in the room the prisoner slept in.</p>

            . I know the prisoner Tebbutt and his wife (looking at the carpet) I saw the prisoner purchase some carpet like this, as near as I can recollect, about five months ago, or it may be six months; it was some time in June, I think about the middle - he bought it in Rosemary-lane, of a man; I did not know the man- I had been to Rosemary-lane to buy the bonnet I have now on my head - I was coming back; and on Tower-hill I met the prisoner, and returned with him to Rosemary-lane - he bought two bits of carpet - he gave the man 6s. for the piece which I believe to be this, and 10d. for another piece, which his wife has now got in her possession - I saw the carpet down at his place in Paul-street once; it seemed to me to be the same piece of carpet - I am no relation of his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time of the day were you in Rosemary-lane with the prisoner? A. I think about twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one o'clock - I recollect it was on a Wednesday - I don't know Mrs. Bartlett - the prisoner was at work at that time, but I don't know where- I had been to purchase the bonnet and met him; I have known him for years; I had walked very little way with him - the carpet was not bought in a shop, but in the street, of a man who had several pieces on his arm; the prisoner stopped the man - he had told me he was going to buy a carpet - the man was walking along the street, not offering it for sale; it is a place where they sell goods of this sort - I cannot say what time in June this was, but it was on a Wednesday in the beginning of June- I did not go home with him; we parted on Tower-hill, he had got a coat on then - he did not appear clean for the day, he was tidy; he looked clean - he had not a baker's dress on - I think the other piece was a yard and a quarter; the large bit was nearly nine yards; it was not new but very old, the worse for wear - it had been down, for there was the mark of nails in it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it common for persons to sell goods under their arms in Rosemary-lane? A. Yes; it was in June; I am well aware, because there is a fair held where I came from in Northamptonshire, and I went down there on the 24th, and it was a few days before that.</p>

            , JUN. I am twelve years old on the 11th of November. I am the daughter of the witness; my mother lives in Lloyd's-row, St. John-street - she was ill in June last; she was taken ill before Whitsunday a long while - she recovered after June - I know the prisoner Tebbutt and his wife - his wife nursed my mother - Tebbutt carried on my mother's business when she was ill - he slept in her house along with my brother and me - Mrs. Tebbutt slept and laid down along with my mother when she did lie down; the house is let out a good deal in lodgings - my mother slept in the next room to us, and Mr. Tebbutt, me, and my brother, slept in the same room as we carried on the business - we used to sleep with mother before she was taken ill - we had a little tester bedstead - the shop joined my mother's bed-room - the bedstead was put up in the shop; one part of the shop is divided, where I, and my brother, and Mr. Tebbutt slept - Tebbutt first came in May, and continued there till about the middle of June - I remember Whitsunday; I remember it, because before mother was taken ill she promised to take me out, and as she was taken ill she could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280009"/>not - I was promised to be taken to Greenwich Fair with my brother, as she was ill we could not go - it was our custom to bake every day; we baked more on Saturday's - I remember the Saturday before Whit-Sunday; we baked on that Saturday, according to custom, more than on other days - my mother had no other assistance but the prisoner to carry on business - he got up between three and four o'clock that Saturday morning; I recollect that circumstance - it generally takes from the time he gets up in the morning till about two o'clock in the afternoon to make the muffins - on Saturday's he got up earlier; he breakfasted at home on that Saturday - it was his habit to breakfast in the shop; he used to breakfast generally and bake too, because he could not leave the business - he dined with my mother on the Sunday and his wife also; that was rather before the business was over - Mr. Tebbutt did not sit down to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. I am not speaking of the Sunday, but Saturday morning? A. Yes; he dined on that day just before the work was done - we bake on Sunday's.</p>

            , JUN. Not on Whit-Sunday we did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What number of lodgers have you at home? A. There is five rooms - the lodgers had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner come from time to time - they generally came in about ten o'clock at night - sometimes they might be out till half-past - there is only one key to the street door - sometimes my mother kept that, and if the lodgers wished to be out she lent it to them - I do not recollect that any lodger had the key between the beginning of May and middle of June - they do not come in at all hours - while mother was ill they generally came in because they would not disturb her - the prisoner had worked for my mother a very little before she was taken ill, (about a month) - we bake every day - he did not leave when he had done work, till between three and four o'clock, because he used to send us round with the muffins to the customers, and used to be home again about five o'clock to tea - I do not know where Rosemary-lane is.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. CHILDS. Q. You were sent to New-street, to fetch, a certain party; who was you sent for? A. Tyrrell, not Tebbutt - I was sent between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - when I went the prisoner Tebbutt was there - it was at eleven o'clock on the Saturday morning - I am positive I saw him there, and they went out together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you state to the question more than once put to you, that when you went to Tyrrell's house for Tebbutt, that Tyrrell and Tebbutt both came out together with you? A. Yes; I sent them to Coverdale - I did not say it was seven o'clock when I went: I said, it was seven o'clock when the things came to my house - it was after breakfast - I was at Mrs. Day's about ten o'clock in the morning - I did not see Tebbutt afterwards with Coverdale - I staid at Mrs. Day's house to hear of the robbery from her - Tyrrell and Tebbutt went out together - I afterwards saw Tebbutt with Coverdale - he drank tea with me and Mrs. Day, and Coverdale, on the Saturday - I heard Mrs. Day make a complaint to the men about only giving Tyrrell 8s. of the money - I heard Mrs. Day in their presence say, she had an offer of money to disclose the robbery - that was in Tebbutt's presence - Tebbutt told her she might do as she pleased, and she said, if it had not been that John was one among them, the Lord help them - Tebbutt flew off rather in a pet, and said he did not wish to have quarrelling - I do not recollect hearing Coverdale saying anything to her in Tebbutt's presence about what Asher had offered respecting the robbery.</p>

Yes, he has been with me a long time, off and on for above three years; a brother of his was my foreman; his name is Tyrrell; he is a very valuable servant; I would not have employed Tyrrell unless I had a good opinion of him, and I entertain the same opinion of him now; his brother is still in my service, and I believed the prisoner to have deserved my confidence up to the time this occurred - I had no reason to suspect him at all myself; he had opportunities of plundering me to a great extent, if so disposed; I always found him conduct himself well.</p>

            . I occupy a house No 14, Brewer-street, Clerkenwell. I have been there two years nearly; I know Coverdale; he was allowed to sleep in the same house as I had known him a long time, and he could not pay for a lodging - Foster also slept in the house for about two months, as near as I can say - Coverdale occupied the front-room first-floor when he was there, and Foster the back top-room - I was only put in to take care of the house - On Tuesday, the 12th of November, I came home to dinner between twelve and one o'clock in the afternoon - I found on the table a table-cloth and some other things underneath it, but what they were I cannot say - Coverdale was there, and he said it was a few things he had brought from his sister's, and asked my permission, that they should remain there, and I agreed - on the following Friday, the 15th, I found a policeman at my house, and I was taken into custody - I had not observed what was contained in the table-cloth between the 12th and 15th - I had not been into Foster's room - I had seen Tyrrell at the house two or three times, but not at the present time; he used to come to see Coverdale or Foster; he was acquainted with both of them - on the 15th of November I was put into the New Prison, and found Foster and Coverdale there; directly I went in they spoke to me, and two or three days afterwards, or the next day, I asked Foster and Coverdale how they came to bring me into such a mess as that - they said, they never should have thought of doing anything of the kind, if it had not been for Tyrrell - they said they should not have known anything about it, if it had not been for Tyrrell - they both said he told them there was a gold watch, and several other things there; both of them spoke - they both sanctioned it; Coverdale, I believe, told me, but both told me - Coverdale said, they never should have thought of going to the place at all if it had not been for Tyrrell; and that he said, there was a gold watch and a great deal of property there; and Coverdale said he left the window open on purpose for them to go in, but the boy shut the window, and did not fasten it, and by that means they got in - they both said, they got in through the window, and they said all the money they had was 4l. 17s.; that it was reported they had a great deal - they did not tell me what were the other things they got - I was kept in prison till the Wednesday morning; I told what I had heard, and was let out as a witness - I do not know that all the stolen things were in my house; I did not see more than I have told - I had no share in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You do not know what stolen goods are, I suppose? A. No; I do not - I was never in custody before - I was trusted to take care of the house; I had permission from the gentleman it belonged to to let one person in, and the other was only there at different times, when he had no money to pay for his lodging - I am a labouring man; bricklaying was the last job I did; I did that the very day I was taken, for Mr. Cockerton, who keeps the oil-shop at the corner of Islington church-yard; I was plaistering up a ceiling - I had a job for Mr. Thompson, up at Paddington - he belongs to the playhouse in Little Church-street, Portman Market - I should have gone to Cockerton's that night, if I had not been stopped, and have not been out of work for some months, except for a day or so - at Paddington I begun work at six o'clock, and was done at eleven - I do not work for any body else, but on my own account - I worked for Mr. Edhall, Bunhill-row, in digging foundations, and pulling down old buildings - I was bred up a labouring man - I was a witness here a night or two ago, against another man; some goods in that case got into my house, which turned out to be stolen; I knew nothing about them; I never asked them where they got them - I had no lodger at all but the two persons I speak off, besides my own family - they used to say they were bakers, and used<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280011"/>to job where they could - I did not make it my business to inquire where the things came from; if I had thought they came from anywhere wrong I should have inquired; he said he brought them from his sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? A. None at all - nothing; you mean, did they give me any money; you did not ask me the question, but you might as well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What was your reason for permitting those two men to lodge there? A. I had known Coverdale for ten or twelve years, and Foster being a friend of his, it was in consequence of the extreme poverty of Coverdale, that I allowed him to lodge at the house; and Foster being his friend; I saw but very little of the property; I slept at No. 14, Brewer-street, on the 12th of November; it was twelve o'clock when I got home from Paddington; I swear I slept at this house the night the robbery was committed - I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock; it was not a little later; I suppose the prosecutor's house is about two miles from my house; on my oath, I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock on the 12th of November; Mrs. Childs slept with me that night; she is my wife - she was examined here last Monday on another robbery - I slept that night with her at No. 14, Brewer-street, and for a fortnight before; a little boy slept in that bed too.</p>

               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, I ask you whether, on the 12th of November, you did not sleep from your home, and if Coverdale did not sleep with your wife? A. I am sure he did not; that I will swear - not on that night, or any other night after twelve o'clock - I know nothing about what was done when I was not at home - I have not come here to give evidence to save myself - I was not told to split for the purpose of saving my wife and family - I was not told by anybody to make the statement I have here to night, for the purpose of saving my wife and children - my wife and children have nothing to do with it - Campbell the police-officer came to the prison while I was in there, and asked, if I knew any thing about it, and I told him I did not, and that is true; I did not know it then; I knew that they had brought things to my house, but I did not know how many, nor questioned them to know what they brought them for; Campbell told me nothing about them; he asked, if I knew anything about them, and I told him no; I had seen the table-cloth and two or three other things; I now know they were part of the things stated by Campbell, to be part of what was stolen from the prosecutor's; but I did not know it then; without a doubt Campbell was inquiring about the very things found at my house - I knew nothing of the robbery then; they had got the things away - I told him I knew nothing about it, further than what he saw; and that was true - I did not know at that time that there were things of that description at my house; I knew the table-cloth was there - I had not seen the glass there; the table-cloth was the largest thing I saw in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of a conversation between Coverdale and Foster; on your solemn oath, during that entire conversation, was a word said by Foster in that conversation? A. There was; he stated it as well as Coverdale; not only once, but more than once; Foster said that Tyrrell left open the window for them to go in; both told me so at different times, and one said, "Yes, did not he;" one told me the story, and the one who was telling me, said, "Did not he so;""Was not it so;" and the other said, "Yes;" both told me the story at different times; I worked for Mr. Cockerton, No. 1, Rufford's-row, High-street, Islington, last; and for Mr. Redhall before; and Mr. Field; I could tell you for the last sixteen years who I did work for; I said, I worked for Mr. Thompson, at Paddington - I worked for Mr. Field, as much as a month ago, I dare say; last Monday was the first time I was ever in court in my life; in this court or any other - I was never at the police-office on any charge, except the one you are speaking of - I was never in charge about a Jew's house that was robbed; my wife was not in custody for that; I was never taken on any charge before this one, and never in my life at a police-office; I got no share at all; that I will swear - my wife got nothing that I know of; she never told me what Coverdale gave her; not on this case; she had a gown that was here the other night - I saw her wear the gown - I knew it was stolen after she had worn it.</p>

            . I am street-keeper, and live at No. 6, Clarendon-street, Camden-town; on the morning of the 15th of November, I was on the watch and saw Foster and Coverdale in the neighbourhood of Brewer-street; Deyken, I, and Price followed them about a mile - when they came nearly half-a-mile, they got to high words, as if they had fallen out, and were in the act of parting, when I took Foster in custody - Deyken took Coverdale - we took them to the station house, in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell - I then had the assistance of a policeman - I searched Foster, found on him one sovereign, half-a-sovereign, one good half-crown, and one bad one, and five duplicates, and a knife and a small brass padlock - Mr. Keyzer claims the padlock - I asked Foster his name, he said Foster, and that he was lodging with his brother at Bermondsey - we then immediately went off with Baylis the policeman to No. 14, Brewer-street - I searched Foster's room there; the top back room, and found in it these articles which I produce - I did not go into any other room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What is your name A.

            . I am a constable and live at No. 22, Grenville-street, Somers-town - I apprehended Coverdale, and found on him a pair of scizzors, 6s. in money, 2 half-crowns, and a shilling, and a gardener's knife - I afterwards went to No. 14, Brewer-street - Baylis was in my company; when we went to the house I suspected the property might be in we asked; if Smith lived there, and were told he was just gone out - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280012"/>found a quantity of things in the first floor front room; Baylis took them away.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You did not search Foster? A. No.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BAYLIS. I am a policeman G. 5. I live at No. 56, Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell. I produce a quantity of articles, which I found in the two first-floor, front rooms; I cannot say which room I found each article in; they both belonged to Child's; I found four plated table-spoons, four plated tea-spoons, two table-cloths, a scarlet apron, canister, a bladder of lard, a cream strainer, five knives and three forks - I found them in the first floor front rooms; three handkerchiefs, a black veil, work box, roasting jack, four wine glasses, a violin case, two bows, five packets of nails, four plated table-spoons, and one plated tea-spoon; I found some articles in both the front rooms first floor, and the remaining articles, beginning with the roasting jack, in the upper room; I found some keys in the upper room; a key which I found in the upper room fitted the prosecutor's yard gate - here is the lock; I found another key which fitted the lock of the workshop door - both the keys were found in the upper room, with the roasting jack and other things.</p>
               <p>MARY CHILDS. I am the wife of the witness Childs. I saw the prisoner Tyrrell at my house on a Monday - I cannot say the day of the month - I think it was on the Monday before I was examined at the police-office - it was on the Monday night before Mr. Keyzer's robbery - he came to Coverdale and Foster, who were at home - he saw them and was there about half-an-hour; he had been to visit them before, often at different times - I think he went away alone - I saw Coverdale the following morning - he did not sleep at home that night - I received some things from Coverdale next day - I did not see them opened - there was a few handkerchiefs, and I think an apron, a bladder of lard, and a tin canister; the lard was in a tin screen; there was two table-cloths, and knives and forks - I think five, and four plated table-spoons, and I think the same quantity of tea-spoons - he merely gave them to me or put them on the table, and desired me to take care of them for a day or two - I put the spoons and forks in my bed room, in a drawer by themselves - my bed room is the adjoining room to where Coverdale slept - he had one front room, and I occupied one front room and a back room - those articles were afterwards found on the premises - I had received them from Coverdale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I think I examined you a few nights ago? A. Yes, and I told you then I did not examine that bundle; I never saw the contents - the property in the other case came in a basket - I could not be off seeing these table-spoons, and tea-spoons because I put them in my drawer; I did not see the bundle open, but the things were afterwards given to me; I cannot say whether this was the night of the 12th of November; I think it was on a Tuesday, my husband slept at home; on the night before the 12th of November - he slept at home, for months; he went to bed between twelve and one o'clock that night; he walks from here to Paddington to earn a shilling, and returns home every night before twelve o'clock; he slept at home that night and got up in the morning between five and six o'clock to the best of my knowledge - I slept in the same room; I always do; Coverdale's room is the next room to mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear he was not out on the night of the 12th of November? A. I won't swear to the day of the month; yes, I could do so; he never slept from home one night, nor was he out till between two and three o'clock in the morning; not for some months, he was never out later than twelve o'clock; the articles were brought to our house between six and seven o'clock in the morning I think; that was not before my husband had left for his work; he leaves a little before six o'clock; the things were brought I think about seven o'clock; I did not shew him the things that had been brought; I saw but very few of them, or I might have had suspicion; I am not to ask my lodgers, how they come by things.</p>

I drove a cabriolet, No. 1331, at that time; I was applied to on the morning of the 12th of November, in Tottenham-court-road, by Coverdale, about a quarter after five o'clock; he came up and asked me to go and take up in the New-road; I stopped first in Tottenham-court-road to take something to drink with him; he told me to turn to the left, I pulled up at the Adam and Eve, down a turning, he asked me to wait there; I remained there nearly ten minutes, when he came back, got in, and told me to go to the New-road, and at the corner of Southampton-street; he told me to stop; three men came with a parcel of things, and put them into the cab; a tall person got in and told me to drive to the Angel at Islington; I was going to pull up there, he said, "Go to the right;" I was going down St. John-street; he said, "No, to the right there," I drove down Goswell-street-road, and came up to Coverdale and another, who asked where I had been - (but before that my traces had broken off, and another cab passed mine;) while I was stopping in Goswell-street, Coverdale said, "Where have you been," I said, "My trace broke, and I stopped to mend it; he said, "Well come on here;" I went on to the corner of Rawstorne-street, he told me to turn round, and I drove to Brewer-street, and Coverdale, and him, and another man took the things out of the cab, and took them into the house; I know the prosecutor's house; I received the things at the corner of Southampton-street, fifteen or twenty yards from the prosecutor's house; I there saw Coverdale and two others; I don't know either of the others; I did not see the other men's faccs; I have never sworn that I did know the persons of the others except Coverdale - this deposition is my hand-writing; it was read over to me before I signed it, but I am rather hard of hearing, sometimes I don't hear - when I got to Tottenham-court-road I saw Coverdale there alone; as we came along, two persons were there Coverdale and another; and they said, "Don't go so fast;" I don't know who the other was; I swear I did not know which of them it was; I have no recollection except of Coverdale; I don't recollect seeing the other prisoners, except at Hatton-garden; I know there were three men followed the cab to Brewer-street; I am not positive there was not four - the first thing they took out of the cab looked like a frame,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280013"/>like a looking-glass; it was outside the flap, on the knee boot, and there was a fiddle-case, and two or three things like a sack; this was about five o'clock in the morning, nearer six o'clock; it was dark.</p>

             (policeman E 14). I live at No. 9, Frances-street, Tottenham-court-road. I apprehended Tyrrell at the premises of Mr. Keyzer in the New-road; I afterwards went to No. 12, Pear-tree-street, Clerkenwell, and got there a quantity of perforated zinc, solder cassia, colouring, and rosin; they are the subject of another indictment - I asked Tyrrell if he knew Childs, he said, he did; I asked if he knew a man named Foster, he said, he did not - he denied all knowledge of a person named Coverdale - I asked him when he had been at Child's, he said, he had not seen any of that party for some months.</p>

I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was searched; I took the watch from him myself, and produce it; it has a chain, three seals, a key, and guard - I know the house in Brown Bear-alley - I took him in custody that night; I saw him come out of that house about four o'clock in the morning, and took him - I found a coat in the house, and the ear-drops, ring, and tobacco-box, in the pocket; the tobacco-box was given up to him by order of the Magistrate - I found these two chisels on the dresser - I went to the Maid and Magpie about seven o'clock that morning, and applied the chisels to the box; here is part of the beading of the box here; this chisel corresponds with it - I have applied it to the marks and they corresponded - I believe them to have been made with this chisel - there are several marks, and they are all about the size - I did not ask him for 5l.; I said, "Harry, what have you done" - he said,"I don't know, let me go and I will give you enough to live on for two years" - I said, "I am on duty, and should do my duty."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. Your house is in the parish of St. Pancras. A. Yes; I know that by paying rates; the parochial rates are headed with the name of the parish, and the notices too - I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I left nobody up; the two servants followed me up the stairs - they are not both my servants; there are three servants in the house; my maid was gone to bed - Mrs. Weston's two servants followed me up-stairs - I did not go into my servant's bed-room; but I know every body was gone up-stairs - I have no means of knowing it except that the house was quiet; I did not go into the rooms of any of the servants to see that they were there - the door at which the entry was made had been locked for three weeks preceding, and the key hung up in the back parlour - I had not tried that door, to see if it was locked, for perhaps three weeks - I had not gone to the door that evening, to see if it was locked - the key hung up in the back parlour; six members of my family had access to that key - every person in the house had not access to it; my servant had access to it, not the others - my parlour door was not always locked - the servant as well as I might have got to that key - that door was the only part of the house that was opened; the other part was safe - I said the back door was a-jar; it appeared to have been opened by skeleton keys; that was the officers opinion; in my own opinion it must have been a key; I do not know what sort of a key - it was certainly not opened by a common key - when I said it had been opened by a skeleton key, I spoke from my own observations, as well as from others, it being more probable than any other kind of key to open a locked door; the common key belonging to the door was again in the parlour in the morning - I saw no marks of violence; I did not examine the door particularly - I have a lodger in my house of the name of Weston; she is a widow - neither of my servants are married women - a pack of cards were taken from Bennett, and I instantly recognized them to be mine - I said to him immediately, "I am glad to see these, as I know we are on the right scent" - I searched Bennett's lodgings with the officer; they are at Grote's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280016"/>house, in St. Giles's - I cannot say he has no other place of residence - I do not know whether he had any boxes anywhere else.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of November, the servant called me, and I missed a silver tea-pot and stand, a cream jug, eight spoons, and some silver forks; the value of the plate I lost was about 20l. somebody told me so; it is above 10l., and I believe above 20l. - the servant said she missed some towels which were under her care, and some knives and forks, table-cloths and sheets - I missed nine yards of brown holland, one volume of Cowper's Poems, a metal spoon; some of the things were kept in the kitchen - the plate ought not to have been there, but it was left there; I lost an ironing-blanket - I have seen the books, table-cloths, holland, some knives, one towel, and the metal spoon - I do not recollect seeing the forks since - I can speak to three table-cloths, and the Poems, and the knives, and the brown holland.</p>

            10). I lodge at No. 19, Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury; on the 16th of November, I was at Grote's lodging-house, at the corner of Lawrence-lane, St Giles'. about half-past two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and apprehended Bennett and Dickinson - I found two stockings on the shelf which Dickinson said was her own, and one pack of cards, and four keys on Bennett's person, and three sovereigns and 16s. 1 1/2d. on his person; I asked Dickinson who the stockings belonged to, she said, they are mine, I said, "then you must go with me" - she did not at that time say where she got them - I took the cards from Bennett and four keys, three sovereigns and 16s. 1 1/2d. - Dickinson had nothing in her possession, but claimed the stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a common pack of cards? A. Yes; they were not tied up; they were loose - this memorandum was not in the midst of them - I put it there because I should not lose it - it is a memorandum that was on Bennett's person - a new pack of cards would not be broken - they are common cards - these are the keys; Bennett said they belonged to his boxes - I asked him where his boxes were, he said, at his lodging - I have seen keys of that kind again and again - there is nothing particular about any of them - they are very plain keys.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Here are two memorandums, did both come from Bennett? A. Yes; both came from his person.</p>

             (police-constable S. 206). I lodge at No. 10, Gloster-terrace; Regents-park. I apprehended Dybell and Baker at another of Grote's lodging-houses, at the corner of Church-street, St. Giles' - Grote has several lodging-houses - it was not far from the other - just round the corner - I apprehended them about a quarter before eight o'clock, on Saturday evening the 16th of November - they were both in one room - I found on Baker a pair of stockings which have since been claimed by Mr. Brimmer - I found in the room where the prisoner's were, two brushes and a quantity of stockings; they were in different parts of the same room, also, two keys hid among some coals in the corner of the room - this key opens the back room door on Mr. Brimmer's parlour floor; I found three knives in the same room, a pair of scizzors, a metal spoon, two cloths which are claimed by Mrs. Weston, a pack of cards which are not claimed - in the back room on the same floor which was occupied by Dybell; Baker told me it was Dybell's room, and Dybell said it was his room as well - they were both present - Baker said, "the room where I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280017"/>this property was his room, and that the next room was Dybell's; Dybell said nothing at that moment, but afterwards he said, "Yes; I live there" - I found in that room this cloth several pairs of stockings, and this knife and fork - Baker said the room I apprehended him in was his room - Dybell had this pair of stockings on - I found five keys there one of which will open Mr. Brimmer's front street door - this latch key found in Dybell's room was claimed, and the knife and fork and some of the stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These things were found at Grote's house? A. Yes; he has several lodging-houses in the neighbourhood - Bennett did not lodge at this house at all.</p>
               <p>Dybell. I asked him what he wanted me for, he said, for house-breaking, I said, "I knew nothing about it."</p>

            . That is true; I did not ask them in the house where they lived - I asked them coming along - Baker, before I brought him out of the house owned to it being his room - he said he lived there; he said so before I left the room - Dybell said nothing before he left; it was going along to the station-house - I said to them, "I suppose you both live there together," and both of them said, "Yes."</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Brighton-street, St. Pancras. On Friday, the 15th of November, I was at the Tottenham-street theatre, and sat next but one to Dybell and Baker, in the gallery; I heard Dybell say to a person who sat next to him, "We had a rare pull last night;" the other person said to him, "What was it; Dybell said, "a silver tea-pot and stand;" they said "What else," and he mentioned several other things, I did not understand what; but among other things, he said, a boy's great coat; the boy they were talking to asked them where it was; they said, "In Mornington-place," Baker sat next to Dybell and could hear what he said; they were both joining in the conversation - in consequence of hearing that, I went the next morning and gave information to Mr. Brimmer.</p>

               <p>Dybell. Q. Did you hear me say so or was it Bennett? A. I heard you say so; you were talking to another boy.</p>
               <p>Dybell. My Lord, he is a noted pickpocket about Tottenham-court-road; he brought Baker a pair of boots to sell for him once, which he had stolen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you ever apprehended on a charge of stealing? A. No, my Lord; I have never been in the House of Correction - I was never charged with any theft - I was never charged with picking a pocket - I am a ladies' shoemaker, and work for Mr. Smith, of Perry-terrace.</p>
               <p>JOHN JEALLOUS BRIMMER. Parsons called on me and gave me information, and I sent for the police, and communicated to them what I heard from Parsons - the prisoners were apprehended in the course of that day, but I had other information besides from Parsons about Bennett; I know this pack of cards from old acquaintance; I have had them twenty years; I suppose my children had them to play with, and I have the remainder of the pack in my hands, they complete the pack; they have been used by my children for fortune-telling, and the remaining cards were kept away from them, and those I have here; the stockings found on the mantel-piece, I identify by their being odd, and I have the fellows; seven of the keys are mine, the four small keys found on Bennett, the latch key found in Dybell's room; this key is my parlour-door key; it was found in Baker's room; the stockings found on the feet of Dybell and Baker I claim (looking at those found on Dybell); I know them and have my daughter here who mended them; one of those found on Baker is mine, and my daughter can identify it - the other I believe to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not the two odd stockings claimed by Dickinson? A. Yes, those found on the mantel-piece; I have seen these cards in my house twenty years; I have not played with them for perhaps twenty years; my children have played with them - I cannot speak positively to twenty years; I should say I have had them from ten to twenty years; I cannot undertake to say I have played with them myself; I dare say I have never played with them, they are children's cards; I never played a round game which requires the whole pack; I don't say they are a full pack, because I have never counted them; there are fifty-two in a full pack; here are forty-one; it is not a full pack; I have printed too many cards not to know how many there are in a pack; I must be in error when I said there was a full pack; I had not counted them; I never meant to say the smaller quantity completed the pack; I will not say I did not say so.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the prosecutor - I have looked over the cards; I have been in the habit of seeing them at my father's house as long as I can recollect; in my judgment these are the same; I know them from the number there are in them - the twos, threes, fours, and fives were withdrawn, except the three of clubs; the servants had done it to play a game called fortune's, that requires those cards to be taken out; the pack then was not full, but what was not among<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280018"/>them were up-stairs in the bed-room - I know the cards perfectly well from frequently using them and seeing them about; I am quite positive to them - I rather think the King of clubs is deficient; the Queen of hearts is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You see all kinds of cards at your father's house? A. No; my father is a card printer, but his business is not done at the house, but at No. 10, Frith-street, Soho; I go there perhaps once in three or six months, or not so often - I have not been in the office to see cards - I never saw such cards as these before in the course of my life; they are children's cards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at this card; had you observed whether any of them were cut? A. Yes; this Queen of hearts was notched in this way.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. It is cut with scizzors? A. Yes, and the young woman that did it is here - after the robbery, the few cards that have been produced, (the twos and threes) were left in my father's house; I never counted them - all the twos, threes, fours and fives were taken out, but the pack was not perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you remembered the cards belonged to the others, because the twos, threes, fours and fives had been taken out for fortune-telling? A. Yes, I did, all except the three of clubs - I cannot say how many of each there are; I cannot tell how many of the twos I took out - I took out all that was in but the pack was imperfect.</p>
               <p>JOHN JEALLOUS BRIMMER. The four keys found on Bennett are mine, and were taken out of my writing-desk- they belonged, one to a drawer under a large box, and another to another drawer; they were tried, and fitted the places; I am certain they are mine, and I lost them that night - they were tied together.</p>
               <p>Bennett's Defence. I bought the cards - I picked up the keys.</p>
               <p>Dybell's Defence. I was coming home from work between twelve and one o'clock, and met an Irish woman; she asked me to buy some articles - I said I would - in the mean time, Baker came up; I said, "We will buy them between us" - he said, "Very well" - we gave her 2s. 6d. for them; they are the things found at the lodging - I know nothing of the keys found in my room.</p>
               <p>Baker's Defence. I was coming home from work on Friday, between twelve and one o'clock - Dybell stood talking to an Irish woman; he asked me if I wanted to buy the things - I said we would have them between us - we talked to the Irish woman about five minutes, and gave her 2s. 6d. for them; there were four or five pairs of stockings, and knives and brushes.</p>
               <p>Dickinson's Defence (written). I most humbly and respectfully beg leave to state, that I am a pauper in the parish of St. Ann, Soho, and was farmed out at Islington; on the day mentioned in the indictment I was out, and called at George Bennett's, to see a person named Susan Miller, who lodges in the house. Bennett had a pair of white stockings in his hand, and my stockings being quite worn out, I requested him to give them to me, which he did. A short time after, the prosecutor and a policeman came in to search the house, and on their taking them I said they were mine, as I considered they were, after Bennett had given them to me. The order will prove I was not out at the time of the robbery, and I can with truth assure your lordship of my perfect innocence.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LINDERGREEN re-examined. I found on Turner this apron; she wore it at the time I took her into custody - it was sworn to as part of the brown holland - I apprehended her in the New-road, and this volume of Cowper's Poems was found on her; it was about nine o'clock on Saturday evening; she was in company with another girl - I took her the same day as I took the other two.</p>
               <p>MRS. WESTON. I cannot recognise the apron; one piece of holland is so much like another I cannot swear to it - this volume of Cowper's Poems is mine; here is the fellow volume.</p>
               <p>Turner's Defence. Previous to the night named in the indictment, I met Susan Miller, who said she had bought a piece of brown holland to make aprons, and that if I would accept of a piece to make an apron, I might have it, which I did - I soon after met a lad in deep distress, and asked him if this book was his; he had it in his hand; he said, if I gave him a penny I should have it - I had no penny, but had a handkerchief in my hand; he said I should have it for that, and I gave it to him - I was in the road, and met a policeman, who asked my name, and took me in charge; I went without resistance - I was searched, and nothing was found on me, but the policeman found 7d.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the afternoon of the 23rd of October, I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after two o'clock - he was then in custody of Burkboy - I neither threatened nor made him any promise - I asked him if he had been in Mr. Brown's skittle-ground; he said, he had; I then said, "You have stolen some linen," he said, he met a man outside Mr. Brown's premises, who asked him to go and have a game at skittles; that he went in with the man who stole some linen from the kitchen - I said "you were both running away together," he said, "Yes, we were;" I searched him and found 15d. on him, in money; I have the linen here; I received it from Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>PETER BROWN. I deliverd the linen to the policeman, they are the things I mentioned before; a tablecloth, and towel, and other things, a pinafore, and 3 pillowcases, they were all in the bundle which I saw the prisoner drop; they are my property; the aprons I wear myself; and here is my child's pinafore; the table-cloth is what we had in use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Kennington-lane, and met the young man, who asked me to play a game at skittles; he said, he was going to the kitchen-door, to ask for the skittle-ball; and while he was gone. I went to the water-closet; he came and knocked at the door, and said, "Richard, if you don't come along you will be taken into custody;" I came out with my trousers undone; he went on to the road, and then he said, "Here they come;" he chucked the things down, and ran on, and got a good deal before me - the witness Brown came up and said, Stop him! I turned up a lane: I stopped, and he caught me.</p>

I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner on the 17th of October - I took her to the station-house; I searched her, and found on her a bunch of keys, three pawnbroker's duplicates, one silver tea-spoon, a knife, and a snuff-box - I asked her if she knew anything of the note; she denied all knowledge of it - she told me she lived at No. 84, Wells-street, Oxford-street; I went and found she did not live there - I afterwards went to No. 54, Well-street,(I am sure she told me No. 84) - I went up-stairs to the attic and found this box - it was not locked; it contained some loose ribbons, and flannel, and linen - I tried the keys I found on her to the box, and one fits the lock; it was a very common lock - I shewed her the box on the Friday at Bow-street, and asked if it was her box; she said it was - the property in it was not claimed; she said nothing about it.</p>

On the 29th of October, I went to the prosecutor's house, about five o'clock in the morning; I went to the slaughter-house, and saw a piece of beef on the block under the loft; it was dirty, and appeared to have been carried; there were marks of soot on it; I then got up into the loft, and saw saw-dust strewed about the loft - I looked out of the loft window, and saw saw-dust and foot-marks on the tiles; I then told Avery of it - and we went and entered at the first street door, which is a sweep's; I saw the prisoner Charles Moore, lying on the first floor; I did not notice whether he was asleep or awake, he was the only person in that room; I found the door open - I found nothing there; I then went up stairs to a room over that Charles Moore was in, and there Avery went through a partition where the lath and plaster were broken down; it divided the room from a room in the next house; he there found a bundle - I saw him pick it up; I then returned down stairs, and Avery came down with another bundle afterwards; I came through the room Charles Moore was in, and came down stairs to the ground floor, and I saw

             and his family down stairs, all except Charles Moore; we then took the three prisoners into custody, and a little boy, who has been discharged; I and my brother officer, went back again and went up stairs, and saw a large hole through the ceiling and through the tiles of the top room, which was one story above where Charles Moore was; the tiles appeared to have been taken off, and put in between the ceiling and the tiling, so that anybody might get out of the hole and into the slaughter-house, by going along the tiling and down to the loft window over the slaughter-house; there was no other way by which the loft could be entered; the door of the next house was strongly nailed up; it is beyond the prisoner's house - the prisoner's house is next to the slaughter-house; there was no back door to the prisoner's house that I could see; I saw a hole covered with a piece of wood, in a cupboard on the second floor or the attic; I am not sure which; it was about six inches wide, and had a piece of string at one end; when that wood was taken out of the hole, I could see into the slaughter-house through the hole; I saw saw-dust on the top of the tiles, and traced foot-marks and saw-dust from the slaughter-house loft window, along the top of the tiles for about four yards, and there was saw-dust all over the gutter - I could not see whether it was the foot-marks of one or more persons.</p>
               <p>Charles Moore. Q. When you pulled the door down, did I not shew you where the people had got in? A. You did not; I broke the door down; nobody could have got in there - there was a small place over the door, but it was impossible anybody could get through it.</p>

             (police-constable). On the morning of the 29th of October, I went into the loft and saw some saw-dust spread about, and in the roof of the house was a trap-door; I looked through that, and saw the tracks of saw-dust on the parapet; I got out and traced the footsteps along the leaden gutter, to the roof of Moore's house, which was covered with tiles; I discovered, I suppose, about twenty tiles removed and placed inside the roof of Moore's house, they were under the roof inside; I returned to the slaughter-house, and saw a piece of beef on the block with several marks of soot on it, as if it had been rubbed against a person; I placed an officer at the outside door - and took Hudson to the first floor of Moore's house, and I went right up stairs, as the door where Edward Moore was sleeping, was fast; I saw Charles Moore sleeping on some straw in the first floor as I passed; I left my brother officer there with directions to allow nobody to go out, while I went to the second floor, which is next to the roof - and after searching for some time, about ten yards from where the hole was made through the roof, I found a smock-frock containing the fat, two other smock-frocks, a cloth, and an apron; a little distance from that, I found an apron containing necks and breasts of mutton; these were all in the room over the room Charles Moore was sleeping; I then went down, and Charles Moore was below in Edward's room; the three prisoners were together in that room; we took them into custody, and took them to the station-house; after locking them up, we went back, and I discovered in a recess in the room where Charles Moore was sleeping, this trap-door hanging by a string; it is a peep-hole made through the partition between their house and the prosecutor's slaughter-house; the wood hung by a string, and worked on a nail as a pivot, and by lifting it up, they could have a full view of the proceedings in Ware's slaughter-house.</p>

               <p>Edward Moore. Q. Was not I in bed when you came? A. Yes; and you said you were innocent of it. Q. Did not I tell you I was a sweep by trade, and had been upwards of thirty miles beyond Waltham Abbey? A. I believe you did say so - I was not there at the first search - they had no furniture in the room they were sleeping in - I know the whole family are sweeps.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. At the office did not you look at the hames for some minutes and say you doubted about them? A. I really do not know that I did say so - I did not doubt it for I swear to them, and am certain they are mine - nobody told me I might be indicted for perjury if I said wrong to my knowledge - I know them because one had a ring broken off, and the other part was broken about where it draws from, and it was not safe - I told my young man not to use them after that time - I said the collar did not belong to me.</p>

             (a prisoner). I lived at No. 4, Three King-court, White-cross-street. The prisoner asked me to go with her to sell the bonnet; I took her to Mrs. Green, and she bought it of her; I dare say this is the bonnet; I cannot swear to it; it has the appearance of the bonnet; I only saw it for about five minutes; Mrs. Green gave her a shilling, and a pair of shoes for it, and asked if it was her own; she said "Yes;" I took a shirt from the prisoner to Mrs. Price's, and brought her a shilling for it; this has the appearance of the shirt, but I never opened it, nor examined it; I gave the prisoner the money when I came back; she said, she did not wish me to have taken it to Mrs. Price's for she had had it from there; that was all she said; when I sold it to Mrs. Price she examined it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On the 5th of October, when I was returning from my work, I met a person in White-cross-street, and I bought the bonnet and shirt. I wore the bonnet several times in the neighbourhood, and then being short of money, I took the articles to the person who now prosecutes me, and she was not up. I had been in the habit of selling things to her these three years; then meeting the witness Smith, and she told me she knew a person that would buy them of me, and then in three weeks after I was taken into custody for them. The witness Smith is of a very light character, and has been tried twice at Portsmouth, and once at the Old Bailey, and is now for trial here.</p>
               <p>MARY SMITH re-examined. I was never in my life in custody at Portsmouth; and never tried there; I was tried here six years ago; I have been at Portsmouth, but was never in custody there.</p>

               <p>ROBERT BUNTING. This is one of the stones I lost; I know it by the fineness of the quality, and the scarcity of this size, and the colour is very peculiar, it being an East Indian garnet; and the cut of it - it was not cut in England; it is Indian cut; all the garnets I lost were Indian cut - I lost one very large one, and some of this size; the generality of them were smaller than that; none of them were like this, not that peculiar cut - I have not the least doubt that this is one of them - Groves has worked for me seventeen years, and Mrs. Groves was in the habit of selling for me to a great amount, and has been in the habit of seeing my stones - she has seen my garnets repeatedly in my place, she has seen this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known Mrs. Groves? A. About fourteen or fifteen years - I have known her all that time, coming backwards and forewards to my house; the husband works for me; she had access to my house - there is no private mark of mine on the garnet.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear it was East Indian cut? A. Yes, and from that and the colour I swear to it; there is not one of a thousand of that quality - I have not seen twenty of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280025"/>that quality; I do not know that I have seen any; but I may have seen fifteen or twenty, or more; very likely I have seen fifty; I will not swear I have not seen one hundred, nor one thousand; but I swear to the quality and cut - I have not seen five of this cut - there is not a lapidary in this country can cut as this is done - the tools are not such as they cut with - they cut them in the East Indies on wood and emery; I believe they are all cut in the same manner from the East Indies; exactly like this - this is the only one I saw cut in this way, I think; I might not have noticed - I do not believe I have seen any of this cut at all; I swore to this positively at the police-office - I believe I gave the cut as a reason, and the fineness of the quality, I think; I will swear I mentioned the cut to the magistrate.</p>

A."Will you give me this stone to make into a brooch?" or something like that - those are the words, as near as I can recollect; and she said he might have it - the stones were at that time in his hands, in a paper - when I first went into the room he asked his sister to get them; he asked a female, and I think it was her, but I did not take particular notice who it was - this was not in the room; it was in the passage - I am certain she was there; it was in the evening, and it was dark, and I think from her voice it was her - I did not go into the room; we went out of the passage into a cart-shed adjoining - I saw both the prisoners in the passage when I went in, and some others, but I do not know who they were - the male prisoner got the stones and opened the paper, and then we went into the other place - I saw the stones in the passage; they brought a candle; I do not know who brought it - I saw the female prisoner there; after that the two prisoners went into a cart-shed with me; somebody else came in after - we went out of the passage into the cart-shed without going into the street - I believe a door goes out of the passage into the cart-shed - the female prisoner had the candle: the male prisoner picked out the stone, and asked his sister, if he might have it; she said, "Yes" - he had them in his own hand in a paper at the time; he gave the stone to me to make into a brooch; this is very much like the stone - I took it to Mr. Groves, to be re-cut, and left it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What directions did the man give you about the garnet? A. To make it into a brooch; it was not in a fit state to be set; it could be set without being re-cut, but it would not look well; if it was re-cut it would make it look different from what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were not directed to have it re-cut, why desire Groves to do it? A. It would look so had if it was not re-cut; I thought it would not do so well for a brooch - it would cost about 3d. or 6d. to re-cut it; I knew the woman by hearing her voice afterwards - I will not be certain it was her - I am certain she is the woman who was there, but am not certain she is the woman he asked to get the stones; there was a girl there, but I am almost sure it was the prisoner he asked; it might he the girl who brought the stones; there was no light in the passage when I heard the woman's voice, when he asked for the stones to be got; I had not known her before; Mr. Hasler could not recut the stone; he is a jeweller; I took it as a little job for myself; I should charge for making the brooch about 1s.; he asked me what it would be: I said, "About 1s.;" I was to set it in brass - I should have 3d. or 6d. to pay for re-cutting it; that would be out of my pocket; I have known Mrs. Groves, I believe, about a year and a-half; it might be more; she worked for my master; I never saw her with any garnets; I have been with my master two years and three months - living with him nearly all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time your master first hired you, up to this time, have you ever quitted him? A. Yes; about twelve months since; I had been hired by him then, a year and ten months - I did not tell my master I was going away, he had beat me before I left, because I lost a little coral drop; I went to a house to get a bill receipted, and in opening the paper, it fell out of the paper and fell down a hole in the room, and I could not get the board up; the value of it was 1s.; I ran away from him because he beat me for it; I went to Liverpool - my master was living in London; it is two hundred miles to Liverpool - I walked there; I found my way by seeing the coaches and things going along; I did not intend to go to Liverpool when I set out - I am sure I don't know why I went there; I had 1s. 6d. in my pocket, and eat acorns and blackberries to support myself on the way; I was eight days walking - I slept in the hedges; I had some clothes - I did not pawn any of them - I had none but what I had on; I did not pledge any clothes before I left - I once pledged a waistcoat, that was nearly twelve months before, I had no friends in Liverpool - I was only there one day; I went to the dock yard there to go to sea; I was never at sea.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you discovered at Liverpool? A. I was standing in the dock yard; a policeman asked me where I belonged to; I told him, and I was sent to London to my master; I was sixteen years old then; I did not see hand-bills offering a reward for me - I saw hand-bills describing me when I returned; my master had scolded me for various things before - he did not accuse me of stealing coral; I am in his service at this time; he refused to become bail for my appearance.</p>
               <p>MR. DOANE. Q. You were flogged and ran away from your apprenticeship? A. Yes; I said I was doubtful who the prisoner asked to fetch the garnets; I have not a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280026"/>doubt who it was that seemed to own the stones - it was that girl; I am quite sure she is the girl who consented to let the male prisoner have that garnet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know who he asked to let him have the stone? A. Yes - that girl at the bar.</p>

            ; I remember receiving a garnet from my husband, about the 25th of October; it was a particularly fine one; I had seen it in possession of Mr. Bunting before, with others, and recognised it; I have worked for him seventeen years - I have had goods on commission from Mr. Bunting, to the amount of 2 or 300l. at a time; I believe this to be the same garnet; I took it to Mr. Bunting's and left it with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen Gibbons many times? A. From his coming backwards and forwards for the last two years - I knew him when he went to Liverpool - I heard of his going, but not till he was gone; I heard it from his employer, after he was gone; I only knew him as a boy bringing work backwards and forwards; my maiden name was Harris; I was not married more than once - I have been married to Groves thirteen years; I never went by the name of Eaton - I never knew that name; I know Hatton-garden, and the Police-office - I was born in the neighbourhood of it; I have been in the Police-office - I was there last month; I cannot tell you how long it is since I was there the first time - I have been there several times as a witness, or any thing else - I was there, and if Mr. Wooler is here he can answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you charged with the first time you made your appearance there? A. I was seen to be talking to a bad character; that is the only charge - I was never brought to the police-office again - I was never charged but once at Hatton-garden; Mr. Wooller was astonished that the key should be turned on me - I don't know who the policeman was that had me; it was one of the new police - I was never there in charge of any officer, not a policeman; I was there a month ago only as a witness in Mr. Bunting's case - I never was in the office, except as a witness for Mr. Bunting, and at the time I was charged with speaking to a bad character, that was last summer - I know Waddington, he is well known in the neighbourhood; he has never had me in custody, that I will swear; the policeman took me, and of course I was in the care of Mr. Waddington; it was only once; and that was, because I spoke to a bad character - my house has not been searched lately - I know Busain, the police-inspector - my house was never searched but once; that was last summer, when I was charged with speaking to a bad character; and, my brother, unfortunately, was in trouble at the time; he had a trial here, and you, Sir, was kind enough to plead his cause - my house was searched, for furs, I believe; it was searched, but no stolen furs were in my house - I was never charged at Hatton-garden, with four other women, that I swear; nor with any women, except what I have said; that was last summer - I was not charged with three or four other women, with housebreaking - I had but two examinations, that was on account of the furs; on account of my brother and me talking to bad women - when I come to recollect, it was the summer before last, but that was the transaction - I was not examined twice; I was not asked questions the next time - I went down, I believe, two days, and was then brought up and discharged - I went by my own name then - I was never in Waddington's custody, by the name of Eaton, nor any name, except Groves; and I was only once in his custody - I was never charged with a girl and two men - I have made no mistake.</p>

               <p>Q. On what occasion did you see her at the office first? A. Two burglaries were committed; her brother was charged with them, and she was taken also by Busain; it was on the 20th of January, 1832; four prisoners were committed, and she was discharged; two males, and two females - I think she went by the name of Groves; I will not positively say that I knew her by any other name - I have seen her several times at our office - I think the last occasion was about some furs, where Busain had searched about furs - I don't recollect what she was charged with; she was, on one occasion, charged with something - I am positive I saw her at our office under a charge once; the second time I cannot be certain of - she was in the office, which is only a small room; but whether she was charged or not I don't know; that is eight or nine months ago - it was about the furs and some shoes that she was there the first time - it was two burglaries together; her brother had been transported. and came back, and was taken up twice since; and on every occasion that he was there, she was there - the burglaries were about robbing a man in Leather-lane, of some furs; that was in January, 1832.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I deny following the gentleman down St. Paul's Church-yard; the gentleman came up Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>JAMES BEAMAN. I stood at the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard; I cannot say where the prosecutor came from, but he was going up Cheapside - I was close to the corner of St. Paul's Church-yard; against Butler's shop - I never saw him in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>JOHN GREGSON. I live at No. 18, Bedford-row; on the 1st of November, I was in Cheapside, and lost a pocket handkerchief - the last witness Beaman called my attention to it, and told me I was robbed - I turned round and saw my handkerchief in the prisoner's left hand - this is my handkerchief - I had come from Bedford-row - I do not know when I last had the handkerchief safe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two young men walking before me in Newgate-street - they crossed the road, and I picked up the handkerchief, and immediately the officer laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>JOHN GREGSON. I have inquired of Mr. Darling, poulterer, Leadenhall-market, who the prisoner left in December last, and he had intrusted him with property, and knew nothing against him; I saw him to day.</p>

            . I am inspector of the division N of the police; on Tuesday night, the 22nd of October, the prisoner came to the station-house, Southwark-bridge, and inquired what the punishment would be for robbing in a dwelling-house, in the night; whether it would be hanging; I told him it depended a good deal on the circumstance, and asked what he meant, he said, "I am the person<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280028"/>who have done it and am come to give myself up;" I thought it might be a hoax - he said, "you may think I am joking, but I am come to give myself up for robbery; let me come round and I will tell you the whole of it" - he came round, took a chair, drew himself up to me and began to state the particulars - I said, "before I can entertain the charge, I will send to see if such a robbery has been committed" - I sent the sergeant who came back with Mr. Edger, who said (in the prisoner's presence,) that it was correct; and the prisoner said, the cook had often said, she would be glad when he was gone, but said he, "I wonder now whether she would be glad or sorry," he said he lived at No. 8, Devonshire-square, in the service of Miss Edger; that he was going to leave the service, and had often watched the cook's keys - that he took a pattern with the eye, of the nearest he could, and tried it to the cook's box; that he slept in the house that night, and took nine silver spoons from the kitchen, and Captain Christie's shoes, and 40 sovereigns from the cook's box, and he would have made them remember it, had not the old stairs creaked so in going up, or else he should have had all the plate in the house; I have no doubt he had been drinking for some days before - I thought he was deranged, but he was not the least altered before the Lord Mayor - he said that after the robbery he went to Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham, for he was determined they should never have any of the property; I told the sergeant to search him - he said, "You will find nothing, for I was determined they should have nothing back," and when 1s. was found on him he said, "Oh there is a shilling here - I would not have come here till I had spent it, if I had known it;" this was on the 27th of October - he said, "Now you think I have been romancing and joking with you, but for all I have told you, I mean to have a trial for it, for they do not know whether it was before twelve or after twelve o'clock that I left the house - and I mean to stand my trial for it, after all I have told you about it" - next morning I thought on reflection, he might contradict his statement but he has never contradicted it at all - I found a key in his box which the cook says opens her box better than her own - I found at the place where he directed me that I should find his clothes, the property in the box with his clothes - I found a pair of shoes with Captain Christie's name written in them - I am not acquainted with the name of the parish myself - I have not recovered any property - he said three duplicates I found, was the produce of what he bought with the money.</p>

On the 19th of October, I saw the prisoner in the warehouse; he applied to purchase articles, and went into the upper warehouse, into the fur room - he came about five o'clock in the evening, and said he was a large shipper, and wanted goods to the amount of 2000l., which he would pay cash for, and would select them next morning - there is an opening below, and one of the boys saw him do something; and on the 21st of October, he came in and I then saw him twist a boa round his fist, take his hat off, and put it into his hat; he stopped a short time - a young man was showing him goods, and wanted to know why he did not buy them; he said he had seen goods at another warehouse cheaper - he came down; I sent some young man for an officer - he walked out of the warehouse, and was brought back, and on being brought into the counting-house, he threw the boa out of his hat, but I did not see that; all I saw him do was, put it into his hat, and walk out - he had been in the warehouse about half an hour, and looked at different descriptions of goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long after you saw him put it into his hat was he taken up? A. About ten minutes; I went down the warehouse, and sent a young man out for an officer; it was not my business to seize him; I should take care he did not go away - I was down stairs between him and the door; he was up stairs - he could not go out without passing me; he did not make any attempt to pass me; I was in the lower warehouse.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Leaf and Co. On Saturday, the 19th of October, the prisoner came to the warehouse, and on the following Monday he came, between twelve and two o'clock, and asked to see the goods he had seen on Saturday; I showed them to him, and after looking at them a few minutes, he asked to see goods which are kept at another part of the warehouse - I went to get them; some boas were on the counter, and some hanging by him; he bought nothing; he was going away - I said, I had some things in the lower warehouse, which I wished to show him - he followed me down; I followed him out into the street and took him back into the warehouse, and as he went into the counting-house, he took off his hat, and threw a boa from his hat; I saw it picked it, and taken into the counting-house - I delivered the same boa to the policeman; this is it; I know it by my own mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been told that he had a boa in his hat? A. No; I did not go down to a place that was dark with him; it is a place below stairs; I should say it is under ground - it is a lower warehouse; a cellar; there were other persons about who had the opportunity of seeing him throw the boa from his hat - they are not here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there any other boas near the part where he threw this? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you say anything to him? A. No; I did not think it proper - I took hold of him, and brought him into the counting-house without saying what I wanted - a person told him he wished to speak with him in the counting-house; that person is not here.</p>

On the 21st of October, I was in the lower warehouse while the prisoner was being served; I heard him ask for different boas, and while the young man was gone for goods, I saw him twist the boa round his hand, and put it into his hat - I saw him go out of the warehouse, and did not lose sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many people were in the warehouse at the time? A. Part of the young men were at dinner - I should not think there was thirty young men in the warehouse at the time; they were not so near him as me - when I saw it I stopped till the young man came back who was serving him - I went up-stairs, and gave information to Mr. Smith - I remained watching the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a city policeman, No. 85. I have the boa.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, I stand before you in a very unpleasant and degraded situation, and therefore beg your most serious attention to the few words I may offer; and should there appear any difficulties or errors, you will make all reasonable allowances for a foreigner - I have been in England since 1824; I lost a great deal of property in unfortunate speculations; I then occupied my time in pursuit of literature - The philanthropic tendency of my writings are well known - I have in my possession a few letters, selected from among numbers, from influential persons, such as his present Majesty, the Duke of Kent, Duke of Gloucester, Lord Stanhope, Duke of Wellington, and also the publications to which they refer - I will call your attention to my mercantile transactions, which will prove that I called at the warehouse on business; having been commissioned by persons, and purchased goods to various amounts, which I have several gentlemen to prove; and on the Saturday I called at the prosecutor's warehouse, but it being rather late in the afternoon, I said I would call on the Monday following; which I could not have done if guilty of improper conduct - on the day stated, I called and looked at a particular description of boas, and offered a certain price, which Buckwell declined; convinced he would ultimately accept my offer, I retired, and at the door, (not in the street,) was requested to go into the counting-house; and to my surprise, after some minutes a third person came forward with a boa which was said to be secreted in my hat, and thrown away - had McIntyre seen me secrete it, would he have allowed me to continue on the place half an hour purchasing goods, and to leave his department - Buckwell states he saw me throw the boa away; would he not then have picked it up? He stated before the magistrate he did not pick it up - I ask you whether it is likely I should have laid myself open to prosecution for so paltry a consideration? when I could have got credit to a considerable amount at many warehouses where I am in the habit of dealing; and there was much more valuable property within my reach at the prosecutor's? - This is the first time in my life I was ever charged with felony, or even in custody - I hope you will take into consideration that I have been six weeks in custody before this has come before an enlightened British Jury; and for the great loss I have sustained all the treasures on earth cannot compensate me; and remembering that Godlike maxim, that it is safer for ninety-nine guilty to escape, rather than one innocent should be punished, I request you will look well at the circumstances, and enable me to return a useful member to society.</p>

               <p>The prisoner here placed the boa in his hat, for the purpose of convincing the jury that it was too large, and could not be there when his hat was on.</p>

            . It took him about two minutes to twist the boa up - there was only one young man in the room he was in - the warehouse consists of different rooms, and he was in the fur room.</p>
               <p>JOHN WOOLMORE. I saw him twist the boa round his arm; he did it in the upper warehouse; there were about thirty persons in the warehouse as near as I can say - there was no one in the same room as he was only Buckwell, and he was at the farthest end of the department; he could not see him - McIntyre was in the lower warehouse with me; Buckwell had turned to fetch some goods when he twisted the boa; it would not go into his hat unless he had twisted it into a small compass, and when he put his hat on, he knocked his hat down on his head.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner the same hat as he has now produced? A. I don't know: the one he put on to-day did not go on his head so far as the one he wore at the warehouse.</p>

On Easter Monday last, about half-past twelve o'clock at night; there were three young men at the corner of Bishopsgate - I stopped for a moment, as they were singing, and while I stood there the prisoner came to me and snatched my watch from my fob; I caught the watch in my hand, and caught the prisoner round the waist; he had got the watch just out of my pocket - I caught it in my hand; he rushed against me, and pulled the watch out of my fob; it was just out of my fob as I caught him; it was not quite out - the watch was at the bottom of my fob before, and he moved it up to the top of my fob; I seized hold of it, caught him round the waist - he threw me down; I called for assistance, and my brother-in-law came to my assistance, and took him off me - the prisoner had hold of the ribbon, and I had the watch in my hand - when he got me down he tried to throttle me; he got his hands on each side of my throat; I called out, and he let go of me immediately; he did nothing more to me - nobody kicked me- I never actually lost my watch; I had a silver coin attached to my watch-ribbon - (looking at the watch) this is it, and it has the same coin to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have had your watch since that night? A. Yes; I got it again three or four weeks afterwards, and kept it until I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280030"/>Mansion-house, when the prisoner was in custody, about a fortnight or three weeks ago - the officer asked me who the maker was - I know the maker's name - Riley took my watch in charge that night; when it was drawn from my fob - I got it again when I went to the Mansion-house, about three weeks afterwards - it was about six months ago; I have had it ever since - the officer had not handed it to me that night; I kept it till Mr. Riley came to my house, about three weeks ago, and said I must give it up into his care; I have never made a mistake on this subject - nobody kicked me when I was down; it was dark - there were about three persons singing; there was nobody at all listening to them - they were not singing for money; they were at play.</p>

Yes; not knocking his head on the stones; I did not - he ill-used me most dreadfully - I held him down or he would have got away; but he kicked and bit me before that - he broke out of the watch-house in the morning - if I had got any thing about me he would not have got out of the watch-house for I would have given him a cut.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my charge - I put him into Bishopsgatecage in the strong-room, and knowing him, I paid more attention to him than usual - I found in an hour afterwards, three iron bars wrenched off outside the cage, and he had got out and escaped - I took him again on the 20th of October - I knew him very well before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you knew him to be a bad character, and paid more attention to him? A. Yes; he got out in an hour afterwards; it was a very busy night - I will swear the bars were not down before - the cage is under the burial-ground in Bishopsgate Church-yard - I found a small googe on his person.</p>

On the 10th of October I was going to town across London-fields - I saw the prisoner, whom I had seen before; there were two men coming after him; they called to him, that he was carrying it uncovered; that attracted my attention - I looked round to see what it was, and saw the prisoner had a copper boiler on his shoulder; when he saw that I was at his elbow, he said he was going to take it to have a lid - I passed on, and the prisoner stopt behind with the two men who appeared to be bricklayers, and the pot was covered up.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker at Kingsland. On the 24th of October, about a quarter past seven o'clock, the prisoner came and offered a gown to pawn; I knew him before; it was a gown similar to this, but I did not take it in, because it was wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you open the parcel? A. No sir; I did not, for directly I felt it was so wet, I would not take it; I don't recollect whether there was a wrapper round it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to swear, that it was a gown similar to that, when you cannot tell whether it was covered up in a wrapper or not? A. I took very little notice of the gown, but I saw it was wet; I don't recollect opening the wrapper; I cannot swear it was not in a wrapper.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How did you know that it was a gown? A. I saw the gown on the counter, but whether there was a wrapper or not, I cannot tell; but the colour was brought to my recollection by the young woman coming to inquire about it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear that the outside wrapper was not black, blue, or brown? A. I did not take any notice of the wrapper, but I saw the gown; I cannot tell anything about it, whether it was covered up or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You swear you saw the gown, now if it had been in a wrapper, it must have been opened by yourself, or some one; do you swear that if it was in a wrapper it was opened by some one? A. Yes, and it was a gown similar to this one; it appeared darker than this, but being wet made it appear darker.</p>

             (police-constable N 202). I received information, and went to Charles-street, where the prisoner lives with his father and mother; I saw the prisoner's brother come out of the house with a bundle, and the prisoner followed him immediately; I was in private clothes; I walked down Dalston, and they after me; I knew them but they did not know me; I stopt, and when his brother came up, I asked him where he was going; he gave me no answer; I then asked him if he knew any body who had any rabbits to sell; he said, "My brother William does;" the prisoner then came up, and I seized him; I made a snatch at the brother also; he escaped, but I caught the bundle which contained this gown.</p>

I was in his shop on the 2nd of November, and the prisoner came in to pawn two watches; I sent the boy up stairs with them; I was then called to the the door, and remained there about two minutes; when I came back I saw the prisoner in a state of confusion, with his hands just put into his pockets; the boy then came down stairs, and told the prisoner the price he wanted for the two watches, was too much; the prisoner took them up, went as far as the door, and told the boy he had provided enough for his to-morrow's dinner, and he did not mind about pawning the watches; he then went away, and I missed this silver hunting watch from the back counter, when the gentleman came down from dinner, which was about twenty minutes after the prisoner was gone; it had been on the back counter in that part of the shop where the prisoner stood, when I was called to the door; if I don't swear altogether to the watch, I can to this piece of ribbon which was inside, and the words which are on it; this watch is in all respects like the one we lost, and the number and name which is Reynolds, are entered in our book; it had been pawned by Mrs. Edwards, for 1l. 12s.; on the Wednesday after the prisoner came to our shop again, and offered a hunting watch to pawn, which was not one of those he had offered on the 2nd of Novmber, and I sent for an officer; this watch had been on the back counter, and the prisoner could get it by opening the hatch door of the front counter, or he might have got over the counter; I don't think I should have seen him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you any shop in the parish of St. Luke's, Middlesex? A. No, our shop is in Bishopsgate, in the City of London; you were taken before the Lord Mayor, but the watch not having been found, you were discharged, but on the following evening, my brother was going by a pawnbroker's shop, and he stepped in, and found the watch; I cannot tell how far our counter is across, but you could not reach the watch with your arm, you must have got over the counter, or gone through the hatch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your house is in Bishopsgate? A. Yes; in Union-street, Bishopsgate, in the City of London; I believe it is next door to the County of Middlesex; it is not five hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have I not been in the habit of frequenting your brother's shop? A. I have seen him before; he has been to pawn watches now and then; he has sold the duplicates, and brought persons to redeem them; I know nothing of my brother requesting you to take a forged duplicate of a gold watch; I did not make out a duplicate in the name of Moss for 5l.; I know nothing about it; all I know is, that you came and said, a gentleman wanted a gold watch, and one was produced which weighed one ounce, it was worth 4l. 10s., and you wished the duplicate to be made for 5l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the prisoner? A. I believe he deals in watches; when he was taken fifty-six duplicates were found on him, and twenty-five were for watches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Having received the two watches back, I said, "Your brother gives very bad prices, but never mind, I have sufficient to get a Sunday's dinner to-morrow;" not, as he insinuates, by stealing his watch, but I had pawned one watch that day, and got 8s. profit by it.</p>

            . No; it was put into the drawer the night it was pawned; but the next morning the gentleman was going to take it up-stairs with some other watches, and it was on the back-counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I went to the prosecutor's for the purpose of pledging two silver watches. The shop lad took them up-stairs, and in about two minutes returned with them, saying the price would not do. I was at that time standing at the shop-door with the brother of the prosecutor; there was a young man with a broach standing in the next box to me. I declare to God, and in your presence, that I never saw any watch but these said two, and which were my own. On the Wednesday following, I went to Mr. Jerome's shop to pledge a silver hunting watch, and Mr. Jerome said he should retain that one, as I had stolen one from his shop on the Saturday previous. I told him if I had it was not likely I should come again to his shop, and if he thought I had really stolen it, he had better give me into custody; he then sent for an officer, and I was taken before the Lord Mayor, when his lordship dismissed the charge. I then returned to Mr. Jerome's shop for my watch which he had retained: he told me that as I had told the Lord Mayor, that he, (Mr. Jerome) was in the habit of making out false tickets of gold watches, he and several of the trade would look after me. On the following Friday I was again taken into custody on the same charge; and on the oath of Mr. Worley (another pawnbroker), who swore I pawned the watch with him. I was committed for trial. On the 1st of November, I pledged a silver hunting watch with Mr. Worley for 30s., and on the Saturday evening I went with the two first named watches to pledge, but we could not agree as to the amount to be lent on them. When I went in, the shop was full of customers, and there were two men also with silver watches for pledge at the same time; one of whom I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280033"/>knew, his name was Gig. If I had stolen the watch as charged to me, it is not at all likely I should have offered it for pledge at a place where I was so well kmown; and if I had pawned it, why not have put my own name and address as I did on the hunter the day before? I have been in the watch trade all my life, with the exception of about thirteen years service on board a man-of-war under the command of Sir

            . If I had the watch in my possession for five minutes, I should have opened it to ascertain its value, and then I must have seen the piece of marked silk which was said to have been in the case, and which I could easily have removed; and I could have taken off the namepiece and field the name off, and have engraved my own name and number instead I most soloemnly declare, that I know nothing whatever of the watch in question. It being Saturday evening, and Mr. Wolerey being busy, some other young man might have taken it in. I never have pledged anything in any other name than my own; and if I had pledged it, the ticket would have appeared with my own name and address.</p>

            . (police-sergeant G 8). I took the prisoner at Brompton, near Chatcham; I had been after him for some time, and I thought he might have enlisted for a soldier, which he had; I told him it was for taking a box of jewellery and some cages; as we were coming to London, he told me he had determined to speak the truth; he then said, the fact was, he was up stairs making a little cart, when his brother came up with the box, and said, "Look here Bill;" he said, he at first refused to have any thing to do with it, but at last he went and sold the box and its contents to an old woman in Chequer-alley; he did not say what the contents were, but he asked me if I had found a silver penny, as there was a silver penny which the old woman said she would never part with, but keep it as long as she lived; I had been to the old woman before, and found she had pawned the brooch in Goswell-street, but I did not find the penny; the woman has been convicted here; I found this watch on the prisoner.</p>

I asked a friend of mine to go with me to buy a little bit of lace; when we went into a shop, I fixed on a piece which measured three yards; I took my money out to pay for it, and at that moment, one of the shopmen took my friend into another room, telling her she had some lace about her; they searched her, and nothing was found upon her but money; they then told me to come, and they would search me, as they said I had got some under my shawl, but nothing was found but the money in my hand; they told us we had better go; I then asked for the lace I had bought, when he said we should not have it; we then accordingly went, and in Bond-street, were buying a comb; and while there, the shopman and a policeman came and told us we must both he searched; they took us back to the shop, but nothing was found upon us; they took us to Marlborough-street, and then I was committed.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WHALESBY. Q. It was your duty to give the money you received from customers to the head waiter? A. Yes; I had to account to him twice a day - I understood he had the tradesmen to pay, but I had no particular knowledge of his duty - I made these memorandums a little before I gave him the money, then I counted the money in a saucer and delivered it to the prisoner - Mr. Taylor showed me these papers again on the night following, and said he was very happy that he had left the papers behind him - the dates on these papers were not written at the time I wrote the sums of money - they were written the evening the prisoner absconded - I saw him walk out of the house with a box on his shoulder and a trunk in his hand - I did not think there was anything suspicious in his going out - I used the word absconded because I heard the officer use it - I never gave money to my master, but settled with the prisoner - I never was in a coffee shop before; I had lived there three months - I had before been with Mr. Egan, in Blackfriars-road, as light porter - I believe there was at Mr. Taylor's a box called the waiter's-box with a hole in the top - I do not know what was the use of it but I had seen it in the bar, belonging to the room up-stairs - I do not know whether it was locked.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have used the term absconded did you expect him to return? A. Yes; he did not give me, or any one in the house the slightest intimation that he was going to High-Wycomb.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. The prisoner was in my service; he gave me no notice that he was about to leave me -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280035"/>he was with me for three or four years - he never accounted to me for either of the sums mentioned by the last witness, which it was his duty to have done - I heard he had left on the 31st of October - I went to Titchbourn-street - I did not find the key in the till - I broke it open and found 2l. 0s. 6d. in silver, and 5s. 6 1/2d. in copper - my daughter had presided there - she was just turned seventeen years of age - I found she had also left - in consequence of information, I went on the 1st of November, to High-Wycomb; I found the prisoner there and my daughter - the prisoner is married and has four children - I collared him when I found him in a public-house, and made use perhaps of improper words, I said, "You d-d infernal villain where is the money you have robbed me of" - he said, "I have none of your money; I left it all in the till" - I said No you have not I am positive - he quickly replied, "You cannot swear that;" I gave him in charge, and brought my daughter to town with me - these memoranda were in a cup on a shelf, where the prisoner generally kept his papers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had been three or four years in your service? A. Yes; I knew him when he was in business for himself; he had been unfortunate, and applied to me, and I employed him - there was nothing to prevent him from taking these papers away; the till was in the counter, and could be taken out if it was unlocked - there is a box called the waiter's box; it was used for him to put his pence or perquisites in; he might put other things in, but not to my knowledge - that stood on the shelf close by where I found these papers - I had the prisoner and Evans, and two female servants in my employ - the prisoner had so much control of the other waiter, that if he had misconducted himself he would have complained of him to me - the prisoner had my place when I was out, but he had not to pay bills unless I gave orders; if the postman came he might have paid him; I left money for the newsman - on the Monday before this, I left 7l. with the prisoner, which he appropriated properly by paying 6l. 16s. 4d. out of it as I had directed him - I left money for the rent; he had paid 74l. about a month previous to this; and if it had been ten times that sum I should have left it with him - I could not have ascertained so correctly what money had been in the till had it not been for these papers, but I keep a cheque and could have told nearly what was deficient; the prisoner generally settled with me every night, but it was never longer than a week; I should always settle with him on the Sunday morning, though I might have received money of him three or four times in the week; there was no writing at the time of our settlement but what I chose to make in my own book; he paid for the muffins out of the money which he took, but on no occasion made any advances; they were not more than 1s. or 1s. 6d. a day; he made no advance to me - I may on two or three occasions, when I have been going out, have said to him, "Let me have two or three shillings, to save my going up stairs," which he has done, and put it down, and deducted it in his account the next day - the key of the till was found after I broke it open; I think my servant gave it me the next morning, the 1st of November - if she had the key she could certainly open the till - I do not know where the prisoner usually kept that key; I believe he sometimes put it in his box - I was never violent in my temper towards my daughter; I have expressed myself in violent terms to several persons since I have discovered this unhappy affair; I have not in her presence expressed myself so as to excite apprehension in her mind - I did not discover it till the 31st of October, when the prisoner and she absconded; I had not suspected it before - my daughter is not here to-day - she was with the prisoner when I found him at High Wycomb; I do not know whether she made any remark; if she did, I was too much agitated to hear it - I have never expressed to any one, my determination to be revenged on the prisoner for the wrong done to my daughter.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, recollect Mr. Taylor; have you never said you would prosecute him for this wrong to your daughter, even if it cost you your life? A. I certainly should do so; I do not know that I used those words, but no doubt they imply my meaning, in answer to an observation about being lenient to the parties.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you your daughter educated at school? A. Yes; she had returned from school seven months ago, three weeks before her mother died; she had been at school thirteen or fourteen years - I never used harsh language towards her - I have expressed myself angrily towards the prisoner since I discovered this, but not towards my daughter.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. I left the 7l. on the Monday morning before, previous to my going to my other house in the City - I ordered him to pay the newsman his week's account; and to get 5l. worth of coke, and pay for it.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Hammond, a surgeon, at Whetstone. On the 9th of July, I saw Edward Thompson at Mr. Harrison's - I was at the post mortem examination; there was an external bruise on the head of the deceased: I found extravasation of blood internally on the dura mater, and a small quantity of blood in the lower ventricle - the face was bruised slightly, and there was a bruise on the arm, and one on the groin - there was a bruise on the back of the head, a little above the ear; that bruise must have been done by a weapon - I should say he died from extravasation of blood - the wound on the back of the head would cause that.</p>

I attended the deceased Thompson during his life-time after the fight, and found him in a state of total insensibility; he continued in that state up to the time of his death; he never recovered his senses at all - he died on Thursday morning, the 11th of July, about one o'clock; I examined him after his death - on the skull being separated, the dura mater was thoroughly healthy - I next saw some extravasated blood coagulated; and found four vessels on the brain had burst, three on one hemisphere, and one on the other; they were superficial small vessels - there was a bruises on one eye, and much swollen, and it had the appearance of having been lanced; there were a few slight bruises on the left parietal bone, and a slight scratch; I saw no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280039"/>bruise on the back of the head - I took great pains to examine, and the head was shaved previously to that; I conceive that I must have seen it if there was one - there was a bruise on the arm - in my opinion the bursting of the blood vessels was the cause of his death: and I should imagine a fall caused the bursting of the blood vessels - I think a fall, or a scuffle, or a fight, would occasion the rupture of the blood vessels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. This is not the first time you have been examined on the subject? A. No, once before; on that occasion I stated that as there was no appearance of sufficient violence externally; I imagined it must be a fall; and that is my opinion now; there was no external violence; I took great pains to examine; there was a slight bruise on the left parietal bone, but that was of no importance; I heard Mr. Cox examined on the former occasion; he stated there was a bump raised up on the back of the head from a blow - and said he could not see it before, through the hair being on the head, but he distinctly felt it with his fingers; I swear there was no appearance of that sort - Mr. Cox did not see the deceased before I did; he had been in my presence perhaps four hours before; I did not do anything to make a bump on the head - I applied a blister to the nape of the neck, which many of the Coroner's jury, I think, mistook for a wound; I saw no bump; in my opinion, there was none; I am not a member of the college of surgeons; I have practised for sixteen years or more, in London and Whetstone, as a general practitioner; I have not been in the habit of practising upon animals; my father was a veterinary surgeon, and that has caused the impression that I attended cattle; I bled him with a lancet and with leeches, and opened the temporal artery previous to Mr. Cox seeing him; it is impossible to say how much blood I took, because the blood was extravasated; I did not take more than three or four ounces from the arteries, but it was not caught, measured, or weighed, it ran about; I did not take more than ten - I can guess an ounce; I bled from the temporal artery, till the blood no longer discharged itself; I did not take a pint from the artery - I never weighed blood; I should think there are sixteen or eighteen ounces in a pint; we measure blood twelve ounces by the pound, fluid measure - not ale and beer measure, but apothecaries weight; I bled him in the right arm, in the brachial vein - I recollect that from the position the man laid in the surgery - he laid on his back; I took about three pints of blood from the arm, as near as I can guess - two pints at first, and more afterwards; I then staid an hour or two, and took about ten ounces more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many ounces altogether? A. Not so much as sixty; I took from the arm about three pints, and about four ounces from the artery.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. And you average eighteen or twenty ounces of blood to a pound; was all that taken in one day? A. All in one afternoon, within four hours; and I think he had five leeches besides, they might take about two ounces; I believe the leeches were applied after the lancet - they were good leeches; the man bled as freely with the last blood I took, as the first; I cannot account for the leeches taking only two ounces; he was bled and leeched again afterwards - not by my orders; it was the next morning; twice the quantity of blood would not cause death in a man of his constitution.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, that would be one hundred and thirty-two ounces? A. I did not say that; it was not taken at once; he lived from the Tuesday evening, until Thursday morning at one o'clock; I attribute his death to the extravasated blood, and nothing else; I should think a man who had been fighting for a long time, would be in a state of considerable exhaustaion; and he was in a state of exhaustion when I applied my remedies.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say he did not die from your remedy, instead of from disease? A. I can; not from my remedy; Mr. Evans operated on him; Hammond saw him - I don't know whether he operated; and Mr. Cox saw him - that was all after me; I saw leeches being applied to him afterwards, by Hammond's orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to state on your oath, on the best of your judgment, that from all the appearances on the man, he might not have met his death from a weapon? A. Certainly I will; Mr. Cox knows nothing at all about it - certainly, Mr. Cox at the last examination, alledged that I killed the man; I have said nothing further here, than I did before - I did not say I took sixty six ounces of blood from him; Mr. Hammond is a surgeon of Whetsone - he is a man of considerable experience - he is not here, nor was he here before; he gave evidence on the inquest.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Was the extravasation of blood on the brain produced by the bleeding? A. No; it could not be.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. COX. Q. Did you bleed the deceased at all? A. No; nor anybody in my presence besides the last witness - I don't know of his having been bled; I don't know the quantity of blood which he took from him; the individual would have died whether he had been bled to that extent or not - I saw the bump, and Mr. Evans did, or rather felt it - a person examining the man accurately, could not have missed observing it - I should think nobody could have mistaken the bump for the remains of a blister on the nape of the neck.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. HARRISON. Q. In your judgment, was the operation of bleeding proper to prevent any flow of blood to the brain? A. It was; I was aware of the bursting of a vessel, and did it to prevent that - I told Mr. Cox so when he came into my shop - I did it to try to remove the pressure of blood on the brain.</p>

            ; the prisoner was there; I cannot say what he had to do with the fight, except that he acted as the brother of Michael Murphy - in several things he acted as he ought not to have done in it - from the first to the third, or it might be the fourth round - it was a fair stand-up fight, man for man; but from that Thompson appeared to be the best man - Ready was one of Michael Murphy's seconds, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280040"/>other man was unknown to me; there was a great many people at the fight - after the third round, there was not fair play to Thompson by any means - I don't mean to say that there was any foul play on the part of the seconds; it was merely the multitude that stood round of the Irish - nothing took place to interrupt the fight, no further than pushing in, and shoving them up to the further part of the ring which I considered the highest ground - the ring was not particularly broken, it was shoved from one part to the other; the ring was kept good enough, except that Michael Murphy wished to give in - he gave in; I considered him to give in twice for at the time Ready was wiping him down the face; (with his hand over his left shoulder, wiping the blood from his face,) he looked over his shoulder to his brother, and said in a faint voice, "I shall fight no more;" I stood close to him; he said so to the prisoner, and the prisoner stepped across his knee, clapped his hands together two or three times, and said, "Halloo, you b-r, you can beat two such as him; you shall fight him" I then said to the seconds of Thompson, "Now the fight is yours;" and at that time I was knocked down and kicked in a scandalous manner, and was senseless; I lost several rounds which I did not see; when I came to myself they were fighting the last round but one; both men appeared then as fresh as they were at the first round, and at the last round they both fought manfully; they were both exhausted, but I don't consider it was by fighting; it was more by the pressure of the crowd - Murphy hit Thompson on the front of his head and caused a fall, but I don't think it was such a blow as would cause a fall, it was more by exhaustion; the fight ended there, for he fell back at that time on a turf of grass which was rather rising - Thompson was senseless after falling on that turf; but I examined the turf afterwards, and there was no stone in it; but it was on a rising a little more than the rest of the grass - he gave a sort of wrench of his neck, and was then senseless - I moved him out of the ring with the seconds, who placed him on their knees, and Thomas Ready came forwards to render every assistance immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What are you, a carman? A. Yes; I have changed my business since I was here last; I did not tell you then I was a costermonger; I drive my own cart - I went to the fight, and took fourteen persons with me - I went to carry people there who employed me to take them to see the fight - I was there casually; I did not go there to see the fight; I was hired to go there; I went for my living - I cannot say that I feel no pleasure in such things; I went there to earn my living - I cannot say how many prize-fights I have attended in the last two years; I will swear I have not attended three.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what you call prize-fights? A. I have not been to three prize-fights; I have not been to any fights at all in particular - I might have seen two fights, but I have not seen three - I swear I have not been to more than three fights of any kind for the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many rounds were fought in the battle altogether? A. I don't know; I did not take particular notice - I don't know how long the fight lasted; I do not know whether it lasted one or two hours - I have never been charged with the commission of any offence; I was never in my life charged with stealing dead bodies, nor ever accused of it, nor anything else - I saw the last two rounds fought; he appeared as fresh then as before - there was a good deal of crowding towards the persons fighting; I saw a number of people break into the ring with sticks in their hands - I saw no sticks used; I saw no blows struck, no further than I received myself, and I did not see who it was - I received the blow with a stick, and was dreadfully kicked; that is what I call foul play - I saw nothing on the part of the seconds except trying to keep the ring clear; endeavouring to keep them from interrupting the fight - the men who broke in the ring, were all huddled together; that is, in as close a compass as we are here; and there was a good deal of confusion during the last round - blows might have been struck at the last round with the sticks without my seeing it - both of them appeared quite fresh, but he was exhausted by the pressure of the crowd about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Being fresh in the last round, did it not appear to you that his insensibility was caused by something which happened to him suddenly in the last round? A. It might not have happened in the last round, but he never spoke afterwards - his antagonist struck him a faint blow - it was not sufficient to knock him down - I consider that something had struck him before he received that blow - the blow was not sufficient to knock him down, nor was there any stone in the grass - I consider he must have received a blow from a stick before the faint blow which knocked him down.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. You did not see any blows struck with a stick? A. I did not.</p>

            . I am a farrier, and live at No. 62, Market-street, Paddington. I was present at the fight at Whetstone - the prisoner was there - Thompson and Murphy were fighting - I did not interfere in the fight - I saw the prisoner Murphy acting as second to his brother Michael - the fight was not a fair one - the mob broke the ring - Thompson seemed the strongest man - a great many of the mob had sticks - I was near enough to the ring to see what was going forwards - I do not know how many rounds were fought - at the last round but one the men appeared in fighting condition - they did so in the last round - the deceased was kicked in the last round by Mulany, in the groin - I saw a blow struck in the back of his head; in the second round there was a bit of a scrummage up at the right hand corner - the ring was not broken in then but there was a bit of a scrummage - it was the second round after the fight began that Mulany struck him with a blackthorn stick - Mulany was taken and tried for this and acquitted; I saw the deceased fall at the last round - I believe, it was the kick that was the cause of that fall, as far as I can describe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. He fell from the kick did he? A. No; he fell from the throw and was kicked afterwards - it was not very much of a throw - I did not hear Tomkin's evidence - he fell through the throw - Murphy threw him - it was not from a blow -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280041"/>I am quite sure he did not fall from a blow - it was a throw, for they were both down together - nobody could have mistaken that for a blow - I was one of the casual spectators - I went down there - the seconds, as far as I saw, conducted the fight fairly - the mob outside broke in - I did not go among the seconds - a good many of the mob had sticks, and broke in at the last round and created confusion - they used the sticks in the last round; the seconds and men fighting had no means of resisting the mob - some of the people were taller than me - I could not see over people's heads - I was about the middle, in the thick of the mob - I had no stick - the greater part of them had blackthorn sticks - in the last round they broke into the ring and used the sticks - I did not see the deceased hit - I was close against him when he fell, as they were all wrestling about - I saw him kicked after he was down, by Mulany - that was after he was down the last time; Mulany had a stick in his hand when he kicked him, and was near enough to strike him with the stick - it was not possible to resist this influx of persons without; who rushed in with sticks; if it had not been for that, the fight was conducted fairly; except what Mulany did.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Notwithstanding the ring being broken in, did not Thompson and Murphy continue striking each other blows? A. Yes; until the last round -

            . I am constable of North-end, Finchley. I was present at the fight at Whetstone, on the 9th of July - the first six or seven rounds which I saw, I thought to be as fair a fight as I ever saw; after that I saw the rounds all fought in the right hand corner; and I saw parties with their sticks flourishing; but (I being a lone officer there) I dare not interfere and did not go on that side of the way, as I saw there was danger, and I had nobody to take my part; but I saw no blows struck myself, because I dare not go nearer to see it - I had heard a fight was to take place and went.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Your attention was directed to the first six or seven rounds? A. After I got there; I was fetched there, and had my staff and handcuffs in my pocket - I looked at the fight the same as the spectators - I saw nobody strike one of the men in the second round - I was looking on - I considered the first six or seven rounds fair - I did not see anybody strike one of the men on the back of the head; there were so many sticks and the ring was broken in - the men with sticks were all round them; but I kept as near the outside the ring as I could; for I saw things unpleasant to myself; and pickpockets about; but I dare not go nearer, when I saw the sticks in the air I could not see the fighting men.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, I knew my brother was going to fight; I immediately went to him, and told him not to fight but mind his work; he said Thompson had repeatedly insulted him, and challenged him, and he was determined to see who was the best man; I then left him and never saw him till the day of the fight at Whetstone; and when I got there the ring was formed; and I endeavoured to persuade him again, but he answered me as before; about the middle of the fight, Thompson's second, crossed the ring and tried to throw the man down; I accused him of it and he abused me; I went away, and at the latter and of the fight, I saw them both fall down, and Thompson's head fell against the ground; I went and endeavoured to recover Thompson by throwing water in his face; I got brandy, and asked the seconds if they would give him that, and they said they had some; I left him and went to Finchley where my brother was gone; I looked in at the doctor's shop at Whetstone; the shop was full of people; I asked the doctor how he was, he said he was a good deal better, but he must have air; I requested the people to leave the shop and come out with me, and saw no more of him.</p>

             were the principals - I was one of Murphy's seconds; the prisoner did not second him - he never had any active part at all in it - I was tried for this offence, and convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to two months imprisonment - Ray and Berwick were the seconds to Thompson; I do not know the name of Murphy's other second - I attended on Murphy as my principal through the fight; the prisoner never troubled himself at all - the prisoner never made use of the expression, "You shall fight, you b - r; you can fight two such fellows," or language of that sort.</p>
               <p>A. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner endeavoured to dissuade his brother from fighting? A. He never troubled himself, but he was in the ring, and hustled about with the others - I do not know whether he endeavoured to dissuade his brother from fighting; he took no part whatever in the fight, except being in the ring while it was going on - it was a fair fight as far as the combatants and seconds were concerned; but the ring was broken in nineteen times out of twenty by the mob, and some of the persons used sticks to keep the people back; they kept the ring; they beat them back with the sticks to keep the ring clear - some of the mob outside had sticks; they used them to break the ring - it was not possible to keep off the mob.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Do you know Tomkins? A. I have seen him; I did not see Tomkins knocked down; if he had been knocked down I might not have seen it; it was impossible; the ring was so confused with Thompson's party, and likewise Murphy's - the spectators broke in at all parts; the ring not being a ropering, it was impossible for me to see if he was knocked down, because I was attending on my man - the mob broke in about the seventh round, to my best recollection - Murphy was the best man up to that time; Murphy did not express any willingness to cease from fighting; I swear that, being his second, I must know if Murphy said he wanted to give in; I consider I must have known it as his second - Murphy never wished to give in.</p>

            . I am a lamp-lighter at Hampstead. I know the prisoners, they live at Hampstead - I remember seeing them last Saturday week, in Heath-street, Hampstead, at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night; they were going towards Hampstead-heath - I was running - I was not running to light the lamps - they were walking - I remember turning Mr. Watson's corner - they were walking one before the other; Willoughby walked first - he had a basket on his head; Shurety walked next - he had a basket on his head or shoulder; Cannon was the last - he had nothing on his head - after passing Cannon I kicked against a lanthorn; I called out to Shurety, "You have dropped your lanthorn, Jack;" he made me no answer - neither of the others spoke; Cannon appeared tipsy; I picked up the lanthorn - I saw an old lady lying down in the road; I picked up the lanthorn, and the old lady said, "Pray do not kick my lanthorn, sir, look how ill they have used me;" I put the lanthorn by the side of the old lady on the pavement - I went on; when I passed the prisoners they were laughing; I believe it was Shurety and Cannon - when I picked up the lanthorn they had turned the corner, and must have been twenty yards from the old lady when I saw her - I did not speak to her at first; she spoke to me when I kicked the lanthorn; the prisoners were about twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which way were you coming, down the hill, or going up? A. Down the hill, in the High-street; it was a dark night; I did not take particular notice - I know Mr. Pilcher's gin-shop, one or two houses there stand back; the road does not turn to the right till after you pass Pilcher's - I was not many steps from Pilcher's when I saw Willoughby, I was very near it - Willoughby was the foremost of the three men- I was close to him - as I turned the corner, he turned the corner; he came close to me; as I turned they turned; I was coming down from the hill and met them - there is a place called Brewhouse-lane - Willoughby lives at the bottom of Brewhouse-lane - the turning he took would lead him to his own house - I had no conversation with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know Willoughby's person at all when you went to his house? A. No; I asked if his name was Willoughby; he said "Yes" - I had not my uniform on; I had my great coat; he could not tell I was an officer by my appearance, but I have no doubt he knew me - I have been at Hampstead about thirteen months; I have met him coming from the market of a morning; I have no doubt he knew me as an officer - his words were, "Cannon did it," to the best of my belief - those were his words - on our way to the station-house he told me the order in which they walked home, and he said, "Cannon was the last" - there had been a great deal of talk at Hampstead about this; I took him in consequence of information I received that night - I had seen the lamplighter before I apprehended them - I saw him about a quarter after nine o'clock on Wednesday night - he mentioned Cannon's name to me - I believe he lives at Hampstead - he might have talked to anybody else about Cannon before that, about Hampstead - whether what Willoughby said about Cannon was what he had heard I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am a police-officer. On Wednesday night the 20th of November, I went to the Nag's Head, public house, with Aggs, and apprehended Cannon and Shurety; I took charge of Shurety and took him to the watch-house; he asked me going along if I knew what charge I had against them; I told him to wait till he got to the station-house, when the inspector would tell him; he said, "Very well, I admit you have only done your duty - and would have done so had you have taken us in the fact;" he then said, "I know what it is about, it is for Saturday night's spree;" nothing more passed, till he got to the station-house; I then went with Aggs to Willoughby's house, brought him to the station-house, and as soon as he came there, Shurety said, "Willoughby, (Cannon was present) we must admit we saw the old woman knocked down by some man who ran down the hill, but who that man was, we don't know." Willoughby shook his head and said he saw no man passing at the time; Shurety, a short time after at the station-house, made use of some expression, but what it was I don't know; Cannon, in answer to him, said,"Hold your tongue, you fool, you will convict yourself;" Cannon was present the whole time at the station-house, and heard what Shurety said to Willoughby; when Cannon said this to Shurety, he made no reply.</p>

            . Q. How near to Brewhouse-lane were you in Heath-street, when it happened; were you above it, nearer to the heath, or nearer to the town? A. Nearer to the town, below brewhouse-lane, between the corner of the lane, in Mr. Cunningham's the butcher's shop; I am quite sure the first man whom I met, passed without interfering with me.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence.

               <p>Shurety's Defence. I was out that night helping Cannon to sell his fish, which he had left in the day-time, and coming home, I asked Willoughby, "Shall I carry some of your things home;" he went by Mr. Cunningham's, the butcher's; I had got my basket weighing sixty or eighty pounds - I had it on my head - I could hardly see, it was very heavy; and when we came past the fields, I heard a young man run by; I went home - I left my basket at Willoughby's; I went home and went to bed, and the inspector came to the Nag's Head, and took us to the station-house; Mrs. Cutter was fetched, and said she had found her pocket, and a halfpenny was left in it - that she went to a butcher's shop, where she missed her money.</p>
               <p>Willoughby's Defence. As I was returning home on evening, coming from Cunningham's with a basket on my head, these two young men were there with things, and I asked this man to give me a lift on the head with my basket. Shurety said, "Shall I carry one of your baskets, Tom?" I said, "No; I would much rather you would not, leave it alone;" and I went up Heath-street, and saw Mrs. Cutter, and said, "Here is poor old Mrs. Cutter;" I passed on; Cannon was behind; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280044"/>home, and came back to Cunningham's again, and had another basket left there; I bought a bit of meat there, and I took it home on my head, and never saw any more of Cannon or Shurety, not till Monday, when I saw Shurety standing at the corner of Flask-walk - I never spoke to him.</p>

I am shopman to Mr. Cunningham, a butcher, at Hampstead; I have been there many years; in front of our shop on a Saturday night, there is a sort of market held, as late as half-past eleven or twelve o'clock; I remember the night the old lady was knocked down - I remember seeing Willoughby standing at the front of our door, in the sale way - he had two baskets; I saw him leave - I helped his baskets on his head - he crossed the road up Heath-street; I helped him up with two baskets - he took both baskets on his head; I saw nobody with him; sometimes Shurety and Cannon stand there to sell vegetables; half-past twelve o'clock is about the time this little market breaks up; I did not see Willoughby again that night; I sold him some meat that night; he took it with him in his basket - he took it the second time - I don't know at what time he went the first time; I suppose he might be gone about ten minutes; he bargained with me for the meat and then went away; I have known him ever since he was a boy - he has maintained the character of a very honest man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are we to understand you helped him up with a second load of baskets? A. The two last baskets I helped him with; I did not help him with the first - the meat was in the last basket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been with them now nearly twenty-four years. I conducted myself with propriety when apprenticed, and nearly up to the present time; but alterations in the firm were very disagreeable to me and to all of us, by a person formerly working for them being now brought in as a partner. I conducted myself with propriety, more to my injury than my own profit; and by the last partner coming in, who is a cunning, artful, deceitful man, both to the master and men, I believe to get the whole business into his own hands, he acts all manner of deceit and deception imaginary to all of us; he is always insulting me and the whole of the firm altogether. He has brought in three apprentices, and before my master had but two; I had been earning from 2l. 10s. to 3l. a week, which my own master promised me as long as I continued faithful to him, and that he would give me constant employment to make us a comfortable livelihood; but the last partner bringing in two parish apprentices, he wished to get rid of all the old hands; and by so doing it has made me do the present act, which I am very sorry for. I hope you will consider my long servitude, and the manner I have acted towards my master and shopmates; I have done the greatest kindness towards them, and to my own injury; and my mind was so worked up, I certainly did sell it, but never spent a farthing of the money; master received 4l. of it, and the other pound I lost.</p>
               <p>MATTHEW ATHERLY. The prisoner has been our apprentice and journeyman for twenty years; I don't wish to say anything about his conduct latterly, but I protest against his injuring my partner; who, having been apprenticed to us, and afterwards a journeyman, his good conduct enabled us to take him into parnership - the prisoner within the last three years and seven months has received 547l. - he has not earned less than 2l. a-week for the last six months - I paid him 88l. from January to October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to LAMBERT. Q. How long have you known me? A. About twenty years; I never knew him dishonest, except in a similar act to this, which was looked over.</p>

No; it was out of a pawn in the beginning of September; I cannot tell who I pawned it with - it is in Hatton-wall; I never took it to any pawnbroker's but that one; I will not swear I have not pawned it fifty times.</p>

No, Sir; I said that was him; I did not say he had a flannel jacket on - I said so on the second examination; I had spoken to the officer between the two examination; I said he had a mark on his face; the magistrate told me to look in his face, and I saw the mark down his right cheek; I did not say he looked like a monkey; it was the other boy said that; I forgot that the prisoner had a flannel jacket on, when I was first before the magistrate; I heard the other persons say he had a flannel jacket on, and I said so the second time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt about who the man was, who took the basket out of the cart? A. It was the prisoner; I know him by the bump on his back - I saw the bump when he was running - I saw his face too, and saw the cut on it; I am sure he had a bump on his back; I did not forget it when I was before the justice, but he did not ask me about it, if he had, I should have told him; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>BERNARD FARRELLY. On the 17th of September, I found myself in <placeName id="t18331128-63-crimeloc370">Glass-house-yard, Rosemary-lane</placeName>

I had my coat off, and my back upon a bed, and the prisoner was strangling me; it was before day-light - she was choking me with both her hands, and cut me very severely - when I took hold of one of her hands, she scratched me with the other, and bit a piece out of my nose - I had been, on the 16th of September, to the Borough, and I had a pocket-book and some memorandums in it, and a £10 bank-note - I saw it safe before I went to Rosemary-lane, at six or seven o'clock, and then they involved me to give them some drink - we did not go into any public-house; they had liquor in this private house - they fetched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by they? A. There was another female with the prisoner, but she is the only person I can swear to, as being the person who robbed me, and nearly choked me - I had some liquor in the room down stairs; I did not go up stairs; I was the worse for liquor - I took off my coat, the pocket-book was in the breast pocket of the coat; when I awoke in the morning the pocket-book was gone - when the prisoner was mangling me, I suppose she meant to Burke me - I did not know the number of the note till I went to the cashier's - the book has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR, DOANE. Q. Where do you live? A. In Kent. I came to Rosemary-lane to see a friend named Timmings; I knew him and his wife, they live handy to Rosemary-lane - I had not known the prisoner before; I do not know Mrs. Reed - I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280051"/>received any rent that day - the prisoner asked me to go in, and give her some drink, and I did; there was another female there; I cannot tell the time; it was before dark; I treated them to beer and gin - I took some other persons up who were discharged; the prisoner was discharged, and I had her taken again - I do not know how long I was drinking - I had seen the pocket-book and note that evening, and to make a long story short, here is the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went in, I suppose, sober? A. Not quite sober - I do not know the other person who was there - I had eight or nine sovereigns in a small pocketbook, in another pocket in my coat, and two handkerchiefs over them - I did not lose any of them.</p>

On the morning of the 17th I was called by a boy, about five o'clock - I found the prosecutor, the prisoner was in her room; he was outside the room, all over blood; he gave me charge of her; he missed his pocket-book, when he got his coat on - I searched the house, and found a handkerchief which he said was his, in a jacket pocket, which laid on the floor, in a room up-stairs, where there were two persons in bed - I afterwards traced this note from the Bank.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live at Langley. On the 19th of October, the prisoner offered me one pound of gunpowder in a canister - he asked me 1s. 6d. for it - I said, I was not in want of it; I had plenty - he said, he had three dozen canisters, which he had bought at a gentleman's sale in London, and I could have what quantity I liked - he came again on the Saturday in the next week, and brought nine other canisters, and some salt herrings, which I had ordered of him - I delivered the canisters of gunpowder to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it an unusual thing in a small town, for different tradesmen to deal in gunpowder? A. No; I believe the prisoner is a fishmonger - I did not think 1s. 6d. a pound a suspicious price for this; it was more than I was giving - I did not buy it; it was left for me to prove it.</p>

            . On the 21st of October, I saw the prisoner; he told me, he had got something that would suit me; I asked what it was; he said, a canister of powder which a man had let him have for riding in his cart, and he could let me have it cheap; he asked 1s. 6d. for it - I said, I did not want it, as my master found me in powder and shot, but if he would take 1s. for it, I would have it; he said, if I would stand a pint of beer, I should have it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In whose employ were you last? Mr. Gilbert, a grocer to work in his garden - I was ostler at the George - I should have been thatching with a farmer's man, if I had not been here to-day - no money passed between the prisoner and me; he said, the gunpowder was worth 1s. 6d. a pound - I was to get what I could for it.</p>

Yes, on the 25th of October - I told him on what charge - I went several days afterwards in search of a person named Littleboy - he was taken by an officer, and escaped from him - he went through some deep water, and the officer did not follow him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner direct you to any house in London, where he had bought three dozen at a sale? A. No - he said he had this one cannister of a boatman, and the other of Littleboy.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The female witness swore at the examination, that she saw me break open the box, and steal the half-pence, amounting to 7s. 6d. I ask you, my Lord, why she did not have me secured by the sentry, who was close by; for she must have had great opportunity of doing so, as it must have occupied me a little time in gathering them up. I was not apprehended till one hour after, and then there was not a single thing found on me, to criminate me.</p>

             (police-constable, 62 T.) About seven o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of October, I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road; the two prisoners passed me by the Coach and Horses - they had each a bundle in their hands; I told Wild I wished to know what his bundle contained  - he said, lace and stockings, and I was very welcome to look; I looked and it contained net caps, and stockings, with some pieces of pasteboard and part of a bonnet box broken up; I asked him where he brought them from - he said from Witney - I said that was not a place for buying such things, and I took him to the station-house; I asked him how many there were - he said when he bought them he had twelve caps, but he had sold three or four of them - they were counted and there were twelve of them; I then asked how many stockings there were - he said he had had twelve pairs but he had sold two or three pairs, and he had sold one pair that day for 8d. - I counted them and found ten pairs of worsted stockings, and one pair of cotton; I then asked Gardner the price of the net - she said she knew nothing of the price as he had bought every thing; I then asked Wild the price, he said "I gave 6d. a yard for it and I have sold it for 7d., 8d., or what I could get;" I said I should detain them for having goods and not giving a satisfactory account of them; we were about to lock them up when Gardner turned round and said,"I hope you will not have me locked up as I only met him a little while previous to meeting you, and he asked me to carry one bundle which I did" - Wild said "Mary how can you say such a thing? you are not only convicting me but yourself, though my punishment may be greater than yours; but as you have said a little I will say a little;" he then said he had met with her about twelve o'clock that day, in St. Giles's, and she said "It is a pity we have not got more money," and he said "I have got 6d. - let us go and have some alamode," and they went and had some; and then came out and took a walk, and between Shepherd's-bush and Acton, they met a hawker, who was very much intoxicated, and he asked him to take hold of his arm, and he asked Gardner to take the hawker's bundle; he said "She walked on towards London, and I kept hold of the man till I got to the dead wall and there I left him, and joined Gardner;" he also said he had been tried and convicted, about two years ago, and sentenced to death, but he was a man of very good education and by his address, he had got off with six months imprisonment; but he told the governor he could not go to hard labour, and he was put to solitary confinement and to live on bread and water - he was quite sober.</p>

               <p>Wild's Defence. I was proceeding from London and overtook the man on the road; this woman was with me but she was a stranger; the man was tipsy and he asked me take his arm; he said, "Is that woman your wife?" I said yes; he said to her "My good woman carry this; I am so ill; I am broken hearted; I shall never get home;" he began to cry; and he gave her the bundle; when we got to Acton, he said, "Where is your wife?" I said "She is coming behind;" we went to the George, and he called for a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco for me, and then he laid his head down and went to sleep; he gave the things to the woman; I did not take them from him.</p>
               <p>Gardner's Defence written. On Tuesday, the 29th of October last, being out of a situation and wishing to get employwent as a servant of all work, in a public-house, I went to Mr. Wright's register-office, in Hatton-garden and I received the names of several public-houses at the west-end of the town, who were in want of servants. On my return towards home in the evening, I was accosted by the other prisoner, with two bundles under his arm, and to whom I was a perfect stranger, he asked me which way I was going; after some hesitation I stated I was going to my lodgings in the neighbourhood of Milton-street, upon which he said "I have just left my situation and am going into Holborn," and he would be glad if I would assist him in carrying one of his bundles, which he said contained his clothes, as far as I went, which request I foolishly complied with.</p>

The circumstances of the case are as follow: - I was sent by the prosecutor to his brother for a letter; I received the letter, with its enclosure (then unknown to me) the cheque; I was accompanied by a young man named Price; when I got the letter Price prevailed on me to accompany him to a public-house, which I to my sorrow did; we went into two or three - while in one of them, I pulled my handkerchief out of my pocket, and with it the letter, which fell on the ground; Price stooped to pick up the same, and did so with the seal broken - Price said he must have trodden on the seal, as it was broken; he then opened the letter and kept it, with the cheque in it; it is here necessary for me to admit that from what I had drank, I had become intoxicated, and was not conscious of what I was doing - while I was in the public-house, Murray, the witness on my behalf, came in, and he will detail what transpired. I, together with Price and Murray, afterwards left the public-house, and we took a cabriolet and drove to Serjeant's-inn, Fleet-street - Price then said, he must go to chambers, and say he should not be there again that evening; I and Murray walked into the Temple to wait for Price - Price joined Murray and myself, and we all went to mine and Price's lodgings, in Moor-place, Lambeth, to dinner; and I have no doubt that it must have been when Price left, as he stated, to go to his chambers, that he went to the bankers in Fleet-street, and got the money for the cheque; as I have since learned that Price had not been in employment at Serjeant's-inn for several weeks before that day. The witness, Finnis will state to you, that I was quite drunk when I came home and did not in consequence eat any dinner, but went to bed, and remained there till nine o'clock - the same witness will also prove that Price was indebted to him for seven week's lodging, and was not able to pay the same and yet immediately; after this cheque was stolen by him, he was enabled to raise sufficient money to pay his passage to New York.</p>

             (police-constable R 140). I took the prisoner on the 7th of November - I charged him with vagrancy, as he was sitting about the doors - we found at the station-house that there was an information against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280055"/>him respecting this robbery; I told him of it; he made no answer, but the next morning, when he was taken before the magistrates at Greenwich, the magistrate asked Mr. Thomas how the prisoner effected the robbery; he said, he believed he broke open a lock - the prisoner said, if he said he broke open a lock, he told a lie, for the lock was open.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. How long was it after this, before any man was brought back to you? A. I never lost sight of him till he was stopped and brought back to me - I admit I never saw his face, but I never lost sight of his back - I did not say I could not speak positively to him, and decline to give charge of him- I don't know Murrell by name - I mean to swear solemnly, that I never expressed any doubt as to this being the man who was concerned in robbing me; I went to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you not decline, even at the watch-house, to swear to this man for some considerable time? A. No; I always said that was the man - I did not see his face; he was in the act of running as he pulled me round - I cannot tell how far he ran; he was not out of my sight; it might be twice the length of this court; it was light - I saw him clearly - I never said, that as I had not seen his face, I did not like to swear to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not an officer who had him in custody? A. No man had him till I took him - there was a man who said he had heard a noise and ran, but I had the prisoner before that - there was a gentleman came up and said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to meet Mr. Sadgrove: in crossing Fore-street I saw this gentleman crying, "Stop thief;" a constable came up and said,"Are you running from the cry?" I said, "No;" he said, "It is not him;" but I was taken to the watch-house; Mr. Hartshorne then came in, but did not swear to me; he was taken out by Lewen, and then he came in and booked the charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARTSHORNE. We went out to see for the watch.</p>
               <p>- MURRELL. I am a patrol of Cripplegate. I was on duty on the spot, and was present when the prisoner was first taken - the prosecutor came up and said, he could not positively say whether he was the person; I asked him twice, and he took me to the spot where the robbery took place; and according to the situation, I consider he must have lost sight of him while he turned the corner - the prosecutor said, he could not positively say he was the man, but he was running at the time - I remained about a quarter of an hour there; the prosecutor did not express any more doubt, but he said he could not positively say he was the man; he did not express any other opinion while I staid - I went away on my duty, considering it was a case that would fall to the ground - I took the prisoner in charge in the street; he pulled off his coat, wished to be searched, and said he was innocent; I went with him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been a patrol? A. I was appointed on the 31st of August; I was a watchman before - the prisoner pulled off his coat himself - there was no watch found on him - I know he had been running; the corner he turned was in London-wall; I was not there, but the prosecutor said he turned it - I consider if the prosecutor says he never lost sight of him, he must be wrong; the prisoner was taken about fifty yards round the corner - I have not known innocent men run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say upon your oath, that you collected from the prosecutor's conversation, that the prisoner was not the man, or one of the men? A. He could not be positive - he did not say he was the man, and give charge of him in my presence; I left him there; he said he believed the prisoner to be the man, but he would not be positive; he said he had not seen his face, but he had seen his back; I did not hear him say he had never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in the Commercial-road. I produce two pieces of cotton; one of them I took in from the prisoner Parker, and I have no doubt the other was pawned by her - I knew her by frequenting the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When was the one piece pawned by her? A. On the 15th of October; the prosecutor came to see if he could find any of his property in our stock; I don't think he put a mark on this piece the first time he came, but I believe he did the second; either he or his foreman came again; the first time they came, he examined this piece, and found some private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not mark it the second time? A. I think he did; I believe he took the measure the first time, to see what length it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do I understand you to say, that the prosecutor put a mark on this remnant the second time he came to the shop? A. I believe he did - I will not swear he did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you swear whether he did or not? A. I do not remember.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutor; I went to the pawnbroker's, and on looking at the goods by candle-light, I thought I discovered marks on this piece, but I was not certain; I could see a mark on this other - I know them to be my master's, from my own marks being on them; they had been taken from the pile in the warehouse - Parry was employed as porter to pack up and to carry out goods occasionally.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When had you seen this brown remnant last? A. It might be three months; I cannot tell what hands it had gone through after that; I will not swear when I had seen it in the warehouse - I first saw this piece at the pawnbroker's on the 26th of October - I did not quite identify it then, from seeing the marks by candle-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you so recognise it then, that you would presume to swear to it? A. I did; I went a second time, because I had seen it first by candle-light, and I could not distinctly make out one of the marks; I said I saw a mark immediately, and I recognised it faintly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to me most positively, that the first time you examined this, you recognized it to be your master's; and did I not ask you why you went a second time, if you could recognise it the first? A. I went five times to satisfy myself; I saw marks faintly, but being by candle-light, I was not certain.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge at my house; I had a leather trunk and a deal box in the room he slept in - they were both locked - on the 11th of October, I put into them the linen stated in the indictment, and locked the trunk and the box - the prisoner staid until the 18th, when I went into his room and examined the trunk and box - the trunk was broken open, and four pair of sheets, two bolster cases, three table-cloths, and a handkerchief taken - the prisoner did not come home that night - he came in the next morning, and I gave him the key of the room as usual; he went to the room, and while he was there, I got a policeman - while he was in the room he removed two more table cloths from the trunk - I came up with the policeman, and found the table-cloths outside the trunk, and on examining the deal box that was broken open, that had not been broken open the day before, some tea and sugar was taken from that box - the tea and sugar and table-cloths are here - nobody could have broken open the box but him; nobody else had been in the room - these articles are mine - I am the wife of

               <p>LADY WINTERTON. On the 22th of October, I was at Brighton, and had occasion to make a remittance to Miss Cowles in London; (looking at a letter) I wrote this letter, and inclosed in it three sovereigns - I wrapped them up in a very little bit of silver paper, and pinned the paper to the letter - I sealed the letter after enclosing the sovereigns in it - I was in a very great hurry about it - I sealed it, and think I came into the room again to look at it - I placed this little spot of wax, I know, underneath it, to keep it, and the wax is still there not broken - I gave it to the footman to give to the coachman; the letter now appears to be directed to No. 11, Manchester-street; I put No. 1, on it - I think the I must have been altered to 11 since I sent it to the Post-office; I think I directed it to No. 1 - I saw the letter at Bow-street some time ago, and three sovereigns were then in it - I cannot swear the letter was not in the same condition when I saw it at Bow-street as when I sent it to the post - I cannot swear the seal was not in the same state at Bow-street, as when I sent it to the Post-office; it had not been opened; it was opened at the office; I saw it before it was opened; it was handed to me before it was opened; it appeared rather different to what it was when it left me, because it had been tossed about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the seal look as if it had remained untouched or unbroken? A. I cannot swear one way or the other; when it was opened there, three sovereigns were in it - I cannot swear whether they were the three sovereigns I sent - the piece of silver paper was not in it; it might have dropped out - I saw the letter opened at the office; when it was opened I did not see the silver paper in it - I pinned it when I put it into the letter; I had wrapped the sovereigns in the silver paper, and pinned the silver paper to the letter - Miss Cowles, to whom I directed the letter, at that time lived at No. 1.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. I believe your ladyship has said, the sovereigns in the letter at Bow-street were not other sovereigns than those you put in the letter? A. I cannot say whether they were or not; I was in a great hurry when I put them into the letter, and put them in a very small piece of silver paper; I do not think it was as large as the palm of my hand; it was half as large; it was single paper, very thin - I was in a hurry at the time I pinned the paper to the letter; I think I pinned it to the letter; I cannot swear whether I did it so, as to prevent it falling out of the letter - I did not seal the ends of the letter - if I had addressed the letter without any money in it at all, I think it would have been exactly in the same state - I do not see any pin-holes in the letter - I will undertake to say I put a pin in the silver paper; I can only speak to the best of my recollection - I thought I pinned it - I have carefully examined the letter; I do not see a pin-hole - I sealed the letter with the same seal that is here; this is the identical impression of the seal I used; it has a plough on it; it is not my common seal, but it is the seal I sealed the letter with; I have no doubt but this is the identical impression I made on the seal of the letter - the words on the seal are "Speed the -" I stated at the office that I sealed the letter with black wax, but I said as I did not write in my own name, that I might have taken the red wax instead of the black - I am in mourning, and in the habit of using black wax, and I have no doubt I have used black wax, as it has my seal, and I use paper with a black edge - I put No. I on the letter - I was in a great hurry at the time I wrote the direction - I was in as great a hurry when I thought I pinned the silver paper to the letter - I conclude I was in a greater hurry when I wrote the address - I think I did not put two one's on the outside of the letter; any thing is possible - to the best of my recollection I only put one; I can only swear according to my recollection; I am almost sure I did not put two ones, to my recollection I only put one. I admit it might be possible - I gave it to the footman, and directed him to give it to the coach-man, who was to put it into the post-office.</p>

               <p>Q. I beg to ask whether you can swear, looking at the letter, which of those one's is your ladyship's? A. It appears to me that is the one next to the M - there is no material difference between that and the other - when I gave the letter to the footman, I desired him to tell the coachman it was a money-letter, and he must take care of it - the letter was in a very dirty condition and unopened when I saw it at Bow-street; I cannot swear that it was in a different condition to what it was when I gave it to the footman at Brighton; it was not so clean as when it was out of my hands, at the time it was sealed- the silver paper might have dropped out - it was plain the sovereigns had not dropped out, for they were in the letter when I saw it at Bow-street - the three sovereigns certainly might have dropped out accidentally.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You put the three sovereigns into a bit of silver paper? A. I did; that silver paper entirely covered the sovereigns, and formed an envelope for them, but it was very thin - I put the sovereigns and paper inside the letter, enclosed them in the front of the letter where the writing was, and turned up the ends afterwards- I directed the letter to Miss Louisa Cowles, No. 1, Manchester-street - I had no intention at all of sending to No.11 - this place was not cut when I first saw the letter at Bow-street; it was cut there - I did not perceive any silver paper or pin when I saw the letter at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not examined at the police-office? A. No; I was not there - I was not called on for some time after the letter was given into my hands to tell anybody about the state of the letter - I do not know how long ago it is - the examination at Bow-street, took place last week - I was not called on, except her ladyship asking me if I gave it to the coachman - I should think that is nearly a month ago - I told her I gave it to the coachman - I cannot say whether she asked me whether there was only one figure of 1 on it - the letter was sent on the 22nd of October and a few days after that, she asked me whether I took it to the post, or gave it to the coachman - I do not think she asked me any questions about the outside of the letter - I cannot say whether I have told anybody before to day, what I have said about the outside of the letter - I did not observe when I took the letter, whether there was anything in it or not - Lady Winterton told me it was a money letter - I know there was only one I on it, because I looked at the address - I did not examine it, only the address - I did not examine it at all; I only looked at it and saw what the address was - I looked at it carefully enough to see what the address was - I looked at it carefully enough to swear there was only one I on it, and not two, I am positive - I think I gave it to the coachman immediately that I brought it down from her ladyship, but I cannot swear that positively.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the letter out of your possession from the time you received it, till you gave it to the coachman? A. No; I gave it to him in exactly the same state as I received it fromher - I should have gone to Bow-street, if her ladyship, or the solicitor desired me.</p>

            . I am coachman to Lady Winterton and was so on the 22nd of October - on that day I received a letter from Court to take to the post - I think it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening - I took it to the post-office directly, and put it into the letter box - I read the address on the letter - (looking at it) this is the letter - it was directed to No. 1; this is No. 11; there was only one 1 on it I am quite sure - it felt as if money was in the letter - I did not hear any gingle - if there was money in it, it was not loose - I put it into the office in the same state as I received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the footman say to you? A. He told me to take it to the post-office, and take care of it for there was money in it - I do not know the exact time the post goes out - I believe the box closes at nine o'clock - I took it to the post office directly - her ladyship's house is within a quarter of a mile of the post-office - I was not employed doing anything at the time the footman gave it to me - I supposed by the weight of the letter there was as much as two or three sovereigns in it - I am at times in the habit of examining my mistress's letters - I did not shake this letter about - I put it to the post office - I had no curiosity to know whether there were two or three sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to tell me which of these figures was on the letter when it came to your hands? A. I believe the first 1; the nearest to the figure 2, to the best of my knowledge - I cannot undertake to swear that - I cannot write very well myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the price of a single letter A. 8d.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. I understand you to say the I nearest the figure 2 (which has been put on at the postoffice,) is the one which was on it when it came into your hands? A. I think so; I cannot see any difference between the two figures.</p>

On the 23rd of October, I was clerk of the money book - a letter put in at Brighton on the 22nd would reach the London post-office the next morning - when money letters arrive at the office they are entered in a book - I have that book here - I find on the 23rd of October, an entry of a money letter, in my own hand writing, "Brighton - Cowles, 1, Manchester-street" - we number each letter as we enter them in a book - I have entered this letter No, 7 - this letter bears the same address that I copied except being now No. 11 - it is the letter I copied into the book - I should think it was not No. 11 then - I do not think it probable, that I should put I so clearly as this is, for 11, but I cannot swear it - there was no other Brighton letters that morning, with the same address - when we enter an address of this kind we make out a receipt for the letter carrier to take to the person for whom the letter is addressed - those receipts are distributed through the office to the letter carriers - they are sorted as letters - when I copy the address of the letter in the money book, I keep the letter for a certain time, and when the letter carrier brings me a receipt agreeing with the address in my book, I give him the money letter - as soon as he gets the money letter from me, it is his duty to sign the book as an acknowledgment of having received it - it is the letter carrier's duty to come for the letter when he receives the receipt, and on shewing me the receipt I look to see if it corresponds with the letter I am to deliver up; I then give him the letter and he puts his signature in the book as having received it, and I return him back the receipt - he has to take it to the party to whom the letter is addressed, for them to sign as his own security, that they have received the letter - there is the signature to the address of the letter in this book - it is J. Borrett; I should think it is the prisoner's signature but I do not know his hand-writing - the signature under the address, signifies that he has received the money letter corresponding with that address.</p>

             cross-examined. Q. I suppose mistakes sometimes are made in the Post-office? A. Certainly - the postage of a letter sent from Brighton with three sovereigns inclosed is 2s. - we always enter money letters in the book - letters do go sometimes without being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280061"/>entered, but three sovereigns would be too heavy to escape observation - when I entered the letter in the book, to the best of my belief I should say, that the figure one next to Manchester-street was on it - I cannot say that this is the one - I swear according to the best of my belief - I did not examine the letter particularly - I have not much time to examine them, only to know if there is any hard cash in them - I knew there was gold or silver in it - I should say it was three sovereigns - it was very heavy, but I could not tell whether it was two or three - there was some hard cash in the letter, if not it would have been written on it, that there was no cash in it - there was some thing hard - I could not see whether it was sovereigns or shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How many letters may you enter in the course of a morning? A. From fifty to a hundred - I have about an hour and a half to enter them in - hardly that sometimes - this was not a very heavy morning - there were seventy-five letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that that morning, you did not enter number one, instead of number eleven? A. I cannot - I certainly might have made the mistake - I am not infallible - nobody checks the entry - it is examined with the receipt; it is a mere hurried entry of my own - a receipt is written out from the letter, not from the book, and given over to be sorted as letters - the letter carrier keeps the receipt - the letter carriers bring the receipts to me, and they are returned to him to get signed - the receipt is given over to the sorters, to sort as letters, and when the carrier receives the receipt, he brings it to me, and if it corresponds with the receipt he has the letter - the receipt does not come into my hands again - I cannot swear the receipt ever went into the prisoner's hands, as two or three hundred men are there - it is evident the carrier came and here is his receipt for the letter - we sometimes keep a money letter in our hands half an hour, and sometimes twenty minutes before we give it to the carrier - when all the letters are sorted, they come for the letters, and bring the receipts.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. When you parted with the receipt and letter, did you give it to the person who signed the book for it. A. I did, that I am sure of - I copied the entry in the book from the letter, and also the receipt from the letter - if I copied the letter wrong, I did so twice - it is not probable that I should copy it wrong twice; it is possible - my object is to copy them correctly - I have been clerk there about a year and a half - the paper does not indicate it to be a double letter - if a letter weighs a full ounce, the charge is 2s. 8d. - they charge according to the weight, at all events - a large sheet of paper would be equally the same, if it contained any inclosure, if it was weighed - this is charged as a treble letter - they don't weigh them except they exceed an ounce - they judge from the thickness, whether it contains one or two inclosures - this letter of itself would be charged single without the sovereigns - if the money were separate we should be able to know how many pieces of money were in it, but if together, we could not, because some people put so much wax - it would be hap hazard very often - three pieces of money in a letter would be liable to be charged 2s. - if the person at Brighton had told the post-master at Brighton that it contained three pieces of money he would charge 2s. - if it don't weigh an ounce they only charge 2s.</p>

               <p>MR. STAMMERS. Q. Don't they frequently make mistakes at the office in charging letters? A. Certainly.</p>

            . On the 22nd of October, I lived at No. 1, Manchester-Street, with my mother - I expected a remittance of three sovereigns from Lady Winterton at Brighton - I did not receive a letter at that time from her Ladyship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what purpose did you expect the remittance? A. I don't know - it was not in payment of a debt from her to me - I suppose it belonged to me - if it had come to hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear if that money had come to your hands, that it would have belonged to you, and been your property? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Lady Winterton to send the money to you? A. It was on her brother's account; he lives in Regent's-park - if I had received the money, I should have done as I pleased with it; I should have kept it for my own use, to lay out as I pleased - it would have been a present from her brother to me - I did not receive the letter - I have never lived at No. 11, Manchester-street - I don't recollect whether I was at home on the 23rd, when this letter should have arrived; I cannot say whether I was or not; I might have been out - I have lived at No. 1, about four months, and was living there between the 22nd, and 24th of October; I am known there by the name of Louisa Cowles - I have never gone by any other name, nor in any other place; nor was my mother known by any other name.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If you had received the money, should you have to give an account of it to Lady Winterton's brother, or have spent it in what you pleased? A. Spent it in my own pleasure - I did not receive the letter at all.</p>

            ; she lived with me at No. 1, Manchester-street on the 22nd of October, I had lived there about four months in October; I never received any letter by the general-post at that place, directed either to myself or my daughter - I expected Lady Winterton would make a remittance to my daughter or myself; I never received that remittance - I was not at home on the 23rd; I saw the letter at the General Post-office - in consequence of not receiving a remittance, my daughter wrote to Lady Winterton in a few days, and an answer arrived to that letter by a friend - in consequence of what I heard, I spoke to the prisoner as the postman on the beat; I spoke to him on the 31st of October, in the evening when he was going to ring his bell; I asked him if he had ever had a letter addressed to Mrs. Cowles, No. 1, Manchester-street; he said, "No ma'am, I did not know a lady lived there by that name" - he did not say he had a letter directed to that name at No. 11, in that street; he said he would do all in his power to find it for me, and let me know the following morning - when I asked him about it, I said it was a double letter - I saw him the following morning when he was delivering his letters; I accosted him at the door, and said,"Postman, have you found my letter?" he was very much affected, and said, "I am very uneasy about your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280062"/>letter, ma'am - I have signed for your letter, ma'am, and must have had it; and I have mislaid it, ma'am, or given it to a Mr. Hart by mistake"; Mr. Hart is a gentleman living in the same house with me, who was in the habit of having a great many letters every morning -(he had been out of town several days at Brighton) - I said, "Postman, has Mr. Hart got my letter then?" he said, "No, ma'am, he has not; but there is a possibility of such a thing by mistake; as he has so many; there is a possibility of it having been given to him by mistake" - I told him I had written to the General Post-office, which he regretted very much; he said so - I had written after I had seen him the night before - he requested I would have the goodness to write again to Mr. Critchett, and say there was no blame to be attached to him, and he would look for the letter; he said he would look among his papers at home, and look for the letter, and call on me again that evening, or the following morning; I fixed for him to call on the following morning - when he came his round with the letters, he said he was sorry, and would rather look up the money than lose his situation - I said it was a small amount, and I hoped it was not lost; I believe I said it was three sovereigns; we parted then - I waited till eleven o'clock on the following morning, and I heard that he called after I left home - I did not see him at my house that morning; I went to the General Post-office at eleven o'clock and stated my complaint to the solicitor, and the prisoner was brought before me; this was on Saturday, the 2nd of November - inquiry was made of him concerning the letter in my presence - and he pulled the letter out of his pocket instantly, and gave it to the solicitor, Mr. Peacock - he was examined then by Mr. Peacock; the examination was taken down in writing - Mr. Peacock asked him why he kept it so long; he said he had mislaid it; and did not know he had it till then - I believe that was all he said - he said he had offered it at No. 11, and it was refused there - he did not state what sort of a person he offered it to at that moment; I believe that is all that occurred before Mr. Peacock - I was present at Bow-street when Sarah Payne was there, and he said she was the person he had offered it to; I believe this was said in the public office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you lived at No. 1, Manchester-street? A. About four months; and have not received a single letter from the General Post-office while there, nor has my daughter either; I was quite a stranger to the postman, and he was quite a stranger to my name, and to my daughter's name too; he did not know such a person was living there; I was out the day the letter should have come, but when I came home, I inquired if a postman had brought a letter; I was out walking with my daughter that day - I cannot exactly say where we were walking; the letter might have been presented unknown to us - the money was intended for my daughter, but I am in the habit of receiving it for her, because she is under age - she is between fifteen and sixteen; all that is my daughter's I consider my own, because she is under age; if the £3 had come to her hand, she would have delivered it over to me instantly; I was at that time expecting a remittance from Lady Winterton - I did not know whether it would be addressed to my daughter or myself; if it had came to hand, my daughter would instantly have given it up to me; she acts as a child at present; I never lived in Lady Winterton's service, and am no relation to her; the £3 was to be appropriated to educate my daughter with, or do as I liked with; when I inquired of the postman about the letter, I asked if he had a letter directed to Mrs. Cowles, No. 1, Manchester-street; he said, "No, Ma'am; I did not know a lady lived there by that name; but I will do all in my power, Ma'am, to find it for you and let you know to-morrow morning;" he did not deny next morning that he had had the letter - he said he was very uneasy about my letter, that he had signed to it, and must have had it; Mr. Hart had been in the habit of meeting the postman in the street, and taking all the letters he had for himself at that address; Mr. Hart was at Brighton on the day the inquiry was made, and his letters were again directed to him at Brighton; Mr. Hart was in town on the 23rd of October, and would meet the postman that day and take his own letters; he said he had mislaid it or given it to Mr. Hart by mistake; I did not see the prisoner again, till I saw him at the General Post-office; when I first saw him, I accosted him in the street, he did not mention Mr. Hart's name the first time - the second time I saw him, I accosted him at the door, to know if he had found it; he said, "No, I am very uneasy about your letter, I have signed to your letter and must have had it, and have mislaid it or given it to Mr. Hart." I said to him, "Postman, has Mr. Hart got my letter." he said, "No Ma'am, he has not, but there was a possibility of such a thing, he has so many;" when I saw him at the Post-office, he did not hesitate about pulling the letter out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time of day were you at the Post-office? A. I was there about twelve o'clock, having left home about eleven o'clock; he had promised to call on me that morning, but did not do so.</p>
               <p>JAMES AUSTIN. I am an inspector of letter-carriers, at the General Post-office; about the 1st of November, I remember a complaint of a letter directed to Miss Louisa Cowles, not having arrived; I questioned the prisoner on the subject - I told him the letter was directed to Miss

            , and asked if he recollected having had such a letter; he said he had no recollection of it; I repeated the question again, and he gave me the same answer; I repeated the question again; I said, "It is stated that a letter was sent from Brighton, directed to Miss Louisa Cowles, containing three sovereigns;" he said a third time he did not recollect it; I said it was very odd he could not recollect, because the letter was said to contain three sovereigns; he said he had no recollection of it; I said "Come with me and go and see the money book;" he did so - and I opened the money book in his presence, and pointed out to him where the letter was entered, and the signature, and asked him, "Is this your signature?" he said, "Yes;" I then said to him, "Now don't you recollect?" he said, "No;" and we went back to the letter-carrier's office from which we came, and I said, "Now don't you recollect?" and he said, "No Sir, if I have had such a letter, I may by mistake have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280063"/>delivered it to a Mr. Hart, with his letters;" he said Hart lived at No. 1, Manchester-street - here is written on the letter, "Not known at No. 11, Manchester-street;" to the best of my belief, this is the prisoner's hand-writing; he was desired to come back on the morning that I first questioned him; he did so, about the middle of the day - I desired him to attend at twelve o'clock the following day, which he did not do, neither was he there at one o'clock; and about twenty minutes after one o'clock, as he had not returned, I went in pursuit of him; he came that day I think, about two o'clock; he would be done delivering his letters, about half-past ten or eleven o'clock and was desired to attend at twelve o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been in the witness-box before? A. Yes; I was shown that hand-writing; it was merely to prove the prisoner's hand-writing to that book - to the best of my belief, it is his hand-writing - I have no doubt about the signature to the receipt, in the money-book - I have no doubt about this writing on the letter being his; he has written on the letter, "Not known at 11, Manchester-street, 
               <persName id="t18331128-83-person907">J. </persName>
            Borrett" - that is the usual mode in which letter-carriers endorse a letter, when the person cannot be found - if he had presented the letter at No. 11, Manchester-street, and it was refused there, and no such person was to be found, it would be his duty to hold it in his possession twenty-one days; that is before he sends it to the Dead Letter-office - I asked him about the letter three times before I showed him the book; his answer was, that he had no recollection of it - when I showed him the signature in the book, he did not hesitate, in the least, to say "This is my signature"- the prisoner was desired to come back on the same day as I first questioned him about the letter, and he came back that day, according to my orders, about the middle of the day - his delivery is about two miles and a half from the Post-office - I appointed for him to come the next day at twelve o'clock, and he came back about two o'clock; but I was not in the office at the time, as I had gone after him.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. When a carrier gets a money-letter, he takes a receipt to the clerk of the money-book, and receives the letter, and enters his signature in the money-book as having received it? A. Yes; he should keep the receipt as a proof that he had delivered the letter - if he cannot find the person it is addressed to, the receipt and the letter should be together in his possession.</p>

            . I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Post-office. On Saturday, the 2nd of November, I expected the prisoner to come to me at the Post-office at 12 o'clock; he came about two o'clock - I and he then went to Mr. Peacock's office; I was expecting him for the purpose of going to Mr. Peacock's office - as we went along to the office he said, "Thank God, I have found the letter!" I said, "What letter?" he said, "The letter containing the sovereigns;" and when we got to Mr. Peacock's office, I mentioned to Mr. Peacock what he had told me, and he put his hand into his side-pocket, and took out the letter - I saw it - (looking at it) this is the letter - there was written on the face of it "Not known at No. 11, Manchester-street, 
               <persName id="t18331128-83-person909">J. </persName>
            Borrett," as it has now - he gave it to Mr. Peacock, who asked him where he found it; he said, in a little desk in his room - Mr. Peacock asked him where the receipt was, he said, he had looked for it, but could not find it anywhere.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you acquainted with the course of his duty, with respect to letters refused to be taken in? A. Yes; if he had taken the letter to No. 11, Manchester-street, and the answer "Not known" was given, it would be his duty to keep it in his possession three weeks; he was at liberty to keep the letter until the 13th - it may have happened to me to be two hours after my appointment at times.</p>
               <p>Mr. SHEPHERD. Q. Although it is the duty of a carrier to keep a letter twenty-one days, if he cannot find to keep a letter twenty-one days, if he cannot find the person - is it his duty to deny all knowledge of it, if he is asked about it? A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you saw the letter at the Post-office it was entire? A.

             is not a short fat woman; I should say, she is just the sort of woman he described, with the exception of not being very tall; she is a thin woman - directly he saw her I asked him if she was the woman he offered the letter to at No. 11; he said, yes, she was.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You did not observe the letter particularly at the office? A. I did not; it was cut open with a knife being put in at the end, and carefully opened afterwards; it was opened at the top of the part which turns down at the seal - it is precisely now in the same state as when it was opened, except that there are no sovereigns in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say No. 11, Manchester-street is the address on the letter; whether that address had been altered you cannot tell? A. I cannot - there were three sovereigns in it when it was opened; they were loose - the letter was opened on the table in the office - they were loose in the centre of the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw it before, was there anything in it which indicted that it contained sovereigns? A. Yes; I heard sovereigns gingle in the letter when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280064"/>first saw it; the prisoner was present then - there was no remark made to him at that time about there being money in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember the 23rd of October? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever refuse any letter since you have been there? A. I have, since I have been to Bow-street - a letter came the other day; I turned a letter away one letter two months before I was at Bow-street, that was presented by the prisoner - I took it up to mistress - she said, it was not her's, and I took it back to him - that was not the letter now produced.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Postoffice. (looking at the letter) I cut this letter open at Bow-street, on Friday last; I cut it at the top, and found three sovereigns in it; it is in every respect as it was then - there were three sovereigns loose in it, without any silver paper or pin - before I cut it open, I examined it; I thought it had been previously opened - the letter had been actually torn open without breaking the seal, as letters usually are, with the exception of breaking the seal; that would not have disturbed the impression, if opened with care - if the sheet of paper was perfect when sent from Brighton, it is evident the letter must have been opened before I cut it open - I can hardly explain why, it is better seen than expressed (handing it to the Jury) this seal has been lifted up, and it has been fastened down with wax - if the sheet of paper was perfect before, it is impossible for the wax to have adhered to this fold - there is an opening underneath the seal; it appears to have been torn open - that hole penetrates to the outside of the fold, the outside of the inner half-sheet; not into it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The cutting or opening goes through more than one fold? A. Only through one thickness of the paper - this inner part has been torn since by accident by the Countess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean this hole? A. Yes; that was torn by Lady Winterton - before that was no opening there; there was not the slightest opening from the outer envelope to the inner envelope - when the sovereigns were found in the letter they were perfectly enclosed in it; I could not have shaken them out; they could not have been shaken out and replaced - if the sheet of paper had been perfect when it was written, it must have been opened since - I have seen imperfect sheets of paper; it is possible imperfect paper might find its way to the Countess - the imperfection must have been where the outer half-sheet adheres to the inner one; I cannot swear this was not originally imperfect, nor undertake to swear that this was not done by putting on the seal in a hurry; if Lady Winterton had put the seal on in a hurry, and the wax had gone on both folds, the paper must have been discoloured, and that is not the case - the wax could not penetrate through paper without burning it; it could not burn without being discoloured; it is possible the wax might go through both sides of the paper without the flame, but the paper must have been discoloured by heat; it is not discoloured with the black sealing-wax - the injury does not extend through both folds of the paper - I will undertake to swear this injury was not produced by tearing open the letter as I opened it myself, and am prepared to swear it - I should say the sovereigns could be got out; if the paper was not injured previous to the sovereigns being enclosed the paper must have been opened and re-sealed - the letter has been opened in my opinion; consequently any thing could have been got out.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. A. In your opinion, the letter must have been opened before you opened it? A. Certainly; during thirteen years experience in the Post-office, I have had to inspect a great many letters which have been opened in a similar manner to this; that fact is well known to persons in confidential employments in the Post-office - it would not be made generally known in the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say under the seal there is a slit? A. Yes; when that slit was first made I could open a letter in precisely the same way as any other letter; by opening the letter I could take the whole contents out - to a common observer it is possible to cover over that part, so as to conceal that it had been opened - it would not be possible to draw out the ends of the letter; in that case the ends would have been rumpled; it would not be possible to draw out the ends of the letter, so as for the sovereigns to fall out, without the cut, not without there being any appearance of it, which there is not - the part under the seal exhibits marks as if the letter had been entirely opened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at a small spot of black sealing-wax near the seal; has that ever been broken at all? A. On my oath, I cannot say; there is no impression on it, nor is the paper torn - it is impossible to say whether that small spot of wax, near the seal, has ever been opened at all; I have no belief on the subject; it is so trifling - if I put another piece of wax in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280065"/>the same manner, I could open it and close it again so that nobody could perceive it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose there to have been a small spot of wax at the place which it has been opened at, is it perfectly easy to put on another small spot of black wax? A. It would be easy to be done, but I conceive a small knife would open that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose that small piece of wax was broken, could it be replaced by another piece, so as to exhibit the same appearance as it does now? A. Yes; I should say it might.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMMERS to LADY WINTERTON. Q. I beg to call your attention to that small piece of black wax; does that appear to have been put on purposely, or dropped casually? A. I put it on purposely; it appears exactly in the same state as I put it on, except that it has been broken in Court now, except that breaking it adhered a little before - it does not appear to me to be the least altered - I will not swear that I did not open the seal of the letter after it had been sealed, and before it left my hands, because I was in such a great hurry, and it is a long time ago - I cannot swear I did not open it after it had been sealed, and re-seal it before it went to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you first sealed the letter did you put the little bit of black wax on it for double security? A. Yes; I put it on after I put the large seal on - I have been considering and I really cannot swear I did not open the letter after I put on both pieces of wax - I was in a great hurry - I did not wish my own seal attached to it, and I considered what seal I should put on it - when I first wrote it I had just entered my house at Brighton; and left the room, as I wanted to give some orders and might have opened the letter again; on reflection and consideration, I think I added the little spot of black wax afterwards - there is no impression on the small piece of wax - I cannot say it might not have been opened and replaced by another piece of wax; but it being so small a quantity of wax, it don't appear to have been touched - if I opened the letter I did not take out the silver paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you put the small piece of wax on, did you put it underneath the paper or only on the top? A. I placed it in this way; I have opened a letter sealed with wax and resealed it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave the case in the hands of my counsel.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON (for the prisoner). Q. Did you go out of court when the witnesses were ordered out? A. I did; I was not in court - I was not between the curtain and the door - I did go out of the court, and came in again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you within hearing of any part of the statement of the counsel? A. I cannot say I did not hear a few words; but I went out of court; which the policeman can testify - I had not returned a minute when I was called - I do not know Mr. Hobler's clerk - I heard somebody come in, and I just popped in for a moment - I certainly stepped in for a moment but I could not relate anything Mr. Bodkin said - I did not hear anything he said.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were not you inside, and the door shut on you? A. No; I do not think this gentleman found me between the door and the curtain - I do not know him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you so inside the court as to hear what passed? A. I was not; I was not long enough in court to hear the statement of the counsel - I had no opportunity of hearing anything he said - it was so short - the door was not shut - I was outside the door - to say I did not hear, would be wrong; but I did not understand a word - I was there a second or so.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you hear me make any statement of facts to which you are to depose? A. No; the prisoner left me in June, for a period of three months, during which time he was in prison; he left me on a Saturday - I paid him a sovereign on Friday night, and he left me next day - I saw him again at my house, on the 26th of October - my son was in the shop then - he came and said, I owed him 8s. to make up the week's wages - which I should have done, if he had stopped; and I gave it him, rather than have any quibble, and he went away - he came again on the 13th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280066"/>of November, about two or three o'clock in the afternoon; he spoke first to my son, in my hearing, and said, he wanted a pair of shoes - my son said, "I know nothing about your shoes - you had better not call; you may get yourself into trouble;" he turned round to me, and said,"I have called for my shoes" - I said, "I knew nothing about them, and wondered he should show his face there - he said, "I can show as good a face as you, and shall send you in a bill for 5s." - I believe, I said, at the Mansion-house, that it was between eleven and twelve o'clock he came, but it was about three o'clock; the bill of 5s. was for the shoes - he spoke rather roughly, he was not there above a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before this that an application had been made to you about his character, by Mr. Beech? A. Yes; he had got a situation before that; he was out of confinement about the 5th of October, and I think an application was made about his character, by Mr. Beech, about a fortnight after - I should say it was from the 12th to the 20th of October - I made a communication to Mr. Beech on the subject of his character, he is in the same business as myself - I afterwards, saw Beech on the subject, and I know he went into Beech's service; and I believe he was in his employ when he called about the shoes - I heard so - I saw this letter on the evening of the 13th of November - I did not see it till about nine o'clock - I received it from my son William - (that was the night of the same day as the inquiry was made about the shoes) - I have seen the prisoner write - in my judgment it is the prisoner's handwriting; I believe it to be his writing - I went next morning to the Lord Mayor, and made a communication to him; one of my men sat up on Saturday night, the 16th, to watch the premises - three or four doors past my house, there is a passage leading to a billiard-room, near my stables, which are behind my house - the passage is separated from my premises, by a low wall, five feet high - Stevens was the name of the person who watched there - I did not employ him; he did it of his own accord; and Abel, the night-patrol, was told to keep an extra watch - I gave directions to the patrol in consequence of this letter.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You received the letter from your son? A. Yes; it has a twopenny-post mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you, in June last, charge the prisoner with felony? A. I did.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was not your charge ultimately reduced to writing? A. No; I don't understand the question.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you prefer a bill against him? A. Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you a common-councilman? A. Yes; I have been so five or six years - I have served on special Juries, and on common Juries; not frequently on both - I cannot say how often on common Juries; it don't come to our turn very often - I don't think I have served twenty-eight days altogether - I don't know that I ever heard witnesses ordered out of Court - I served on a grand Jury last Sessions - I don't recollect that I ever did hear witnesses ordered out of Court - I will not swear it - I understood what you meant by ordering the witnesses out of Court - I had no reason for coming into Court - I came in, I suppose out of curiosity - on my oath I did not hear what Mr. Bodkin said, I scarcely heard five words.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not hear ten words consecutively? A. Not inside the door - the door kept opening and shutting constantly - I cannot say I did not listen - the door did not stand open - I cannot say, I did not hear when the door opened; but it was instantaneous - I did not hear Mr. Bodkin's statement; I tried to hear; I was outside, and was anxious, of course, as to what was going on - I was not constantly listening - I certainly did step in for a moment - I was not aware that my being out was so particular - I suppose I was ordered out that I should not hear the counsel open the case - curiosity excited me to come in to hear - it is of no use to disguise the cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hide yourself behind the curtain because you was ashamed of being seen there, after being ordered out? I did not come on this side the curtains; but I did not remain there, because I was so short a time; getting behind, and remaining there, is another thing - I came in to hear but did not remain long enough to hear.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath were you not there five minutes? A. No; I was not - I did not know the importance of it, or I should not have done so.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray give me leave to ask, whether you have any motive for prosecuting the prisoner? A. I have no motive but justice.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath don't you know there is a charge before the Excise against you, for having fraudulently made candles without paying the duty? A. No; there is no charge - I never had one - I never knew of one in my life - I never heard of one against me - the prisoner talked about it at the Mansion-house - this man has reported such a thing about - my character, I believe, is as respectable before the Commissioners of the Excise as any man's - I have been thirty years under the excise - I never had an information, nor anything to injure my character - there was no charge against me for fradulently making candles, except what he said - I never heard of it before, except through him - I believe he has talked about it round the trade - I never had a charge against me - I never heard of a complaint from the Excise - this man has been talking ever since he robbed me, that he would do something, but I don't fear him - he has had plenty of time, since he was convicted, if he had any information to give - I don't know that the subject is under the consideration of the Excise at present - I feel confident I am not undergoing the scrutiny of the law officers at present - I don't believe the Commissioners of Excise have any information against me, for the duty has been off candles for two years - I swear I don't believe there is even a suspicion against me - I did not go to the office to inquire if there was a charge, after I had heard the prisoner had made such a charge - I never was afraid of the prisoner or any man.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not make inquiry when you heard there was a charge? A. It was not worth my while - I was satisfied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280067"/>there was no such thing - I should not have prefered this indictment, nor the other, if I had not been obliged - my own preservation obliged me - I have been under the Excise laws thirty years - I never was suspected, I believe; and to the best of my knowledge, no man in the trade stands better with the Excise than I do, and insinuations of this sort are very vexations - he has had time to do me an injury if he had thought proper to lodge an information - I know the prisoner's hand-writing well - I have no doubt of this letter being his; I have known his hand-writing twelve years, and I am sure it is his writing - some of it is disguised but it is his writing; some of it is hardly disguised; I know it to be his hand-writing - I am well acquainted with his writing, and am satisfied in my own mind that it is his writing - I should say it is his writing but rather disguised.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of it? A. I should say the bottom part is more disguised than the top - I know it is his writing - here is the word "fired" - it is plain to me this is his hand writing - I have seen him write that many times - the word fired is in very large characters - that is just the hand-writing I have seen him write - there are other words as much like his writing as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Point them out? A. I should say the word "fired," and "character" - I believe the whole is his hand-writing - the fact is, it is all the character of his writing, particularly the upper part - the capital I's are his hand-writing - I believe it is his writing, on my oath - I mean to say it is rather disguised, the whole of it, but I am satisfied it is his writing - the bottom part of the letter in my opinion is more disguised than the top - that is what I said before - the word "character" is near the top in the fourth line, both the words "fired" and "character" are like his writing, one is like his large hand, and the other like his small hand - I think they are all disguised in a measure, but so much like his I could tell it in a moment - I say it is all his writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you find such traces of his character of hand-writing as to satisfy you that it is his? A. I do?</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now is there any word in the letter which you particularly notice, being particularly like his hand-writing, except the two words you have mentioned? A. The words "have," and "suspect" it is all like his writing - I should say the word "Saturday" is like his hand-writing - I am satisfied it is all like his writing - the words "person," and "understand" - I don't select any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mr. Hale, you told my friend that on his coming to you for 8s., he conducted himself very rough, what was the roughness? A. He said, I had done the worst I could do, and he did not mind me; and I gave him the 8s., and away he went after a little further conversation - I tried to talk and reason with him, as the thing was over - I begged he would not go on talking about me as he had done, and I said, "Now you have an opportunity of establishing your character, and I hope you will" - he said, "I don't care you have done your worst," and he would not listen to me- he would not hear me - on my oath I had not heard at that time that he had preferred a charge against me at the Excise - I never was afraid of any charge against the Excise laws - the conversation about the 8s. was on Saturday night the 26th of October - he never said a word about the Excise to me - he did not say he had preferred a charge - when he was in prison before, he had said he would rum me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why tell me you never heard any complaint had been made? A. There had been no complaint directly from the Excise-office - he never made a charge against me to my face.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not tell you on the 16th of October, that he had preferred a charge against you? A. He did not tell me so; he had been talking about the neighbourhood; I cannot tell who I heard it from - he had spread a report, but it never amounted to anything - it is a cruel accusation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you on the 16th of October, pay him the 8s., telling him it would be better for him that he should not say anything against you, and after that, recommend him to a situation? A. I recommended him, and I am sorry that construction has been put on my motives - I never saw him on the 16th of October; the first time I spoke to him, to the best of my recollection, was the 26th; I wished to see him well, and rather wanted to show I wished him well; but I was not under any fear from the Excise - I had no reason - he took the money and away he went; I did not say, it would be better he should not say these things against me - I wanted to reason with him as a friend, to try and soften him down; he seemed to be so high, and said I had done my worst, and he did not care for me; I did not tell him it would be better not to say anything more against me, nor anything of the kind - I did not say it would be better; I said, "You have got a place, cannot you go on and get a character."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say to him, you hoped he would not now talk of you as he had? A. It was not on account of the Excise, my Lord.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was it on account of? A. I had no motive at all, further than I wished to shew I was disposed to be a friend to him; it did not apply to making candles fraudulently; it really was, that I wished him well; all he could say about me, could do me no injury; I did not ask him not to say any more about me; I believe, I said, I hoped he would not talk about me as he had done; it was not from any fear - I cannot say why, I said so, further than from a kindly feeling I had towards him, that the thing might go quietly and die away - I meant my having prosecuted him; he had threatened me about the neighbourhood; what I said to him had no reference to what he had said about the Excise.</p>

               <p>Q. About two years ago, do you remember a supper being given at the Bull's Head at Walbrook? A. I recollect that I gave the officers who used to visit me, some bread and cheese, or something of that sort; it was not to induce them to keep any secret, I gave them something to eat and drink; I think that was about the time the duty came off candles; I recollect doing so once, and only once - I swear positively, I have never given them any since that; we have only one officer visit us now; I don't think I have given them anything to eat above<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280068"/>once or twice in my life - I will swear I have not done it half-a-dozen times, nor five times.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked about somebody you ordered to watch; what is his name? A. Abel, the patrol; I don't think he is here - I believe Stevens is not here - I did not ask him to come; my house has not been set on fire - I have not been done for.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long is it since the duty has been taken off candles? A. Two years next January; I never had any charge or process against me in the Exchequer; the prisoner, never in his life to my face, said he had a charge to make against me - I have heard it rumoured in the neighbourhood as having been said by him - I have never in my life had even a caution from the Excise.</p>

            . I am the son of Ford Hale. The prisoner left my father's employ in June - I saw him again on the 26th of October; he did not speak to me on that occasion; he spoke to my father in my presence - he merely called for 8s. wages; my father said, "John, I don't think 8s. is due to you; you did not serve the whole day, but rather than have any squabbling about it, (or something of that sort) here are the 8s.," and he paid him - I again saw him on the 13th of November, at my father's house; he came into the shop; he addressed me, and said, "Mr. William, I have called for my shoes"- I said, "Really, John, I know nothing about your shoes; you had better not keep calling, perhaps you will get yourself into trouble" - he then turned round, and addressed my father said, "Sir, I have called for my shoes" - my father said, "John, I know nothing about your shoes; I wonder you can shew your face here" - he said, "Face! I can shew as good a face as you" - my father made him no answer, but turned round and walked off; this was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I was at home that night; a letter came about eight o'clock by the twopenny-post; I took it in; this is the letter - I opened it, and read it, and gave it to my father - during the time the prisoner was in my father's employ I have seen him write often; I have known his hand-writing for eight years - I believe this letter to be in his hand-writing - I think it was in about an hour or three-quarters after I opened the letter that I gave it to my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at the letter carefully; you have seen the prisoner write for eight years? A. Yes; and became well acquainted with his writings - if I had seen an account he had made out, I should immediately know it was his hand-writing; and if I saw a letter written by him I should know it; as soon as I saw it, it was clear to me, that it was his hand-writing - I am acquainted with his ordinary style of writing; this is rather disguised, I should say the large word "fired" is not so much disguised as some parts - I think it is most disguised where it is folded down at the bottom, all but the large word "fired"; it is not so much disguised but I could tell it was his hand-writing - I think the lower part is much disguised, but the word "fired" not so much; it is rather disguised - it is disguised in the formation of the letter "R"; the capital "F" is not disguised; it is the way he would have written a direction - it was palpable to me, that it is his hand-writing - the word"have" is rather disguised, not more than the generality - the word "understand" is written in the way he would have written it, if in a hurry; I should say it is not disguised - the word "character" is not at all disguised, but just as as if he wrote in a hurry - the word "person" is disguised a very little, as if he wrote it in a hurry - I should say, the word "suspect" is not so much disguised as the lower part; I should say, it is not in the least disguised - I should know it, it is just as he writes when in a hurry; it is like his ordinary hand, when he writes in a hurry.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. FORD HALE. Q. Since the prisoner has been in custody, have you written any letters, or caused any to be written, to Giltspur-street Compter? A. No; none whatever.</p>

            . I am apprenticed to Mr. Hale, and have been so nearly four years. I knew the prisoner while in the employment of Mr. Hale - I saw him after he left the service, on the 13th of November; he had called before that - I had no conversation with him on that occasion; he did not speak to me, he spoke to young Mr. Hale - I heard him say, "I have called for my shoes;" Mr. Hale said, "I know nothing about your shoes; you had better not keep calling, or you will perhaps get yourself into trouble;" and then he spoke to Mr. Hale; he left shortly afterwards - I saw him next on the 19th of November, about two o'clock in the afternoon; Mr. Hale was then at dinner - the prisoner addressed me, by saying "How do you do?" and "You are the only person in the house I shall ever speak to" - and then he took the liberty of looking at a list of orders I was packing up; he said, "What, are you packing these?" I said, "Yes" - he then spoke to me about how he liked his place, and what confidence was placed in him; he said, he had got a very good place - he then said, "I told Beech, on Saturday night, I would not wrong him of a sheet of paper; but as to the other one, I would take his life away if I could" - I exclaimed, "What, Beech?" he said, "No, Hale's." meaning the prosecutor - he said a few words more; I, being very reluctant to enter into conversation with him, took no notice of him; he then left the shop - I called Mr. Hale down stairs, and communicated this to him - I have frequently seen him write in Mr. Hale's service - I believe this word "fired" in the letter to be his hand-writing; I believe the whole of it to be his hand-writing, but part of it is disgused a little.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was the prisoner in Mr. Hale's service while you were there? A. Going on for four years; I think he had left Mr. Hale about four months - I have been there nearly four years - I have talked with Mr. Hale about this letter since he received it; I told him I thought it was the prisoner's handwriting, and he told me he thought so - I pointed the word "Fired" out to him; it bears the greatest resemblance to his hand-writing; every letter in that word is like his hand-writing; I think the "R" is not so much like it as the other letters - I told Mr. Hale I did not think it so much like it as the rest - I mentioned the "R" to Mr. Hale and his son; he told me to look at the word; I don't recollect that he told me to look at the little "R;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280069"/>I will not swear he did not - young Mr. Hale was not there when we were talking about it - he was present once; I don't think it was when the letter "R" was talked of - I will not swear that he did not point out the"R" to me; I cannot say that he did - I cannot recognise any word so much as "fired" - I am not positive of the word "have;" I think it is like the prisoner's writing; it is disguised - I believe the word "understand," to be his writing - I believe the whole of it to be disguised; that word appears disguised more than the rest that you have asked me about yet - I believe the word "character" to be his writing; I believe it to be the same as the rest; I think that disguised not so much as "understand," but rather more than the word "have" - I think the word"suspect," not so much disguised as the rest you have asked me about; but the word "fired" is more clear than any other - I think "suspect" is not so much disguised as any other part, except "fired" - I am not so positive to the word "person;" I think that is very much disguised - the words "

            " are disguised; the two "J's" are, I think, very much disguised; I think there is a difference in the two "J's;" the "J" in the second line is more clear than the "J" in the fourth line; - the second is partly like his hand-writing; it is pretty nearly like the "J" he used to make - there are about fifteen persons in Mr. Hale's employ; some of them are in the house and some out - there are two other witnesses here who are engaged in the house, and one out.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons have as good opportunities of seeing the prisoner write as you? A. There is one more besides; that is Daniel Gilbey; he is here - it is not likely that the other servants who don't work in the shop, should know his hand-writing - two or three of them are in the shop parts of the year - Joshua Burr, and James Howard, sometimes work in the shop; I don't know who else exactly; there are various persons work in the shop; sometimes they work in the cellar; the carman, Thomas Stevens, is in the shop - there are three places where they melt the tallow to make candles with.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, have you not assisted in removing candles from one place to another in the night? A. No, I have not; never in my life.</p>

               <p>COURT. If you consider the question involves you in any charge you are not bound to answer.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you answer or not? I cannot answer, because I know nothing about the case you speak about - I have not assisted to remove candles in the night or morning.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, have you never assisted in removing candles, or seen them removed, on your master's premises after day-light? A. No; I will not swear I have not done so, because I am not come on that suit.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is it part of your duty to remove candles from one part of your master's premises to another by his direction? A. Yes - I never removed candles in the night - I have been in the service four years; it is impossible to tell how often I have removed candles from one part to another in that time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear positively you have not assisted in removing candles from your master's melting-house to the general stock, in the absence of the Excise officer, as many as twenty times in a year? A. I have assisted in removing proper candles, which I have a right to move - I don't think it proper to answer the question; I don't consider it relates to the business I am come about, and I shall not answer - I have no objection to answer it, but I don't think I have a right to do it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Mr. Hale has about fifteen persons in his employ; how many are employed in the melting-place? A. About three in each; there are three melting-places; nine are employed in making candles, &amp;c., one in melting, and the other two in making candles - three have to do with the books and writing, and making the bills out; there is William Hale, (the son), myself, and Jonathan Hale, who has recently come into the trade; I mean in the shop, not in the counting-house -

               <p>Q. You have been asked about the hand-writing in the letter; is the belief you have expressed about it, the result of your own judgment, or the result of any concert with Mr. Hale, or any body else? A. Immediatly the letter was shown to me, I recognized the word "Fired" - that was directly I had any intelligence about the letter - directly the letter was turned over to me I fixed on that word as I read.</p>

            . I am a married woman; my husband is a tallow-chandler, and lives at No. 4, Maiden-lane, Queen-street. My husband works at Mr. Hale's, and from that I became acquainted with the prisoner - he was in the habit of calling at our house now and then - he called on the 13th of this month; my husband was not at home; I had some conversation with him at the street-door - after his telling me he had obtained a situation, he then commenced talking of Mr. Hale - he said he had called on Mr. Hale for 8s. due to him, that Mr. Hale refused paying, and he said he was a scoundrel - "Mrs. Coe," said he, "I have suffered innocently; should me, my wife, or family come to want, through the injury Mr. Hale has done me (taking a knife from his pocket, and opening it), this knife shall go through him, for my revenge I will have" - it was a large sort of pen-knife; he said, "I have youth and pluck on my side, and revenge I will have" - he said, as he was going from the door, "I am going there now" - he then left; it was about two o'clock in the afternoon - I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is your husband? A. I believe he is here; I did not laugh at what the prisoner said - I certainly thought Mr. Hale's life was in danger at the moment, but I did not go to Mr. Hale - the conversation was on the Wednesday, and I told Mr. Hale of it on the Saturday afternoon - Mr. Hale did not take me before the Lord Mayor on the subject; I first heard I was to be produced as a witness last<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280070"/>Monday - the knife was longer than your finger; it was not a pen-knife; it was a sort of clasp-knife; it was not more like a dinner-knife; I believe it was a case-knife; he took it out of his waistcoat-pocket, and unclasped it - I have known him better than five years - my husband is a candle-maker - I sometimes dress cottons at home; I have been employed there nearly four years - I saw the prisoner write, but not to know his writing; I dare say I have seen him write ten times; I cannot swear that I have fifty; I have seen him write now and then - I was not called on before the magistrate about this - I believe Mr. Hale's stables join the premises; to the best of my knowledge they join the house - I should be sorry to swear any thing about it - Mr. Hale called on me, and asked what I had heard him say, and I told him; most likely my husband had told him what I knew, as I told him the same evening - I never went before any Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What was the manner of the prisoner when he used the expressions; was it jocular? A. He appeared more in a passion as it were; he appeared to speak rather rashly than not - I dress wicks at home.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you paid by Mr. Hale? A. Yes; I have seen the prisoner writing at the desk - my attention has never been called to what he was writing.</p>

            . I am not in the employ of Mr. Hale; I was so for twelve years, up to August last - I knew the prisoner in his service perfectly well; I was in the counting-house as book-keeper and accountant - I have seen him write and am acquainted with his handwriting - I have carefully examined the letter; I have seen it before; in my judgment it is the prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were before the magistrate; I know what you said; on what do you form your belief of it being the prisoner's hand-writing? A. I believe it to be his hand-writing - I did not say before the Lord Mayor that I formed my judgment from the circumstances I heard from Mr. Hale - but from the letter itself; it was from the first part of the letter I formed that judgment - I did not state that I should not have judged it was the prisoner's if I had not heard of the circumstances; the question was asked, if I should have known it had I seen it anywhere else; I said, I might not have known it if I had seen it anywhere else - what I have seen I could identify, but if this had been presented to me in any other quarter on a sudden, in my judgment, I could not have spoken so clearly to the point - I say. I believe it to be the prisoner's hand-writing now, after having carefully looked at it; if I had not seen it in the hands of Mr. Hale I should have known it - I saw it in Cannon-street - I certainly have talked with Mr. Hale about it, before I went to the Mansion-house - three or four times in Cannon-street, and once or twice since I was at the Mansion-house - I am not Mr. Hale's servant; I am an accountant; I do not know one of the Excise-officers' names who have attended the business, nor their persons - I have nothing to do with that department; I believe there was a good many of them - I left Mr. Hale in August; I was told I was to be a witness about a week since I believe, when he was taken to the Mansion-house - the prisoner's hand might differ on account of the pen; he writes sometimes in large characters and sometimes in small.</p>
               <p>Q. If the letter was written in a disguised hand, you would not have known it; A. No.</p>

            . I am a tallow-chandler in Mr. Hale's employ; I have been so twenty-seven years; I have seen the prisoner write - I believe the former part of the letter, as far as the word "suspect," to be the prisoner's hand-writing, and likewise the words "fired," and"Saturday;" I believe the whole to be his writing - the lower part is more disguised.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you got your living under Mr. Hale? A. Nearly twenty-seven years; I can write myself; I do not say I write well; I can write my name without making a mistake - I am employed by Mr. Hale to do his work, and have nothing to do with the Excise; I have not been employed to remove candles from the melting-houses after day-light, or after the Excise-officer has gone, to the general stock; that I swear - I never knew the boy Field assist the prisoner to do so; I never knew it to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known it done in Mr. Hale's business? A. Have I a right to answer the question? I do not refuse, but I consider it not a right question - I have not had anything to do with taking things away in an improper manner, nor has any one else done so - Mr. Hale never laid himself open to the Excise, to do or suffer any thing of the sort to be done - I do not sleep on the premises; I did for the first seven years; that is twenty-one years ago - I am there generally all night; the melting houses were seldom shut - we have no Excise-officers now; two years ago they came in, and out as they pleased - the Excise-officers came in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, on your solemn oath, swear you never assisted, or were aware of candles being removed from the melting-houses while the Excise-officers were absent, to the general stock? A. I do not think the question has anything to do with it; I shall not answer it.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you ever heard of any complaint made on the part of the Excise about Mr. Hale's business? A. Never; not by anybody - there never has been, since I was in the house, anything to do with the Excise; he never laid himself open to it - I have attended the manufacturing night after night, and never heard any charge made against him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Has not the prisoner preferred a petition to the Excise, charging the prosecutor with the offence, which is now before the Board? A. I have heard he has charged Mr. Hale, but I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD COX. I am a hatter, and live in Long-lane, Southwark. I was in Mr. Hale's employ about twelve years; the prisoner was in his employ during that time - I had opportunities of seeing him write daily; we were fellow-apprentices together - as regards the former part of this letter, I have no hesitation in saying, it is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280071"/>prisoner's hand-writing; the latter part of it I think is disguised.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Pray how long have you left Mr. Hale? A. About four years; about two days after the letter was sent, I was passing Mr. Hale's, and called in, in a friendly sort of way - and he laid the letter before me - he did not ask me if it was the prisoner's hand-writing; he merely laid it before me and asked me whose hand-writing I thought it was; and without hesitating a moment I said, it was the hand-writing of the prisoner - I am not at all concerned with Mr. Hale, more than friendship - if the letter was shewn to me without any direction on it, I should say it was the hand-writing of the prisoner - it is not disguised so much as to deceive me; because when it was placed before me I could tell the hand-writing in a moment - I don't know that the word"have" is disguised - I take the writing as it stands before me - I have nothing to do with the words - I don't think the word "understand" is disguised - if the prisoner sent me a letter, in the same style as this, I should say it was his hand-writing, without any name to it - I have had a glass of wine, but no spirits - I have not now come out of a public-house - I have had no spirits and water - I don't see anything disguised about the word "character;" it is in a regular way - I should say the word "have" is quite consistent with his handwriting the same as the other - I should say the word"person" is in his general habit of writing - and suspect, I should say "Saturday" is not - I cannot say whether the word "fire" is like his hand-writing; it is a different hand to what I saw him write - I might have seen him write as large as that, but not to come under my observation, so much as the former part of the letter - it is not in a different style - but I am not in the habit of seeing write him large - it is a hand that never came under my observation - I have seen him write daily - the word"fired" would not have attracted my attention more than the rest; because he always wrote small when I saw him- I can point out no word, which, according to my idea, is inconsistent with his usual writing.</p>

I am in the employment of Mr. Hale; I have been so eight years; I was acquainted with the prisoner; I saw him in August, in Giltspur-street compter, and had some conversation with him - (he was not then in custody on this charge) - in course of which, to use his own words, he said, he would be the death of that Hale; those were his words; he said nothing more of that sort - I was talking with him an hour; in the course of the conversation he used that expression - I saw him on the 18th of November, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening, standing at the end of a passage, in Cannon-street, or very near it - the passage leads to the back of Mr. Hale's premises - I have been down that passage; it leads to the stables - there is a wall about five feet high, between the stables and the passage; he was standing not above half a rod from the passage, in Cannon-street - he was under my observation five minutes as near as I can recollect; he was dressed very differently to what I ever saw him before - he was wearing a cap - his dress differed in no other respect - I did not speak to him - he saw me and walked off very fast; he looked back and saw me two or three times, but did not come back - I followed him; he went up Cannon-street - I had heard about the letter which induced me to follow him - I had sufficient opportunities of seeing him to be able to speak to his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you follow him to? A. About one hundred yards up Cannon-street - I followed him no farther - I get my bread by Mr. Hale - I am a journeyman to him and have been so for a year - that is since the duty has been taken off candles - it was about half-past nine o'clock in the evening when I saw the prisoner, he had on a cap which I never saw him in before - I saw him in Cannon-street; on the pavement very near the passage; at the bottom of the passage - I do not know how far from the wall - I did not measure it - I cannot judge - I was not called on before the Lord Mayor - he might have been fifty yards from the five-feet wall - there is a billiard-room close by - I did not see anything with him - he was standing on the public pavement -(letter read for which see the indictment).</p>

               <p>JURY. Was the prisoner employed in directing parcels in the shop? A. Yes' very often; he frequently wrote in characters as large as the word "fired" in the letter - the parcels he would direct, would not have Mr. Hale's name on them - I have frequently seen him write directions - Stevens the carman takes the parcels out in carts - he is the principal - he can read - he is not here - Gilbey has been in the habit of taking out parcels with the prisoner's directing on them, at times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I have to address you now on one of the most cruel cases you will find on the records of this court. In March last, considering from Mr. Hale's increased family coming into the business, I should not be able to hold the situation I had held so many years; and having applications at the same time from a tradesman rather insolvent, within six minutes walk of the house, to join in partnership; I refused, knowing the gentleman's inability to attend to business. I asked him, what he should consider the business worth if he left? he said, he could not carry it on by himself, and would take me as a partner, knowing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280072"/>my ability and talents. I did not much like to enter into a contract with him, but asked him, what he thought his business and shop worth, knowing at the same time he had lost his trade from indolence. He asked, what I thought too much. I staid a short time and consulted Mr. Hale, who I considered my father; I thought I could confide in him; I consulted him merely as to what he thought the business worth, not stating I had any idea of it; he gave me quite a candid answer. I consulted my friends, knowing I had a few pounds in the saving bank of which Mr. Hale's brother was a trustee. I applied to my wife's brother, who readily offered me part of his capital to assist in taking the business without security. I then immediately asked Mr. Hale for his most can did advice, stating I could obtain the house and business for such a sum, - and the trade had offered me credit to stock it. The house was in Upper Thames-street, near Kennet Wharf. Mr. Hale immediately turned round on me. In fact from that day, his conduct was very different, and in less than three months, I was charged with felony. Of course as he was against my taking the business, I dropped the concern; and even now I am respected through the trade. The day after I came from prison, I was on Change, and met the trade in a body, and one and all gave me their word I should have the first situation vacant. A few days afterwards I called on Mr. Beech, who said he thought of altering his system of business, and I could do him essential service; he did not know then I was out of a situation. I intimated the situation would suit me, and he felt surprised at my leaving Mr. Hale's. I told him I had left him charged with felony and could expect no character from Hale; I offered him £200. security, he accepted of £100. It was agreed I should serve him, and he said if I had been guilty of an error, no doubt I should retrieve my character. I said it was my own request that he should call on Mr. Hale. I said "You have my story and I should like you to hear his;" consequently he called on Mr. Hale, who told him, as I did, myself, every thing consistent with my character, but not one single item in my favour of course. Mr. Beech told him he determined to give me a fair trial, considering my talent was calculated to serve his business, and I was from that day to consider myself in his employ, though I did not go for a week afterwards, as he had to discharge a servant, who was taken into the employ of Mr. Barton, of Bishopsgate-street, on purpose to make room for me. Mr. Hale, the same day; or the day after, understanding Mr. Beech was determined to give me an opportunity of retrieving my character, returned to Mr. Beech and gave a more favourable aspect to the subject, stating I had been trustworthy; and he was always satisfied with me up to the time I was committed. I was then in full confidence with Beech, treated with the greatest respect, and was very fully engaged from six o'clock in the morning till ten or eleven o'clock on night, and one or two o'clock in the morning, on separate nights. Business increased, and I did the best I could to improve it; considering, that in gratitude to him, I ought to do it. I was so taken up with business, I frequently had my meals with Mr. Beech, not having time to go home, though I lived in the neighbourhood. Such is the situation I now hold in life, and through the Jury, I expect to be in the same situation on Monday. As to the charge, if Mr. Hale's house had been accidentally set on fire, (and I have known it on fire several times,) I might have been tried for arson and expired on the gallows. I call God to witness, I know nothing of the letter in question. I neither wrote nor caused it to be written. I neither sent nor know any thing of it being sent, till I was before the Lord Mayor. I was taken from behind the counter in custody: I did not know the charge; and the Lord Mayor immediately stopped the proceedings till my friends and solicitor were sent for; and though two days at the Mansion-house, I did not know the sentiments the letter expressed, till I read it in The Times since my committal to Newgate; Beech can prove what I have said is entirely true. On the 18th of November, I certainly was in Cannon-street. My business laid there. At half-past seven o'clock we were wanting a man to go for us to a particular customer. not being able to get a porter, I offered to go myself. I went to Red Lion-street. I then had to purchase an article; and went to Grays Inn-lane to the melting-house with the article; which is graves. The article was weighed; I paid for it; it weighed 1 cwt and 5lb. I put it on my shoulder and left it at the melting-house. I then returned home. I certainly did not hurry myself, having had a hard day's work. I passed through Cannon-street at ten minutes after nine o'clock. Mr. Hale's workman was at the door; a person was singing, and I stood there and gave a person a 1d., and Burr was then at the door; he followed me up the street a few steps; I went to my employers, and I think reached there at a quarter past nine o'clock. Mr. Hale speaks of my being with him on the 26th of October, respecting a balance due. I called on him to thank him for the service he had done me by calling on Beech a second time, and not troubling my friends for my security. I entered the counting-house; he had a friend there who is a respectable man, and I expected to see him here. Mr. Hale asked my business? I said, "I had called on him." He said,"You are a pretty sort of fellow." I said, "Perhaps I may be." He said, "You are very saucy, you have been to a fine place." I said, "what I have learnt I have paid very dearly for." He began talking about how much he had served me. I said, "I had come to thank him for it, and to say, that I did not think he had served me as much as he certainly had injured me first." The Excise was brought up. I said, "I have no animosity against you. I shall not impeach you, though I have been tampered with even by officers; I have been offered 50l. from their private purse to inform." It was my duty to keep account of the men's work, and what was paid them. He would frequently say, "John, I have paid so much wages, what do the Excise say?" I said,"There is so much that has not been weighed off by the Excise, and putting the two together, you will make a sum of so much;" which I did frequently; and he was not ignorant that I had an account of certain irregularities, but never with a view to give information. I worked for him nine or ten nights together. I never went to bed except on Saturday and Sunday nights. I went to another employer, who acted to me more than a parent. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280073"/>my duty to encourage his business, though it was in the same neighbourhood. I cannot help people giving me orders, indeed they do it to give me support. I hope you will consider me as innocent as any body in Court. I never had any animosity against Mr. Hale; he has brought witnesses who are dependant on him, and he is a powerful man who has spared no expense I believe; I cannot suppose he would turn this up to get me out of the country; but somewhere there must be an author. I certainly must leave my case in the hands of an Omnipotent Being who knows the secrets of all hearts, and trust in God to do me that justice my case requires. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, one thing I have omitted to state respecting the present prosecution in the hands of the Excise. I did not give that up, till a few days previous; it was about a day or two previous to my arrest; but the Excise-officers, not only in our district, but in several districts in London, knowing me to be a managing man, (and Mr. Hale being a suspected man,) had it not been for our strict exertions, and that of Gilbey to protect him, he would long ago have been convicted in their court. I was afraid, sooner or later, I should be called on by the Excise; and of course I was compelled to give my papers up when the solicitor knew it, having had information from the officers, stating that Mr. Mayow was acquainted with my conduct. The papers were given up previous to my arrest for this concern; and before I knew he had received the letter.</p>

            . I am an officer employed by the excise. I know the premises of Mr. Hale - I have known the prisoner between two and three years - I have seen him write often; this letter don't seem to be any resemblance of his hand-writing - I know his hand-writing; I don't believe it to be his, from the appearance of it - the address don't seem to correspond at all with his mode of writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often have you seen him write? A. I cannot say; it is many times - it don't seem to bear any traces of his hand-writing at all - to the best of my belief, I don't believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you in the employ of the Excise now? A. Yes; I have been so twenty-one years last January - I am a principal officer, which is next to a supervisor - I never knew the prisoner till I surveyed at Mr. Hale's, which was in the early part of March, 1831- I think my duty called me to Mr. Hale's, two days out of three, from 1831 to 1832; I used to see the prisoner write notes of business; that is, notices given for his master to commence his operations; they were not always written by him - I have seen him write those notices several times; many times - I never saw him write but one hand - a small running hand; it was the writing of a good penman - he did not always write alike; I never saw much variation; he possibly might have a bad pen sometimes - it was always a small free running-hand; a moderate hand - the notices used to be written in a moderate, free, running hand; they were on small pieces of paper, probably as long as a pen; more than two or three lines - I saw this letter, for the first time, this morning, at the clerk's office; Mr. Hobler's clerk brought me here to see it - I was asked if I should be able to recognize his writing; I said, I thought I should, having seen him write several times - I persued it a short time; I thought it very necessary I should examine it, if I was to speak about it - there don't appear to me to be any trace of his writing; it don't appear to me to resemble his writing at all - no part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the word "fired?" A. I never saw him write such a hand as that; I cannot call to my memory that I have seen him write as large as that word "fired" - I should call "fired" a round hand; I should call the rest a running hand; a moderate hand - it is not at all like the prisoner's hand-writing - I can form no judgment whether the person who wrote it disguised it; it don't appear to me to be disguised; I should say it was not a disguised hand.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are asked, whether it bears any trace of the prisoner's writing, were you obliged to read it through to see if it bore any trace or not, when it was shewn to you? A. Yes; when I went to see it this morning.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you in Court when the case was opened? A. Yes; I heard the order given for witnesses to go out of Court, and I retired immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have you not been inside that door since? A. Mr. Hobler's clerk brought me round there about eight or nine o'clock, while the case was going on for the prosecution; I staid five minutes or thereabouts- I did not take notice whether any witness was under examination - I was merely brought in to look at the letter; I had seen it in the morning - I was called in to see it, I don't know why; I had given an opinion of it in the morning - I did not look to see whether any witness was being examined.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you interested at all; whether the prisoner is convicted or acquitted, does it signify to you a farthing? A. Not a farthing - I am deaf - Mr. Hobler sent for me to come and look at the letter in Court - I went out after seeing the letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have the regulations, with regard to the Excise, respecting candles ceased? A. They ceased in January, 1832 - I had known the prisoner's hand-writing from the early part of March, 1831, to January, 1832 - I was in the habit of attending at Mr. Hale's during that interval, and seeing him write at times - I cannot charge my memory that I have seen him write since January, 1832 - I did not see him write anything but the notices I mentioned; there are five or six lines, and a few figures in the notices.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BEECH. The prisoner was in my service. (I live at No. 37, Lime-street, and am a tallow chandler), He had been employed a few days previous to the 4th of November; but I had not then taken him as a regular servant - he was taken into custody, on Tuesday evening, the 19th of November - he was about a fortnight in my service, and had commenced a third week - I had sent him for graves; (looking at his book) it was on Monday, the 18th, I should think, because I see the entry - it was on the evening of Monday, the 18th, the evening before he was taken into custody; I told him to purchase the graves on the road, at a place - he went with a box of candles, which he took to Atkinson's, Red Lion-street, Holborn;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280074"/>he would not have occasion to pass through Cannon-street in his way there; it was out of his way - I cannot say what time he returned home that night - I have had opportunities of seeing him write but little; I should say, this letter bears not the least resemblance to the writing I have in my possession - I do not, believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You never saw his writing till he came to you? A. No; he was with me about a fortnight; I have seen him write probably half-a-dozen times - my attention was not particularly called to his hand-writing during those half-dozen times; I am able to form a judgment of his writing from that - I believe from the writing I have seen of his, that the letter is not his handwriting; I have two notes of his in my pocket; I saw this letter this morning - I had the notes with me, but I did not compare them - I remembered having them in my possession; I took them from my desk yesterday - I had not seen them to the best of my knowledge, from the time I received them, till yesterday; I looked at them, knowing I was coming to look at this - I did not look at them again this morning, neither before I saw this nor after; they are in my pocket now; my opinion is not formed by comparing the writing and the two notes, it was governed by the writing in the letters, and what is in my book; it is formed in part by comparison of the writing and those letters, and of direction cards I have given him to write; I cannot form any opinion whether it is a disguised hand of the party who wrote it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the direction? A. I should say the direction of the letter is totally unlike his writing; I can produce a person who writes a very similar hand - he is not in my employ.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you see that direction first. A. This morning; and it occurred to me that I knew a person who wrote very much like it; I did not inform Mr. Hale of that; I should say the letter part of the letter seems huddled together more than the first, but there is a similarity in the whole; I cannot say the word "fired," at all resembles the prisoners writing - it is quite different - it is larger than I have seen him write; I consider it a fine hand-writing; I don't call this letter a good hand-writing by any means; he writes a good legible hand - I consider a good hand-writing, a bold hand; his is a good hand-writing, not a small running hand.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you lived in Lime-street? A. Nearly five years; I have no object in this case at all.</p>

            . I am a fishmonger, and live at Billingsgate; I have known the prisoner about fourteen years - I have seen him write numbers of times; I have no knowledge of the hand-writing of this letter - to the best of my belief, I should say it is not the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Don't you think it quite different? A. I think it different to his writing generally; I cannot tell whether it is disguised, but I should say it is not his hand-writing - to the best of my belief it is not his handwriting; I should call it a free tradesman's hand-writing, not particularly good; I think it is all written by the same person - I think it in some instances differs a little, but probably is all written by the same person; the direction I think seems rather to differ, but still I consider it the same writing; I consider the prisoner writes a very excellent hand - very superior to this; not a fine bold hand - what I consider a running hand, a genteel hand; I have never seen him write so large as the word "fired;" I have seen accounts of his, and have read numbers of letters from him, and never saw him write such a hand as that - nothing so careless as this; I saw this letter this evening for the first time in this court - I was not here when the case was opened - I heard the witnesses ordered out of court, and went out; I came in again and saw the letter and went out immediately - I suppose I was in court two or three minutes; that was the time given me to examine the letter, and quite sufficient; it is a very different hand from the prisoner's; I persued it, and believe it is not the prisoner's hand-writing; I could read the letter in half a minute; I have been outside the door walking up and down - I did not hear any witness examined - I heard part of one; I came into court and was issued out again; they said I had no business here; I did not know I should be called on this business; I came here to day myself at my own desire - I did not expect to be examined - I came into court as a spectator; I was not here before the case was opened; I suppose the witnesses were being called when I came in, which was between eight and nine o'clock; I heard some of the witnesses examined; I have been in and out two or three times: I did not know at that time I should be examined - I have not known it half an hour; I did not leave when the witnesses were ordered out of court; a gentleman asked if I was to be examined; I said I did not know; they said,"Are you coming to character;" I said, "If he wants one I shall give him one;" and when I said that, I withdrew; I believe I did not tell you just now, that I went out on hearing the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear you went out of Court when the witnesses were ordered out? A. Yes; and that was the prisoner's father, who asked if I was to be examined as a witness, and then told me to go out, and I went out - I did not know I was to be examined as a witness; I did not make more than one attempt to come in; the officer did not stop me; I came in for a moment; they said if I was to be examined as a witness to withdraw, and I then went partly out - I was outside the door; I heard part of what was going on in Court, and some I did not hear - the letter was shewn to me when I first came in, and I was ordered out again: I went out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been at Billingsgate? A. Sixteen years, I lodge at 97, Thames-street; I have not any interest in the issue - I was not in court five minutes after I was ordered out.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Does it appear to you to resemble it? A. Not at all; it appears to me to be a different hand - I do not write a good hand myself - the address and the letter I should say are the same hand - I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280075"/>certainly say the "F," of the word "fired" is not his; the"ired" does not appear to be at all like his - I saw this letter first about three quarters of an hour ago; I came in here to see it - I came here to do him good if I could; I was not aware whether I should be called or not.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you write yourself? A. Yes, I can write better than that - I had letters on different concerns from him; I cannot say when I have last received a letter from him; I have received one within the last year when he was in the country - it was a letter of thanks - I think he was in Kent, at Brighton, or Maidstone at the time; I think it was at Margate; I thanked him for his kindness - the letter came by the post; I think I paid 8d. for it; I think it was in June or July in the present year - I know he was in Giltspur-street Compter; I cannot say whether that was in July - I cannot say when I received the letter from him; I cannot say how many I have received altogether from him; I will swear I have received more than two, I will not say three; they were only respecting our friendship; I knew him perfectly well - I have seen him write several times within the last four or five weeks; I saw him write last when he was at my house - I cannot say the exact time; he wrote different letters at my house- he wrote for himself; I cannot say what business he was writing on - I looked at the letters he wrote; I did not read any of them, of course they were about business- he was not particularly in the habit of writing letters at my house - I live at No. 5, West-street, Borough - it was just at the time he entered Mr. Beech's employ - he came over to my house to sleep sometimes, and wrote letters at my house - I cannot say how many times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. HALE, Sen. Q. Do you happen to know that the prisoner was at Margate and Dover about July? A. No; he was in Giltspur-street Compter - he was in that neighbourhood about the beginning of June.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. He is my only son - I have known his hand-writing from childhood, but have not been much in the habit of seeing him write lately; he has been a long while away from me - I have a letter of his - I have not seen him write for years.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am a single woman, and live with my father and mother, at Maze-pond, Borough. The prisoner is a married man - I have seen him write twice- my father is a porter in Queen-street, and my mother is a monthly nurse - I have received several letters from him but have destroyed them - it is about two months ago, that I saw him write; as far as I am able to judge this is a different hand-writing to his - I do not consider either the address or the letter at all like his.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. After the witnesses were ordered out, did you come in, and sit in the corner? A. The clerk brought me and my mother in, to look at the letter, and we were ordered out - I do not think I was in Court three minutes - on my oath, I was not here a quarter of an hour - a gentleman held up the letter, and there was some altercation about our being in; the officer spoke to the clerk about bringing us in - I do not think we were two minutes looking at the letter, and went out again directly - I saw instantly it was not his hand-writing - I did not come inside afterwards, nor attempt to; I have been outside all the evening - the letters he wrote me were to invite me to parties; I have been to about four parties of that sort; I have four times received letters from him, to come to meet a few friends of his - the four letters were to the same purport - I did not go to all four parties; I went once to the christening of the child, about three years ago, and I had one letter about four months ago; that was to go with my cousin to see him when he was in the Compter before; that was the last - I cannot really say what was in the letter - it was to ask me to come and see him with my cousin, who is his wife.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. I am satisfied Mr. Hale meant nothing improper in coming into Court, though it was my duty to sift the matter; I have every reason to believe him to be a gentleman of perfect honour and integrity.</p>

On the 19th November, about nine o'clock in the evening; I came out to buy myself a pair of shoes, and a pound of sugar - I fell in with Beeson, whom I knew by sight, but not by name - he spoke to me first, and asked where I was going - I said, "I don't know I am going round this way home" - we walked on and talked, and I asked him to have a drop of half and half, which we did - when we came out, we met Cooper, who was a stranger to me, but he knew Beeson, and they talked together - I don't know what they said - I went to a grocer's shop to fetch my sugar and shoes which I had left there till I came back - I went with the prisoner to a public-house, and we had some gin which I paid for as I was going to leave them - I then crossed to get my sugar and shoes, and said to the prisoners good night, but they followed me to <placeName id="t18331128-85-crimeloc492">Maida-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ROWE. Q. Had you never seen Cooper till that night? A. No, I met him then accidentally in the street - I had been at the Phoenix public-house that evening - that was where I had the half and half with Beeson - I asked him to go there as he was out of place - we had a pint of half and half there, and I had a drop of gin which a butcher gave me, because he knew Beeson - we tossed for a pot of beer, but I did not toss for gin with the butcher - we then went to a public-house at the corner of Bell-street - I don't know the sign - it is not the Key - Cooper had not been in the first public-house with us, we met him in the street, and then we went into the second public-house, which I should think is half a mile from the Phoenix - we had one quartern of gin there - it is not true that we had three or four quarterns - I did not toss for gin there - I did not apply to the landlord for more gin, and he refuse me - I was not exactly tipsy - my master lives at Beaufort-terrace, near Pineapple-gate.</p>

             (police-sergeant D 6). I met with the prosecutor on the night in question - he was a little the worse for liquor, but perfectly sensible; and he recognised the prisoners the moment I put them before him - he had described them, but not to me - I saw the prisoners go into the Key public-house, in Bell-street, and from his description, I thought they were the persons - I went into the Edgware-road, and saw the prosecutor - I asked if he had been robbed; he said, "Yes;" I took him to the key - I saw Cooper there, but I could not see Beeson - I looked about, and found him concealed under a table - I desired him to come out three times, but he did not - I put my hand to take him, and he rolled out - I said"You are very drunk - you were not drunk three minutes ago" - I took him up and these shoes were between his legs- I then took Cooper, and took his hat off, and in it was a parcel of sugar, I suppose a pound - I was searching for the handkerchief, and the sugar was gone in a moment - I took the prisoners out, and when we got to the corner of James-street, Cooper got away - I gave Beeson to another officer, and went back and found Cooper in Little James-street, making great resistance - he struck me, got me down, and kicked me; the prosecutor came to my assistance - we were both very ill used - he was very violent - I got from him and sprung my rattle; another man came up and he was secured - he made great resistance indeed - I was laid up for five days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prosecutor very drunk? A. He was the worse for liquor, but he could walk very well - I saw the sugar in Cooper's hat, but it was gone in a minute - it was screwed up, but I could see at one end that it was sugar - Cooper was coming out of the public-house as we went in - I said, "I want you," and he went back and sat down.</p>

             (police-constable D 130). I was on duty and went with Sergeant Horsford to the Key - Cooper was coming out - the sergeant said, "I want you," and he went back; I took Cooper out, as soon as we got out, he said, "D-n your eyes don't collar me and I will walk;" he walked till we came to Little Queen-street, and then ran off; I overtook him, and he struck and kicked me in a dreadful manner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the sugar in his hat? A. Yes, and an old handkerchief, but not the prosecutor's handkerchief; that has not been found - the sugar was snatched away, and a little was spilt on the table.</p>

I believe between eight and nine months - he has, by chance, had a pair or two of shoes made to measure - he told me had some kid skins, at a time when I wanted some, and I had a few of them of him; I paid him 3s. more for them than I was giving at the warehouse for them - I had some satin uppers of him - I have pawned my own things in my own name, but never in the name of Brown - when the prisoner was taken, he gave up his bunch of keys, and offered every facility for searching his place - he said, he lived at No. 13, Phoenix-street, and he has asked me to come there; if I had gone there, I might have seen anything that might have been there, but I had no suspicion.</p>

I said, "You should not drive a blind mare too fast down hill" - he had taken his hand out of my breeches at that time and put it into my left waistcoat pocket; in a moment or two he tried to clasp hold of my legs and I whipt my legs under the seat of the cart; he caught hold of them, and chucked me right out of the cart on my head; and no more did I see Coupe after that; I had five half-crowns in this left hand waistcoat-pocket; I know I had them safe when I paid the ostler; I gave him 6d. and 3d.; no one had been with me but the prisoner, and my money was gone out of my pocket; I saw no more of him after he chucked me out on my head - there was a person went to the place the next morning to look for my money, and he could not find it - I got up as soon as I could and went to the Coach and Horses which is the nearest house; I could not make any body hear, and I got into the road again and got home as well as I could, with my blind mare; Mr. Clark the magistrate, and Mr. Edghill, came to me the next day; the patrole followed the prisoner and took him, but I cannot say when, as I was ill in bed, in consequence of my fall, and the cut on my head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now I warn you, I have twelve witnesses here; at what rate were you going with this blind mare before you were chucked out? A. Eight or nine miles an hour - I might tell the magistrate that the wheel went over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you tell him so? A. No, I could not tell him that, so as I was hurt; I might say that when the magistrate first came to me; I dare say I was sworn - I did not state to him that the wheel went over my head; I was not asked the question - I did not tell the magistrate at the first examination, that the wheel went over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said read over to you? A. Yes - I put no mark; I think I did not put any mark; I don't think they asked me; I shall not swear whether I did or no - I think I told the magsistrate I had five half-crowns and a shilling in my pocket; I could not tell them at the first examination; I was too ill; I was all but a dead man - I should think I was a mile and a quarter from home, when I was chucked out; I did not go to any public-house; I walked home, and led my mare home; I could not get into the cart; I got up as soon as I could, and cried "Wohey" to my mare; I was as sensible as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say when you got home, that you had left 75l. in the hands of Mr. Wells? A. If I did say so, my pain was so great I did not know what I did say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pain so great on the third examination, that you did not know what you said? A. Yes, at times; but the magistrate came up-stairs, and did not ask me whether I was well or unwell; I did not give them long answers, to the extent of two or three pages - it was on Uxbridge fair-day I was chucked out of my cart - I might he examined on the 18th of October, I cannot say - I might be examined on the 28th; I was examined three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the prisoner's hand in your left breeches-pocket, what did you say to him? A. I said,"Coupe, what are you at, ar'nt you a fool?" and then he clasped hold of my legs, and threw me out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you felt Coupe's hand all over your pockets, and in all your pockets? A. Yes; I had papers in all my pockets, and they were taken out; I did not tell the magistrate so on the first examination - he put his hand in my left breeches pocket, and then in my left waistcoat-pocket; he then crossed his hand and put it into my right breeches-pocket, and then in my right coat-pocket; probably he might put his hand into my other coat-pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you doing all this time? A. I did not study nor think he meant to rob me; I knew the young fellow well, and I thought he was only on his larks, but I lost my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear in the outset, that after he had put his hand in your breeches, and in your waistcoat-pockets, that he then chucked you out; what do you mean by now swearing that he put his hand in your other pockets? A. He had rifled all of them before - I told the magistrate the wheel went over my head - I told you the cart was going eight or nine miles an hour, and so it was; the wheel went gently over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart and horse before you when you cried, "Wohey?" A. Why I was along with it; the mare stopped when I was chucked out, and I clambered hold of the cart, and that set the mare going; no doubt of that - I had been to more than one or two public-houses looking after my business - I know Richard Green of the King's-arms; I don't know that I was there at all that day; if I was there, I paid for what I drank - I was at the Falcon; I took money and paid money all the morning- I had some mild beer at the Falcon, that was all - I was at the George, I drank some beer there and had a good dinner and some wine - I was at the Sun; I drank a small glass of gin there, but no rum: I don't know what I paid, it was the regular charge - I went to Mr. Smith's beer-shop; I found a man there, and had a deal with him; I was not drunk all day; I had no fight with a man named Brill - I mentioned two or three words to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner requested to interfere, and take you away from the crowd? A. No; I remember going to the George-inn, and the landlady said, "Bill, I think you had better not have any more beer;" I did not make any answer - I don't know that I said before the magistrate, that I did not touch a drop of spirits during the whole of that day; the magistrate did not ask me - I did not dance with the prisoner or anybody that night; I might stand outside the dancers and see them dance - I don't remember standing in the middle and the prisoner dancing round me - Ann Langford might be at the dance, but I did not notice her; I cannot resolve how many people were at the dance, nor what time it was; it was not a great while before I went home - I did say that I left 75l. in the hand of Harry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280079"/>Wells, but I did not know what I did say - I walked home more than a mile after I was chucked out; I missed my money the next morning - I have not been drinking this morning; I have only had a cup of coffee, some toast, some beef, and a glass of beer.</p>

             (police-constable G 183). I was going my round, past the prosecutor's shop, at two o'clock in the morning, and saw a hackney-coach start from the rank, and go down the City-road - I saw three men follow the coach from the same side as Mr. Hill's shop; they did not seem to have shining buttons on their cloths; I went round my beat, and found Mr. Hill's shop-door open, and gave the alarm - I had seen the prisoners Pott and Langham at one o'clock, in Red-lion-court or passage, which is four doors from the prosecutor's shop - I asked them what they wanted there; they said, something to drink, and they tapped at the door of the public-house; they then went out of the court, and I followed them; they went to the front-door of the public-house, in St. John's-street-road; they stood there, and I went down my beat, and they went down before me and endeavoured to conceal their faces; I told them it was of no use; (I think I had seen them before) they crossed, and went down Pentonville-road - Pott had a dark great coat on, and a shawl-handkerchief muffled round his neck; it was a white ground with dark spots on it - some time after that I met him again between Goswell-road and St. John-street-road, nearly opposite the Angel; he was there without the handkerchief, but he had the great coat on, open to the two lower buttons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What were you before you were an officer? A. A shoemaker; I left that about four years ago, and entered the police - I think I had seen Pott before, in or about the neighbourhood of Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I warn you that I have several witnesses here to contradict you; when had you seen him? A. Within six months; I cannot tell what month; I did not pay that attention to take notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the oath you have taken, did you, when you were first before the magistrate, say one word about seeing Pott in Red-lion-passage? A. I did not think of it; I did not see them properly; I only saw one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word about it? A. I knew they would be remanded, and that was my reason for not saying it - I did not hear it stated before the magistrate that Pott and his friends could prove he was in another place.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you mean to confine yourself to the answer you have just given, that the reason why you did not state that you saw Pott in Red-lion-passage was, because you knew he would be remanded, or that you did not think of it? A. I did not recollect it; I did not say I did not know Pott; I said, I did not know his name.</p>

On the 16th of October, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw a man go into No. 8, Lower West-street, with a bundle, but from the distance I was, I could not describe the person or the bundle - I afterwards saw two persons go into the house, one in a light great coat, the other in a black or dark coat; Coppin lived in that house; I had seen all the prisoners before - Hopkins had been fighting an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever in Coppin's house? A. No; it is a lodging-house - I never was at Leeds in my life - I was not born in the country, and never was there but for a little pleasure; I was born in London, and have lived here for seventeen years.</p>

On the 16th of October, about half-past two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty and saw a yellow bodied coach stop at the corner of West-street, in Smithfield; I saw three men get out; one was a short man in a kind of a dark dress; I took it to be a black coat - another had a light drab great coat with pockets at the sides, which was very much like the one that Coppin had on at Hatton-garden; and I think the other had a kind of light fustian jacket on; they went down West-street, as far as the gates of the workhouse; and then the one in the dark dress ran back into Smithfield again after the hackney-coach, which had started and gone towards Smithfield-bars.</p>

At a quarter before three o'clock that morning, I was coming down Saffron-hill, and saw a man going up West-street, till he came to Coppin's house, and went in; I went down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280080"/>to the City-bounds, and returned and went up West-street; I saw Coppin at his door in his shirt sleeves; as I passed he drew his head in and said, "Whist, whist, there is a policeman coming;" I passed on till I came to the City-watchman, I stood talking with him a few minutes, and a man came out of Coppin's door in dark clothes; he went up Black-boy Alley; I informed my sergeant; he returned in about two hours with another sergeant; he said as there was no order to break the door open they could not do it; but they knocked at the door about five o'clock and no entrance was allowed; I went to No. 12, and asked to go over the houses; I found three umbrellas on the roof of No. 12 and No. 9; I afterwards got into Coppin's and found Coppin, Langham, and Hopkins there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say there were no other persons in the house? A. There was a little child there; I know the house is a common brothel - I have spoken of it, but have not given notice to Colonel

            . I was a police-constable at that time. I went to Coppin's house and knocked at the door, about five o'clock in the morning; I did not get admission - I looked through the key-hole and saw a man in his shirt run through the passage with a candle in his hand - I got admission through No. 7, and got to the back of the house - I saw a person look over the wall in the yard, who, I believe, was Pott; I saw Pott again in the custody of Beadle, about half-past ten, and I believed him to be the same man, I had seen look over the wall - I have known him ever since the beginning of May, and have scarcely been two nights on my beat without seeing him - he said he had come from Deptford on the night of the robbery at half-past ten o'clock; and he denied having been at Coppin's at all - nothing was found on him - when I entered Coppin's house I asked him why he did not admit me when I knocked at the door, but I did not stop to hear his answer - I went into the yard and found this skeleton key, this drop latch key, this dark lantern, and this memorandum book; in the front room I found this crow bar; and in attending on the nightmen, to empty the privy, I found this pick-lock, this piece of pewter, this halfpenny, and two sixpences - I did not find these umbrellas, but assisted Beadle to take care of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear that Pott was the man you saw in the yard? A. I believe him to be the man; I will swear positively he is the man - I have known him five months - I saw him as distinctly as I see you now - it was half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 16th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I have four persons here to contradict you, will you swear it was him? A. Yes; I am a bricklayer by trade; I left the police on the 16th of this month - I left to suit myself - there was no complaint against me for neglect of duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, was there not a complaint against you? A. Not when I left; there had been complaints against me before, the same as other men - they were various; I believe there were five reports against me, but not for being drunk nor neglecting my duty; I was twice reported by the A division - one was for being in a public-house, when called to do my duty - the next was for standing talking to a fellow-policeman that was dismissed; the next report was when I was in the M division; I and the sergeant had a few words, but that was dismissed; I was again reported for being absent from duty, from nine till twelve o'clock - it was not for neglect of duty - I was fined 1s. for that; I believe there was not another report against me - I will swear there were not many more - there were not two more; whether there was one I don't know; I have had two reports this year; one in the beginning of the year; I cannot tell when the second was - I believe it was in July or August; it was in the summer - I did not hear Pott state where he had been; I saw him searched, and this pocket book and this knife were found on him, and a watch and a brooch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this what you called a dark lantern? A. It is part of a dark lanthorn; there were four persons I believe lived in Coppin's house at that time; there were three women in the second-floor back room; there was no man there - there is no empty house adjoining Coppin's - there is a house next door to his which is not inhabited, but it belongs to a man who lives at the next house.</p>

             (police-constable C 72). I was coming down Chapel-street, on the evening stated. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner; he called me, and gave charge of her for robbing him of a sovereign and some silver; he was the worse for liquor; he said he had given her 2s.; she said yes, but she had bought a quartern of rum, and had 1s. 6d. left, which was all she had in the world; I took her to the station-house - I heard something fall, I took the candle, and found it was a sovereign - I then found 14s. on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not say I had no money - I said none but my own. Witness. She said the 1s. 6d. was every farthing she had in the world, and I was welcome to search her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I met by appointment a friend of mine. He was going into the country, and before we parted he gave me 1l. 14s. As I was going home I met my prosecutor at the bottom of Princes-street, where he accosted me, and being very tipsy, he took hold of me, saying, I should not go till I had had something to drink with him, which we had: he then asked me to take him as far as Oxford-street; being so tipsy, and my way home, I consented, and we went together. He then would not let me go till we went to a public-house, where he asked for some rum, but I persuaded him not to drink it; he however pulled out his money to pay for it, which he threw on the counter. He had a great deal of silver, and a half-sovereign. I did not see any of his money fall, though he said he had lost a sovereign; he then sent for a policeman and gave me in charge, being so tipsy he could not remember what he did. At the station-house he said, if I would have paid for the rum, he would not have not said any thing about it; I did pay for it, for he gave me 2s. for that purpose.</p>

             - I went with Mr. Davies to Spithead last month, and saw that person who went by the name of James Smith on board the ship Fairley, with a convict's dress on; I knew him to be the man whom I took on board the Providence on the 24th of July - as soon as he and this prisoner came on board the Providence; the prisoner said to the boatman, "You have no reason to complain, you are well paid, I have given you fourteen sovereigns" - I then said to the prisoner and his companion, "Why did you pay fourteen sovereigns for a boat, when you might have got on board for 6d.?" - the prisoner said, he could dispose of his own money as he thought fit - I had seen that ship leave the harbour about ten o'clock, and they came on board about two hours and a half afterwards - I saw their boat come from Cross Haven, which is a little to the right of the Cove of Cork; as you come out the vessel lay to the right of the Cove of Cork, and their boat came from the same side - I also asked the prisoner, why he had cut off his whiskers, and he said, he might dispose of his own person as he thought fit, and he might cut all the hair off his head if he liked - I said, he was there under very suspicious circumstances, and from the nature of his answers, I did not think right to permit him to go to America - I searched him, and found one hundred and thirty one sovereigns upon him, and four sovereigns were found in the other man's boot - I then took them on shore, and they were examined before Major Miller, the magistrate for four counties - the prisoner was examined; this is his deposition in the magistrate's own hand-writing, and the prisoner signed it - I took him for no crime, but only under suspicious circumstances; I was on board the ship looking for some murderers - after the prisoner had signed this deposition, the magistrate remanded him to make inquiries, and he was afterwards dismissed - I think in about a fortnight; I afterwards saw him on board the Julius Caesar, a barque bound for New York; this was on the 28th of September - I desired him to get out of his bed, which he was in, in his clothes, and I took him on a charge of forging a cheque for £300 in London, and told him that his comrade, who had given himself the name of James Smith had been already taken - I desired the prisoner to get up in the name of

A police-constable - Cross Haven is a little bay in the sea; there are plenty of houses there; if a person had slept there, or gone there, he might take a boat to go after a ship; the ship was sailing when I went on board, but she laid too for me; she then kept sailing on, and laid too again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280084"/>for their boat; if she had not, I do not suppose they would ever have overtaken her; they could not tell how far the boat would have to go before they overtook the ship - they might have stepped from the quay the night before for 6d. - when I took the prisoner before the magistrate, I stated that I had been on board to look for murderers; and it was afterwards that the prisoner made his statement - too many of our countrymen go to America, and it is usual when they go to sell all they have and take the money with them - I should think Major Miller made every inquiry respecting the prisoner's statement, but he was set at large in about a fortnight.</p>

             - I knew him at that time; he was clerk to Mr. Hart - he called two or three times at the house, I cannot say which - he called to ask if there were any more letters left.</p>

               <p>Q. For who? A. For Hart; if there were any more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280085"/>letters left in the name of Smith I suppose - when Hart called it was to ask if there was a letter - I know the postman but not by name - I have never seen Atcheson meet him - I saw Hart take a letter one day at the door, but not inside the door - it was about a week after the conversation about furnishing the room - it was within a fortnight - he took the letter at the door from the postman - I never saw but one letter taken by Hart, and the one sent to him - I knew his name was Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how you came to take in a letter by the name of Smith? A. Neither myself nor Mrs. Tucker expected any letters, and I presumed it was for Hart, and sent it down to him - I did not take the letter in myself; I called after that at Hart's, in Mornington Crescent - it was after Hart had met the postman at the door - I found him there, and had some conversation with him respecting the letter I sent him; I thought it very improper if he wished letters addressed to the house to stop the postman in the street and take them; because the neighbour's noticed it - (I had not observed the neighbours notice it, but it was named to me by persons in the house) I really do not know the reply that was made - I did not think I should come before a tribunal about it, and did not take dates or anything - we had a conversation of a few minutes - I do not know what passed- it was of no moment at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hart say when you said it was improper to stop the postman in the street? A He might laugh it off or something; it was tantamount to saying it was of no detriment to the house, or something; I really do not know what it was - he said, "Oh, that can make no difference," or something.</p>

Morton - after I sent the letter, I saw the prisoner at the bar, at the Swan Inn, at Alton, in Hampshire, which is eight miles from my house - I had some conversation with him - I did not accost him by any name - no name was mentioned - I think not - I asked him if he could accommodate me with from one to £5000. and at what interest - the newspaper was not there - I merely said I came to ask him if he could accommodate me with a sum of money - I rather think I began the conversation - he asked me who I was; I told him I was the son of Sir

            , and that I had £60,000. in the funds, upon which I wished to raise the money; that £60,000. is vested in trust, so that it might form a security, but could not be taken out and sold - he told me he thought he could accommodate me with the £5000. - I asked him at what rate of interest he could lend it to me - the answer was that I should have it at six per cent, and that I might keep the money as long as I chose, provided I paid the interest half-yearly - he then produced ten blank stamps and asked me to accept them; he produced them from his own pocket; I do not know that he gave any reason why I was to accept them - he did not say what was to be done with them when accepted, that I recollect - I wrote on them first of all "payable at Messrs. Praed's and Co." and omitted to sign my name - nothing was written on the stamps except the words I wrote - I do not know what was to be done with them - I did not authorise him to do anything with them - I do not remember his assigning any reason for my writing on them - I had made an appointment with him to go over to the Inn, because I wanted to raise the money - in consequence of the advertisement, I wrote a letter addressed to Morton, University-street, and had a letter in answer to it - I have not got it - I have lost it - I have looked for it and have not found it - there was no allusion made to that letter in the conversation I had with him at the Swan, that I know of - the name of Morton was mentioned several times by the prisoner; he said he was sorry Mr. Morton could not attend himself; that he had sent him in consequence - I saw nobody but the prisoner about the business; I gave him the ten pieces of paper with"payable at Praed's" written on them, and he made them £500. each at his own suggestion - he asked me what sum the ten bills should be and said "I think we will make them £500. each" - he wrote on the papers in figures "£500" in ink - these are some of the papers which I gave him (looking at them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Point to the place where he wrote anything on them at that time? A. I fancied he wrote on them: he certainly made the observation that they should be £500 each - I do not see anything here that he wrote at that time - I wrote on them "payable at Praed's and Co. No. 189, Fleet-street," - that was all I had written on them at that time - since then some stir has been made about this affair and some of the bills have been returned to me - I received a letter signed T. Morton, which first called my attention to the mistake I had made in omitting to sign my name to the acceptances - this is the letter I received.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live at No. 30, Upper North-place, Gray's-inn-road. I know the prisoner - I have one or two occasions had opportunities of seeing him write, and have received letters from him, and acted on them, and have seen his affidavits - I believe this letter, signed J. Morton, to be the handwriting of Mr. Hart - I believe these other three letters and this memorandum to be his hand-writing - they are all in a feigned hand, but I believe them to be his writing(See documents Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).</p>
               <p>FRANCIS DUGDALE ASTLEY re-examined. In consequence of receiving that letter, (No. 2.) I saw the prisoner- he mentioned that I had omitted to sign my name - he produced the ten pieces of paper which I had given him - it was several days after I had first given them to him- when he produced them, I signed them, and returned them to him; he did not say anything to me about what was to be done with them; he merely said, he would send the money in two or three days, by the mail - I signed my name to all them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I see on the bills above your name there is the word "accepted;" when was that written? A. That was written by me, at the time, I signed my name, I think.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You wrote the word "accepted" at the time you wrote your name? A. I did; I did not receive a farthing of money - I think I wrote to University-street, on not receiving the money - I think this letter(looking at it,) was the first intimation, I received, respecting my bills. (No. 3.) In the meantime I had received these other three letters.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving the letter, signed Dimsdale, did you go to town? A. I did; I went to No. 35, University-street - I did not find any such person there as Morton, or anybody, answering to that name - I also inquired at No. 34; I was told at No. 35 there had been a person of the name of Morton residing there; that there had been a gang in the house - I saw a woman; I believe I had at that time received some other letters - I then went to my bankers, Messrs. Praed &amp; Co. and by their advice I went to a solicitor to assist me in the business - no money has been demanded of me in payment of the bills- I did not see the prisoner, from the time I saw him at my own place, until very lately - the only inquiry I made was at University-street - I employed a person to search after him under the direction of my solicitor - five of the bills have been returned me - I did not pay a farthing for them - the others have not been returned, but I know where they are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I believe it was in July last year? A. July this year; at my interview with the prisoner, at the inn, I wrote across the paper, "payable at Praed's, &amp; Co., 189, Fleet-street, London" - after that interview, it turned out that I had forgotten to put my name, and we had another interview, at which, I put my name, and the word accepted; there was nobody present but the prisoner - it did not occupy long - some little time after I put my name, I wrote to the prisoner requesting him to send me £500 - I afterwards had some communication with a gentleman, named Smith, about one of the £500 bills, to know whether or not he would have a reference to some body in town, about my validity- this letter is my hand-writing - it was written in consequence of Smith's having applied to me for a reference in town, as to the validity of one of the £500 bills - it is dated 11th August - the bills were signed 2nd August; I wrote on them on the 27th of July.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the communication you had with Smith, by letter? A. Yes. (Letter read No. 7.)</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Now, is that bill one of the ten you gave the prisoner? A. It is; I told him I had £60,000 in the bank, on which the bills might be secured, which would be responsible for them - I am sure I did not state that I had got £60,000 by my wife, and out of that those bills were to be paid - I had not funds sufficient at my bankers at the time the acceptances were given, to take them up, nor had I the means of providing it except in this way - my applying in this way to get money was only to pay other debts.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some time before that you had been making a settlement with your creditors? A. The only settlement I was about to make was with Smart; there were outstanding bills on which there was an understanding that there was a composition made, or to be made.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were those outstanding bills, bills for money or goods advanced by tradesmen, or quite of another description? A. They were gambling transactions; Smart had bills of mine quite independent of these ten bills, to the amount of £2500 - some of those bills were for £500.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do you mean to say, when you wrote the letter, saying, if Smith presented a bill it was genuine, you referred to one of the ten bills, or one Smart held independently of you? A. I referred to one of the ten bills which was in the possession of Smith, who had written to me; I never saw it in his possession - I stated if Smart presented it, it was a genuine bill - I had no expectation of being called upon to honour the bills, at the end of two months - the prisoner told me, as long as I paid six per cent. for the forbearance, they might continue outstanding - the £500 I applied to the prisoner about was in part of the £5000 he had promised me.</p>

            . In June, July, and August I was a General Post-office letter carrier for the district in which University-street, Bedford-square, is situated - in the course of those three months I had letters directed to No. 35, University-street; I met one person only once, to whom I delivered the letters; but I met another person frequently, in North-crescent, which is not a great distance from University-street - I do not remember ever meeting a person in University-street; the name of the person who came but once was Morton - a person named Atcheson came with the person who described himself as Morton.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know the person was Morton? A. He asked if I had letters directed to Morton; I delivered letters to him then, and many times afterwards to Atcheson - those letters were directed to Morton, University-street - I firmly believe the prisoner to be the person who described himself as Morton - I received the postage for the letters on delivery, in the street - I remem<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280087"/>ber on one occasion having a letter with the Alton postmark on it; I do not remember the date.</p>

               <p>The following are the documents referred to in the evidence.</p>
               <p>No. 1. Twenty thousand pounds. - Money to lend. - A gentleman retired from business has this sum unemployed, with the addition of a larger one in the funds, ready immediately to lend upon the promissory notes, bills of exchange, or other good personal security of gentlemen or persons of respectability, either in one or more sums, who require but temporary assistance, who may feel desirous to avoid the expense of effecting morgages on their property. Terms for short periods four and a half per cent. Particulars, stating amount required, time, and every other information are requested to be made in the first instance, by letter, post paid, to Mr. T. Morton, No. 35, University-street, Bedford-square, London, which will be received in strict confidence, and meet early attention if approved."</p>
               <p>No. 2."Sir, - In consequence of some little irregularity in what took place between us when last here, it is requisite I should see you again, in order to rectify it, prior to a final settlement; as I considered it preferable to have a personal interview, rather than communicate my wishes by letter. I came here at some little inconvenieuce for this purpose. It is totally out of my power to comply with your request, of remaining until to-morrow, as I have to go into Kent. I will endeavour to come down again between this and Saturday next, but you shall hear from me first, your obedient servant, J. M." To F. D. Astley, esq.</p>
               <p>No. 3, was also addressed by J. M. to Mr. Astley, without date, requesting that if either of the bills should be referred to him, he would state that they were his hand writing, and would be attended to; but not to enter into the particulars of the transacction, by attention to which, matters would be finally settled on the following Thursday.</p>

               <p>No. 4."Sir, - My arrival here was delayed on my way to town, until this afternoon, and that is why you have not heard from me before. I am sorry that I shall not be able finally to complete your business, until the latter end of this week. I have to be at Southampton on Saturday next, and will meet you at the Swan at Alton, on that day, at 1 o'Clock. You say in the letter I found here, that it is your intention to be in London, either on Thursday or Friday next; but I suppose his was upon the supposition that you would not see me at Alton again. I shall be from home almost all the time, until I see you; as I leave early to-morrow, I may possibly be at Alton before Saturday, in which case I will send over to you, and should you be out, leave word where you are gone to, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J.

I shall be on my return home about Wednesday next, and shall come by the way of Alton purposely to see you. On my arrival at the Swan I will despatch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280088"/>a messenger to you, as you said you did not wish me to come to the house, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J. M.</p>
               <p>To F. D. Astley, esq,</p>
               <p>No. 6. The postman is requested to leave all letters to Mr. Moreton, 35, University Street, at No. 4, Gower Place, Bedford-square, J. M.</p>
               <p>To T. Smith, esq. 21, Austin-friars, 11th August.</p>
               <p>No. 7. Sir, - If the bill you allude to, was presented by Mr. Smart, No. 12, Brydges Street, Covent Garden, I have no doubt it is quite correct; though a sight of it previous to its being discounted, would be satisfactory to me, as I am compelled to be very cautious in my pecuniary affairs.</p>

At six o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of July, I missed a mare which had been turned into the field the night before at five or six o'clock - the field is enclosed; we could see where she had been tied to a gate, and had broken it all to pieces in struggling, and broken the gate down, and after that she was taken away, and a horse at the same time - I have seen her since at Queen-square, about a month ago in the possession of Webster; it was the same mare as I lost I am certain - she was in good condition when she was taken away; when I saw her she was in a very bad condition.</p>

In July last I was on duty in Middlesex-mews, Lisson-grove; on a Thursday or Friday morning, the latter end of the month (I cannot say the date,) I saw the prisoner Dawes there; Griffiths is a stable keeper in the mews - it was about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning; Dawes was riding a bay horse or mare into the mews; he said to me,"What do you think of this little thing; I went away from here at twelve o'clock, and have been twenty-seven miles since?" the mare was a small size, the exact size and colour that Mr. Smith had described; she appeared to be very much distressed, and in great heat - he went and knocked at Griffiths' stable-door, the door was opened, and the mare put in, and he went in, and in about four or five minutes there was a black horse driven in in a green chaise-cart - I did not see Griffiths when the mare was put in; I noticed it, but did nothing - the black horse appeared in great distress and great heat; the hair was clotted with dirt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Griffiths keeps a livery stable? A. Yes; I knew him before, for about three weeks or a month; I was in my police dress - Dawes could see I was an officer; I never saw him before.</p>

            . I live in Fox's-lane, Shadwell. On the 23rd of November, I received my wages, and went to a public-house with a friend; my wages were tied up in a bit of rag; there was half a sovereign, and three half-crowns, and I put them in my left-hand trowsers pocket; we drank there, and I went to pay for it, the prisoner came in; she knew my acquaintance, and we went and had some beer in her house; my friend then went to the door, and the light was blown out, and five or six women came in and began to beat me; my pocket was torn out and the money fell on the floor; they picked up the three half-crowns, but the officer got the half-sovereign - I caught hold of the prisoner, and kept her, and sung out, "murder;" the policeman came in; I went up stairs with the prisoner but nothing passed between us; I gave her 6d.; the officer asked me who I accused; I said, "This woman, and the old woman of the house."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me the expence of the house; I told him the price and 6d. for the servant; he then took me up stairs, and I put out the candle, and his expressions were dreadful. Witness. I gave her 6d.; she asked for no more.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did she make any demand for money which you refused to give her? A. No; she took the light in her hand up-stairs, and blew it out directly the door was shut; we were sitting on the bed-side together; she seized my pocket, and called for the old woman, and five or six came in.</p>

             (police-constable K 160). I was called about two o'clock in the morning, by a female who appeared to come from the house; I went up-stairs with three females; I found the prisoner, the woman who keeps the brothel, and the prosecutor there; he said, he had been robbed of a half-sovereign, and three half-crowns; I asked him to pick out the person; he picked out the prisoner and the landlady; I searched the prisoner and found on her two sixpences and some half-pence; I then heard something chink on the floor, the prisoner stooped, picked it up and put it into her mouth; I seized her mouth, opened it, and she dropped this half-sovereign on the floor, which my brother officer took up; there was blood on the prisoner, and the prosecutor; the prisoner had a tremendous blow over her eye, and the prosecutor had a blow on his face, and his trowsers were torn.</p>

My son was never in that house where the spoon was lost from; I live at No. 106, and he lived there, but the spoon was lost from the other house No. 104, where the prisoner lived; it is let out in apartments; my son is about seventeen; I never said he took it; he had not been in that house for a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

This is Mr. Mc Lellan's spoon; he has five more marked the same as this; they were in my care; on the Wednesday before the prisoner left I locked up the six spoons in a drawer; she left on Saturday the 2nd of November; she said, she should leave; Mrs. Mc Lellan's son used to come there, but he had not been for a fortnight or three weeks before she left; he was offended about something; I don't know what; he used to speak to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280091"/>me before that, but he never said anything to her; I don't know whether he had any quarrel with her; I don't think he had; the drawer the spoons were in, was in the front kitchen; I had put down the keys, and the prisoner might have gone to them; she had been with me in that house about three weeks.</p>

            , Jun. Defence (written). I left my situation through the cook's beating me, and turning me out of the house; I went home to my mother, who returned with me, and insisted on my staying until my mistress came home, when it was agreed I should leave as soon as my week was expired, which I did. My mother came for me on Saturday evening, November the 2nd. The cook and my mistress were both in the kitchen. I fetched my box, and my mother emptied it before them, and they said there was nothing there belonging to them. My mistress asked the cook if the spoons were all right, she said they were. My mistress paid me, and I went home. On the following Tuesday, November the 5th, a policeman came and said Mrs. Mc Lellan wished to speak with me. I went with him immediately; when she charged me with stealing a table-spoon, which I knew nothing about. I was then taken to Hatton-garden, and remanded until Friday, the 8th instant, when I was re-examined and discharged. The next night the policeman came to my mother's lodgings and asked her to let him see her duplicates, which he had seen before, when he kept two of them. They were two pocket handkerchiefs which Mrs. Mc Lellan said I had stolen, and my mother received, which I deny. One of them I pledged in the afternoon of the day that I went to Mrs. Mc Lellan's, after ten o'clock at night, on Saturday, July the 20th; nor did I see my mother for a week afterwards. After I had been at Mrs. McLellan's some little time, my mistress sent me on several occasions both to pledge and to redeem pledges for her. The servant who turned me out of doors sometimes gets tipsey, and there is a man also sleeps in the kitchen where the spoons were kept. My mother never came to see me except when my mistress was made acquainted with it.</p>

               <p>MRS. McLELLAN. I once sent her to pawn a pair of spoons in October; I lost a great many things while she was in the house.</p>

On Monday evening last, I received information and looked into the shop from my parlour, I saw a person in the act of stooping, with a cap on, and going out; I ran out and missed a cheese - I directed my young men to go different ways, and I went out also; when I came back I found the prisoner in custody, and this cheese; but whether he is the person I saw going out, I cannot tell, his cap resembled that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was it not rather dark? A. The gas was lighted; I was at some distance from the person, he had a cloth cap on, not a glazed cap; the cheese was taken from the pile at the door.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutor; I went down Oxenden-street - I saw two young men cross, and the prisoner who was one of them, had a cheese under his arm; they were both walking; I followed them to near the bottom of Oxenden-street, when our other young man came and met them - I ran and took the prisoner back with the cheese; this is the cheese that was under the prisoner's arm - I can swear to it by a mark on it - I was not absent from the shop, and know it was not sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that during that evening you were not absent at all? A. No; I had seen this cheese ten minutes before it was stolen; the prisoner said at Marlborough-street, that he had been engaged by the other man to carry it, but he did not say so before; he said in the street, that he did not take it; and then he said he did it for hunger.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that a man had given him the cheese to carry.</p>

The prisoner came home in the same ship with me from the Britannia, with a bad character; he had been sent on shore at Chatham - I had been paid off, and fell in with him at the Brown Bear, Ratcliff-highway - I treated him with several pots of beer, because I pitied him, and gave him his dinner; he then invited me to go and see his friends on Saffron-hill - I went to his fathers, but he would not let me in - he then took me to his sister - we had several pots of beer there, but there were a great many persons there - I was a little drunk; we then went to a public-house, and had something to drink, and then he took me to his sister's to sleep; I went there, and sat down on a chair, and half a gallon of beer was fetched - I was lying on a chair dozing to go to sleep, and the prisoner struck me a blow in my mouth, and while I was down he took my watch, which was worth 3l., two £5 notes, and seventeen shillings in silver from me - he kicked me on the thigh, which was black for a week after - when he had got the bettermost of me, and had taken my money, he blew the light out and ran off; it was then about one o'clock - I got down stairs as fast as I could and followed him, but I lost him - I described him to the police, and they took him - I am sure I had my watch and notes that night, and I had changed a sovereign and had 16s. or 17s. in my pocket; all I had spent was what we drank in beer- this is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had no £5 notes; I was only indicted for stealing a watch; he was drinking till one o'clock in the morning, and then he wanted to go to Poplar - I told him he might stop and sleep with me - he said,"If you will mind my watch and money, you may have it" - he gave them to me, and then in ten minutes he wanted it again - I said he should not have it till the morning - I went down stairs, and he sung out "Robbery and murder."Witness. No; he knocked me down, and took if from me, and ran down stairs - I followed him till he turned some corner, and I could not find him.</p>

I heard that a sailor had been robbed; I went down and found the last witness with the prisoner - I saw something in his pocket; I put my hand in and found fifteen shillings, four sixpences, and this watch - the prisoner then said, "I have got his watch and money" - the prosecutor said,"That is the man that robbed me - I give him in charge."</p>

            . I lodge at the Five Bells, Finchley. On the 16th of November, I fell in with the prisoner and four more young men in Grays-inn-lane, and I went to Smithfield, and looked at some trousers which were in pawn - we then went to a skittle-ground at the <placeName id="t18331128-116-crimeloc660">White Hart, Aylesbury-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. What time in the day did you come from Finchley? A. About eleven o'clock in the day; I walked to town and met the prisoner at the Marquis of Granby in Grays-inn-lane, about three o'clock; I had stopped on the road, but had taken no liquor till I got to the Marquis of Granby - I will swear I was quite sober when I got there; I met the prisoner in the skittle-ground there - he introduced himself to me by offering to bet me on the game; I did bet with him once or twice - I do not recollect whether I hesitated or not - it is not a fact that I offered to bet with him; I did not challenge the prisoner to play with me, but I did his friend, whose name was Hopkins, and we played; I do not know how many games; it might be from ten to fifteen games; it was not twenty; we played till about eight o'clock - I drank a little brandy-and-water, certainly - we played for drink; I cannot tell how many games I won or lost - the persons in the ground drank the liquor; there were ten or fifteen quantities of liquor drank by myself and the persons in the ground; I cannot tell who in particular - the first game was for a glass of brandy-and-water; the prisoner, his friend, and me, and I believe two other persons partook of it - the second game was for the same - I cannot recollect what the third game was for - I partook of any quantity of liquor if I felt inclined; I might drink four or five times; I did not note it down - I left the place quite sober; I drank brandy-and-water and half-and-half; I mean half ale and half porter - I had one glass of gin after the games were over; I cannot tell how much I paid for the liquor - I had three sovereigns when I went to the ground - I cannot tell what I spent, for I won and lost money - the prisoner then wished me to go and look at the trousers, which I did, and bought them for 5s.; I am positive of that - we then went to the White Hart, in Aylesbury-street - I had a Welch rabbit and a pint of beer, and the prisoner induced me to go into the skittle-ground there - I played one or two games; I did not notice how many; I paid my way as far as I went - I do not recollect whether they were single games or rubbers; a single game is only one; a rubber is the best two of three - I played about two rubbers; I do not know how long it took to play them; I went about nine o'clock, and was going home comfortable about ten o'clock, when I was robbed - I do not know what liquor I had in the skittle-ground; I do not believe I had any: I might take a taste - when the prisoner robbed me, I caught hold of him, held him as long as I was able, and called for assistance as loud as I could - when I left the skittle ground, the prisoner ran after me and robbed me - there were ten or twelve persons in the skittle-ground then - the prisoner ran after me, and took my money in the passage; I saw his face at the time - there were no lights in the passage, but there is a light in the bar, which shines through a window, and gives light sufficient to recognise any person - I caught the prisoner's head under my arm, and held it for two or three seconds, or perhaps a minute - I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you sober, when you got to the White Hart, so as to know what you were about? A. Yes, decidedly; I can swear it was the prisoner took my money - I know I had 2l. 6s. because I counted my money under a gas-light in the ground, just before I came out, and I can distinctly swear that the prisoner ran up to me and took my money - I cried out, "I am robbed;" there were nine or ten persons at play in the ground; they must have heard me - I did not pursue the prisoner; I ran to the front-door, and called for a policeman; I thought the prisoner was safe, as he ran back into the skittle-ground - I had three sovereigns in my pocket when I came to town; I had only changed one of them - the silver and sovereigns were in the same pocket.</p>

            . My father keeps the White Hart, Aylesbury-street - I recollect the prisoner and the prosecutor coming on that Saturday evening, a little before nine o'clock; the prosecutor appeared to be perfectly sober; they went backwards to play at skittles; I afterwards heard the prosecutor say he was robbed by the man he had come in with; he was then in the front of the bar; I did not hear him say how much he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons came in with the prosecutor? A. Two; they staid about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in front of the bar; the prosecutor had a slice of bread and cheese toasted; I did not see him have any drink - I was about my business; I cannot tell how many persons were in the house, or in the skittle ground - the prosecutor did not appear drunk; a man who was drunk might call out that he was robbed.</p>

            . I live next door to the White Hart. I was opening my back-door, about ten o'clock that night, and saw two men standing at the door; the prisoner is very much like one of them, but it was dark, and I could not swear to him; he had no hat on - they said, "Let us through, it is only a lark" - I said, "I do not like such larks in my house, get back again over the wall" - it is a good high wall between my yard, and the public-house yard; I saw that the man's hair who had no hat on was dark, and he had a long coat on - I told them to get back, and gave one a lift over the wall; the other got over - I then came to the front-door, and heard a calling for the police; I saw the police going in; I got a light, and the steps, and found a phosphorus box swimming on the water in the butt, which is by the wall where they got over - they could not get over without almost touching it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A porkbutcher - I had no light when I went to my back-door, but a good light in my shop, on the cross-counter, which shone to the back-door - the men were close to the door when I opened it; I cannot swear the prisoner is one of the men, but one had his hat off and had dark hair - I lifted one over the wall; the water-butt is not on my side - I have heard there were ten or twelve people in the skittle-ground, but they could not have lifted any one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280095"/>over without being very close to the water-butt, or touching it, as there is only about a foot of wall, but what the butt stands against which leads into my yard - the box I saw on the water might have fallen from the person who got over the wall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at first that you would not swear to the prisoner at the bar? A. Yes; but he was a young man like him, and he had dark hair - the water butt stands about the middle of this short wall - a person dropping anything in getting over the wall, would very likely drop it into the butt.</p>

             (Police-constable G 107). I was at the White Hart door, and saw a great many persons assembled, some of whom said, a man was robbed of 2l. 6s.; I saw the prisoner come out of the mob without his hat, and he had a long coat on - he walked out of the door and said, "I know which way he is gone, I will go and find him out;" when he got out of the crowd he ran away - Martha Lewis said, that was one of the men; there was another officer who took the prisoner's partner - when I went out again, Robinson told me, he had found the phosphorus box - I drew the water out of the butt, and found in it nine skeleton keys, a dark lantern, a jemmy, and this halfpenny</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do men use these tools to pick pockets? A. No; I think they are used for house-breaking - the prisoner wore a long coat, it reached to the middle of his legs; he seemed rather confused - when I went into the skittle-ground there were about ten men there; they all had hats on, that I saw; I cannot say they all had long coats on; I only spoke of the prisoner's partner from what the prosecutor said - I had seen them both before, but not together - the prisoner was taken afterwards, but not by me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not probable that those men who pick pockets might use these tools for housebreaking? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent. I left the gentleman about nine o'clock, and bade him, good night, and he said so to me. I left him, with the young man, playing skittles. I did not play a game with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Can you take upon yourself to say, there is a piece of lawn lost from them? A. Yes; we have lost a good many - I know that by the books which are not here - about twelve persons are employed in our business - they would all have access to these goods - our house does not manufacture these - they are transmitted to London - other persons might purchase pieces of the same manufacturer - my employers told me they had never sent the prisoner out with a piece of lawn - I do not know whether persons in the country have different marks for the goods they send to different houses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would they have a parcel with Lewellin's name on it? A. Certainly not; we have lost many pieces of lawn similar to these - I receive the lawns and enter them in a stock book, and having refreshed my memory by reference to the book, I can say we have lost articles of this description - it is my duty to keep the books - when I am there I sell the lawns, but when I am not others sell them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he not been engaged in a great many concerns? A. It was our object that he should be so; but I believe he has been neglectful - I have in some instances been dissatisfied with him, but he has complained of the times - he has generally asked me on Saturday when I was drawing drafts for different persons, to let him have a sovereign or two, or what he wanted; I never refused him; and on every quarter-day he gave a receipt in his own hand-writing; but there was a balance against him in general; I should say that on the 6th of February, and on the 27th also, he was overpaid, or fully paid for his services - I will not swear that we were not indebted to him, but to the best of my belief he was always overpaid - I have often said to him, "If you do not take care you will overdraw your salary" - I had no particular confidence in him, but I considered him an honest man - he had to go round and receive orders - he might have been employed in our shipping concerns, but to a very small extent - he was chiefly engaged about town - he opened a small account at Greenwich, and at one or two other places; but they were extremely prejudicial to us - he may on some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280096"/>occasions have bought at the docks but very little - he never brought money at the end of the week but immediately he had received it; if my own brother received money he would bring it to me directly - when the prisoner went to a distance he was allowed his coach hire - I do not recollect any sum having been paid by Mc Gee &amp; Co. to the prisoner about June, 1832.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not after the 17th of September, when you discharged him, send a message to him requiring him to settle his accounts? A. No; there was no negotiation carried on between us, and the prisoner's family respecting settling his accounts; his wife called on me and requested me not to prosecute him, and requested me to take this bond, which I said, I believe was useless, as it seemed to be out of date; I said, I would refer it to my solicitor; I forget whether I took it, or told her to take it - there was no other proposition made to settle his accounts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not content to refer this document to your solicitor? A. I put it into his hands to ascertain whether it was good or not, but certainly not to compound the debt - I never made any application to raise money on it - I think this bond was referred to our solicitor about a week after the prisoner was discharged - I never saw him in the docks before he was arrested - I never went to his home - I never said that a great deal of harm might occur to me from his leaving.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WHALESBY. Q. When did you first see the prisoner on business? A. About two or three months ago - I don't know where he was living; he did not live in my house; I hired him only as a commission traveller - I have no partner in the profits of my business, though the word Braden and Co. is on my bills - I give my son who is here to day an advancing salary - I can't tell what he has now - I paid the prisoner on Saturday evening.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose he had made a very unsuccessful voyage, what would he have been paid? A. He would have had nothing, if he had not sold goods or taken money.</p>

I said, I had been working hard all day, and I would rather have a glass of gin, which I paid for; and the policeman told him, he would put him into the way to get my money; because he had seen what I had when I paid for the gin.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I met my prosecutor, who asked me to have something to drink, which I refused, but he would not let me go till we had; he called for a pint of ale, which I told him I could not drink, and called for a glass of gin, I paid for it myself, having some silver in my hand. He saw I had money in my hand. I bid him good night, and he said,"No, stop with me." I told him I must go, and put the children to bed - I was going, he said, "You have some of my money." I said, "No; I have none but what is my own;" having been about a pair of boots for my husband, but they were not done, he gave me in charge, saying he had lost his money. The policeman and his wife searched me, and there was thirteen shillings found upon me, which I had from my husband to support my family with during the week. I declare I never saw any money belonging to my prosecutor, but some halfpence, which he paid for the ale.</p>

             (police-sergeant I 20). On the 23rd of October, I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road, about a quarter-past seven o'clock; I met the prisoner carrying this bundle; I said, "Halloo young one, where are you going with that?" he said, "They are things belonging to a servant maid, and I am taking them to No. 94, Park-lane; I said, "No person would allow you to carry them there in these rags - where did you bring them from?" he said, from Kensington, and if I would go to Park-lane, I should see it was right; I said, no, I would take him to Kensington; he went on with me for ten or fifteen yards, and then turned, and said, "My statement is false, they are my things - I brought them from Notting-hill, near Acton." I then said, "Where does your mother live;" he said,"She did live in Wild-court, Wild-street, but she is removed to near Ealing; I am bringing these things there;" I took him to the station-house, and found this bill of parcels inside the bundle.</p>

            . (policeman). On the evening of the 12th of November, I met the two prisoners in Upper Seymour-street; they both had bundles; it was about ten minutes before ten o'clock - Preston went up to a door in Seymour-street and said to Hannibell, "This is No. 47;" I crossed over on the other side, and followed them down the street, into Portman-street; one went on one side of the street, and the other on the other; when they came to Oxford-street, Hannibell kept on the left hand, and Preston went on the right; I saw McLean speak to him; I then crossed over and asked Hannibell where he had come from? he said, "From Notting-hill;" Mrs. Savage's house is at Notting-hill; I asked where he was going to - he said, "To the Tower," - I asked if he knew the young man who was with him just now with the bundle - he said, he did and called out "George"- I said, we would go over to him, and not call him over; we went over to him and McLean had him in custody; we took them down to the watch-house, and in the way to the watch-house, I asked Hannibell what he had got there - he said, he did not know - I asked where he got them from - he said, he found them in Edgware-road; I had not then opened the bundles; when I got to the watch-house, I opened the bundles and found one counterpane in a handkerchief, and a counterpane in an apron in Hannibell's bundle; there was nothing else in his bundle; I found a flint steel, a match, and two keys on Hannibell; one of them was a latch key, the other a common box key; I also found on him a bag; it dropped from under his clothes, while I was searching him; there was nothing in it - that is all I found on him - I saw the other bundle opened - there was a reticule in it, also two waistcoats, a counterpane, a pair of small clothes, a piece of figured silk, a shirt, and the skirt of a merino gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of night was it? A. Very foggy; I do not remember whether it had been wet; the roads were not dry - there was a damp from the fog - there were a number of link-boys in Oxford-street; I did not go further; I believe it was such a fog a man might have been one hundred yards off with a link and I not see him - I do not know what parish the house is in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what Mrs. Savage's husband was? A. A physician; the house in Berner's-street is the house they used to live in when Dr. Savage was living; she has never lived there since he died; she lived at her mother's - there were two bills put up to let the house in Holland-park.</p>
               <p>Hannibell's Defence. On the 12th of November, we were lighting a gentleman's horse and chaise, down Notting-hill. I kicked against the bundle. I said to Preston, "George, here is a bundle;" we looked about and found another bundle, and four forks.</p>

I remember in that month the witness gave me a letter for his Lordship to frank; it was about the 10th, or thereabout - she gave me a slip of paper with the address, which I remember very well; it was "Mr. Newberry, 3, (or 6,) Grafton-court, Manchester-square, London;" I don't know whether it was three or six; no street was mentioned on the slip of paper- I took the letter to his Lordship's dressing-room, and laid it on the table with other letters, to be franked; his Lordship was not there - his Lordship could not frank the letter for that day, but on the following day, when he sat down to frank it, he sent me into the nursery, to inquire Newberry's Christian name, and the answer I received from Mrs. Newberry was,

            ; I communicated that to his Lordship, and to the best of my belief it was so directed - there was a locked box, in which letters for the Post-office were deposited; the steward had the key of it; there was but one key - the letters are taken out of the box by the steward, and deposited in a bag, which bag has a lock to it also; the steward keeps the key of the bag, and the postmaster at Bury keeps another key of it - I took the letter from his Lordship, with other letters, and put it into the letterbox, which was in the entrance-hall; I did not notice whether there was anything in it.</p>

            . I was Lord Bristol's house-steward, and was at Ickworth, in October - there is a box for the letters which has a lock and key - I kept the key - there was only one key to my knowledge - if a letter was put into it and required to be taken out again, I was applied to to open the box - on the 9th and 10th of October, I believe, I took the letters out of the box to put into the bag for the post; it was my duty to do so; I put them into a bag to be sent to the post-office, at Bury St. Edmunds - that bag had a lock and key; there were two keys to it - I kept one, and the post-master at Bury St. Edmunds, kept the other - I locked the bag on those days and did so always - I gave the bag to a person kept on purpose to take it to the post-office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you left Lord Bristol's service? A. About a month - why I left the service is a matter between his lordship and myself - I will swear it does not arise from the present affair - I knew nothing of the present affair until last week, and I dare say I could produce testimonials from his lordship; I am now in his lordship's service at another place - I have no other reason to remember this particularly, except that it was a duty conferred on me, and I know I performed it - I took the letters out of the box that day; I cannot say how many there were; it is quite useless to try to remember. I believe Lord Bristol is a Member of the House of Peers; his lordship's letters generally come directed to himself - the number of letters vary from five or six to fifteen or sixteen a day; it depended entirely on what company was in the house - I have no recollection how many there were on the 9th or 10th of October - I have sometimes examined the addresses, if a party has wished to know if a frank had been put into the box for them - I cannot swear whether I examined the letters on the evenings of the 9th or 10th of October; I sent the bag to the post-office by Ralph who assists in the stables and fetches and carries the letters; he generally takes them; he always brings me the box - I cannot say whether he took them or not; I have sent them by another person once; I only remember doing so once.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Did you dispatch the letters from the box up to the end of October? A. I did.</p>

            , and I should have thought that I directed it to Grafton-court, North-street, Manchester-square, but I may have made a mistake - the impression on my mind is not sufficient to say whether I took any particular notice of the letters - I cannot say whether I found it in my dressing-room or not - I generally found them on the table of my dressing-room - when I came to dress in the evening my servant generally asked me if there was any frank to be given away - after I franked letters, I gave them to my servant to put into the box; and the impression on my mind is that I left them in the room; while he was out of the room - I recollect sending him out of the room for the Christian name - it would be Pope's duty to put the letters into the box.</p>

Of the House of Commons - I sometimes write my full number of letters - I cannot say I recollect on my own knowledge what day of the month it was I directed this letter, but I inquired of my nurses, and they told me it was the day after I returned from an excursion in the country - I referred to a memorandum, and found it was on the 10th - I recollect it by comparing dates - I recollect going away the week after the Bury fair, which I believe was Friday, the 4th; and I think I went on the following Monday, and stayed two nights - I have every reason to believe it was on the 10th of October that I franked the letter - I cannot say I have a distinct recollection of the address I wrote on the letter - I cannot say whether it was Grafton-court, or Grafton-street - I cannot say whether I directed it correctly or not - I know how I ought to have directed it - I cannot say whether North-street was on it or not - I knew at the time that was the place where the person lives - I should say that North-street was probably on the letter - I thought the house was No. 9, but I cannot say, but I believe the number was on the slip of paper which was with the letter - I have not a very distinct recollection of the number; I conceive I copied it from the slip of paper - my impression is that I referred to the slip of paper, for I remember "Mr. Newberry" being on the slip, and thinking it was not the right way to write to a person of his station, I sent to know the Christian name - I had Margaret Newberry's address on a slip of paper, and I once went there to Grafton-court; it is a small place; I should not have called it a street, if I have done so, unless I had been in a hurry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Spell the manner in which you you have written the address? A." D. Newbry;" I always copy the address of money-letters, into this book; and the name, and street, with great correctness and care - I generally copy the Christian name when I copy it at length, and the surname I always copy at length - according to the best of my belief, the entry is a fair copy of the letter - it is Grafton-street, "Grafton" is spelt with one "f" and an "a" - I recollect the letter being franked - my attention was called to the entry, about a month after the 10th of October - I supposed that letter was franked, because it corresponded with the one stated to be lost - (I never could have written "bry" for "berry,") that is the only reason I suppose the letter to have been franked - we always lay the money letters in a small box, made for that purpose; the box was not locked; it was in the centre of the office - master has nine children and a wife in the house, who have access to it; it is a shop, but the office is parted off with a book-shop; there is an entrance from the book-shop into the office - the shop is much frequented - we should see a person passing from the shop to the office; there is no door, but there is an open place to the shop - the postmaster takes the letters out of the box; if he is unwell, his wife, Mrs. Deck, does it, and if she was unwell, I should take them - about four persons in general have access to the box - the post goes out at ten o'clock, the shop is closed at nine o'clock, and then the office duty is done, till the mail stops; the letter arrived on the 10th of October, and was sent to London the same night.</p>

            . I am postmaster, of Bury, St. Edmunds. On the evening of the 10th of October, I did not open the bag which came from Lord Bristol's; a letter bill is forwarded from the office every night, to town, with the letters (looking at a bill) - this signature, John Deck, is mine - I forwarded that bill on the 10th of October, with the letters, as it is now (reads) "10th of October, unpaid letters, for London, 3l. 17s. 6d. unpaid letters passing through London, 16s.; paid letters 1l. 4s.; money-letters, one name Ascroft, anothernamed Newberry"- here is at the bottom of the bill, a direction, that letters containing cash, should be entered, and wrapped up in the bill; and I wrapped up myself, that night, the two letters in the name of Ascroft and Newberry, and forwarded them that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you see this book? A.

            . I am a letter-carrier. I recollect a short time ago seeing a receipt for a money-letter directed to Grafton-street, North, Manchester-square; I deliver in Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square; it therefore occurred to me that the letter did not belong to my division - I had it in my possession at my seat which is in the same division as the prisoner belongs to - I either gave the receipt to the prisoner, or put it before him; if it had been an unpaid letter I should have given it to the charge taker; but a paid letter or a frank, I should give to the prisoner or put it before him; that would be the course of my duty - when I read the direction, it struck me forcibly at the time it must be intended for Grafton-street, North-street, Manchester-square, and I shewed the receipt to the prisoner; I remember that, and I asked him if that would do for him; he said,"Yes" - I was aware that Grafton-court was in his delivery, I had been on that walk myself some years ago - I remarked to him that that laid wide from my Grafton-street - the prisoner's duty would be to take it into the inner office, and by shewing it to the clerk he would get me letter and sign a book for it; he would take the receipt with the letter to the party it was intended for, and get them to sign it, and he is expected to keep that receipt as his acknowledgement; I have some hundreds of these receipts by me - if a carrier was asked a question about the delivery of a money-letter, he would have the receipt to produce; I have had that to do myself; it has happened to me - the prisoner lives by Chadwells, Gray's-inn-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The letter you saw, and of which you have been speaking, was addressed to Grafton-street, North, Manchester-square? A. I saw no letter; that was the address on the receipt, "Grafton-street, North;" I am pretty sure it was not North-street - I deliver at two Grafton-streets; my delivery is not near Grafton-court; it is the nearest Grafton-street to Grafton-court - the Grafton-street in my delivery, is the nearest Grafton-street to his delivery; his delivery is not next to mine - there is Grafton-street, Fitzroy-square, and Upper Grafton-street; and Pannel, my assistant, delivers in Grafton-street, East.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had a letter directed to either of the Grafton-streets in your delivery, should you think of taking it to Grafton-court? A. No; nor should I have sent this, but seeing "North," and "Manchester-square," on it - I either put the receipt before the prisoner where he sat, or gave it into his hand - it is usual at times to put them into the delivery when the carriers are not there it is a frequent custom - I thought it was intended for Grafton-court from its having "North," and "Manchester-square" on it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When persons are absent from their seats, receipts may be left there for them? A. Yes; the prisoner was at his seat - I will not swear he saw me lay it down; but I said to him, "Will this do for you?" he said, "Yes, it will" - I had his walk once; there is no Grafton-street in that walk; Grafton-court is about half a mile perhaps from the Grafton-street in my walk.</p>

He keeps an Italian warehouse; he has lived there nearly five years; the letter was brought to me on the 7th of August, I think - I have a particular reason for thinking so, as a servant's character was inclosed in it, and the lady who sent it to me, wished me to give it to the servant who was anxiously expecting the character to arrive; the date of the post-mark is the 7th of August - it came from Lymington; I inquired of him for the overcharge; he always said he had not yet got it.</p>

            . I am a window clerk in the General Post-office; it is my duty to make the rebate on overcharged letters; I keep a book to enter the letters on which those overcharges are returned - I have the book; here is an entry on the 10th of August, "Collins, No. 9, Dorset-street; the original charge 2s. 3d. - the allowance 1s. 6d.;" I erase the original charge, and put the reduced charge on the letter, and that is done on this letter by myself; it was reduced from a treble, to a single rate; there are other letters as well as this, seven or eight in number, overcharges; the amount of these overcharges is 5s. 6d; when this entry is made, the letters are tied together with a piece of string, and the amount being 5s. 6d., would be placed in that string, merely to secure it from falling out; the letter-carrier's bring them to us in that form, ande we tie them up again and and place the money immediatly under the string; they are returned next morning to the letter-carrier's office; I don't know whose custody that money would come to; my duty don't extend to that department; it is sent to the letter-carrier's office; the receipt of money is acknowledged by a person signing T. or J. Deacon; I don't know who he is; the entry is, "Mrs. Collins, No. 9, Dorset-street, 2s. 3d. - 1s. 6d.; signed, T. Deacon."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you call the rebate? A. An allowance made on letters overcharged; this book contains the entries of the rebates; there is no particular carrier employed for the purpose of taking the letters to the letter-carrier's office: the prisoner is certainly not the man to whom I gave the money.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier of the General Post-office; I belong to No. 1 division, which the prisoner belongs to; when the window-clerk has entered in his book the overcharges and rebate, the overcharged letters are brought round to me by one of the sorters, with the money to be allowed on them; this is my signature to the book, acknowledging that I received the overcharges for that day; it is my duty to give to the carriers of the different walks, the overcharged letters and rebate; there is an entry of a letter directed to Mrs. Collins, No. 9, Dorset-street; I returned that letter and the money to the prisoner on Monday, the 12th of August; I gave him 1s. 6d. - he should have given that to Mrs. Collins; the prisoner's signature is on this letter; "Single, J. Borrett;" I cannot swear to his hand-writing, but if it had been written by any other person belonging to his district, I should have given it to the prisoner; seeing that name on the letter, understanding what district it belonged to, and knowing he delivered in that district, I should have given the prisoner the money; I have no doubt of the money and letter being given to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Not the slightest in the world? A. No; I am certain I gave it him; there is nothing particular which calls it to my recollection; I return rebates every morning - I don't remember the identical letter, nor giving him the 1s. 6d. on that identical letter - but I swear, according to the book, that I did return 1s. 6d. on that letter; I will undertake to swear, that I did give the prisoner 1s. 6d., as the rebate on that letter - I gave it to him, to return to Mr. Collins, not Mrs. Collins; I gave him the money to return to the party to whom the letter was addressed; he should not have given it to anybody else, except to a branch of the family.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Would he be justified in returning it to anybody, Mr. Collins authorised to receive it? A. Yes; if his wife received the letter, and paid the postage, he would be justified in returning it to her; I never gave the overcharged letter to a carrier, without giving him the money, as he would be answerable for it - he would not take it without the money.</p>

            . I live at No. 14, York-court, East-street, Manchester-square; I have seen the prisoner there delivering letters - he brought me this letter(looking at it) - I paid 2s. 10d. for the postage - I opened it in his presence, and shewed him that it was a single letter; it came from Ireland - I required half the postage back again - he told me to give him the letter in a day or two and he would bring it to me with half the postage back again - I gave him the letter on the Saturday evening following, in High-street, while he was ringing his bell - the letter was directed to East-street, Mary-le-bone - he found me out - I saw him on the Tuesday following in High-street, and spoke to him about returning the letter, but I did not expect he would have it then; I told him I would meet him in High-street, the next evening, while he was ringing his bell, and I met him on the following evening (Thursday) and asked him for my letter; he put his hand to his side, and said he had forgotten it; I never saw him afterwards - I have never received my letter or money back - the letter was first delivered to me on a Tuesday or Wednesday - this Thursday, was the Thursday week afterwards - I had not authorised him to keep the money he was to receive for me, or to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times did you ask him to return you the overcharge? A. Once, I believe; I will swear I asked him once; I asked him for the letter twice; I did not ask him for the money, but, of course, I meant to have the money with the letter - when he clapped his hand to his side, he appeared to be feeling for the letter in his pocket, and then said, he had forgotten it; the letter is now torn across.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It has been out of your possession all this while? A. Yes; when he took the letter from me, he said, he would return me half the postage, which would be 1s. 5d. - when I asked him for the letter I expected the postage also - I know this to be the same letter from the inside of it.</p>

            . I am clerk in the General Postoffice - it is my duty to make rebates on overcharged letters (looking at the letter) - I have no recollection of this letter; but here is a figure of mine on it, which enables me to say that it has passed through my hands(looking at the Rebate book) - here is an entry, dated 28th of October, which I believe refers to this letter; it does not correspond entirely with it; the entry is, "Mr. Wells, 14, York-street, postage 2s. 10d., 1s. 5d. allowed;" sometimes mistakes occur in entering the directions of letters, but not often; I have no doubt whatever but that entry refers to that letter - the book is signed by"

            Deacon."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any recollection of returning the rebate? A. Not the slightest; these transactions are too numerous for me to recollect them; this 1s. 5d. was put on the letter by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that when you entered "Mr. Wells, 14, York-street," you were copying from a letter, with"Mr.

            , 14, York-court on it?" A. Yes; I believe it is the same; the direction was obliterated, and I read it "Wells" to the best of my recollection - I misread "Wells" for "James," but I believe it to be the letter from the correspondence between the entry and the letter - I have no recollection of it, except from the book; I read "James" for "Wells;" I did not see the surname - I may have copied that entry from some other letter; to the best of my belief, I did.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. The two figures on the letters are yours? A. I have no doubt of it; I have made no similar entry of 1s. 5d. for any other letter that day - I entered two pages of overcharged letters that morning - when I have a great many it sometimes occurs that one name is put for another - my sight is not very good.</p>

            . I am letter-carrier of the same division as the prisoner; my signature is to this book - on the 28th of October, here is a letter entered in the name of "Wells, 14, York-street;" I have signed the book for the amount of money for that division, I delivered the letters to the different carriers - the entry here is"Wells, 14, York-street," but I only sign for the amount I receive - I did not receive a letter that day directed to "14, York-street" - there is a letter entered here, "14, York-street," but I did not receive such a letter - my signature is to the book as having received 5s. 9d. for rebates belonging to my division - there is a York-street in our division - this letter is directed "York-court, East-Street, Manchester-square;" that is in the prisoner's delivery - I have no means of saying whether I received that letter with the overcharge - the prisoner receives the rebate letters from me - the direction of this letter is in his walk, and his name is attached to the letter in his writing - the letter shows it has been overcharged, and the money returned - that letter and the rebate would be delivered to him in due course; I should have delivered it to the prisoner - the Post-office date on it is the 23rd of October, when it went out of the office first - I have no doubt but that I delivered that letter to the prisoner, but at what time I cannot say - the address of the letter is not correctly copied into the book; there is no such an address in it for that day; there is an address of "Wells, &amp;c." with exactly the same amount of postage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you undertake to swear you gave any person the overcharge on that letter? A. Yes, positively but not to the time - it must have been after the 23rd of October, that I gave it to the prisoner - I have no recollection of giving it to him, no more than in the general way, as I gave him them every morning, as he sits in his seat, and the money also - he sits the third man from me, and I gave him the whole sum - I received the rebate from a man named Reed, a sorter; it came from the window of the Inland-office.</p>

I saw the two prisoners close behind the prosecutor; Rockall stepped up in front of the other prisoner, and took a handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket - I took hold of him immediately; he scuffled and threw the handkerchief down - I told my brother officer to go and tell the prosecutor that his pocket was picked- the prosecutor returned and took up his handkerchief - we took the prisoner to the station-house - Brown stood close by; he was taken by another officer - I had not seen the prisoners speaking to one another.</p>

On the 19th of November, I left two cruet-stands on a shelf in the coffee-room, at eleven o'clock at night, when I went down to supper - I left no one in the room; I went up again in three minutes, and saw the prisoner with the two cruet-stands in his hand - he was coming out at the door as I went in; he then placed them on the table and walked out - I do not know whether he had taken them up to look at, or whether he was going to take them away - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280109"/>shelf they had been on is about a yard and a half from the door - he was going out; I caught hold of him - he got from me, and broke the window and ran out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Do you know that he went there to measure a gentleman for some clothes? A. No; he had these stands in his hand - he was not disguising them - I do not know what he meant to do with them; he ran when he had broken the window - he gave his address, but I forget it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Berwick-street, Soho. I have known the prisoner a long time - in the forenoon of the 8th of November, he brought this tripod to my house - I asked him who he brought it from; he said, from Mr. Newcombe, a respectable gentleman, and whom I have known some years; from whom he had brought things before - I asked him if he was quite sure; he said, "Yes," and he wanted 2l. on it, which I let him have; in the course of the day some bills were brought describing it as stolen, and I gave notice of it.</p>

             (police-constable E 86). I apprehended the prisoner - I told him he was charged with stealing a tripod - I took him to the station-house, and he said, the next morning, that he had pawned it at Mr. Aldous for 2l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I am a porter, on the day mentioned in the indictment, I was at the corner of Rathbone-place, and was accosted by a man decently attired, who asked me to carry a parcel into Berwick-street, he went with me, when we arrived at the house of Mr. Aldons, the pawnbroker, he desired me to go in, and asked whether they would take it in as a pledge, saying, that it was for Mr. Newcombe. I went in, and asked the question, and was told that it would be taken in. I then went out, took the article from Mr. Newcombe, and pledged it for two sovereigns, I gave the duplicate, and the money to Mr. Newcombe, and receive 2s. for my work. I went away, and went to my brother's in Whitechapel, and received 19s. from my brother, for my mother (which he can prove); to pay a part of the funeral expenses of my father.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I lodge at Mr. Baker's at Kilburn; I was in Bell-street, Paddington, on Sunday morning, the 17th of November, about nine o'clock; there were several persons there and I saw the prisoner Duxberry; he asked me if I had seen William Curall; I said, I had not; he put his hand into his right trowsers pocket, pulled out a watch and said, he had picked a man up who had tumbled out of a cab lumpy, and he had got that and his tile - lumpy means tipsy, and tile means a hat - he then put the watch into his pocket again - it was a silver watch with a chased case; not a plain case; it had two seals, a key, and a steel chain; I am sure of that - while we were in conversation, William Curall came up, and Duxberry told me to stand on one side as he wanted to speak to him - I stood about a couple of yards from them, and saw Duxberry take the watch out of his pocket and shew it to Curall; Curall then took it into his hands, and they were in conversation; Curall then gave Duxberry two half-crowns, and put the watch into his own pocket, and went away; Duxberry then asked me if I would have a glass of rum; I said yes, and he took me to the Green-man, and we had a quartern, and he paid for it out of one of the half-crowns; we walked on as far as the Coach and Horses, and then he asked me to go home and have a bit of breakfast with him, and I went with him to Grace's where he lodged; I had some bread and meat and a cup of tea; I then left him - I went there again at dinner time; I had some bread and meat and then came away; I left him there and did not see him again till Monday evening, about nine o'clock; he was very tipsy and had a cap on - I saw him two or three times, but did not have any conversation with him till the Friday following, when I saw him in the Edgware-road; he said, he wanted to see William Curall as he had promised him 1s.; he said, he had fooled away the watch very foolishly; I told him there was a paper in a window and I took him and shewed it him; he said, "Yes, that was the watch and this is the tile I have on, and I had better do away with it;" I did not give information of this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now as Duxberry told you he had found a man lumpy and he had got that and his tile, how soon was it after that you gave information of this? A. I did not know of anything being lost till I saw the bill; I believe there was one sovereign reward on the bill; I do not know whether I expect to get it - I do not know whether I hope to get it - I came here because the prosecutor is a poor man, and I thought he should not lose his hat - I went before the magistrate and Curall was admitted to bail - I have not seen the watch since - I did not know who had lost these things, till I saw the bill on the Friday following, and then I went and told that a man I had seen in the street, told me he had stolen a watch and a hat - I live at Mr. Baker's opposite the Red Lion, at Kilburn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever known to Mr. Baker till this time? A. The carman knew me, but Mr. Baker did not; I lodge in the buildings where he keeps hay and that, as I was out of employ; I did not lodge in the open air; I lodged in Mr. Baker's hay-loft for three weeks - I never asked his permission; he did not know it - I am not known at the Delaware Arms - I was never lurking about there; I have been in there and had a pint of beer, but I was never lurking about there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I were to produce anybody who had seen you lurking about there you would be surprised? A. No; I should not be surprised at all - I know

               <p>Q. Do you remember saying to him that you were not going to walk about without shoes, and to starve, as you knew where there were some fowls that would do very well? A. No, sir; I never said so nor anything of the kind - I was not without shoes - I knew there were fowls where I lodged - when I told his lordship and the jury that I lodged at Mr. Baker's I did not mean to represent that I lodged in his house - I was never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280112"/>in any trouble myself; I was never acqainted with crime in any way - I never did any man an injury, nor any fowls - I knew that tile meant a hat and that lumpy meant tipsy, because I had heard men say so in the street many times - he did not say he had picked a man up who was lumpy and had got his ticker - I know that ticker means a watch - I have heard that too.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WILKS.

               <p>BAKER. I am a farmer, and live at Kilburn; I am afraid Turner lodged about my place to my inconvenience - I lost a great many fowls; when my hay is put out for my cattle, Turner walks in and takes the hay and covers himself with it; there was a very bad character lodged with him.</p>

A man named Taplin was in the habit of calling there for the shopmen's linen; and on that day he called for 17s. 6d. due to him, from Mr. Ware, but he found he had been discharged. He then met me at the gateway, and asked me to pawn his watch for him, as he had not received his money - and said, he would give me the guard and key, if I would pawn the watch; and he would see me again in the evening, and receive the money, and the duplicate. I never saw the watch till Taplin gave it to me, and the witness cannot deny that he had been in the kitchen, where she says she had placed the watch.</p>

On the 25th of October, I was sent to Mr. Brown's, Clerkenwell-close, to the flatting-mills, with some gold and silver, from Mr. Harris's, in Gloucester-street - I took it there, and was returning with it, in a bag; it was about 14l. worth- it had been flattened for cases - I was going back with my mother - as I came out of Mr. Brown's, I saw the two prisoners standing at the door; as I got round the Close I saw them again, and they looked at me - they then went up a street, and I did not see them again till I got to the corner of my master's street, which is about fifty yards from Mr. Brown's - my mother then bade me good-bye - Russell then pulled my cap over my eyes, and Wright pulled my bag; but I had the string so tight, that he did not get it away; but he had the bag in his hand - my mother then came up; Russell then left my cap, and pulled at the bag - they both pulled at it, and the string cut my fingers very much, and made them bleed - I caught hold of Russell, Wright then swore at me and wanted me to fight him - my mother told me to go down the steps and tell my master - I went and gave the bag to my mistress; I then ran after the prisoners and told my mother she was to bring one of them back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew Russell very well? A. No; I had seen him once before, but did not know where he lived - I had not played with him - I saw him once when I was looking for a place - he said to me, "Is there a boy wanted" - I did not know him name was Russell, till he told me up at the station-house - I did not know the other boy at all - they did not begin to play with me - my cap was not taken off and thrown down an area - I don't know that they knew what I had got - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, on the 25th of October.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them next morning? A. Yes - I saw Wright when I went to Mr. Brown's - he whistled and some more boys came to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long was it before this night, that you and Russell went to look for a place? A. I did not go with him, I was looking at the bill when he came up to me, and asked if a boy was wanted - I had not tole them that I had any money or property about me - they did not tell me to deliver, or that they would have my things, or anything of that kind; but one struck my cap, and the other pulled my bag, and when my mother came up, they did so still - I did not stay to hear whether my mother scolded them, they walked away talking together; my master was not at home.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The first you saw was one of these boys pulling your son's cap, and the other the bag, and when they saw you they walked away? A.

On Friday, the 22nd instant, I left home with 6l. 4s. 6d. in my pocket, and met the prosecutor and some prostitutes at the Golden Ball, Cow-cross or lane. We all drank freely there, and continued drinking together at different houses all day; at length we came to the Hog in Armour, Saffron-hill, all drunk. The prosecutor had been exposing his box all day, and the prisoner fell asleep. The prosecutor was boasting how many men he had sent out of the country, when David Reece said, "We'll, send him out of the country;" and the prisoner was given in charge. The prosecutor said he would not charge the prisoner; he appeared an honest man. The girls of the town were with them all day. The purse was picked up in the street by the boy, and taken into the house. David Rees and the hackney-coachman offered to the prisoner's wife, in the presence of Mr. Parkinson, a baker, if they were paid 5s. a-piece for their time, they would get out of the way; and asked her to keep the boy back.</p>

             (police-constable G 182). On the 24th of November, I was on duty, in Goswell-street, at half-past three o'clock in the morning. I saw the prisoner with a bag in his hand - I stopped him, and asked what he had - he said, "Some fowls" - I asked him to allow me to look at them - I took them in my hand, and asked where he brought them from - he said from Finchley, and was going to take them to his brother in Old-street - I said I would go with him; I went with him to the end of Gee-street - he then ran away - I followed him - he ran on to the Willow-walk; I took him there - I asked him how many fowls there were; he said four, and he gave 4s. for them, to a man on the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STAMMERS. Q. The fowls were in a bag? A. Yes.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Lumley my brother-in-law. There are three gates in the garden, which lead to the poultry-house, but that does not join to the dwelling-house - on Saturday week, at nine o'clock in the evening, I shut the poultry-house up secure, and these fowls were missed the next morning - I knew the prisoner - he has occasionally worked as gardener for my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the habit of feeding them? A. Yes; very often - there was a padlock on the door of the fowl-house - the outer gate of the yard was shut the night before, but in the morning it was open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a pork-butcher, and went down to Finchley for work, and on coming back I met a man, who said, "Will you purchase these fowls?" He asked 5s. for them, I gave him 4s.; I came on towards home, and was stopped by the policeman; I told him what I had got, and walked a few paces with him, but being agitated I ran away; I was then taken to the station-house. I was taken to the magistrate, who, having a good character of me from Mr. Stroud, and Mr. Van, the officers; gave me up, till the following Tuesday; I went to work, and was taken again.</p>

I keep the house - it is my dwelling-house - On the afternoon of Sunday, the 24th of November, I went out, about four o'clock; I left nobody at home - I latched and double-locked the door, and left a rushlight in the room - between six and seven o'clock my attention was called to the house; I returned to it, and went in with a key - my door was then on the single lock, and I found the drop-latch lying in the passage; I kicked against it, and picked it up - the cupboard-door in the back-parlour was open; I had left it shut, and fastened by a brass button - nothing was actually taken out of the house - I found a silver tea spoon in a cup and saucer, and the other in a mustard-pot, which they had been in when I left; but I found them taken out of the cupboard, and put on a table, and one was broken in halves - I had a silver pepper-box; I had left that one on the shelf, and it was removed off to another.</p>

            . I am a gold-beater, and live at No. 3, Upper Chapman-street. On the 24th of November, I was near the house No. 5, standing within four or five yards of the house; I saw four persons at the door, whether the prisoner was one I cannot say; there is a court leading into the street, about half-a-dozen yards from the prosecutrix's house, on the opposite side of the wasy - it is not quite opposite; I saw the prisoner under that court at half-past seven o'clock; he was about six yards from the house; we went under the court and found him standing there, and took him; the policeman, my brother, and I, went up to him and asked why he was standing there; he said he was waiting for a female; the policeman said he must come to the station-house, and we proceeded on very quietly till we came to the bridge over the London dock basin - my brother was close behind him, talking to him; he turned round to make a reply, and put his hand over the rail of the bridge and dropped something into the water, which made a great splash; and directly opposite the station-house he pulled an iron jemmy out of his pocket, and put it on the sill of a chandler's shop window; I took it up and gave it to the policeman; Clark, the prosecutrix's daughter in-law, came forward into the station-house, as she went into the station-house, the prisoner went towards her and said, "You are another one that has come to swear my life away;" that is all that passed in my presence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How broad is the street? A. Half a stone's throw; I think about four yards and a-half;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280120"/>there is an arch over the court it was raining very hard at the time; the arched court would protect the prisoner from the rain; there were four men round the door - I am not certain the prisoner was not one of them - according to the best of my memory, it was half-an-hour after seeing the four men, that I saw the prisoner under the arch; the court opened into the street - anybody passing up the street, could see the prisoner if they looked, there was no one else sheltering themselves at the time; I did not observe Mrs. Clark's door when the four men were round it - they appeared to surround the door; a short man stood next to the door - I could see them by the gas-light; I thought it not prudent to speak to them; I saw the policemen about twenty minutes after seeing the four men; my brother went to look for them; it was half-an-hour from the time he first went, till we took the prisoner out of the court; I did not know any of the four men.</p>

             (policeman K 48). I was called to Upper Chapman-street, on the night of the 24th of November; I got there after seven o'clock - I cannot say how much; I saw the prisoner in the archway opposite the prosecutrix's house; I asked what he was waiting there for; he said he was waiting for a friend - a female; I asked how long he had been there: he said, "Not above five minutes;" I said he must go with me; and I took him to the station-house; on the road, he threw something over the bridge in Old Gravel-lane; I said he had thrown it away; he laughed, and said, "What will you do with me now?" I said, "Witnesses have seen you throw it away;" he told me not to name it to the magistrate that he had thrown anything away; if I did it would be a doner for him - and he would give me a sovereign in the morning when his friends came; I said, "I must do my duty;" I saw him lay something on the cill of a window; Ginger took it off the cill - it was a jemmy; that window is about fifteen or twenty yards from the station-house; he said he knew nothing about it, that I had laid it there to put a plant on him; I took him into the station-house; plant, means I had put it there to convict him, or something; I afterwards took that instrument to the house No. 5, Upper Chapman-street, and examined the state of the door and premises, and applied the jemmy to the marks; there is one mark of the point of it on the door-post, and of the shoulder, on the door, in a position which would enable a person to open the door, as if the shoulder had rested to give force to the other part; and the marks corresponded with the shoulder and point of the instrument exactly; the impression was quite perfect as if it had been moulded in clay; I can say positively it must have been done with this instrument, or one exactly like it; I only applied it to two places on the door where the latch was wrenched off, the impression was fresh and strongly marked - I have no doubt that impression was made by this instrument.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had been one of the four men, he could have got more than fifty times the length he was from the house in half-an-hour? A. No doubt of that; I call this a very good instrument; one of the same size would of course make the same marks; Ginger was across the way when the prisoner offered me the sovereign; he could not hear, for the prisoner whispered it to me - he did not whisper about the plant; Mrs. Clark came to the station-house with me; he asked if she was come to swear his life away; the house is in the parish of St. George's-in-the-east.</p>

            . I am the wife of George Clark, the son of the prosecutrix; I live at No. 42, Richard-street, Commercial-road; on Tuesday evening, the 19th of November, I was in Walbeck-street, one end of which, leads into Upper Chapman-street, I saw two men at the corner of Walbeck-street - I passed by them, and walked on the opposite side of the way, I looked over and saw a man at Mrs. Clark's door; I crossed over and asked him which was No. 8 - I was afraid to ask him what he wanted there; he turned himself round from the door, keeping his hands behind him, and said, "Further on, further on the other side of the way;" there was a gas-light there, I could see his face - I know it was the prisoner; he was standing in the door-way of No. 5; this was on the 19th of November; I said to him, "No, I think I am near it," and I knocked at the next door to No. 5, which is Mr. Potter's, and he walked away; Mrs. Potter came to the door with a candle in her hand; I afterwards saw the same person pass in the street two or three times; when the prisoner was in custody on the 24th of November, I went to the station-house and he made a rush towards me, and would have struck me, but the policeman pushed him back again, and he said, "Here is one, I know now, come to swear my life away;" I saw the jemmy applied to the door; it agreed as if it had been moulded in a bit of clay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not hear the policeman make that observation? A. No; it was the Tuesday before the robbery I saw him, which was on a Sunday; I did not live with the prosecutrix; the house is No. 5; nothing happened to the house on the 19th of November; the name of the parish is St. George.</p>

            . I am a city watchman. About half-past two o'clock that morning, I saw a hackney-coach at the corner of West-street, Smithfield; three men got out of it, one of whom had a light-drab great coat, and the other a dark dress, and the other a short jacket; they went as far as the iron railings in front of the workhouse, and then the short one ran back after the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you know the prisoner before that night? A. Yes - I did not say I thought one of the three men was Coppin; I said it looked like him with the coat with pockets at the side.</p>

             (police-constable G 75). Between two and three o'clock that morning, I saw a man go into Coppin's house with a light coat on; I went past the house and heard several men talking, as I thought, and Coppin stood at the door; he half shut the door too, and I saw two men standing in the passage; I afterwards saw a man come out dressed in blue or black - I went in the morning about a quarter-past eight o'clock, on the roof of the next house but one; I found seven umbrellas and these parasols in the gutter, and on the next roof some more; the house I went on had been open till two or three o'clock in the morning; the house next to Coppin's is always shut; the front-door is never open; but it is held by the man at the next house but one, named Webb, and he has a communication between them - when I crossed the roofs, Coppin's trap-door was open, and there were fresh foot marks from his trap-door to the place where I found the umbrellas - I then came down and went to Coppin's house; he was asked in my presence, why he did not open his door, which had been knocked at early in the morning, and he replied,"I did not wish to lie in the station-house all night" - the umbrellas appeared to have been thrown carelessly on two different houses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. On a former occasion there were four persons tried? A. Yes; one of them was Coppin's daughter; her name is Hopkins - I heard that she had been fighting that night, and that the police had threatened to take both her and her father into custody - I stated on the former occasion that I saw Coppin at his door; and that he cried, "Whist, whist, here is the policeman coming," I cannot tell how many lodgers there are at No. 10 - it is a traveller's house, and the same man keeps No. 9 - I cannot tell where the lodgers slept that night - a person can get from No. 9 to No. 10, but to get from No. 8, to No. 9, or 10, you must climb over the roofs - I found Coppin, Langham, and Hopkins, and a child in the prisoner's house - I did not go into any room where any women were sleeping.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280123"/>COURT. Q. Did you examine the trap-door of the prisoner's house? A. Yes; it had a button inside; no person from No. 9 or No. 10 could open it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say anything about the button on the trap-door on the last examination? A. I had hardly time to say anything; if I had been asked, I should have told the same story, I have to-day - I did not see any bolt on it - I swear positively there was a wooden button on the inside, which turned on a nail or a screw - I did not mention about the trap-door to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you try whether it would turn? A. No; I did not see any lock on the door.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 20). I went to the prisoner's house, and found a number of cigars, in various parts - there were a great many strewed under some bricks in the cellar; and a great many down the privy - I picked up two of them which were clean - I should think they had been put there the day previous; they were on the top of the soil - I had been watching at the back of the house, that morning, and saw Coppin looking out at the second-floor window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you see the trap-door? A. No; I found Langham in the house- he was on the last occasion charged as one of the thieves - he had plenty of opportunity to put the cigars where I found them, or to go through the trap-door on the roof.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where was the privy? A. There was one in the cellar, and one in the yard.</p>

            . I was an officer. I knocked at the prisoner's door, about five o'clock in the morning - I was not admitted; but a voice answered from within - "Who is there?" I said, "Coppin, let me in, I want to speak to you" - I looked through the key-hole, and saw a man run through the passage, in his shirt, with a candle in his hand - I went through No. 7, waited in the yard, and got admission into Coppin's house after eight o'clock- I went into the back-yard and found this skeleton key, this drop-latch key, this pocket-book, and this picklock - I was present when both the privies were emptied; but saw no tobacco found.</p>
               <p>COURT to W. S. BADCOCK. Q. Did you find cigars down both the privies? A.

Yes, sir; but I explained the nature of it - I said, I saw a man, who I believed to be Pott, looking into Coppin's yard - I said, I was as sure I saw him, as I saw you in this place - I don't recollect that I swore positively he was the man - I afterwards heard four respectable persons called to prove that he was some miles off at the time - I was astonished at it - I saw those persons at the magistrate's office.</p>

            , Jun. I am the prisoner's son - I live in the same street, but not in the same house - I know the trap-door of my father's house - there is no button inside it, or outside; it has not been fastened lately; but we used to fasten it with a padlock, the hasp is on the cill, and the eye is on the door, about four or five inches from the edge - there is an opening through the ceiling, and from there, there is a trap-door to the roof - there is no button on either of them - my father's is a lodging-house, and so is Webb's, and the next door - I was at my father's, this morning; there was no button on the trap-door, nor any hole where any screw or nail have been in; the hasp and eye are there as usual.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What led you there this morning? A. To let a lodger out of the loft, as we bolt them in their rooms, at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that the general practice of the house? A. Yes; if not, they might get out, and take things with them, as they have done before; we don't shut the trapdoor; but we always see the lodgers in and out - I keep a lodging-house opposite my father, but not so large a house as his.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to swear, and expect us to believe that the trap-door is always open? A. Not the outside trap-door, that has a bolt, and is always bolted night and day; the persons who lodge at my father's, pay a few half-pence for the night.</p>
               <p>COURT to R. BEADLE. Q. Was it the outside trap-door you spoke of? A. Yes; the ceiling had no door that I saw.</p>

I am a bricklayer; I was employed by the prosecutor on the 30th of October - I was on the premises before six o'clock in the morning; I knew the prisoner, he worked for Mr. Gee on the evening before; I saw him and a man named Sanford, crossing between the saw-pit and the long-pit; with some quartering and weather-boarding in their arms - they had, I should think,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280124"/>sixty feet, and they threw it against the wall; there is some garden ground on the other side of the wall - they threw it over, and then got over themselves; I knew the quartering and the weather-boarding; they had pulled it down the night before, but had no business with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you certain the prisoner was one of the men? A. Yes; I could not make a mistake about him; it was dark; I had two other men with me, we did not speak to them, we went to work; I never had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

I am a carpenter; I was with Keatch about six o'clock; I saw the prisoner and Sanford, they had quartering in their arms, and crossed before us to the wall which parts Mr. Gee's premises from where they live; they put down the quartering, and went and got some weather-boarding, and put that down; they then commenced throwing it over; I did not stop to see it all thrown over, I went to work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you to them? A. Not more than five or six yards; it was darkish - I never was accused of a highway robbery; a person took me into custody, and said, I had taken money from his boy, but I was immediately discharged as innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any foundation for the charge? A. No - I have been ever since in Mr. Gee's employ.</p>

I pawned it for, all at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, had you said or lone anything to him on that day, or on the former day of an indecent tendency or nature? A. No, sir; nor suffered him to do anything to me; I spoke to him in the first instance out of charity, because I thought he looked very wretched and miserable, which was my only reason; I gave him into custody by the advice of a friend, yesterday fortnight, in River-lane, Islington; I had not seen him before, after I gave him the 7s. - he came to my house that day - I do not know how he knew where I lived - I had not told him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How long have you carried on business in your present residence? A. Five years; I have been at Bristol many times, thirty years ago - I had no particular reason for leaving it, that I swear - it was about eleven o'clock on the 12th of November, that I first saw the prisoner - I spoke to him out of humanity - he was dressed as he is now as near as I can recollect, but he was very dirty and shivering from cold - I think he was rather ragged, but I did not take much notice of his dress - I think his trowsers were rather ragged down the side - I cannot say whether it was both sides - I cannot swear to one side - I think I saw the appearance of rags somewhere, but I did not particularize it - I think there was a little rags - I first asked if he had been to sea; he said, he had, but he should not wish to go to sea again, if he could procure a situation; I said, I thought I knew of one for him, where he would have a good bed to sleep on and plenty to eat; I then proposed to give him a pint of beer, and he said, he should have no objection; I did not ask him to follow me, but I told him I was going down Gutter-lane and he followed me at some distance; I did not tell him not to walk by my side to my knowledge - I will not swear I did not - I walked on the left hand side of the way, and he walked some distance behind me, on the same side - I did not keep looking behind me - I did not tell him to walk on the other side to my knowledge - I think I can venture to swear I did not - I had no reason for walking so far before him - I suppose it is a mile from where I first saw him to the public-house - I told him I was going to a public-house where I called now and then, and had a glass of beer, and he said, "I am going that way;" Type-street is not much out of the way; I could go in two minutes and a half from the bottom of Bunhill-row; the house is the sign of the Red Lion; we went direct into the parlour and called for a pint of porter; we did not have glasses; I drank a little of it; we both drank out of the same pot - we had no conversation; I sat and read the paper, and he drank the beer - I sat on a seat near the window, and he at a little distance from me; I did not ask him about any ship, or any women being allowed on board; I will positively swear I did not say anything about women; I did not say anything to him, nor he to me - on the next day I met him at the same place; I told him I was going to the same public-house; I walked on, and he followed me; I called for a pint of beer; I drank a little drop; he then put his hand into my trousers, in front, as far as he could; he was sitting at some little distance from me; he did not change his place; I stood up and went out - I said nothing to him - I left the room and came out, and he followed me - I walked quietly away; I was very much terrified - I did not say anything to the landlord, or any one in the house, as I did not know his motive for doing it - I suspected it was to see if I had any money - when I got half-way up Bunhill-row, the prisoner came again and said, "I come to have some money of you - if you do not give me some, I will give you into custody, for what you have been saying."</p>

               <p>Q Then he did not say, I come to demand money of you? A. No, sir, not in the first instance, but he did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did he say? A. He said, he would follow me as close as my skin was to my body, but he would have some; he would not let me move away from him, and we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280126"/>walked on together; I did not stop at all - I did not give him in charge as I never gave a person in charge in my life, and did not wish to do it - we walked together from Bunhill-row to Islington; and he went with me into Mr. Smith's the pawnbroker, just at the top of River-lane - I suppose that is a mile from Bunhill-row - I did not mention at Mr. Smith's that he had attempted to rob me as I thought I should never see him again.</p>

            . I am brother of the prisoner. I was sitting with George Fennell in Mrs. Lugden's room, when my brother came in with a bundle of four shifts; he showed them to me, but did not say where he got them; the next day he sent me to pawn two of them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was coming home about seven o'clock at night, and picked these four shifts up in the Kingsland-road; I took them to Mrs. Lugdue's, and said,"Perhaps Mrs. Smith has lost them;" I kept them till the next night, but there was no inquiry made for them, and I sent my brother to pawn two of them.</p>
