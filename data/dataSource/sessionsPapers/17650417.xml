               <p>John Butler. I am parish clerk of St. Peter's, Cornhill: I saw the prisoner take the prosecutor's hat, as he was in a pew behind the prosecutor, as the people went on their knees. I had observed him take hats, I may say, twenty times before, and had many a run after him, but never could catch him; he came again on the 23d of March; then I secured him.</p>

I went to see the boy in Bridewell, on the other side of the water; I asked him where the rest of the things were; he said the other watch was sold, and he had had a guinea for it; but the other prisoner, the gypsey, said he sold the watch for 25 s. I asked him where the shoes and buckles were; he said Lovell had the shoes on his feet, and Lovell had sold the buckles for a crown. Lovell said that was true. Justice Dawson delivered the things to the constable: the boy told me the gypsey threatened to cut his throat if he did not bring out the bundle. (He had bundled them up in my husband's apron.)

            . Lovell, his wife, and two or three boys, the boy at the bar was one, came to my house in the morning of the 13th of March. I keep a publick-house, near St. George's Church over the water; he called me aside and pulled out a watch, and asked me if I would lend him a guinea and a half till the evening, or the next morning; I refused it: presently he pulled out a guinea and wanted change, I changed it; he went out and left the boys and his wife behind, to pay the reckoning: I desired the boys to go about their business. About two or three hours after Lovell came in again with a bad shilling, and said he had it of me, and insisted on having it changed; I knowing he never had that from me, would not change it; there was a gentleman by, who said to him, Where is that watch you had this morning? here it is, said the gypsey; the gentleman said he would give him a tankard of beer to tell him the number of it; he told us quite a different number. Then the gentleman desired I would stop the watch and man, till he got a constable; then we took him before Justice Dawson; the boy at the bar came after us, to prove the gypsey came honestly by it; but the boy soon confessed the gypsey encouraged him to steal it from his master, a butcher in Holbourn; he also confessed he had robbed his master of another watch and a pair of buckles: the gypsey pretended this watch was a gold one, but it is only silver gilt.</p>

The next morning I was going over to the Borough, to fetch some things cut that I had pawned; this boy and two others came over the water after me; he brought into a house, where I was, a breast of mutton and a quartern loaf, and asked me if I could sell him a pair of buckles: I went and sold them for 7 s. then he gave me the watch to dispose of for him; I went and asked 3 l. for it; the gentleman gave me 25 s. for it: the boy said he took the things from his father, and was going to Portsmouth.</p>

About a month after Mr. Hudson sent for me; when I came there the prisoner was before him: I was asked whether I did not lose some handkerchiefs? I said, Yes. The justice said the prisoner had confessed, before I came, and described the house where he took them from; he had also told the place where the handkerchiefs were pawned: I went with the constable and him to Mrs. Adams's in Ratcliff-Highway; the boy asked for the handkerchief he had pawned; Mrs. Adams delivered one; I think it is my handkerchief; (Produced in court.) I had such a one as this in my window for two or three years.</p>

            . These lads had lodged at the house of one Talbot on Salt-petre Bank: they had given this watch to a lodger there: I was sent for to the White Lion in White Lion Street; there was Talbot; he keeps a very infamous house, the worst in our parish; he is bound over to appear as an evidence, but he will not come: there was Johnson, the man that the lads had given the watch to; I asked the lads, that is, the prisoners at the bar, how they came by this watch; Talbot had shewed it to the beadle; the beadle said Talbot had stopped the watch and brought it to him. We went before a magistrate; Talbot there produced it: Magin said Talbot had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170009"/> knocked him down in order to run away with the watch; (his forehead was swelled) he said Talbot told him he should not have a needle's worth of the watch; and as he was running away with it, they overtook him, and stopped him; and then Talbot laid hold of them, and said he would carry the watch to an officer, and upon that he went to our beadle: this was said before Talbot's face: I said, Talbot, are not you ashamed of these things? there has been people enough hanged out of your house already; you ought to know better. The lads told the Justice where, and how they got the watch; and also of a great many more robberies they had done: they said another lad, in company with them, entered into a chandler's shop facing the Hermitage Stairs, betwixt 2 butcher's shop and some other, and when he came out he gave them the watch to sell. By this description I found the prosecutor; Magin said they carried it to a one-armed man named Johnson, who said he would not sell it for them, but would buy it; and that Talbot had got a pension ticket of Johnson's, and if Talbot would let him have the money, he would give them 30 s. then they went to carry it to Talbot, and he took it, and was going to run away with it, after he had knocked the boy down.

On a Saturday morning, I cannot tell the exact day, I had four or five guineas, a half guinea, and four or five quarter guineas in my pocket apron, which I had told over the night before, and laid under my head: after I brought it down I laid it on the dresser, and sent the prisoner to bring me a clean pocket apron; she very officiously said, she would take the money out of the soul one and put it in the clean one: I thought she had done it: I then looked upon her to be honest. I took and tied it up, with my halfpence in it, and took it roll'd up in my arms to the market. I went to turn my money out, and found but four or five small pieces of gold, called quarter-guineas, among my halfpence; all the rest was gone: I immediately ran home to the maid, and asked her what she had done with the gold; she said she had not meddled with it: My husband coming down stairs that minute, I was afraid to let him know of it. I ran away to market, without saying any thing to him: I told some of our servants of it; and said, if my husband should come to know of it, I would say I had found it again. I never searched the prisoner, nor made much to do about it; but used to say, it is strange the money should be gone so. I, about a month after, told the prisoner she had got it: she said, You lie. She was taken up about a month after for robbing my husband's till; then I spoke of this to my husband.</p>

            . I am a tripe-man in Clare-market: I know but very little of the thing; it was kept a secret from me. I took the prisoner up for above forty guineas that I lost out of my till, which I miss'd on Sunday the 24th of March; if I say threescore, I believe I shall not tell a lie. She, at her coming, always went prodigiously ragged, with great holes in her stockings, and her shoes down at heels; and after she had been with me some little time, she was dressed out with fine fly caps, and as good things as any lady in the parish: we have an account of things to the amount of 16 l. she bought. She staid out on the 24th of March till 11 at night; I said, You keep very bad hours; She said, If you don't like it, I'll go away: She went away, and came early in the morning for her things: She had been at our house about seven weeks.

               <p>I am very innocent of it. The morning my mistress lost her money, she took her pocket upon her arm, with the money in it, and went to the shop. She sent the boy to look about the street for it, to see whether she had not dropped it: she came home, and said her husband had taken four guineas out of her pocket; this is not the first time he has served me so; he is an old rogue. Then she said Jemmy or Sam must have it; then she went to a neighbour, and asked if they had seen it in the streets.</p>

I have known her five or six years; she has a good character: I was in the shop when my mistress came with her pocket under her arm; she shook out three or four five-and-threepenny pieces; O Lord! said she, I have lost my money, four or five guineas; then she went home, and then to a woman that keeps a pork shop, and said she had lost her money: she came to the shop again, and sent me to look in the street for it: I told my master my mistress had lost her money; never mind it, said he, may be she has, and may be not.</p>

I went and informed Justice Welch of it, and got them advertised in Monday's paper following, two guineas reward for any person that should stop any part of them: on the Friday following

I seeing the warrant express that I was to secure the person where I found the goods, I told Mr. Kelley he must go to the watch-house; the next day I took him before Justice Welch: the justice said he was sorry I had kept the man a prisoner, for he came voluntarily, and discovered where the goods were: he was discharged; and the justice desired him to slop the people that brought the goods, if they came. On the 30th I went again to the ale-house, where they first brought the warrant to me; there was Kelley; he halloo'd to me, and said, I have one of the men here; that was

I live in Blackhorse-yard, Nightingale-lane;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170013"/> on the Wednesday after this robbery was committed I was coming from Greenwich, after I had received my pension, about two in the afternoon; there were Lee, Murphy and Muckleroy in my house: Murphy is the only person of them that I knew: after we had drank two or three pots of beer, Murphy said, do you live anywhere hereabouts? I said, Yes: said he, I have got a few houshold-goods to dispose of, that may be of use to you, or any poor man; I said, what are they? he said there are some copper pots and some plates: I said I would buy them, if they were within my reach; I told him where I lived. They brought the goods the night following, about nine o'clock: Murphy had the great copper on his head, Lee had the other parcel on his shoulder, that is, a fire-shovel, tongs, poker, a pewter pot, a dozen of plates, a brass cover, and a saucepan; when I saw them, I said, I would not be concerned if you would let me have them for six-pence, therefore take them away. Murphy seemed to be daunted at these words; then I said, if they would set a price on them, and come on the next day, I would pay for them. The next day I had an opportunity of seeing the news-papers, and found they were advertised; when they came, I put them off, and apply'd to the prosecutor, and from thence to Justice Welch: they sent Mr. Langree with me, and a warrant; then Mr. Peterson came, and they put me in the Round-house.

I went and carried him over to an ale-house, and waited for Mr. Peterson: when he came I told him there was one of them; then we went to London-bridge, and took Murphey. We went with Lee and him to Justice Welch; after that we took Muckleroy, and lodged them all three in the Round-house. On the Monday after we went to Saltpetre-bank, and took Courtney, at the house of Mrs. Innis, according to the direction of the evidence Lee: I desired Courtney to tell the prosecutor where the the rest of the things were: he said, What do you mean that I should tell and be hanged? he would confess nothing.</p>
               <p>Thoms Lee. On a Saturday night or Sunday morning early, Muckleroy and I went with a poker, to open Mr. Mullings's warehouse, having agreed so to do: I tried to break the hasp, but could not do it; so he took the poker and broke the hasp and padlock off: then we went in and brought out two beds. two warming pans, the copper full of tea-kettles and saucepans, and a looking-glass that we broke afterwards; there were three saucepans, three teakettles, two pannakins, a fire-shovel, poker and tongs, a dozen of plates, a brass sender, a brass lid of a pot; we had a light: these we carried away; we carried them away at twice each, and on Sunday night we carried them all to Fox-and-Knot-court, Snow-hill. On the Monday we were to meet Murphy; he came to our lodging on Tuesday evening, then we informed him how we came by these things: he agreed to take them to Saltpeter-bank, saying he could dispose of them there, and we were to have each an equal share of the money; we both told him they were advertised.

               <p>Q. Did he know how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, then he did not: we came home again that night, and Murphy and I sat up in Fox and Knot court, to black the pots and saucepans, to make them look as if they had been used. The next morning, we took the rest of the goods in a hamper and a bag, to Mrs. Innis's, and Courtney and his wife went about to some brokers, to see if they could sell part of them. Courtney brought a broker, and when he came, Courtney bid me go out at the door: after that, they said they sold the two beds for 12 s. after that his wife said it was but 9 s. Courtney carried one of the beds away to the broker's; Muckleroy was waiting for us at the Wheelwright's arms; there we went and divided the 12 s. Murphy told me that Courtney's wife had pawned one of the small pots, for 4 s. so we divided 16 s. we had liquor and victuals, which we all paid part towards. Then we went to Mrs. Innis's, in order to take the rest of the things to Mr. Kelley's house: Courtney said, nothing should be touched, saying, he had as much right to them as we had, and he struck Muckleroy. We came away, and Murphy went back to lie there: that same evening. Muckleroy and I carried the other goods to Kelley's: he looked at them, but did not like them: he lent us a couple of shillings, and said money was short with him, but if we came in the morning, we should have the money. In the morning, Muckleroy, Murphy, and I went there; he put us off till night, but we did not go that night. On the Saturday night, Murphy and I left Muckleroy's lodgings, and went to Mr. Kelley's, to take the goods away, or be paid: Murphy would go no farther than London-bridge and said he would wait there till I came. If I had brought the goods back, we were to carry them into Kent-street, but Mr. Kelley stopped me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170014"/> Then I told them where to find Murphy, and went with them to London-bridge, where they took him, and carried him and I before Justice Welch. Mr. Welch granted a warrant to search Mrs. Innis's house, but they had taken care, to that none of the goods we left there could be found.</p>

               <p>Courtney's Defence.</p>
               <p>Murphy and Lee came to my father-in-law's house, about seven or eight at night; they asked me whether I could let them have a gallon of beer? Lee asked me if I could pawn some things that belonged to his aunt: I said, I could not: a woman there said she could. He gave her two candlesticks, and she went and pawned them, and they got some beer; that is all I know.</p>

I was informed, on the 14th of March, that house was broke open. I went and found the buffet stripped of punch-bowls, and the other things mentioned in the indictment were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any servants in the house?</p>
               <p>Farr. No, I had not. I found a window up stairs had been broke, the sash was screw'd down: they had broke the bottom and upper part of the glass, in order to get the shutters open. Upon enquiring about, I was informed the boy at the bar was seen to come from my garden, with flower-roots. I got a warrant from the Bench of Justices, to take up the boy, and likewise to search the boy's father's house. When we came to Hager-stone, the boy was at play: when he saw the constable and me coming, he took to his heels: the constable went through a house to meet him, but the boy seeing that, returned, and I catched him by the arm: he sadly wanted to call his father. When we came to his father's house, the door was shut, and upon the latch; when we opened it, the father was behind the door: I saw him go out: the first thing I saw was the ostrich's egg hanging up in the house. I found the china tea cups and saucers, and punch bowl, a pair of brass sconces which were put up: after that, I found the leather bag, with gunpowder in it; the mother owned the boy brought the things all there: this was within the hearing of the boy. She said, he got them at a fire in Kingsland road: the boy said, mother, you make a mistake; I told you I got them at an auction. Said I, will they give you brandy and rum, powder and shot at an auction? In the corner of the room was a stone bottle: I said to the boy, that is my bottle: the boy said no, it is my daddy's, touch it if you dare. I said, there is Bradley, Covent-garden, if it is mine, at the bottom. I looked, and found it so. The boy said, he had assisted at an auction, and they gave him all these things for his trouble: then he began to cry, and said, they gave him them: I said, who is they? if any body was concerned with you, tell the truth, and don't accuse an innocent person. We took him to the Bull alehouse; at last he said, if I would be favourable to him, he would tell the truth: he there impeached one

We found Bonam in Smithfield; he threatened to kill the boy, and said, he knew nothing of the matter. We examined his hand where the boy said, and there we found a cut in his finger. When he found there was some proof against him, he begged pardon, and said, if he had known it had been my house he would never have done it; after that he said he did not know the house: he said there was a person in the neighbourhood would be bound for him for a thousand pounds; but that gentleman would not be bound for a farthing for him; he took an opportunity and slipt away from us, and got off. The boy at the bar accused one

            ; we took him up; he was committed for further examination: I could not accuse him any farther than the boy had said, so he was discharged: now the boy says that Brodrick was innocent of the fact; the justices said I must get the father: on coming home one Saturday night I met the father and mother: I took him to the Bell tavern: I asked him how long he had had these things in his custody? he said he had had them three weeks; but I had seen them since that time in my own house. The boy is about thirteen or fourteen years of age: there is no bed in the father's house for the boy to lie on. The father is a shoe-maker by trade.

            , Esq; the prisoner worked in our brew-house on the 9th of March: he told me if I would leave the key of the stable he would take the dung away, on the morrow morning; I gave it him: when I came in the morning I miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment. On the 29th of March I was informed the prisoner was seen at the Whitehart, St. John's street: I went there on the 30th, with one of our stoakers, and took him: I charged him with taking the things; he denied it: at last he owned he took them, and said he hoped I would make it up as reasonable as I could: he said he sold the frock in Bishopsgate-street, for 4 s. and 6 d. and the shoes he sold sixteen or eighteen miles out of town, for 4 s. he went to a porter there, to borrow a guinea to make it up with me. I said the frock was my master's; he had better go and down on his knees to him and ask his pardon: when we came there, my master ordered him before my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it not waste something?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cox. If wastes about half a penny weight an ounce: on complaining to the other man, he was a little uneasy; I did not examine the prisoner, he having lived with me some time: but I was informed afterwards, the prisoner had carried fourteen ounces to Mr. Spinler, in Foster-lane, to sell: this was on the 14th day. I think, in the mean time, the prisoner was out with bills to a considerable amount, which he was to pay in at the bank. Mr. Spinler came and asked me if I had not a servant named Jones: I having no servant of that name, imagined it was not my servant. When the prisoner came home, I asked him if he had been at Mr. Spinler's, or ever went by two names? he said, No: I had then no suspicion, and Mr. Spinler having seen all my servants, I then let the prisoner have bills, to the amount of 300 and odd pounds, to go out for payment: I began to be very uneasy, as I understood he had not paid the other money into the Bank. I sent my apprentice out, who soon overtook him, and brought him back; then Mr. Spinler came to my house, and said, this is the man that brought the silver and gold lace to his house; he was confined in my house, and in the morning he confessed to me, the constable, and another of my servants, that he had robbed me of fourteen ounces odd pennyweight, which he had sold to Mr. Spinler the day before; the money he had secreted between his shoe and stocking: after this he confessed it before Sir

On the 9th of March, in the evening, I found I was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment: the prisoner was taken up, and she confessed she had taken them. I found the handkerchief pawned at Mr. Slayter's, in Shoe-lane, for 2 s. and four tea-spoons pawned at Mr. Day's, facing St. Andrew's church, Holbourn, for 3 s. 6 d. and an apron and cap for 2 s. she said she would not tell where the tea-chest was pawned, if the justice would give her 50 guineas; but said it was pawned by a woman that was living. She said I should have my chest and all my things, if I would not prosecute her.</p>

            . I keep a public-house, in Trinity-lane. I had this piece of muslin of the prisoner at the bar: he wanted to borrow five guineas, and said he would leave something in the room of it, till he came again: I never looked at it. I knew he used to by goods of his masters, to sell again, and had for a year and a half. The next news I heard after he left it, was, that he absconded: his wife came to my house, and I told her there was a parcel: she looked at it, and said, if she knew who it belonged to, she would let them know. Then she went and let Mr. Vinie know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin. We have sold the prisoner several parcels of goods, within four or five months; we have looked over our journal, and find no such piece as this entered. When we found the prisoner out, we asked him the reason for his going off? he told me, he went off for fear of having this piece of muslin found. Two or three of our servants now in court heard him say this. (He takes the piece up.) I believe this is our property.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear you never sold it?</p>
               <p>Martin. I cannot pretend to swear that. We advertised it, and the prisoner confessed he went off, for fear of its being found: he knew we should not have troubled him, on account of a debt he owed us. He owned also the same at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Vinie. Can you say this piece never was sold by any of the servants to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Vinie. To the best of my knowledge, it never was. As one piece was missing, by looking over the books, the prisoner was naturally asked the question, whether he knew of the going of it, as well as others? It rested a fortnight, or three weeks, till such time it was advertised: after that, he went off.</p>

               <p>Mr. Martin and I have had several dealings together; the last parcel of goods that I had, this piece came home in the parcel: I looked upon it as my property, so I pledged it for five guineas.</p>

            . I am twelve years of age.</p>
               <p>Q. If you should say falsely, what will be the consequence?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. If I do, God Almighty will d - n me; but I will speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your mother live?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. She lives on Artichoke-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your father?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. My father is a coleheaver.</p>
               <p>Court. Now take care, and say nothing but what is exactly true.</p>

               <p>M. Halfpenny. I will. On Thursday before quarter day last the prisoner said, Molly, will you go with me out of Rosemary-lane, to see my sick mother? going through an alley, first she said, Will you give me that money you have in your pocket? I said I can take care of it myself: she then knock'd me down, and took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. She took a guinea, two six-pences, a shilling, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that money?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. My mamma gave it to me, to carry home, to put in a drawer to pay a quarter's rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told the prisoner any thing about the money?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. No: I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she knock you down with?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. With her fist; I arose up again, and ran from her, and cried out she had robbed me; she was going to stamp upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your mamma give it you?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. In Rosemary-lane; here is the woman who was with my mamma then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a house, or in the street?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. It was in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner with you there?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. She came to me two or three minutes after my mamma gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see your mamma give it to you?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I believe she might.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner take the money from you?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. It was between six and seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I know it was her; I followed her all the way, till she was taken up by Shoreditch church.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep sight of her all the way?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I did; I never lost sight of her: I called out she had robbed me, and a gentleman charged a constable with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. No: I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you do any business?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I go out to service.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say you never saw the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I never saw her before?</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother sent for to you?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mamma say to you, you was a naughty girl, she had not seen you from eight that morning?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. No; she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your mamma's business in Rosemary-lane?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. My mamma went to buy a bit of meat.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go there?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. She had been there all day, till she sent me home with the money.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say to the prisoner, when she asked you to go with her?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I said yes, I would, with all my heart.</p>
               <p>Q. What words did she make use of?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. She said, Polly, Will you go along with me?</p>
               <p>Q. Then she knew you before?</p>
               <p>M. Halfpenny. I thought she did by that; we went into the Hackney road, and I thought it might be some of the neighbours.</p>

            . The child came crying to my house, and said the girl had robbed her. ( I am a constable and live in Shoreditch.)</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Welch. This was a month ago, to-day, I believe: I took the prisoner in custody; there came up a marine, and said the prisoner had some of his money; he searched her, and got 8 s. 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170020"/> which she owned was his property; he took it from her; she denied seeing any money of the girl's; I found only that 8 s. 6 d. upon her; when the girl's mother was sent for to the watch-house, she said her daughter had not a farthing in her pocket, only six pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Slipper. I happened to go to a public house; I saw the house in confusion; I enquired the reason of it; there was a marine, and some women that appeared to be girls of the town: the marine said he had been robbed of upwards of 30 l. by the woman at the bar; she was then in our watch-house in Shore-ditch: I said, How came you by so much money? said the marine, I received it at the pay-office, and have been along with her, and she has robb'd me of it: When the mother of the girl was sent for, she came, about ten at night; I desired she might be kept from the daughter; I said to the daughter, How much money has this woman robb'd you of? she answered, of a guinea, a nine-shilling piece, and eighteen-pence (three six-pences): I said, How came you by so much money? she said her mother gave it her: I asked her where her mother lived; she said she keeps a shop in Rag-fair; but lives somewhere in Ratcliff-Highway; she said her mother gave her that money in order to lock up, to pay the rent, and not to let her father see it; for he is a coal-heaver, and a very drunken man. I said, Why did you go with this woman? she said she knew her very well, she had been servant with her mother three days; that she came to the shop that afternoon, and saw her mother give her the money, and she inveigled her to go with her to see her mother in Shoreditch: that she went with her, and she brought her up some turnings, and asked her for the money, and knocked her down, and took it from her. When the mother came, I spoke to her; the girl said, don't you speak to my mother; she will go into fits, and I shall also fall into fits: I said to the mother, Pray, good woman, where did you see your daughter last? she looked, and said, O! there she is! O you impudent wretch! I have not seen you since eight o'clock this morning; how dare you be out so long. Said I, Does she often go out? She said, Yes, too often. Said I, Do you trust this girl with any money? she said, No; I have none to trust her with: said the girl, Did not you give me a guinea? said the mother, I have not a shilling in the world: said the girl, Don't you remember you gave me a guinea? O! said the mother, I gave you two guineas; I hope you have not lost them: Yes, said the girl, Bett Jones has robb'd me. Then said I, are not you a wicked woman, to behave in this manner? then the mother sham'd fits. I never in my days saw so iniquitous an affair.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Slipper. I am school-master at Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. to the daughter. You said, when I asked you if you knew the consequence of an oath, that if you did not speak truth, God Almighty would d - n you; do you consider what that is?</p>
               <p>Girl. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you dare to give such an account as you now have done, that appears entirely false?</p>
               <p>Girl. Sir, indeed she took and knock'd me down, and took the money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. You said you did not know her before, and you told that witness you did know her.</p>
               <p>Girl. I never said I knew her before.</p>

               <p>Court. I expect you will tell me who set you to say as you have done: there is no way of saving yourself in this world or the next, but by telling the truth: I expect you will tell me directly.</p>
               <p>Girl. No body but myself, indeed, Sir.</p>

               <p>I am clear of every thing.</p>
               <p>The mother to the girl. I desire to be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Here are two people swear positively against what your daughter has swore; and if I find you are perjured, I shall immediately commit you; so consider of it: you declared you gave the girl no money at all till she talked to you. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mother. I can't say I know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live servant to you.</p>
               <p>Mother. She did once; that was three days.</p>
               <p>She declined being sworn.</p>

I have known her near twelve months; I believe she had not left Mr. Denmead's Service then; she said she was to come away that evening; Mr. Denmead's man came and enquired of me about her; I asked what was the matter; I observed he was slurried: he said she was in custody: I having received these the day before, went and carried them to Mr. Denmead.

               <p>E. Turner. I have known her twelve months; I believe real necessity drove her to it: I never knew any thing but honesty and sobriety by her.</p>

            . I am an officer at Stratford: I was called upon last Saturday to detain a thief; he was suspected to be such, by offering saddles to sale about the streets under price. I took the prisoner in custody, and asked him what authority he had to sell the saddles; he said they were not his own, but belonged to the hostler at the White Horse and Leaping-bar, Whitechapel: not having an opportunity to go to a magistrate directly, we sent to know if there was such a person; but there was no hostler at that house: before the magistrate he said he found the two saddles in a ditch, as he was coming from Islington to Moorfields, covered with dirt; he was committed for farther examination: on the Sunday morning I went on horseback to Islington; the hostler at the Angel inn said, he recollected a Gentleman had lost a saddle or saddles; on farther enquiry we found out Mr. Simms; upon my telling him the affair, he came to Stratford and owned the saddles; his servant and a constable from Middlesex came with a warrant, and the prisoner and saddles were committed to their care.</p>

               <p>Kinsey. She had the tea-kettle to boil the water, because the woman where she was had none: it was to boil the water to wash the linen in: these are the facts and truth of the case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authorise her to take away these things?</p>
               <p>Kinsey. I do not say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take them away with your knowledge?</p>
               <p>Kinsey. I don't say that. I desired her, as soon as she had done her business, to carry them home; she had no authority from me to take them away: as to the feloniously taking away, it is entirely out of the question; I don't think she would wrong a worm.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to lock her out?</p>
               <p>Kinsey. As long as I had things convenient for me, I did not care whether she was in or out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. As the tea-kettle was taken out of your room? how did you manage for your breakfast?</p>
               <p>Kinsey. I breakfasted at the coffee-house; sometimes I am at one place and sometimes at another; sometimes I breakfast at Grosvenor-square: in case there was a bad intention I would not appear here on any consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Booth going into your room, and missing the things?</p>
               <p>Kinsey. Mrs. Booth broke open my door and searched the room; I don't remember her missing the things: I don't know any thing about it: I had this room only for sleeping.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bulmore. Whether the things were made use of in your house for washing?</p>
               <p>Bulmore. I know Kinsey was blowing the fire one Sunday morning, to light it, while my wife was ironing of a shirt.</p>

I trusted him with my keys, and he looked after my horses: I believe, about the 25th of January, my wife and he had a few words; she said he should not be in the house any longer. The second day after he was gone I went to look into a chest, in which were old iron, spike nails and other things; all was gone, a large quantity.</p>

I got a warrant of suspicion against him; as soon as he saw me he ran like a race-horse; we have seen him run five or six miles round Hackney-fields: we were after him a great many times. An<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170024"/> officer that had a writ against another man said, I can take your man, if you can let me have his name with the other man in a writ: I'll soon catch him: this was last November or October; he was put into a writ and taken, and put into Whitechapel gaol. I got him discharged, not wanting the debt so much as I wanted him; they turned him out before the constable could come with the warrant, so I lost him again: I was at Guild-hall last Tuesday was three weeks; he was brought there by the city constables; he said, God bless you, Mr. Smith, do not say any thing: I went before the sitting alderman, and charged him with stealing my iron; he owned to it all.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words?</p>
               <p>Smith. He said he did not deny it; but I had made a debt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sage. I am a broker in Shoreditch: I bought these steelyards of the prisoner, about a year ago, (produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He desired me to give him a note of hand for forty-three shillings, and said he would make it up with me; he sent me to Whitechapel gaol, and kept me there seven weeks: then I sued for my groats; he desired me to give him a fresh note of hand; I did, and he let me out of gaol; he arrested me upon the first note a little before last Michaelmas; the fresh note was for 3 l. 19 s. 9 d. I was to pay him at a shilling a week.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is this truth, that the prisoner has been saying?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never had a first note of him: I did not arrest him upon a note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he seven weeks in prison?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, he was not upon my suit; he never gave me any notice for the groats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any note?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He gave me a note when he came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in gaol on your suit?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They had him in gaol some time before I knew of it; as soon as I knew he was in gaol I went to him.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not answering the question.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I will not take upon me to say how long he was in gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell as near as you can?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it was not quite a month: we could not find the warrant, was the reason he lay in gaol so long.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the note for?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The note was for 3 l. the lawyer desired me not to turn him out without a fresh note.</p>

            . The prisoner worked in the country with us, at Martin in Surrey: I live in London. I had notice brought me last Sunday, in the evening, that there was a person with a piece of printed linen, twenty-two yards; that the marks at both ends were cut off, and that the man worked with us, and had acknowledged it to be ours; he was in the watch-house, by Ratcliff-Highway: a printer who had seen it, and knew it was not finished, came and informed me of it. I went the next morning; the prisoner acknowledged he took it from our yard, (produced in court,) about twelve o'clock at night: it is our pattern, we don't know of any body that has got the same: the pieces are always marked at each end. There is the draper's mark, the king's stamp, the progressive number, and the workman's mark that prints it; these are torn off.</p>

I live in the New-Road, near Wellclose-square: on Sunday last, about two or three o'clock, the prisoner went by, with this cloth under his coat; he asked me if I would buy it: I said, let me look at it. I sent for a headborough, and took him in custody, and put him in the watch-house, and on the Monday morning he was taken before the justice; there he confessed from where he took it: there was twenty-two yards and a half of it.</p>

The funnel, or flew, of a chimney had been broke through, in a room called the sailor's-lobby, on the ground-floor. The chimney was not finished, and was carried up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170028"/> only to the floor of the tea warehouse, which was over it: the brick-work of the funnel was broke through about the middle of the chimney, and the way being forced into the chimney, it appeared that many holes had been bored by somebody within the chimney, with a large gimblet, in the floor of the tea-warehouse; which being forced one into another, a hole in the floor of the tea-warehouse was made thirteen inches and a half one way, and eleven inches the other, (several pieces of the floor produced, of deal wood, an inch and half thick, bored through in several places): these were found, as I am told, in the cavity of the chimney. There stood over that part of the floor, thus broke through, four chests of tea, one upon another, each about nineteen inches high, two feet and a half long, and twenty-one inches wide. These chests were so wedged together, that it was impossible to move them; so that after they were broke, and the tea let down the chimney, there was a necessity of getting to the top of these four chests of tea, in order to get into the tea-warehouse; the uppermost chest stood within about three feet of the top of that warehouse. The bullion-office lies on the contrary side of the tea-warehouse, which is about sixteen feet in width, and being full of tea, two chests which stood uppermost next the wall of the bullion-office, were broke in pieces, and the tea scattered about the warehouse, in order to make room to go on with the work. A hole was bored in a large piece of timber, which was fixed in the wall of the bullion-office; but not being able to get through that timber, a hole was made underneath it, in the wall of the bullion-office, which was twenty-one inches and a half thick, and the hole was eighteen inches by twenty, (I measured it:) the mortar and bricks had been drawn into the tea-warehouse; it was about five feet above the floor of the bullion-office, and was broke into a little closet which the clerk of the bullion-office makes use of, and I am told generally stands open. In this situation I found the chimney, the tea-warehouse and the bullion-office; there were produced to me, at the same time, this gimblet and an iron crow, (a gimblet of five-eighths of an inch bore, and an iron crow, three feet ten inches long, produced in court): the crow was found in the lobby, and the gimblet in the tea-warehouse; the gimblet exactly fits the holes bored in the pieces of the floor now produced. There was a bag of dollars found behind an old door, which stood against the wall of the lobby: I made a very diligent enquiry, and having no reason to suspect any of the porters of the tea-warehouse, the robbery was immediately advertised: there is a door to this sailor's-lobby, which opens into a yard where the bullion is always loaded into carts by a crane, and where any body, being in the lobby, might see the same loaded; the bullion is packed up in chests and corded. I believe that door of the lobby is always open in time of business; it is a room about fifty feet long and fifteen or sixteen wide, so is the tea-warehouse over it. I advertised the particular marks and descriptions of the crow and gimblet, but heard nothing tending to a discovery till Thursday the 4th of April, in the afternoon, when a letter came from Mr.

            , the woman who went with him. Their examination was fixed for Monday, the 8th of April, at twelve o'clock; I was present: it was a long time before the woman would confess; at last she gave an exact account of the robbery, as she said it had been related to her by the prisoner: when the prisoner was called upon, he said at first, that on Tuesday, the 26th of March, he had seen a man in Stepney-fields, hiding something in a dunghill; that he watched him, and after he was gone, he took out this bag and carried it home; and seeing the advertisements in the public papers, concerning the robbery, he thought it best to go over to France, and dispose of the dollars there; that he was born at Cherburg, in France; and that all the dollars he found in the dunghill were contained in one bag, but he intended to carry them to France at two different times, and what he had not at Dover were left in his chest, at his lodgings in Barnaby-street, Southwark: this was the substance of what he said, when he was first examined; but after the young woman had made the discovery, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170029"/> was confronted with him, he said it was true that he had told her of the robbery, exactly as she had related it; but that one M'Cartey, a sailor, was the man who broke from the chimney into the tea-warehouse, and thence into the bullion-office, and stole the dollars; and that they had schemed it together, but M'Cartey had delivered all the dollars to him for sale, he not knowing how to get them off in town. He said he was present with M'Cartney in the India House, and assisted him at the time of the robbery. Some pieces of boiled beef had been found in the tea-warehouse; he said he bought that at a cook's-shop near the India House. I asked him how he came by the gimblet and crow; he said they were bought in Wapping, and mentioned, as well as I remember, that eighteen-pence was given for the gimblet and three or four shillings for the crow, but he could not tell at what shop, and that M'Cartey bought them. The young woman being asked very particularly, said she was sure nobody had assisted him in the robbery; that she knew a man of the name of M'Cartey, who had a slight acquaintance with the prisoner some time before; but that they had not been together for some time. I sent to Wapping to enquire after M'Cartey, and was told he had not been in town for several weeks, and it was supposed he was in some jail in the country (800 dollars and upwards produced in court); the three bags of dollars stolen, I understand, weighed 1200 and odd ounces. The prisoner said, upon his examination, that M'Cartey told him how he broke through the floor and wall, exactly in the same manner I have described; that the floor was broke through with a marling-spike (which was not found) and that the crow was made use of in breaking the wall of the bullion-office, and the dollars were conveyed through that hole, and down the lobby-chimney, by means of a rope (a rope produced); this rope appears to be part of some cordage that lies in the bullion-office, and is used in packing the bullion, and I understand was found in the lobby: he said M'Cartey was concealed in the chimney on the Saturday, the 23d of March, and himself behind the door, when the lobby was locked up; and that M'Cartey immediately went to work, and worked all night at it, but could not get through till about eleven on the Sunday; he also said M'Cartey was in the chimney when the lobby doors were opened, on the Monday morning, the 25th of March: he was asked why he did not mention the name of M'Cartey to the young woman; his answer was, that he had not a mind she should know that any body was concerned with him: he owned he had all along told her that nobody was concerned in the robbery but himself.</p>

            ; he has since acknowledged it was sent in on his account; and on the 26th I opened the bullion-office, between nine and ten in the forenoon, and perceived there were three bags missing out of the seven that I had taken particular notice of on the Saturday: I found the wall had been broke through. Then I went down stairs, into the court-room, to acquaint a gentleman with it; but he not being at home, I went to the deputy-chairman, Mr. Bolton, and acquainted him with it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170030"/>Q. How was the wall broke?</p>
               <p>Harris. The lining boards or wainscot in my closet were two of them thrown against the door, and another was displaced a little; I saw a hole in the brick wall; the place communicates with the tea warehouse; I was sent to Goldsmith's hall, to have handbills dispersed; so I did not look about to see the whole of the place they had broke through.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the dollars missing?</p>
               <p>Harris. About 335 l. they weigh pretty nearly all alike; we reckon them by weight?</p>

               <p>Q. How much might they weigh.</p>
               <p>Harris. The weight is about 1285 ounces; they are worth about 4 s. 6 d. each; I weighed them myself; I received them about ten days before; they came in in old bags, and we shift them into new ones, and mark them; I can say nothing to the identity of the bag; they were to be sent to India, and the returns were to be made in diamonds: a request was lodged in the bullion-office for the Company's leave to export the value of ten thousand ounces, which was granted by the court; they are exported in the Company's ships, and the Company have the custody of them till they are carried on board; I undertake to send them to the ship's husband, and he sees them on board the ship, the owner has no other care about them; they are carried in the same manner as the Company's bullion is; when the bullion is received on board the ship, the commanding officer sends up a receipt to us, acknowledging he has got the bullion on board the ship; the owner of the bullion has no more to do with it, only to tell us on which ship he will have it on board, and to what consigned, and it is all allowed to go freight free.</p>

            . I am bricklayer to the India Company: I was sent for by order of the directors; I went up stairs, and saw Mr. Harris; I saw they had broke through from the tea-warehouse into the bullion-office; the wall is two bricks and a half thick; the boards that run from top to bottom the wainscot, was boared through, two of them were tumbled down into the bullion-office, and I took a third down that was loose. I compared this gimblet with the holes, and it fitted exactly. I built the chimney. When we came to take the chimney down, which was only carried up to the top of the ceiling; it is not cieled but boarded; it is built up quite to the boards, the top was drawn in to a foot by fourteen inches. Over the core, on the back of the sloap, a hole was made between the back and the breast, and the bricks were put in between the boards and the joists: I took the chimney down, then we made the discovery at once. In the core there was I believe half a hundred weight of tea. I compared these three pieces of the floor of the tea-warehouse with the floor, and they sitted; I found some cordage after I pulled down the chimney; after that I went to Newgate, to the prisoner; he there confest he put the cordage in the farther corner of the lobby; he likewise said he left it there; I asked him what he did with the cord; he said the bags were let down by it: I said, honest friend, Who was concerned with you in this affair? Who, said he? then he set out a hammering; he said, There is one M'Cartey; I aided and assisted him. I said, How came you to do it? Said he, I was too lusty, M'Cartey was thinner than I. Said I, How did you manage it? He said, M'Cartey said, if I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170031"/> undertake to be concerned, he would engage to go through it; that M'Cartey was up the chimney, and he was up the chimney aiding and assisting; that he scrap'd the tea down as it fell below. Said I, How could you do this, as the tea ran down upon you enough to suffocate you? He said, We did not think of the tea, we thought of being in the bullion office at once. I asked him how he got up the chimney: he gave no account of that; he said he had a pint of beer before he went in, and that was all; I said, There was some beef found; he said M'Cartey bought the beef over the way; I said, Don't you go to bring an innocent man in; it is very odd you should have all the money and he none: said he, He is a bully for the whores, and he is pretty well known, and he did not chuse to have any of the money; and that he had given M'Cartey about ten guineas. I said, That was enough to kill you, with the tea coming upon you; he said, So it was, I thought I should have died: said I, How did you clean the place? Said he, I scraped the tea all down a hole, and it ran into an arrack cellar; he said, one of the bags slipped and made a terrible noise, that I did not go to work for some time: I said, You must have a large deal of assurance: how could you carry the bags off? Said he, I carried the bag under my arm, and the rest of the money I put into my pocket: I mentioned the bag left behind: he said he was afraid to come any more, but made off as fast as he could.</p>

He desired it to be opened; the constable refused o' pening the chest; then he desired Mrs. Woods; she refused to open it; I was called up; they told me the chest belonged to Pickett, and they refused to open it; I got a poker, and we burst it open; at first we discovered some papers of his receiving the money at the pay-office in Broad-street; we concluded to take an inventory of the things in the chest; we found jackets and shirts, and at the farther end of the chest we found a bag of dollars; then we directly thought of the India Company's affair; we went to go to Sir

            's, and in the mean time I thought proper to acquaint the Company of what we had found; I went into an alehouse, and wrote a line to the India Company what we had found, and supposed they were their property, and I would be glad if they would send somebody to meet me at Sir John's at six o'clock; I enquired of a young woman at the house, where Pickett was gone; I was informed it was imagined he was gone to Dover; that he went in a coach to the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, with a woman; we went there, and found such people were booked as they described them, and after that I was told they were gone to Dover; then I offered myself as a volunteer to the East India company to go to Dover after them; I and another man sat out about twelve at night, and got into Dover in the forenoon; I went to a merchant to whom I was recommended, and carried my letter, and told him my business; he said he would help me all in his power; he sent his clerk to get the warrant backed, and got an officer; the prisoner and Eliz. Finnick came past me; I had a brace of pistols about me; I thought these were the people that I came after. I ran after the prisoner, and catched him by the collar, and put a pistol to his breast, and said, If you venture to stir you are dead; you are my prisoner: he trembled, and said, He had not robbed any body: he made no resistance; I took him before a magistrate, and searched him; I found the key of the chest upon him that I had broke open at Mrs. Woods's, which I have tried since, and it fits exactly; then I insisted upon searching the woman, and in a green purse found upon her were 43 guineas, 12 half guineas, a 36 s. piece, a 27 s. piece, 17 s. 6 d. in silver, and two dollars; the clerk and I counted the money; I put it in my pocket, and asked where the prisoner lodged, and where their chest was: they said, they had none. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170032"/> went to the sign of the White Horse; I there demanded their chest; they told me which it was; we wrenched it open; in that I found 499 dollars more; I took the bag and carried it away to the magistrate; we counted them, and took the woman's pocket, and the two dollars, and put them in the bag, and put it up, and sealed it with the magistrate's seal and another; we took the prisoner and woman in a post-chaise, and got back as fast as I could; in returning I said to the prisoner, It will be better if you would confess: then he said, He was in the fields betwixt Whitechapel and Stepney, and he saw a man hiding something in a dung-hill; he waited there till the man was gone; then he went to the place and found a bag of dollars; that he brought them home, and used them as he thought proper, but was never concerned in stealing them himself; he said he had read the papers, and suspecting them to be the same dollars, he was going to a correspondent in France, in order to change them, and then to come back and carry over the other part, and change them. I brought all away in a box, and the prisoner and woman lived as I lived: I brought them as fast as I could to Sir

(The chest found in Barnaby-street produced, and the key fitted the lock.) I was present at all the examinations before Sir John; first of all they both denied it; they persisted on that of finding the dollars in the field; coming along they both agreed in that; and on Monday before Sir John they did the same some time: Sir John said, Have the woman away; she is only come to tell a pack of lies: when the woman came in again, she cried; Sir John said, Well, what have you got to say now? The prisoner had been examined, and was then put into the next room: then the woman confest: after the prisoner was brought in, the woman said the prisoner was guilty, and he was the only man that robbed the India house; and as to M'Cartey, she thought him to be innocent: (this was before the prisoner.) Then Sir John said to him, Is what the woman says true? He said, Yes, and please your honour: Sir John said, Did you tell this woman you had robbed the India-house? He answered, Yes: Sir John said, Are these all facts which the woman has said? He said, Yes: Sir John said, Had you not li ke to have been smothered with the tea and things? He said, Yes: He said, M'Cartey did it, and he was present assisting him at the time. In the chest at Mrs. Woods's I found the probate of a will, granted to

I have had several before; he put the bag of dollars in his chest; he told me on the Thursday morning, as we were in bed, he got them in the India-house; he said he went round and saw a chimney, and he got up; that he had a gimblet, and bored holes with it up through the bottom of the chest, and the tea fell down, and he did not know what it was; at last he found it was tea; he said he got through the chests of tea, and got up into the room; that he had made holes with a marling-spike, the gimblet, and an iron crow; he said there were more dollars, that he left behind the door, I think; I never counted the dollars; he and I were both taken up at Dover; I am acquainted there; I was at Dover fair with him; he proposed I should go down; I told him I would not live with him; I lived a very uneasy life; I wanted to see Mr. Fuller, that keeps the White Swan on the Pier; he had been in London, and told me he would send me up some things; the prisoner would not go without me, and I consented to go; he packed up every thing himself in this little chest, that had been mine; he had the key; he took and put the chest in the coach; that chest was afterwards found at Dover; I had some gold, and two dollars about me, which I had from him.</p>

               <p>E. Pursey. I don't know whether it was or not in my fright. (The money produced in court, one half, guinea very remarkable one).</p>

               <p>M. Clay. I was sent for to the prosecutor's house a little before ten o'clock: I first asked the prisoner if she knew, of her master's being robb'd she said she had heard something of it; I asked her what money she had about her? she said, she had none. I asked her what money she had up stairs? she said she had none. I said, Have you neither silver nor halfpence up stairs? she said, No. I desired her to consider the consequence, if she denied it; and it afterwards came out to be true. She said she had no money at all, except nine-pence, that was given her at divers times in halfpence. I told her it was entirely false what she had said, therefore I could not believe her any longer. I then produced this pocket with these halfpence in it. Then I produced this gold, and said, This was taken out of your pocket, how can you deny it? she then said she took it out of her mistress's pocket up stairs, after her master had got up to brew. I asked her how she came by the halfpence? she said there was a sixpence among it was her own, which I gave her; but the rest of the halfpence, she said, she had taken out of the till last week. After that she was charged with the same at Hick's Hall; there she also acknowledged it. I never heard any thing amiss of her before. She was brought up at a charity-school in our parish. I have known her from a child: she is 17 years of age.</p>

Yesterday morning we miss'd a china bowl that was generally in the house; I desired the maid to go and look into the closet to see for it, and she miss'd two or three more. I suspected the prisoner, as he used to come backward and forwards. I keep cows, and he is a milkman. I apply'd to one of my men where the prisoner lodges, to ask if the prisoner had brought any thing home over night, he told me, he had enquired of a friend of the prisoner's at Limehouse, and he found the prisoner had left a tea-pot there. I enquired at home, and found there was one lost. I went to that house, and desired the woman to let me have that tea-pot that the prisoner left there. I brought it home, and my maids all knew it to be mine after that I took the prisoner into my parlour; and charged him with taking a china bowl, and china tea-pot he denied it, and said, he had no china at all. I said, Have you no tea-pot? he said, No. Then I shewed him the tea-pot, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170036"/> said that he had left it to be sold for 4 s. 6 d. in Ropemakers fields. He said he had that pot of a woman in Ratcliff highway. She was fetched: she declared she never saw it with her eyes before. Then I got a warrant, and charged him: he then went on his knees, and begged I would have nothing to do with it; saying, it was the first time, and necessity drove him to it: this he confessed before my family, and before the Justice also.</p>

The Medway's boat impressed him out of my vessel, a timber sloop, called the Prosperous; he was impressed in the Downs between the North and South Foreland: I cannot say how long it is ago; it was the beginning of the war. I know he, was this woman's brother: I have seen them together about four times; they passed for brother and sister while he belonged to me. He failed with me two years. I paid him his wages after that at the new hospital at Gosport. I have seen him on board the Medway: after that, he told me he had a mind to make a will and power to his sister Pritchard when in the hospital, but he could not then well spare the money to pay for it.</p>

On the 16th of March, about half an hour past 7 at night, I was sitting looking through my window; I saw a person's hand drawing a large nest of pans from the opposite corner. I gave the person an opportunity to carry them a little way. I went out, it was the prisoner; she had got about four or five yards with them. There was a man stood with open arms to receive the pans at the end of the bench. I took her by the arms and said, Ship-mate, where are you going with these? she said, D - n your eyes, what is that to you. I said, Pray, how far are you going to carry them? she said, You shall be d - d before I'll let you know, and spit in my face. I said, if that is the case, I will know where you are going: you shall come back and place them where you had them. She said, I'll see you d - d first. I took her back, and said, Put them down there. She said again, Ay! you shall be d - d first, and listed them up, and let them fall, and broke three of them, and spit in my face again. I pushed her from me against the shutter. The fellow said, Why do you use the woman thus? He was very pert, and she very abusive. I conducted her to the Counter: and when I came to take her out on the Monday, there was that man sitting by her. I have found since they cohabited together.</p>

I had left it in the house, and when I came for it, it was gone.</p>
               <p>Jos. Buckmaster. That day we had about 300 kitts of salmon came in. I met the prisoner with a kit of salmon under his arm, about half an hour after 3 o'clock that day, at the King's Head door as I was going in. I said, How odd that man carries his kit of salmon! Soon after that Russel came in and enquired for his kit, and it was missing. The next time I saw the prisoner, I asked him how he came by that kit? he said, he never had any, or sold any salmon in his life. When we came before the sitting Aldermen, there he owned he took the kit of salmon, being drunk, and was willing to make restitution. He said he sold it at Greenwich.</p>

             were looking out for a fare; by and by I saw the man that came first by me with a small cask on his shoulder: he got it away in an instant. And on the Saturday following, I saw that same fellow came peeping about there again; but I having a fare to carry a person to Westminister, did not see the last of him then. After that Mr. Enderby hired me as a watchman. I saw the prisoner and another man come on shore in a waterman's boat; I got behind a nook, behind the corner of the necessary. A boy said to me, What are you doing here? I said, I am waiting for a fare: it rained that night. Presently this man and another asked the boy to drink; the boy said, Thank you; and went with the prisoner. After he came back again, the boy said, Mr. Ellen, I am afraid I am upon no good design: these men have agreed with me, I am to carry them up, with a vessel of small beer, for a shilling. I went up to the Fortune of War, and told my two assistants (they are servants to the prosecutors) I desired them to be in the way, for there were two strapping fellows, I could not take them myself: then I went down to my boat, and broke my mop-stick in two: said the boy, What did you do that for? I said, to shy at the rats; don't you see how they run about? by and by came the two thieves out of that public house; they and my two assistants had been all fitting together. I saw the prisoner fumbling at the cellar door of the warehouse; he clapped his shoulder to it, and shoved it open: by and by I saw him roll a cask of oil out of the warehouse. I jumpt to him, and said, You villain, what do you do that for? he said, What, What, What, What! and made a blow at me, and miss'd me. I took this stick and knocked him down with it. (Producing a large piece of a mop-stick.) The other fellow was come out of the cellar; I made a blow at him; he bobb'd his head and I miss'd him. I jumpt to the prisoner, and swore I would blow his brains out if he did not go with me; but I had nothing but this mop-stick about me. I took and led him almost forty yards, calling Thieves, Fire, and the like, but nobody came to help me. When I came to the public house door, there came out one of my assistants, with a pipe in his mouth; the prisoner had insisted upon going into that public house, and I gave him another knock on the head, because he should not get away from me. When I got him into the public house, there sat my other assistant, with a pipe in his mouth: then they went away, and left me to take care of the prisoner. I asked for a pennyworth of gin. I then asked for a knife to cut the waist-band of his breeches, that he should not run away. He said don't cut my flesh. Every one in the house called me thief-catcher except the landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170039"/>Ellen. God knows; for I had enough to do take care of the prisoner. The servants said, after they had hunted about they bolted the warehouse-door; but in the morning the door was open: I imagine he ran into the warehouse. The prisoner said he was to carry that cask to the Britannia, by London bridge, where a Jew was to have met him for it. We took and marched him to look for Mr. Jew, but I kept him so long that the Jew was gone. He owned he had taken a cask the day before.</p>

               <p>I was coming out of the public house, going to the necessary house by the water side; I tumbled over this barrel.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The barrel of oil lay by the warehouse door. The prisoner acknowledged to me that he took it out, and that he had taken some before.</p>
               <p>Ellen. The other man with him was a very stout fellow; we imagine he has entered himself for a soldier, to go to the East Indies.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen either of them since?</p>
               <p>Walker. I have seen the watch, coat, and waistcoat, and one book. When the prisoner was charged before the Justices at Whitechapel the book was found upon him: that was on Saturday the 16th. The Justices told me, as it was in the city I must take him before my Lord Mayor. I took him there; the crowd being so numerous I took a coach. When in the coach I promised, if he would tell me where the things were, I would not hurt or prosecute him: he seemed to be relent, said he was an unhappy wretch; and that if I would not hurt him he would tell me. I said I would not. He said he had pawned the waistcoat in one place in Rosemary-lane, and the coat was in another; and the watch he had exchanged for another in Tower-street, to a house-carpenter: thus instead of going to my Lord Mayor, we drove to Rosemary-lane. We first got the waistcoat, then the coat, then we went and got the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you count you did right?</p>
               <p>Walker. If I had not promised him, we should not have got the things again. He then was under the care of a constable: I could neither hinder or forward it.</p>

I snatch'd a pocket-book out of his trowsers: I went to see what was in it, he snatch'd it from me. And when we came to the Justices he threw the book away; it was pick'd up.

            . I was housekeeper to Lady Doddington Montague, in Grosvenor-square; the prisoner was a servant there. About the latter end of September, or the beginning of October, the cook called me up stairs, and shewed me the goods mentioned in the indictment; they were found in the prisoner's possession in his box in his room: she desired I would not tell the prisoner how I came to see them, but desired I would talk to him when he came in: when he came in I asked him if he had any acquaintance in that branch of business; he said he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lie in that room beside the prisoner?</p>
               <p>A. Ripley. No: I told him there had been a person to enquire if I had seen such sort of things, and I had searched his room and saw such things, and desired he would give me an account how he came by them: he told me part of them he had taken from out of a house where he had lived, and part of them were given him by another man, named John.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention what house?</p>
               <p>A. Ripley. No, he did not; upon that I told him they were very bad things to be seen on such a person, and in time he might come into trouble. I bid him carry them back again the next morning, for I would not suffer stolen goods to be in the house: I thought he had taken them away, he told me afterwards that he had: I did not know that he had them by him, till the day he was taken up: my lady's cook came and said he had behaved in a very bad manner, and used me very ill to my lady; and that he had charged the servants, on the peril of their lives, never to let me see my lady, if he was gone out, (I had married and was gone away). I asked her if she knew any thing of the things that we had seen before; she said they were in the house: upon that I went to my lady's house, and the prisoner opened the door to me: I asked to see my lady; he said I could not see her: I said, I should insist upon seeing her: he went in and told my lady I was there. I went in to her, she was angry with me: I said, if I had deceived her in any thing it was concerning the prisoner, and I was there to answer for what accusations might be laid against me: we had a great deal of debate. I told her what things I had seen upon him, and that I believed they were still in the house; the house was searched, and they could not be found. My lady bid me go down with the servant; I went: I observed him with a bundle, which he was taking out of a closet: I took the bundle out of his hand; there were the things that were mentioned in the indictment, with other things: I carried them up stairs, and shewed them to my lady; my husband was with me.

I went there to her, and asked her for the key of the room, and where the goods were; she delivered me the key, and said she had made away with the saucepan and a sheet: I came home and looked in the room; there I found all the things, mentioned in the indictment, were gone: she told me she had pawned the sheet at Mr. Taylor's, Catharine-wheel-alley, Bishopsgate street, and the saucepan at Mr. Dellope's. I went to her again, and told her the other things were missing; then she owned she had pawned them also, and told me where; the pail and bellows at Mr. Dellope's, and the box-iron at Mr. Taylor's: we found them accordingly.</p>

            . I am a taylor: in the years 62 and 63, there was an agreement made betwixt the journeymen taylors: I belonged to a body of them, and was chose out to represent them at the Hand-and-Shears, in Cloth-fair.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did that society consist of?</p>
               <p>Blood. That society consisted of about thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of the prisoners members of that society or club?</p>
               <p>Blood. No, they were not: That house the journeymen used to meet at is a house of call.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come to a resolution to raise money?</p>
               <p>Blood. We came to the resolution to raise money in the year 1762, the week before Easter; then we came to a resolution, through the town, to leave our masters, if they would not give us three shillings a day. This was done in the committees first, and then carried to each house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a representative?</p>
               <p>Blood. That is a person chose in order to go and meet at a general meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know there was to be a general meeting?</p>
               <p>Blood. We gave it out in secret where we were to meet again: there was notice of it left at every house of call, in the year 1762, to meet at such a house; we could never discover who these letters came from; but the signification of them was, that each society should send two men to meet at a particular house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the first house of this meeting?</p>
               <p>Blood. I believe that was the Green-Dragon, in Fleet street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your particular society do, in consequence of that?</p>
               <p>Blood. Notice was laid before the club, and they agreed (so did most of the houses in town) to meet: our society sent me, and another man named Howard: we there might be thirty or forty of us that met from other clubs. Sparks was one that met there; he represented the Brown-Bear, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when there?</p>
               <p>Blood. We had the letter read to us; there was no name to it: we consulted to have another meeting; that was all that was done then. We met again the week following, at the Sun in Devereux-court; we had a particular reason for varying the house, fearing we should be known; they apprehended it was not lawful for them to meet: when we met in Devereux-court, we did not know whether all the houses had agreed to have 3 s. a day. The letter was to stir up all the journeymen taylors to insist upon 3 s. a day: we were to represent it to our respective bodies, and see what they said. That night we agreed to meet the week following, then we should have a club night in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you represent to your club what had passed at the Green-Dragon?</p>
               <p>Blood. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you from your society any authority to consent, or join in any acts, to raise your wages?</p>
               <p>Blood. They were agreeable to my going, to see whether the others would agree.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses were there?</p>
               <p>Blood. There were forty-two houses, and we went two from a house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter upon any business at the Sun, in Devereux-court?</p>
               <p>Blood. We represented what our members were agreeable to, and agreed to continue our meeting till the spring of the year; and then, at a proper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170043"/> time to raise our wages. When we strike, the masters cannot help themselves. Then we were at the spring to leave work, unless our masters would give us three shillings a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any dispute about the hours of work?</p>
               <p>Blood. No; they made no dispute about that then: the masters had then submitted to the hours, to leave off at 7 o'clock; the hour had been taken off and laid on again, and the men would not work it: the only consideration we had was the wages: I acquainted the body that I represented of these resolutions.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of the prisoners there then?</p>
               <p>Blood. There were Mr. Sparks and Mr. Manning there then: this was in Devereux-court; we met every week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come to any uniform agreement concerning fixing this three shillings a day, or to strike at the soring?</p>
               <p>Blood. We continued from February till a fortnight before Easter, then the whole town agreed to strike.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet next?</p>
               <p>Blood. I believe it was at the Queen's Arms in Newgate-street: Sparks and Manning were there then. I believe there were near fourscore of us. The city and the other end of the town did not agree: the city fell off from the agreement rather: every house was not willing to strike; the other side Temple-bar signalized themselves from this side; they said, If the city would not agree with them, they would have a meeting themselves, and would strike on the Monday morning. They wanted to have 3 shillings and three halfpence a day: the city did not come to a resolution that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was chosen speaker of the house of representatives?</p>
               <p>Blood. Every one had liberty to speak. Mr. Sparks was the principal man that did speak commonly: we were always ruled a great deal by him, because he had been in former schemes; we looked upon him as one of the principal persons. This division was on a Thursday night; but on the Sunday night we had a meeting among ourselves. On the Monday night the other end of the town struck: the city disagreed one among another. On the Tuesday night, about 8 o'clock, came two men to us, and said, We hear the other men have struck, and we are willing: they came from the Shepherd and Goat, Fleet-ditch. They said, Let us go round and see if the others will agree. I was chose out of my society to go to three more houses in the city, I went to the Ship in Lime-street, and the Crown in Duke's Place: we had word brought they were agreeable in Black Friars; there are two or three houses of call there. At the Ship in Lime-street I told them the resolution of our house, and that we had come to a resolution to strike: they were agreeable if the Crown in Duke's Place and two others would. I went to the Crown in Duke's Place on a club night, when the members were all present: they consented to it: there was

             at the Crown. I went to the Faulcon in Duke's Place that was near it, and made the proposal to them, and they were agreeable; (our meetings were all on one night). I returned back to my society, and they sent about; they were all agreeable; every representative went to his own club, and every body were to strike in the morning. We did in general through the city all strike. I can't say where our next general meeting was: it was the week after Easter. Tuesday is the club-night of the society, and on Wednesday they all struck from work: the week after we met a representative for the city and county all together: Mr. Sparks always attended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the house of representatives agree to confirm and abide by what had been done?</p>
               <p>Blood. Yes, they did. Our meetings continued once a week all the year. They came to a resolution at the other end of the town to raise six-pence a week in the year 1762; towards the latter end of the summer we apprehended the masters might object to the wages, and turn the men off: so we thought proper to have a stock to supply the men in the vacation from July to Michaelmas, (then the trade falls off); this was to be continued till every man had paid in six shillings, or they might pay it all at once: that was complied with and raised; it was sometimes lodged in the landlord's hands, sometimes with the members; which we thought proper. This was also to be applied to support an opposition to the masters: every house kept their own stock. I believe there were between three and four thousand of us embodied; and if any man was not agreeable to pay this money, there were orders given he should not be worked with. If a man was at work, if he had not paid the money, we would tell the master he must not keep him; we would not work with him; and if the master continued him in work, that master was not to be work'd for; this was at the latter end of 1762, and beginning of 1763. All the prisoners were present at these committees a different times. Milbourn represented the Shepherd and Goat, Fleet ditch; Manning and Cannon, the One Ton in the Strand; Sparks, the

I have seen all these persons at their meetings. In February 1763 the masters began to take it up; they came to a resolution to make the journeymen submit to Rule of Court, to work from six to eight, at 2 s. 6 d. a day one quarter of the year, and 2 s. 2 d. the rest of the year: the journeymen agreed still to continue at 3 s. a day, and work no longer than to seven o'clock. The city consented to raise 12 s. each member raised 6 s. more, to defend all causes. If a journeyman was to be prosecuted, we were to support him. We all did refuse to submit to a Rule of Court, and we regularly did communicate the resolution to the houses; and if any member met with a refractory journeyman, he gave an account of him to the committee; then that was carried to the general committee. Each representative took his name to their respective clubs, and that man was not to be worked with. If the master insisted on keeping him, he was to lose all the others. They that were agreeable to our rules we called Flints, and those that were not were called Dungs. When our troubles came on, there was an order of the committee for every member to pay 6 d. and the representatives were to bring it to the committee. Sparks was the man that raised the money: we raised in the whole I believe to the amount of fifteen or sixteen hundred pounds. We fixed upon men to go and consult Mr. Hewlate the attorney upon matters of difficulty, and so reported his opinion. About the beginning of the year 1763, we looked upon it that Mr. Dove, Mr. Fell, and Mr. Mason, three masters, were stirring up strife against us: so we fixed upon them, th at they should not be served. We insisted upon the men that worked for them to come away and leave them: it was a general resolution they should have no men work for them. The master of the House of Cail sends the men, and if he sent any there, the body of men in that house would be fined so much money for serving contrary to rule: Johnson has not been with us these 12 months.</p>

            . I am a journeyman taylor; I belonged to the Joyner's Arms on the other side of the water: when I first was a committee man in the year 1762, the first house I met at was the Red Lion, in Bull and Mouth-street; this was only a city meeting. Our society had paid no money at that time, and they agreed that I should go to know what resolutions they had come to: I found they had collected 4 s. a man. I brought that resolution to our body of people, and told them the town was very much dissatisfied that we had paid no money in: we agreed to pay in 6 s. at 2 s. a week, from our house. The money was collected: this was to enable us to defend ourselves, if the masters brought on any prosecutions. It was resolved, that they should not work under 3 s. and 3 halfpence a day. When the order of sessions was in the year 1764, we came to a resolution to oppose it: we on the other side of the water subscribed 12 s. a man, and this side the water was but 6 s. If any man thought proper to comply with the order of sessions, he was scratch'd out of the society he belonged to; and in case we found out any man that worked contrary to our resolutions, he was represented to the general committee, and the representatives were to report him to their separate body; so that all journeymen throughout the town were not to work with him if the master continued him; and such masters were to be without men from our houses. The city raised above seven hundred pounds in the years 1762 and 1763: I do not know what was raised in the county; I believe the sum raised at the other end of the town came to that sum, or rather more. I remember the men leaving Mr. Dove, Mr. Fell, and Mr. Mason: they left Mr. Dove on account of one Breary working for him; and I remember the men leaving Mr. Mason on account of one Hollyday working with him; and the people belonging to the Crown in Duke's Place were not to be worked with, because they did not come into the scheme at that time. I have been in company with all the men trying now. I was at a meeting in the year 1763, at the Hole in the Wall, Fleet-street: then we had a general meeting of the whole town by the representatives, both of the city and suburbs. I was last at a meeting in April 1764, then I saw Jones, Milbourn, and Macham. Mr. Dobson has not been a committee man these two years. I have not been with Manning, Cannon, Sparks, Dobson, Berry, and Johnson for a year and a half, or better; since I was with Garrick it is rather longer.</p>
               <p>Blood. I do not imagine Cannon has left off acting three months: there was a striking last March. Cannon acted all last summer. I was in company with him at the One Ton, in the Strand, last March; he delivered to me three letters to three houses, for the society to come into the body again: these letters were to invite the houses to send representatives to contract with them again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176504170045"/>Q. to Chapel. For what purpose was the 6 s. a man collected?</p>
               <p>Chappel. That was to defend the law suit; or, in case a man was out of work, it was left to the representatives to do as they thought proper. We were still to bring our proportion to the law, if required; the men that did not work were supported with 6 s. a week; I paid 2 l. 12 s. 6 d. to Sparks from the society, at the Joyner's arms, Oct. 19, 1763. (The receipt which Sparks gave to him, produced and read in court.</p>

               <p>Berry's Defence.</p>
               <p>I work'd for a man for 3 s. a day; I left him; he saw me after that, and asked me to come again, and he would give me as much as any man; he gave me 3 s. 6 d. a day; I worked for him for half a crown a day: if I have done amiss, I am sorry for it; the order was given out no man should work with us; we were all turned about our business; I do not believe any master can lay to my charge that I asked them for any wages; I have never been near these societies since the charge was given out at Guildhall.</p>
