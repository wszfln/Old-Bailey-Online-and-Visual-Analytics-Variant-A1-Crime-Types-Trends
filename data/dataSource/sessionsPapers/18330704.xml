               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is William your only name? A. Yes; my family consists of my three cousins, who live with me; they are all females; the porter, his wife, and servant; they all sleep in the house - Mr. Maltby, his housekeeper, and his maid-servant; they live at the top of the house - they are not here to-day, I believe; all my cousins are here - I went to bed that night, I should think, about ten minutes after one - I had been spending the evening at Mr. Bentley's, the publisher - Mr. Hibbert has no second christian name; I have seen him sign his name many times.</p>

On the night of the robbery, I was the last person up; the window shutters and every thing was well fastened and secured when I went to bed; the window shutters were entire, there was no hole in them; the window in question was fastened with a bar - I went to bed at half-past one - I was awoke about half-past three in the morning by a noise in the street, I heard Mrs. Hooper and the watchman at high words; I immediately threw up my window, and saw chips laying, and the area-door open - my window is at the back of the house - I became alarmed, and I apprised Mr. Upcott - I called the police over, and then went down stairs, and found the house in the state Mr. Upcott has described - I know a person named Baglee, she has been in the habit of frequenting the house, so as to know the state of it perfectly well; she called on me on the 4th of May, after having been absent a year and three questions; she know the interior of the house perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. A gentleman, named Maltby, lived in the house? A. Yes; he has a housekeeper and an under servant; and there is a porter to the Institution - I can't he certain that I had seen all these persons that night; I know I saw the porter at half-past ten o'clock at night; I had not seen him after half-past ten - I did not go into any at the bed-rooms, to see if the servants were gone to had - I certainly can't tell whether the porter might not have been up after me, or the under servant of Mr. Upcott- my niece and daughter were in the house, they are here.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Eldon-street; my husband is a builder. A room in my house commands a view back of the Institution - on Sunday morning the 19th of May. I had been up all night attending to a sick lady in my house; and about a quarter-past three o'clock in the morning my attention was down towards the Institution - it was a harmful morning; it was the flowers on the tree lookout of window - the morning was clear, so that everything - (there is a gate or door in the passage, which separates the Institution-garden from the passage) - I saw that door open, and a hand introduced, and a beckoning motion was made in a direction towards Long-alley - my husband was at the window, at the same time, looking out - Mr. Hooper opened one window, and I opened the other, to see who they were beckoning to; we saw nobody - the door was shut and opened, and a beckoning made with the hand five or six times; and then the door opened, and a face looked out up the street, and down the street - the person had no hat on - the door was shut and opened three times, and every time I saw the same face put out, and had a distinct view of the face every time - it was the prisoner Sanderson - I am sure that is the man I saw look out - Mr. Hooper said something to me - I thought it was a love affair, and he thought it was a robbery - we directly called for the watch and police; the watchman stood at the lamp, and did not attend to our call - then the gate opened, and three men ran out together - they crossed to my side of the way, to get out of sight - we called out, Watchman, police, and thieves; and my husband did the same; and brought people out in all directions - the police came round the corner - they were all three then in sight in Queen-square, and the policemen ran after them - the prisoner Jones is very nigh the size of one of the persons running away - it was about five or ten minutes to three o'clock when I first saw them, and it was twenty minutes after that they ran out - I might have seen them for twenty minutes - it was about a quarter-past three o'clock when they ran out - I don't know that I said it was a quarter past three o'clock when I first went to the window - it was about twenty minutes after three o'clock when they ran away - I had been watching them about twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say at first it was a quarter after three when you first looked out of window? A. I don't recollect it - being up all night, I knew the time very well indeed - I had got a clock close by me, and looked at it directly after they run away - I am sure it had not struck three when I first saw the hand - I had never seen Sanderson in my life before - I was very much alarmed the whole day - I was very ill through it - I am very sorry I could not get somebody to assist - my husband was not dressed, nor was I - I made more noise that night than I ever did before - it was me that disturbed the last witness - I was calling to the watchman to know what was the matter - I said at the police office that one of the persons was near the size of Jones - what I said was read over to me and I signed it; I said I do not swear to his face; I said he was near his size, I am sure - when they came out, they all had hats on; I could not see either of their faces then; they ran very fast - one had a brown coat on, but I could not see which it was - my window was so near the door which the head was put out of, I could see the face quite perfectly; I might be about fifty yards off; it was a beautiful fine morning; I saw the watchman directly we looked for him; we did not look for him till we saw the face; it was directly after the hand was put out the last time; the watchman was leaning against the lamp iron; it could not be half a minute; I turned my head and there he was; I had not looked at the lamp iron before - I began to call out after the hand was put out the last time; I beckenod to the watchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040005"/>and told him, there was something going on there, but he never moved; he stood opposite Wilson-street, which is the width of the Institution, to the other gate; he might be fifty or sixty yards from the door; it was so near that he could see me; he was a parish watchman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is he so now? A. I believe they turned him away; when I accused the watchman, he told me he was deaf and blind; I told him the parish had better pay him to lie in bed, and not to be about - I was dressed at that time; I had come down in the street; I had called out of the window before I came down; the policeman came directly round the corner, when I called, and said,"there they go."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could the watchman see the hand put out where he stood? A. I have every reason to believe he did see it.</p>

             (policeman G 151). At half-past one on Sunday morning, the 19th of May, I was in Wilson-street, close to the Institution; I there saw three men walking along at a slow pace; Jones and Shaw were two of them; Shaw I am certain of; Jones I am almost certain of, but not so certain of him as the other; Sanderson is about the size of the third man - Shaw made an observation after he passed me, he said, "He did not care a d-n for no policemen; one of the two said "hold your tongue, he has said nothing to you, say nothing to him." They walked on and turned down Eldon-street, and there I saw them pass Long Alley, they were in my sight about ten minutes; I saw no more of them - Jones was dressed in a green coat, made in the Newmarket fashion; Shaw in a blue coat; the other man had a dark coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was about half-past one? A. Yes; I did not hear of this robbery for a fortnight afterwards; it did not take place on my beat; I did not appear at the police office till after the third or fourth examinations - I had not known Shaw before to speak to him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where the persons walking in the same direction as yourself. A. Yes; Shaw looked round and looked me particularly in the face; it was he who made use of the observation which made me take more particular notice of them.</p>

            . I am a married woman; I have come from prison to give evidence here; I have been committed for want of sureties; I know the house well, where Mr. Upcott lives and knew where he kept his property - I know the prisoner Sanderson very well, and I have a slight knowledge of the other two; I became acquainted with them through Sanderson - I had seen Sanderson about four years ago, but have known him more intimately for the last four months; I remember walking with him and Jones near the London Institution about a week before the robbery - previous to this I had met Sanderson on the Saturday fortnight before the robbery, and told him I was going to see a friend of mine; he asked me, where to; I said, to the London Institution, and told him I was almost afraid to go, because I was afraid I had offended Mr. Upcott, on account of some little circumstance; he asked me why I did not go and see, I said I would; I said I was going then; (this was a fortnight before the robbery); I made an appointment to meet Sanderson when I came away, and I went to Mr. Upcott's, and met Sanderson accordingly; he asked me if I had been; I said, yes; he asked, if I had seen him; I said, no; he asked me, what Mr. Upcott was; I told him, he was Librarian to the London Institution; he asked me, if he was a man of property; I told him, I did not know, but I believed he was a man that took a great deal of pride in some gold coins which he had got - nothing further passed at that time, but about a week afterwards, as near as I can recollect; I met Sanderson by appointment; he took me down to Jones's house, at the bottom of Holborn-hill, and I there saw Mr. and Mrs. Jones; and Sanderson asked Jones, if he would like to take a walk, as he was going to take a walk; Jones made answer, that he had no objection, and we all three came out to take a walk, Sanderson, Jones, and myself; leaving Mrs. Jones at home - when we got as far as Long-lane, Smithfield; I said "Where are we going to?" Jones said he wanted to go round Finsbury-square; we went that way, and went to see the Catholic chapel; he said he had never seen it, and should like to see it; it is near the London Institution - we came round by the Catholic chapel, and walked round till we came to the back of the London Institution; then Sanderson asked me, if that was not where my friend lived; I said, yes, it is, and those are his rooms which you can see; and then he asked me, which was the room he kept his property in, and I told him the room in the hall - Jones and Sanderson desired me to walk on a little, and they stood at the rails for the space of two minutes; I walked on; he asked me where the family slept.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say he asked you, were the others by all the time, joining in the conversation? A. Yes, it was a conversation among us all three - I told him I did not know, but I believed at the top of the house; he asked me if anybody slept down stairs; I told him the porter and his wife - nothing further passed then. - I read in a newspaper of the robbery, a day or two after the robbery;(it was nine or ten days after teh day we took the walk,) and from the description it gave of Sanderson, I went immediately to him where he lodged; I asked him if he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040006"/>anything of Mr. Upcott's robbery; he said, "No, how came you to think of such a thing" - he said, he thought I was talking very foolish, and I had better go home, and he saw me home, and told me to meet him next morning, which I did accordingly; he said I was to meet him at the corner of the street where he lodged; he asked me then if I wanted any money; I said, yes, if he liked to give me some; he gave me 2l. and told me to buy myself a new dress; I went to buy the dress - he did not go with me - I went to see Mrs. Jones, and had a conversation with her; I know nothing more - I saw the prisoners when in custody; I was taken into custody myself, and told all I know about it, and the conversation I had with Mrs. Jones - when they were talking about the house and property, I told them Mr. Upcott kept nothing but papers in his room below - I never saw Shaw in Jones's or Sanderson's company; I have seen him speaking to them - Sanderson had on a black coat in general; I don't recollect noticing Jones's clothes - when I saw Shaw speaking to Sanderson, I think he had on a blue coat, and yellow buttons; I can positively say that - Sanderson represents himself to be a working jeweller.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Shaw has a blue coat and yellow buttons on now, has not he? A. Yes; it is a very common dress - I don't know why I told Sanderson that Mr. Upcott kept nothing but papers below - he asked me where he kept his property - I don't know why I said he kept nothing but papers below - I am a married woman - I am not living with my husband; Sanderson had given me money before, but not to that amount; he had not given me money often before - about twice I suppose; I never was in Mr. Upcott's service, nor living in the house, nor in the Institution; Mr. Upcott has shown me where the papers were - I have been in service - I have left my husband two years; I have not been in service those two years - part of that time I have been at home with my father and mother, and part of the time with a friend that has taken care of me - I swear that - that is the only way I have got my living since I left my husband.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to get money from Sanderson twice? A. He offered me the money, and I took it - I understand what you mean; I have been living with my friend at No. 3, Weston-place, Paddington - I have lived there about two months - I cannot swear that I have been there three months - I will swear that I have been there one month; I was at my father's house frequently after parting from my husband - it is more than six months ago since I left my father's house; I lived with my friend since that time - I lived with that friend in Duke-street - I have been living entirely with that friend since I left my father's house; I know a man named Maze - that is the person I am living with - Sanderson is no relation of mine - it was while I was living with Maze that he gave me the money - Maze is about thirty years of age - he is no relation of mine - we are living together as man and wife; I believe Sanderson had no reason for giving me money but pure friendship - I swear that I don't know of any other reason - I understand you; I believe it was pure disinterestedness that made him give me the money - I cannot say whether it was two or three times - I don't recollect more than three; I am sure he has not given me money six times.</p>

I own it is true I was in the house a little after eleven o'clock - we were in great distress, and are so now - we walked by the house, and saw the door open; we went in with no good intent, but the things now produced never did belong to us, and never were in our possession - we had hardly shut the door before it was opened, and we flew up stairs - I must leave myself to the mercy of the Court, it was done through want.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I received the prisoner in custody at Brooke's shop; his hand was cut and bleeding - as I took him to the station-house, (I neither threatened nor made him any promise) he told me he run his hand through the window to get out the seals, saying, he thought he might run away with them, but as it was, he hoped he might be transported.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You told me next morning, that I said that I could have run away if I liked. Witness. No, I did not; he seemed rather sorry next morning, and wished to see Mr. Brooke - he said he was not so drunk as he appeared to be.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker; I live in the Curtain-road, Shoreditch. I have known the prisoner from infancy; his character was exemplary in all respects, as a sober, industrious, honest man - he was employed in a cotton manufactory when young - I never heard anything disrespectful of his character - I think this must have been done under mental excitement - about a year and a quarter ago, he lost his father, mother, and sister, who were all the near relatives he had, and he was committed to my care; and he has conducted himself with the strictest propriety - he has had work to do up to the day this transaction took place - he was with me; he never lost his time, and was never out at night, and never had any vicious propensity whatever - I always considered his propensity on the side of virtue - this was under influence of mental excitement; his mind I believe sustained great injury from the loss of his father, mother, and sister; and since that I believe there has been some other causes - he had no medical attendant - he was at work as early as five or six o'clock in the morning on the day of this occurrence - he is a cabinet maker, and a very industrious ingenious young man.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by mental excitement? A. There has been something of an exchange of sentiment between himself and a female - he met with some difficulty in this attachment; and I believe this was the cause of his leaving my house in the morning - he had received some objections to his overtures that day, and I account for this being the principal cause - many have committed suicide under such circumstances - he has never been in a state of confinement, nor under medical treatment.</p>

Inquiry was made, and this having been ascertained to be the fact, the learned Judges have determined that the said bills are illegally presented, and no judgment has been passed in those cases; but a Special Commission it is expected will issue for the purpose of fresh bills being preferred, and the cases in which prisoners have been convicted to be re-tried. The Court have accordingly ordered those prisoners, as also those whose cases have not been tried, to be detained; and only passed judgment upon those prisoners against whom Indictments were found at the London and Westminster Sessions. The indictments which have been illegally found are printed in ITALICS.</p>

I was so on the 13th of May; I no longer belong to that body; I belong now to the Lincoln militia; I entered that on the 4th of June, as sergeant-major - I had been in the Metropolitan police upwards of twelve months, as near as I can guess; I belonged to the C division - on the 13th of May, I was called out; about twelve o'clock we fell in at St. James' watch-house, and proceeded to a riding-school in Gray's-inn-lane - I don't know the name of the riding-school; it was on the right hand side as we went to Calthorpe-street - we arrived at the riding-school about two o'clock, and remained there upwards of an hour - after we had marched there we fell in regularly in the stables, and I was ordered to march out with the right sub-division of the C division; there was about forty or forty-two constables in that sub-division - we marched out into Gray's-inn-lane, turned round the corner to the left hand, and went into <placeName id="t18330704-5-crimeloc33">Calthorpe-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Could you see any part of the banner itself? A. I did; it was a sort of American colour, a union, white and red - I know the colours of the American standard; it seemed to me to be a flag or colour; I could not see the size of it; I saw it folded in the man's left hand; I saw a part of white and a part of red on it; I did not see any other colour; it was fastened to a pole or stick - the prisoner is the man who had the flag; I am certain of him; when he came opposite to where I was in the centre of the street, he raised his right hand and struck me on the sixth rib on the left side - I had been doing nothing before he struck me, only commanding the sub-division; I neither raised my staff nor touched any individual since I came into the street, nor saw anybody else attempt to do so - the blow was with the right hand; it was with an instrument something like a dagger, seven or eight inches long; the hilt of the dagger was brass - after I received the blow, I retired back two or three paces, and after I had retired I looked particularly at the prisoner, and saw an instrument like a dagger in his right hand - I received a severe wound; it produced such a wound that I was obliged to leave the division - I saw another constable there named Redwood, he was on my left; he went towards the prisoner; I then turned and looked at him, and saw him and the prisoner, and other constables scuffling together in the street - I went to the end of the street towards the fields, and there I met the sergeant, who took me to a doctor's, to get my wound dressed - there was no probe or instrument put into the wound then; they examined it and put a plaster over it to prevent it from bleeding; it had bled - I must have been six, seven, eight, or nine days before I was able to go about; it was probed the morning after - I was at my own house during the eight or nine days, confined to the house; it was four or five days after that before it was healed up; when it was proped it was found that the dagger had struck the sixth rib - the blow was given with considerable force.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your rib was not broken, I believe? A. It was not; the fleshy part over the sixth rib is slight, there is a very thin surface or skin over the rib.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it since this affair that you got promoted into the Lincoln militia? A. No; I have got it since, but I was recommended to it some days before this - Earl Portmore is the colonel of the militia - I don't know how many divisions of police were there that day; I cannot form any opinion at all; I was at the head of a subdivision; I don't know how many there might be in the field - I had the use of my sight till after I was wounded, and then my sight was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said you looked particularly at the prisoner, after you were wounded; how could that be, if your sight was taken away? A. That was immediately after, but I had some distance to go before I got out of the street - I turned round and saw the prisoner with another policeman.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sight was not gone then, was it? A. Why, I was not killed dead; my sight could not be gone then - I cannot tell how many policemen I saw on the ground; I saw the division I belonged to; I cannot say how many more there were; I will not swear there was not five hundred nor twelve hundred; I am not able to swear about it; I did not see them; they had all truncheons, all that I know of - I did not see the hustings or railings where the chairman was at all - there were several policeman and inhabitants about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040010"/>the prisoner at the time this took place; I cannot say how many; I dare say there were some hundreds coming into the street, and there were some hundreds near him, because they were meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the inhabitants, as you call them, that is the persons who were not of the police, doing all they could to get out of the way of the police? A. They were coming down the street from the field; I did not see any police driving them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not appear to be doing all they could to get out of the way of the police? A. I did not see it; I had not a considerable view of the ground; where I was I could only see to the end of the street and no further; I was about the centre of the street - I cannot say what the people had been doing, they came down on the division down the street; it was about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by coming down on the division? A. I should suppose to drive them out of the street; I cannot answer for our whole division having truncheons; all my subdivision had to the best of my knowledge; they were paraded before they got there, in the riding-school, and my subdivision was at the head of the whole of them; they were paraded, and I saw they had truncheons then, but some of the men might have lost their truncheons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not march to the ground with their truncheons in their right hand, leaning on their left arm? A. No, not to my knowledge; I was at the head of them, leading them, and cannot say what was going on in my rear. I did not give my division an order to draw their truncheons - I can say my subdivision did not strike nor offer to strike - after I turned about I could not see all my subdivision; I saw part of them - I cannot say whether they had their truncheons out, because I was wounded then; they might have had them out and I not see it - my subdivision consisted of between thirty and forty, to the best of my knowledge - it was upwards of forty, I will say, forty-two; I cannot swear it was not fifty; there was not sixty; I cannot say exactly the number - I know it was under fifty, by the number of files - I speak to the best of my knowledge - the people were not quiet at the time the police rushed on them; they were coming out of the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not peaceable? A. They were not, for I was stabbed; at the time the policemen went into the street they were coming from the fields - I did not consider them peaceable - I did not see any person commit a single act of violence till I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what was it induced you to say they did not appear peaceable? A. Because this man came deliberately from the side of the street into the middle and stuck me - I am speaking of what I saw, and what was done to me - the people round the prisoner were not peaceable, they were fighting with the police - when I came down they were scuffling round about where I was - I saw that, it was when I went towards the mob - directly after I was stabbed this scene commenced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear this instant, that when you came down you saw the people scuffling and fighting with the police? A. That was just at the moment that I was wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. How long the scuffling and fighting had been before you came there you can't say? A. I cannot say; at the time I went up there was no fighting with the police or the people - not till I was stabbed - I explained before that there was no struggling and fighting in Calthorpe-street till I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore that when you came down you saw the people scuffling and fighting with the police? A. That was at the time I was at the head of my subdivision, when I received the wound - directly after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to me the people were fighting and scuffling with the police when you came down? A. That was after I was wounded - there was no fighting in the street till after that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by this expression? "How long they had been fighting before I came I can't tell."? A. That was a misunderstanding of mine, because there was no fighting till I was cut - not in that street - I was not able to see into any other place - I was going away when they were scuffling and fighting with the police - I did not see the police use their truncheons; some of the men had their truncheons, but not using them - I believe an inquest was held on a man killed in this affair, but I was not there - I don't know who prosecutes this case - I am one of the witnesses - I incur no expense to my knowledge in this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know another policeman named Popay? A. No; I don't recollect a man of that name; he may go by another name - I never heard the name before to my knowledge - I don't know a name of that kind in the police - I have not seen a man here to-day of that name - I don't know whether any of the police were in plain clothes that day on the ground; they were not to my knowledge - I did not see any of the people wounded that day - I saw no women and children knocked down and bleeding in the street - I stated before the magistrate to the best of my knowledge, that when I was struck I retired two or three paces, and then looked particularly at the prisoner - I don't know whether I did say that before the magistrate - I believe I did - what I said was taken down.(POPAY was here called into Court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that man; have you ever seen him before? A. I don't recollect the man, Sir - I have never spoken to him to my knowledge; he is no acquaintance of mine - when the policeman are paraded, they are in ranks regularly like the military; but I could not see them all - I saw my own subdivision at the door - I was never away from the door of the riding-school - I was obliged to turn my back to the door to look at them - I did not notice whether the riding-school was nearly full or not - they had not their truncheons in their hands when they were paraded, they were then in their pockets - I and another serjeant, I believe his name is Macdonald, commanded the subdivision, - there was a superintendant - I commanded a subdivision, not a division; and that subdivision had their truncheons in their pockets in the riding-school - when they got out into the street, the superintendant gave the command to draw their truncheons I believe - I did not give the command - I heard the command given, but I did not see the constables have their truncheons in their hands, as I said before - the command was given loudly, so that the division could hear, and the private are regularly in the habit of obeying the command when given - I have no doubt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040011"/>their truncheons were drawn when the command was given; I did not see the American flag unfurled; the man had it in his hand - I believe there are red and white in the English union flag, but a colour of that description is generally called an American flag - I only saw white and red colours, that is generally what is used in the American shipping, the Union; it was like an American flag - is like the English flag too - I have no reason for calling it an American flag - I have no other reason than I have given; it was like an American colour or flag, and as like the English - I have no reason for calling it one more than another - it was not to prejudice the prisoner, that I called it an American colour instead of English - there was a superintendant with us in the riding-school - I did not see any other officers.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the superintendant an officer? A. He is called an officer, he commands the division.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you come from to the riding-school? A. From St. James's, Westminster, watch-house - I only saw my own superintendant and inspector there; I did not see Colonel

             there; I saw him in Gray's-inn-lane; fifty yards or less from Calthorpe-street - I did not see Lord Melbourne there - I did not see any military officers there - my weapon was a staff - I had been in the police upwards of twelve months; before that I was in the guards, about two years ago - I got my discharge from the guards; I asked for my discharge; I had completed my service - I was in no other regiment - no court-martial was held concerning me in any regiment, nor court of inquiry - I was twenty-five years and forty-one days in the guards - I was out of the guards upwards of twelve months before I went into the police - I have been in the field, and ought to know the use of arms - I did not hear any cries of"Shame, shame!" from the windows in Calthorpe-street - I saw Fursey in a stable or coach-house, after the surgeon dressed my wound - I told the magistrate I believed it was a coach-house, but I was not certain; I was not well enough to take notice - I did not hear anybody say in the stable that was the man, because he carried the death and liberty flag - there might be upwards of fifty or sixty persons in the stable or coach-house, or more; they were not all policemen - there was no wounded men there that I know of; I was there myself - when I went to the door, the man came to the door; I did not go up into the coach-house - the prisoner came from behind the men; they called his name; as soon as I saw the man, I identified him as being the man who stabbed me in the street; he was sent forward, I believe, from the men; I then identified him; that was about two hours, or upwards, after I lost my sight from the wound - there was nothing to prevent my going in; and being desired to point out the man, instead of his being sent forwards - I saw no wounded men in that place to my recollection - Fursey himself was bleeding at the side of the face, but I did not see any wound; I did not see him wounded nor yet struck; I did not notice his head; I believe he had a hat on when I first saw him in the stables; yes, he had a hat on at the time I was there - I did not see his head bandaged - there was blood on his cheek, but I did not see any wound; it was only for a moment or two that I saw him - I did not form any notion how the blood came on his face, I was too ill to take notice - I was stabbed about one hundred or two hundred yards from the doctor's, more or less - I walked that distance with another serjeant - I did not notice that Fursey had the appearance of a man violently ill used; he had blood on his cheek.</p>

               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. You were above twenty-five years in the guards, in which regiment? A. The 1st Grenadier guards - I entered the regiment at eighteen years of age; I served at Waterloo - I could not discover how the stripes were distributed in the flag; he had it folded in his hand - I think I should know the flag again if I saw it - I came to the stables about two hours after I was wounded - the prisoner came from others towards me - I did not know his name till his name was called, and directly the man came towards me - I identified him as being the man who stuck me - I have not a doubt whatever that the person I saw there, and who is now at the bar, was the person who gave me the wound.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. How long was it after you received the wound before you lost your sight? A. It was a minute or two afterwards - directly after I received the wound I lost my sight - after being wounded I went round to the doctor's to get my wound dressed - I was some considerable time in the doctor's shop, then went into a yard and sat down - I was upwards of two hours before I was taken home - I had recovered my sight before I got to the stable-yard; I might be about a quarter of an hour getting from the crowd to the surgeons - I was with the sergeant who conducted me there- I was not able to go by myself.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How near was Redwood to you when you was struck? A. He was just on my left, about a pace or two - he had said or done nothing to my knowledge before I was struck; I did not see anything of the kind - the instrument was in the prisoner's right hand - he was carrying it down by his side, hanging his arm down with it in his hand - I did not observe anything in his hand till he raised his arm against me; I did not observe anybody trying to take the flag before I was struck - I did not try myself nor demand it.</p>

             No. 167, both of the C division, and they took him away; I told them at the time that the man had stabbed me - the wound was a three-edged wound, commonly called a triangular wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you acquainted at all with St. Albans? A. I am; Rickmansworth is my native place - I have been to St. Albans, but never lived there - I was never there on any charge that I am aware of - I was indicted once for an assault - I now recollect myself.</p>
               <p>Q. All of a sudden? A. All of a sudden; that was the only charge against me - I know the Giltspur-street Compter - I was there once but it was wrongfully - I don't consider that a charge; I consider it a charge when a man is in confinement - I was not in confinement there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there? A. I had some property of my own, and another man wanted it, and I would not let him have it - I was not in confinement in Giltspur-street - I was taken there and liberated immediately, without going before anybody except those at the watch-house - I don't know whether it was Giltspur-street Compter or the watch-house that I was taken to - I am not much acquainted with London; I have been in the police two years last April - this was before the police came on, it was the large stone building I was taken to - I have never been there since - it is on the right hand as you go across from here; I don't know who let me out - the man who wanted my property and I went up to the Compter together - he wanted to charge me with felony, but he could not - I was not charged with it - the man's name was Booth - I cannot exactly say what property it was now; a watch and a gown was two things among it - I cannot recollect any more - there was a few more - I don't recollect what they were - I knew they were mine, because I bought them and paid for them, and that is a good reason; the watch was made by Mr. Atwell, of Uxbridge, and that is where I purchased it - it was a metal watch, a woman's watch - I bought it of him in 1824 - I cannot say whether Mr. Atwell is alive now; I cannot say whether it was in my fob or in a bundle at the time - I had a bundle I know - I had a bundle in my hand - the gown was in my handkerchief, which I had in my hand; I was not in the habit of carrying watches about in bundles - I cannot say whether the watch was in the bundle or in my fob on the occasion - I was not charged with stealing that bundle - the charge was not taken - the man accused me of it; there are so many linen-drapers in London, it is impossible to say where the gown was bought; the piece was bought; it was made up into a gown afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was this transaction? A. I cannot say whether it was in 1826 or 1827.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the bundle opened? A. The bundle was opened in the compter in my presence - I cannot say who opened it, whether I opened it myself or anybody else - I cannot say whether I had the watch in my fob or in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Or whether you had another watch in your fob? A. That I don't recollect - I bought it at Atwell's in my own name; I gave five guineas for it - the watch produced at the compter was metal, having the name of Atwell, Uxbridge, on it - it was my wife's watch; my own watch at that time was in pledge - I was then living in Little Charlotte-street; I mean at the time I was charged, not when I bought the watch - I had left London - I was living at Rickmansworth, down at my sister's at the time; I was out of employ at the time - I had been living with my sister about a week or so before that; my wife was living in London in Little Charlotte-street - the charge was made in the middle of the day; I have seen the man since - I have got some more property from him which he had belonging to me in his possession - I met him accidentally in the street one day, and got his address from him; he had lived in the same house as we did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business had he with your wife's gown and watch? A. That has nothing at all to do with this trial - he had got the property away from my wife; she told me so herself - I do not charge him with stealing it; it is impossible for me to say how he got it from her - I consider it an unfair question when it relates to a man's wife; I don't think it relates to this - I got the property lawfully by going into my wife's apartments, where she lived at the time - Booth was living in the same house as we were - I came up to London from Rickmansworth to fetch my wife down, and also the things which she had; and that is the plain truth of the matter and all the account I will give you of it - since I have been in the police, there has been no charge of intemperate conduct against me, nor has there been any report against me of any description - I never answered to any charge, and if there had been one I should have answered it - I never acted intemperately in the street; I was put on what is called house-duty - I was a turnkey in St. James's watch-house; that was not in consequence of any intemperate conduct out of doors - there was no complaint of my having misconducted myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I think you said, as you advanced, down Grays-inn-lane, and turned into Calthorpe-street, you saw the prisoner with the flag? A. I did; that is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040013"/>way he held the flag (here the Counsel held it up) - it was not furled round, but hung so that the blues and stars and all were plain to be seen - Brooke was in advance of our division, and nearer to the man who carried the flag; (here the witness described the position in which the flag was held) - he held the flag so that the whole was plainly to be seen; the star and blue and all were sufficiently seen for any one to understand what the colours were - I was not in Court when Brooke was examined; I was of the same sub-division as Brooke - as near as I can guess our sub-division consisted of from twenty-two to twenty-six; there were not so many as thirty, I am certain - in the whole there was more than forty - I don't remember their being paraded in the riding-school.</p>

               <p>COURT. A. Do you mean the whole sub-division under Brooke's command amounted to twenty-six? A. Yes, not more; they were divided into sections - two sections formed a subdivision.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the subdivision to which you were attached, or the section of it, paraded in the riding-house? A. There was no parading, we were all in there - it was Dawson's riding-house; I suppose there were from three hundred to four hundred there of different divisions - we were not paraded nor examined by any officer in the riding-school - we were not paraded to ascertain whether we had our staves, but we were all called on and formed into a line to go into Calthorpe-street; their staves were not in their hands in the riding-house - we have a piece of string or whip-cord affixed to our truncheons to hold them, so that we should not lose them - we were the first subdivision that came out of Dawson's stables, and we were the first subdivision that advanced into Calthorpe-street from Gray's-inn-lane - I know nothing about any other divisions being stationed at different parts to command the other end of the street; there was no other division in Calthorpe-street that I know of, except those who came from Dawson's riding-house, when we left the riding house, as we passed, the gate Superintendent Baker gave the order to draw our staves - Brooke was then in front of us; he had his staff in his hand - whether he drew it then or had it drawn before, I cannot say; the furthest distance he was away from us was about three paces - I saw none of the populace till I got into Calthorpe-street - some were standing at the corner of Calthorpe-street, and the people came rushing down - there were people at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any people in Gray's-inn-lane? A. At the time we went there, there were a few at the corner of Calthorpe-street and Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How many? A. There might be forty standing on the pavement - they did not interfere with us - not in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men, when told to draw their staves, spit in their hands and say, Now for it? A. No, they did not - there was no one in my presence said so; I did not, on my oath, see anybody spit in their hands, in order to grasp their staves the stronger - I am positive I did not do so myself - when we got to Calthorpe-street - I could see right down Calthorpe-street into the fields; the open ground is immediately at the bottom of Calthorpe-street, and is terminated by the prison wall - I could not see the end of the prison wall - I could see the prison wall - I could see the paling at times, and at times I could not; as we advanced down Calthorpe-street we were about twelve or thirteen abreast, and we were in the middle of the road - I heard hooting, and shouting, and brickbats were flying - I saw some bricks and stones; I suppose there might be about a dozen flying - I don't know whether there was six of each; if I had known you had requested it I would have counted them for you - there were no cries that I heard further than the shouting of the mob, as we went down Calthorpe-street - the mob came down from the fields, down Calthorpe-street, towards Gray's-inn-lane - about two hundred came down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come pretty fast? A. Those that came on the pavement did, they came out of the fields as fast as they could come - I don't know whether that was the place where the meeting was to be held, because I was not on the ground - the meeting was dispersed at that time, when the people came down Calthorpe-street, towards Gray's-inn-lane they were pursued by no police that I know of, they were not by ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see one body of the police coming from the fields, driving them in that way, and you stood thirteen abreast, so that they could not come your way? A. I did not see them, nor was I aware of any police being at the other end - I was in Calthorpe-street from five to six minutes - the people separated themselves on seeing us, and got out of the way - it was our business to advance up and disperse them, and also to keep the people quiet; of course it was our business to keep in our ranks till we received orders to the contrary, unless we saw a breach of the peace - Fursey was waving the flag, and heading the others; he had the flag in his hand; he passed Brooke first; he was nearest to Brooke when I rushed forwards to seize him.</p>
               <p>Q. Must Brooke have seen him wave the flag? A. I know nothing about that - he was waving the flag and urging the people to come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, "Come on my boys?" A. I don't say that - I could hear him shouting something - I was examined before the Coroner - I am positive I told the Coroner that I heard Brooke cry out "Oh!" - that was after I left the rank; I had not advanced above one step when I heard it - I did not receive any order to advance - I was in the front line.</p>
               <p>Q. When before the Coroner, did you tell him the man Fursey raised his arm as if to strike, and then you hit him somewhere on the head with your staff? A. No, I did not; I have told you so now - I did not strike him till he struck me with the dagger or instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Why omit to state that before the Coroner? A. I cannot say any thing about that - it has not come into my memory on a sudden; I was sworn to state the statement before the Coroner, and did so - I was sworn to tell all I knew, and I told all I knew before the Coroner, except striking him - on my oath, I did not purposely conceal that from the Coroner; if I intended to conceal it I should conceal it now - I did not state it there, nor at Bow-street, because I thought there was sufficient evidence without that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did recollect it? A. I knew of it, certainly - it I had not omitted it, I should have said it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040014"/>I omitted it because I thought there was sufficient evidence without, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q. If you thought there was sufficient evidence without when before the Coroner, and at Bow-street, why did you not omit it to-day, if there was sufficient evidence without? A. Because I am bound to speak the whole of the statement, and that was not required of me there- it was not asked me - I was sworn, but I was not asked, whether I struck him or not. - I was sworn to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. And is it not part of the truth, that you struck the man? A. After he stabbed me - I state it now because I am to state here the whole particulars - I have not stated the whole particulars before - I did not suppress it to prevent any body from knowing that I had used violence - it was before I got to the man with the colour that Brooke cried "Oh;" and I was one step in advance of the rank when I heard it - I saw the flag, and my intent was to take the flag from the prisoner - I did not see any persons in Calthorpe-street lying on the ground wounded - I was advancing up the street; my intention was to take the prisoner into custody; I was not to see who was lying down in the street, or who was standing up; I heard no cries for assistance - I heard shouting - the prisoner came from the right hand corner of Calthorpe-street, to about the middle of the street; he was not alone, there were several with him, he was at the head of them; there were two hundred or three hundred, some in the middle of the street, and some on the pavement - those who came down the street escaped, and the ringleaders are what we apprehended - after the prisoner was apprehended, I told the superintendant I was wounded; he told me to go and get the wound dressed - I was told the prisoner was taken to Dawson's stables; and I went there, but found nobody except the woman who lives there - I went from there down to Burbridge's stables, where the prisoner was - he was in the coach-house at the time I went in - I went to that coach-house two or three times, I cannot say it was not six times, it could not exceed half-a-dozen - there were other persons there besides the prisoner, from fourteen to eighteen - the first time I went in I recognised the prisoner from the rest, and afterwards came out and gave his name - the superintendent requested me to search him, which I was unable to do; I cannot say who it was I gave his name to; it was to one of the officers of the A division; I don't know whether he is here - I do not know a man named Popay; I don't know such a person in the police; there are many I don't know - I can't say whether I saw a man there in plain clothes and white hat, there might have been many, I did not see one - I am not aware that any of the division or subdivision to which I belong are members of the Trades' Union, nor any of the police that I am aware of - I do not know of any of them being directed to enrol themselves members of the Trades' Union, nor of any other Union - I know nothing of Popay; I believe there were some of the police on the ground in plain clothes that day, I know there were some - I know they were sent there in their plain clothes, but I cannot say whether by the superintendent or by the commissioners - I did not hear them ordered to go.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know they were sent there? A. Because I saw them there, and know they were there - I only know I saw them there - on meetings of any description there are persons sent in plain clothes - I saw them there, and they came into the yard, after the meeting was over - I was not at the meeting myself; how is it possible to distinguish them among a mob - I saw them come into the yard where we were, and I saw one in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn you saw several of them at the meeting? A. At the meeting, and attending the meeting, are two different things; I said I could see the prison wall before me - I saw one of the police in plain clothes in Calthorpe-street; I saw him by coming up and speaking to us - I did not see him till then, that was just as I took hold of the prisoner; it is impossible for me to say his name - I know he was a policeman, because he told me so, and he had a staff in his hand - some of my own division were there in plain clothes, Farrant and Hobbs, Stone and Harwood - I know no more, they are all that I saw that belonged to our division; none of them are here to-day that I know of- I cannot say where they were, they were there; I saw them in Burbridge's yard - I believe the back of the yard is at the back of the field where the meeting was; it is not open to the field - of course they had all got staves, every one goes out with his staff; no constable goes out without his authority, whether he has regimentals or not - we none of us carried arms that day, except staves; I saw none at all - I saw a pistol which was found in the stable afterwards - I did not see Mr. Thomas, the superintendent with any arms - every superintendent had the command of his own division and Colonel Rowan, I believe, commanded all the divisions - there was no general-officer or soldier there, that I know of - I saw no orderly men there to ride from the spot to the Horse-guards; I did not see Colonel de Roos at the inquest that I know of - I don't know him; none of our division as we advanced, either by accident or otherwise, hurt any body, or broke any body's head that I saw - I did not see any of the subdivision break any body's head - I heard no cries; nothing but the shouts - I have said my object was to take the prisoner - if I had paid attention I might have heard cries, but my object was to take the prisoner; I cannot say whether there were any cries of wounded persons - Compton and Holland are both here; they are both policemen, and were in uniform, the same as me - nobody was sent out to command the police who where in plain clothes that I know of; they had the same means to act improperly as anybody else - I did not state at Bow-street, that a man named Coltman, a baker, was heading the mob in Calthorpe-street, nor anywhere else.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. If I understand you correctly, your division was divided into two sections; does the number twenty-six apply to your division alone, or each section? A. There were twenty-six in the two sections together; I think fourteen in one, and twelve in another - I did not see Brooke use any act of violence before I heard him cry Oh! nor raise his staff.</p>

            . I belong to the C division. On the 13th of May, I was in Calthorpe-street; I was close to Redwood when he was stabbed; I did not see him stabbed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040015"/>- he said he was stabbed - he had hold of the prisoner - he called to somebody to take hold of the prisoner, and I and another constable, named Holland, took him, and took him to the White Horse livery stables, Gray's-inn-road,(Mr. Burbridge's).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there another policeman with you? A. Yes; a man named Holland - we both went together - there was a scuffle between the prisoner and Redwood; that was the only scuffle; the prisoner went very quietly with us - I can't say what scuffling there might have been when I was away; there was scuffling when I was there, between Redwood and the prisoner, and between several in different parts of the street; there was a disturbance - I cannot swear whether the people were fighting with each other, or with the police - of course it was between the police and the people - I did not rightly understand you when I said I could not say whether the police were scuffling with the people, or the people with each other; I did not rightly understand the question - I certainly understand you - I certainly did say so, but it was in the flurry of the moment - the scuffling was between the people and the police, the police were trying to disperse them - the police were trying to disperse the people, by telling them to go away - I mean to swear that; I cannot answer for what they might do in another part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that nothing passed but the police telling them to go away? A. Certainly there were blows struck on both sides; I mean to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. What weapons had the people that you saw them strike with? A. Why, there were stones thrown, and there was a short stick, about five or six inches long, loaded with lead, and they hit one man on the chin with it - I had the stick in my hand after the prisoner was taken to the stable - it was taken from some prisoner - I did not see it taken from a prisoner - I saw one man strike with it after I left the prisoner in the stables - I saw scuffling between the people and the police before I took the prisoner to the stables - I don't say I saw the blow given with the stick then - before I went to the stables I saw scuffling between the people and police - I saw the people with sticks, and there was some long staves, about four or five, or three or four - I did not see the police striking right and left - I saw them striking the people with their staves - I cannot form any idea how many were in action at that time - I belong to the same division as Redwood and Brooke - I took Fursey when the scuffling was ensuing - the scuffling was going on at the time I took him to the stables.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Redwood said he was stabbed - was the scuffling going on? A. Yes; the prisoner and Redwood were wrestling together.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you heard Redwood say he was stabbed was the scuffling going on with sticks and truncheons? A. The constables were dispersing the mob, of course, with their staves - I staid in the stables with the prisoner about a minute and a half, or two minutes - I did not search him at that time to see if he had any weapon nor did my companion - there was nothing to prevent our doing so.</p>
               <p>Q. As you had a colleague with you, and heard Redwood say he was stabbed, why not search the man, to find if there was a weapon about him? - you seem a sharp man, why not give an answer? A. I can't tell the reason - I must have forgotten it; I was as much in my senses then as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to give a flourish with your truncheon as you were going away? A. No; I had it out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the prisoner when you were taking him to the stables? A. He had received a blow; on which side of his head I can't tell, but the blood was running down his forehead - there was one prisoner in the stables when I took Fursey there, and some police constables; about three or four - we left them behind us; some of them are here to-day - there was nothing to prevent them from searching Fursey if they chose - I belong to the same division as Brooke; I went out with the division; I can't say how many Brooke commanded, I was not under his command, I was under Serjeant Ellerby - I heard no cries when the blows were given between the people and police - there was hallooing; I did not hear any screaming, as if the people were hurt - there was shouting - I cannot say I police halloo.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was from the people, and not from the police, that the hallooing came. A. There might have been some of the police hallooing - some of the police were in plain clothes that day - I don't know Popay - I believe there was one or two of my division in plain clothes - I can't tell who they were - there was not above, (I believe,) two of my division in plain clothes - they had their truncheons about them; I did not see them, but they mostly have orders to carry them with them - I saw them when we were in the livery stable-yard - it was not when I took the prisoner, it was afterwards that I saw them - it was a stable we took the prisoner to; I left him, but he was removed from that to a coach-house; I saw him afterwards in the coach-house - I don't know whether the other person in the stable was wounded; he was not moaning as if wounded; he was standing up - I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard Popay's name, I suppose? A. I have heard his name outside to-day, and that is all I have heard of him - I was not at the inquest - our division was not paraded, it was drawn up in a line - we were ordered to draw our truncheons when we came out; I can't say who gave the order; it was as we were in the road - I don't believe there was above one hundred of our division.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there was not upwards of fifteen hundred policemen assembled altogether all round the place? A. I was in Calthorpe-street; it was impossible for me to see what was in Bagnigge-wells-road, and other places; there might be two hundred in Burbridge's stables after the meeting was over; there were about three hundred, I suppose, in the riding-house before we started - it was in Gray's-inn-lane we were ordered to draw our truncheons, and they drew them as they were desired - none of us had been struck at that time, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You carried your truncheons in your right hand resting on your left arms? A. I don't know, I carried mine in my right hand (holding it straight up).</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you see wounded in Calthorpe-street, before you took the prisoner you saw blows struck on both sides? A. I never heard of one person being wounded till after I returned from taking the prisoner to the stables, and then I heard of Serjeant Brooke being wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040016"/>Q. About how many persons did you see wounded when you were passing on to the stables? A. The prisoner was the only one I saw with a cut over his head; I did not see any wounded, nor crying out from their wounds; I did not hear of anybody else but Serjeant Brooke being wounded.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the people's heads being broken? A. I did not see any, I heard there was such things; I did not see any men and women struck; I must have seen a thing of that sort if it had been in Calthorpe-street where I was, when I was there - I left Calthorpe-street about half-past four or four o'clock, after it was over - I was in Calthorpe-street a little after three o'clock, after returning from the stable - I did not see any one wounded from that time till half-past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said, if any one had been wounded while you were there, you must have seen it; do you mean to represent that, from half-past three to half-past four o'clock? A. I do.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. How long had you been in Calthorpe-street before you took the prisoner? A. I took him a little after three o'clock, we had been there two or three minutes, hardly three minutes - after taking him in custody, I took him down to Burbridge's stables; I took him there at once, and after that returned - I was at the stables about two minutes, and I remained about an hour after I came back from the stables.</p>

I am a policeman belonging to the C division - I was on duty in Calthorpe-street on the 13th of May - I was close against Redwood when he had the prisoner - I saw him with the prisoner, and heard him say he was stabbed - Redwood had hold of him himself, and he told me to hold him fast, for he said He has stabbed me in the arm - I laid hold of him - Compton came up at the same time - I took him into the stables in White Horse-yard, Gray's-inn-road, with Compton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe it never occurred to you to search him till after you had left him there some time? A. It did not, Redwood had told me he was stabbed; I saw no weapon about him; the weapon might have been in his pocket for aught I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take the trouble to see? A. No; I might have done so if I liked, but thinking Redwood was following down, I did not know whether Redwood would search him or not - there was one person as a prisoner in the stables where we put him; I don't know his name; he was there before I put Fursey there, and a police-constable was there keeping the door; we took him into the further part of the stable; nobody else was in the place; I placed him in the stable myself, in the lower part of the stable - there could not be three or four persons there without my seeing them - there was not three or four police-constables in the stable; there was one police-constable there and nobody else; there could not have been three or four police-constables inside - I have not heard Compton examined; I was under Sergeant Harris; I got to the riding house at one o'clock, or half-past one - I was not examined there to see if I had all my accoutrements about me - I went there from Marlborough-street; I was at Dawson's; I should think there were about two-hundred there; I heard of only two meeting places for the police-constables - fifteen or sixteen hundred policemen could not have been put in two places; I don't know how many men were out that day, our division produced their staves about three o'clock, when we were called out of the riding-house - when we were called out and came into Gray's-inn-lane I did not see any disturbance any where; there were a great many persons in Gray's-inn-road; they were quite harmless and peaceable for what I saw; we were there to disperse them if there was a row.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the people peaceable after you produced your staves? A. I saw nothing to the contrary; as we went along they certainly never interfered - I had my truncheon in my hand; I did not see Brooke; he was in advance of me; I was in the rear - I cannot say how many divisions had advanced before our column came up; the C division was the first that came out, and they were divided into five subdivisions, I believe - I don't know exactly; I cannot say how many each subdivision contained; there might be six subdivisions; I cannot say - the divisions are marked by letters A, B, and C, &amp;c. I don't know how many letters there were in the riding-house - there is a string round our truncheons; I don't know whether our truncheons are made of box-wood; they are no doubt capable of breaking a man's head - the people did not offer the slightest molestation as we passed down Gray's-inn-lane, not till we got into Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called out, do you know, because a row had began or because one was expected? A. I cannot say; we were called on to quell a row; I imagine that one had commenced - as I went into Calthorpe-street I saw no broken heads, nor heard any cries; I saw no fight; I saw a great number of people - I saw no stones or brickbats flying; we followed at the same time as Brooke - I was looking about to see if there was any mischief. I did not hear of our division breaking anybody's heads - I heard of one of the C division being struck in the eye with a stone; I saw none of the people injured; I saw no fighting in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps none had commenced when you came up? A. I did not see any; I heard no shouts of murder, nor saw sticks, staves, or bricks flying, nor any sound of sticks and staves going against each other; nor any appearance of fighting at all - we were not molested by anybody from first to last; there was more of the mob than police in Calthorpe-street; they did not offer us any harm; I did not see them offer the slightest molestation to anybody, except in words - the words came from the mob.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, because they were in plain clothes? A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. But some of the police were in plain clothes; they could kick up a row as well as anybody else; how do you know that part of the mob were not policemen in plain clothes? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the great body of the people did not divide themselves in Calthorpe-street, on each side of the way to let you pass, in order to get rid of you? A. Yes, they did; I did not hear a cry of "The police are coming, make way."</p>
               <p>Q. Am I right in supposing you have said, you saw them immediately at your approach divide themselves on each side of the way, while you filled up the high road, and passed along? A. Yes; I did not see or hear of any riot or disturbance in Calthorpe-street - I found no disturbance<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040017"/>except the prisoner; I saw no likelihood of any disturbance except that.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to Compton? A. I was the first that took hold of the prisoner; Compton was close by me; he remained close by me, while I walked up; he had the same opportunity of observing what passed as I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think brick-bats and stones could be flying and he see it, and you not? A. I saw none; I don't know the house of Mr. Stallwood; I know the northern house at the corner of Calthorpe-street, on the left hand side nearest to the field - the hustings or railing where one of the persons had spoken were down at the bottom part of the field - I should think nobody could have a better view of the field than a person from the balcony of that house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not the space resound with cries of shame, shame, while the police were knocking people down with their staves? A. There was that cry in the top part of the field, at a little after three o'clock; that was as soon as we got there - I believe that was after I had taken the prisoner; I cannot swear whether it was when I first went up into the street, or after I had taken Fursey to the stables, that I heard the cries of shame, shame; I really cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you believe you heard those cries as soon as you got into Calthorpe-street from Gray's-inn-lane? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath were not the police at that end of the field knocking them down right and left? A. I was not at that end of the field till after the mob were dispersed - I saw no wounded people then; I saw nobody knocked down - I heard the cries of shame; I saw no fighting; I had no notion what the people were crying shame at.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go to see? A. I kept along with my division; I afterwards went to the coach-house, where the prisoners who were taken were put, and saw through the door sixteen or seventeen - the doors were shut at the time; I had no opportunity of seeing them except through the door.</p>
               <p>Q. To the best of your recollection had not every one of them his head broken? A. I should think not - I don't know that any man's head was bleeding except the prisoner's; I could not see them to distinguish them perfectly - the door was shut, and I looked through the keyhole - I did not count them; I went out of curiosity; that was about four o'clock or afterwards, after it was all over - If a woman had been knocked down with a staff, and her head broken, while I was in Calthorpe-street, I might not have seen it - our directions were to disperse the people away as quietly as we possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not to strike unless resistance was offered you? A. No; I saw nobody attacked - I don't know Popay; I never saw him to know him - I don't know how many policemen were in plain clothes there; I know of none except Harris, I believe of the K division; I am not certain of his name; he is a witness for the prosecution - I saw him in the White-horse-yard, nowhere else - I did not see him in the field, nor in Calthorpe-street; I don't know how he came there in plain clothes - I don't know of any policemen being members of any unions of trades; none of our division or subdivision are so I believe - I know Sergeant Dean, he is in the corps now - I don't know a man of that name who is not now in the corps.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Before you heard Redwood say he was stabbed did you see any blows struck by the police? A. I did not.</p>

            . On the 13th of May I was a police constable - I was stationed in Mr. Burbridge's livery stables, Gray's-inn-lane - I remained there when the other officers left the stables; I recollect the prisoner being brought to the stables; I cannot exactly say who brought him, but it was by two police-constables in uniform - two others were brought about the same time, named Tilley; they were in the yard all at one time, brought out of Gray's-inn-lane - I had been in the stable; and taken a truss of straw into one of the stalls for the purpose of sitting down on; I sat down on it; I was not sitting on it when the prisoner and Tilleys were brought in - I was standing at the door then; I had been sitting on it before that; I got up, it might be about ten minutes before that; when Fursey and Tilleys were brought to the stables they went to the further stall, to which I had taken the truss of straw, and on which I had been sitting - they sat themselves down on the litter, and leaned back against the truss of straw, which was near the manger - they remained in that stall about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; they were then taken out and put into a coach-house - about ten minutes after the prisoners were taken out I observed part of a book in the stall, which seemed to me to be a penny publication, it was laying on the litter - I went into the stall and turned the truss of straw over; I pulled it over towards me, and there I found a dagger, and pistol, and powder flask - I had not seen them there when I placed the straw there; it was light enough for me to have seen them if they had been there; I think it is impossible they could have been there without my observing them - there had not been any one in the stall from the time I put the straw down till I found the dagger, and pistol, and flask, except Fursey and the two Tilleys - not to go to the manger - I have the dagger (producing it).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would it not be rather difficult for a man who was seized to secrete that so long without being observed, he being taken in the act of stabbing - don't it strike you as difficult for a man to conceal it in his pocket at a moment - do you think you could do it? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not search the prisoner when he was brought in? A. I had nothing to do with him, except to take charge of him - there was nothing to my knowledge, to prevent the policemen who brought him in from searching him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anybody in there before the prisoner was brought in? A. Yes it is my firm belief there was a person sitting in a chair - it was not my duty to keep the door - there was a police-constable in uniform there besides me - I was not in uniform - I don't know that the police-constable is here who was to keep the door; I saw him there; I don't think I should know him if I saw him - I am not able to say his letter and number - I was just inside the door when the prisoner was brought in - to the best of my belief there was a person sitting on a chair there - it was light in the stable - the chair was under the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040018"/>Q. Was there a person in it or not? A. I believe there was; to the best of my belief there was one; I have not a doubt of it - I was not aware that he was a prisoner; to the best of my belief there was one in the chair, but I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a person seated on the chair? A. There was such a bustle, just at the time, it is impossible to say - I saw the chair, there was nobody in it when I looked particularly at it the last time - there was no person sitting in it the first time I looked; there was a police-constable sitting in it afterwards - it was before the riot or row began that I saw the policeman sitting in it - he went out, all of them went out after the riot began - I cannot say whether any body sat in the chair after that; it was a man who was sitting in the chair - I cannot swear positively that there was a prisoner brought in before Fursey - if anybody was in the chair it must have been a man - I will not swear positively that anybody was in the chair - I brought the straw close from the side of the chair - it is about half a dozen yards from the chair to the stall.</p>

               <p>Q. If it was so light that you could have discovered a dagger if it had been there could you help seeing a man, if he had been there? A. If I had thought to have looked if there was a man undoubtedly I could have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it a thought to look for a dagger, when you put the straw down? A. No; it was impossible for it to be there, with the powder flask and pistol, without my seeing it - a man might have been there without my taking particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say whether the chair was empty or not? A. I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say you took the straw up from close by the side of the chair? A. That was an hour before the prisoner was brought in - a police-constable was sitting there then - they all went out, leaving me and another in the stable - I had orders not to leave the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the situation of the chair an hour before? A. Several police-constables were sitting in it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not they leave it, and leave you behind? A. When the row began; they did not leave me alone in the stable, because I walked out to the door at the same time as they did - I went back again certainly, I never left the stable door - it was when I went in the first time, at one o'clock, that I took the truss of straw - there was people in when I first went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a prisoner there, on your oath? A. If I was certain there was I would say, Yes; but I am not certain - I did not take notice till Fursey was brought in; I found when Fursey was brought in that there was one there, because I heard what was said - two police constables brought in Fursey, and two others were brought in at the same time - and there was five or six very shortly after - I cannot say whether there was a prisoner there before Fursey and the Tilleys were brought in, to the best of my belief there was - I don't know whether the man who minded the door is here - the door was not closed; it was not guarded particularly; we just stood at the door to see that they did not go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he stationed there to see that nobody went in or out without his knowledge? A. I am not able to say - I found this sheath that I have on the dagger, it was in the sheath when I found it; he must either have sheathed it in the stable, or before he came there - I believe the prisoner was searched at last, I was not present - it was loose straw for horses to lay on, that I put the truss on - the dagger is in the same state as I found it, except that I put a mark upon it; it was as bright as it is now when I found it - I was not in Calthorpe-street; I was not there as a looker-on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go in disguise, and not in uniform? A. I was there to go for my own division, in case they were wanted - my superior ordered me to go in plain clothes, his name is Murray - I had my trucheon with me - I saw other officers there in plain clothes, it is impossible for me te say how many - twenty, or there might be more or less, I cannot say; there was several standing about in different places - I did not go out of the yard till after it was over? six or seven persons were brought into the stables afterwards; I did not see any one wounded but Fursey, nor any marks of wounds - Fursey had a handkerchief bound round his head, he had a hat on - I could see the handkerchief not with standing the hat - I don't know the name of the person who searched Fursey - no reason was given to me for my going in plain clothes - there was a numerous body of policemen about the place; some hundreds - my truncheon was to defend myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You took it suspecting that being in coloured clothes you might be attacked? A. Yes; very likely - and if I saw a necessity, to help my brother constables - I did not use it that day; I saw no necessity - I was at the inquest; I did not see Popay among the persons in coloured clothes- I did not know him; I have seen him here to-day; I cannot say that I ever saw him before - I never saw him dressed as a policeman to my knowledge - P is Popay's letter, I don't know his number.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know his letter if you don't know him to be in the police? A. I know he is in the police - I have never seen him in the police, but I have seen an account of him in the papers, and heard of him - I spoke to him to-day; I asked him if he was still in the police, and he said Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. How long, according to your best recollection, do you think Fursey was in the stall? A. From ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, to the best of my recollection - Tilleys and he went into the stall together - nobody had been into the stall to sit down in the stall after I put the truss down - from the time Fursey and the Tilleys were removed, until I went and found the dagger, pistol, and powder-flask, nobody had been in the tall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long passed from the time you went out of the stall till the prisoner and the Tilleys were brought there? A. Not above ten minutes altogether; it might have been an hour after I had brought the straw in there, because I sat down some time myself.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROOKE re-examined. Q. You observed in the hand of Fursey a dagger with a brass handle, look at that? A. It was a dagger something like this; I cannot swear to this being the one, it was one similar to that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of a coat had Fursey on? A. A different one to what he has now; it was a ragged coat - it was a ragged sort of coat to the best of my knowledge - it was a coat of the same make as he has on now - I don't know whether the person is here who searched Fursey.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040019"/>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Do you know of his having been searched? A. I do not - the dress that Fursey has on now is not the dress he wore then - the prisoner at the bar struck me with a dagger similar to that which is now lying on the table.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe at that time the prisoner's head or face, to see whether there was any mark of blood on him? A. At the time I was struck I saw no blood on any man - his head was not bloody at that time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Since you were last examined, have you come to your recollection what were the other things in the bundle which the man wanted to get from you? A. I have not troubled myself to recollect.</p>

             on the 13th of May, about eleven o'clock at night; it was over the sixth rib, on the left-side - it was inflicted by a pointed instrument a little triangular - I probed it; the point of the probe stuck in the rib; proving that the blow must have been given with some violence - in all probability, if the instrument had not been met by the rib, it would have passed through the heart - such an instrument as this would produce the wound - I examined Redwood on the following morning, the 14th, he had a wound in the left arm; a triangular wound about four inches in depth - that was precisely such a wound as would be inflicted by such an instrument.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you a surgeon to the Metropolitan Police force? A. I am the superintendent surgeon.</p>

            . I am a gentleman living on my fortune, my residence is No. 13, Calthorpe-street. I remember the 13th of May, the day the meeting was intended to be held in Spa-fields; my house is the corner house, the north-east corner of the street - it commands a view of the field in which the meeting was to be held; of Calthorpe-street, of the Union public-house, and all the avenues leading to it - on that day I took my station at the balcony of my house rather before three, say half-past two; I observed the police make their first appearance - there was no disturbance whatever up to that time, nor any disposition to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you observe the first appearance of the police, in what position? A. They came up in a body up Calthorpe-street, the first division; occupying the whole of the carriage and footways; they came from Gray's-inn-lane - I had let some stables to a Mr. Burbridge; he calls them the White Horse livery stables - I observed some of the police come out of those stables; they went out of the eastern gate into Gough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is a considerable portion of Spa-fields bounded on the eastern side, by the prison-wall? A. It is not Spafields, it is the Calthorpe estate; the east side is bounded by the prison-wall; Gough-street, and Calthorpe-street, are two avenues leading to the west from the Calthorpe estate; outlets through which a multitude might go through westward - the first body of police that came into Calthorpe-street, halted directly opposite my house - I observed a chairman and railings in the meeting; they halted within about sixty feet of where the chairman was - the body who proceeded into Gough-street, halted at the corner of Collingridge's-buildings, which was about forty-five feet off the chairman - when these two bodies had both halted, the body in Gough-street were ordered to draw their staves out of their pockets; the other body drew their staves at the same time, they observing that all the avenues were first stopped up by bodies of the police - I should conceive the police force in my view, consisted of seven or eight hundred - it was a few minutes after three when the bodies were all formed - when the staves of both bodies were drawn, the order was given to the Gough-street body to charge - I distinctly heard the word Charge - up to the time that I heard the word Charge, everything was peaceable on the part of the people - on that order being given, the police bodies charged immediately, making for the chairman, knocking down everybody indiscriminately that they met with.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What, the Gough-street body? A. The two bodies - one coming one way and another the other.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now, Mr. Stallwood, your being in that commanding situation, was there, up to that moment, either order to disperse, or Riot Act or Proclamation read? A. None whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of the charge that the two bodies made? A. The ground was strewed immediately with bodies of every description, men, women, and children - I saw that, and after it had continued some time, my blood boiled in my veins, and I addressed the police force.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What division was it you addressed? A. I addressed them both; it was the last division - I addressed the C division, with Mr. Thomas at their head - that was the division that came up Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long before that had you been in your balcony? A. Half an hour or more, and during that time there was no disturbance whatever, or breach of the peace, till the police came into Calthorpe-street - I stated to the C division, that as the Riot Act had not been read, nor the Proclamation for the people to disperse, I begged of them, if the people had done wrong to take them into custody, and not knock them down - I had occasion to go down stairs with two ladies who had been at my house, and had a carriage waiting for them, and they got off as fast as they could - I saw some women and children at the different doors in Calthorpe-street, as well as men, and some of them were beaten, boys' heads were broken, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040020"/>one woman was so beaten in the field, that two gentlemen went out of my house to rescue her - two gentlemen of the press - Mr. Courtney was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said this affair began a few minutes after three o'clock, how long did this outrage continue in the street? A. An hour and a half before they cleared the premises, and that would bring it to about half-past four o'clock - I sat down to dinner at five o'clock - while this was going on, and I was at my balcony; the inhabitants shouted out of their windows, "shame, shame" - one of my daughters fainted at the sight; Mr. Courtney was very much affected, and another gentleman with him - I was examined at the inquest - I could not single out particular individuals in the confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, from the time the word charge was given and obeyed, did the police force appear to be under any control whatever? A. None whatever; I thought they were rather intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Were you ever a Justice of the Peace to the county of Middlesex? A. I was; I think I was nominated in July, 1831 - I continued so three or four months - I have since that ceased to be a magistrate - I made application to the Duke of Portland and the Lord Chancellor to know why, and they refused to inform me - I was superseded in the commission from the representation, I believe, of the select vestry of Pancras, which I have opposed for twenty years - there was never any complaint made against me - there was never any complaint made against me to the select vestry.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever a member of this select vestry? A. I am now; this is the second year that I have been so - I was not a member before that - I have been the means of overthrowing that vestry, and have been elected in their room - no complaint had been made about a payment of rates by a tenant of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been tried? A. I was tried for a riot and assault on the corn question in 1815, and honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time you have ever been tried? A. For a riot and assault - there was never any charge brought against me respecting an apprentice of mine - I never had an apprentice - I was tried in 1819 or 1820, at the Quarter Sessions for the county of Middlesex - the charge was, a boy named Jones, came with a horse and cart, and threw a great quantity of bottles on my ground; I requested him to move them, he would not - I desired two men to compel him to move them, in doing which they threw him off a horse - I was tried with two men and was convicted, and paid ten pounds to the prosecutor; I was at that time spending my private fortune in a building speculation - I was brought up as an architect and surveyor - I continued spending my private fortune in building speculations, till I made forty or fifty thousand pounds by it - I did not know there was to be a meeting on the Calthorpe estate, till the Sunday, when my groom informed me there was a proclamation on the prison walls, and I then went to read it - the thirteenth was on Monday - I did not consider it a proclamation, because it was not signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Because it was not signed, did you consider it was to be disregarded? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not caution persons against coming to the meeting on the following day? A. It cautioned persons from holding any illegal meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not state, that the object was to adopt preparatory measures to form a national convention, as the only means of obtaining and securing the rights of the people, did it not state a public meeting held for such a purpose, would be dangerous to the public peace and illegal? A. I believe it did; if you will hand me the paper I will tell you whether it was what I read; - (copy handed to Witness) - this is a copy of what I saw on the wall - a copy of that was stuck against the wall of Coldbath-fields prison, and is there now, and was there on the 13th of May.</p>

               <p>Q. You thought this not being signed was to be disregarded? A. I did, as it does not specify what Secretary of State.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you thought there would be nothing illegal in such a meeting? A. I never considered the question at all, because there was a meeting held by Mr. O'Connell, with ten times the number, and the peace was not broken; I don't know what the object of that meeting was, they spoke for three or four hours and then went away - I did not know before the meeting assembled, that this object of it was to adopt preparatory measures for forming a National Convention - I looked at the paper, generally on the prison walls the day before - I have no doubt but I read the whole of it - I saw flags at the meeting - I saw a flag with death's head and cross bones, all the same flags were at the former meeting and more too - I did not read the words on the death and cross bones flag - I believe it had an inscription - I have no doubt it had - before the police came that flag was not flourished about, it was exhibited - the moment the flags came up the police attacked the body instanter - I think there was four flags - I do not recollect the inscription on any of them - I saw that flag - I think it is the flag - I did not observe the person who carried it to notice him particularly - I saw it unfurled - I do not think the person who had it in his hand waved it - I think he furled it as soon as he got to the chairman - it was unfurled all the way down the street - there was a caravan at the meeting half an hour before; there was not a stage erected; the boy who first proposed the chairman, got into the caravan, with the chairman; in the first place he was in a caravan, and the man belonging to the caravan, finding they would not pay him drove him away; he drove about thirty feet up Calthorpe-street, and then the boy Lee and the man jumped out of the caravan into the street, finding they were likely to be carried away - the boy Lee first climbed up the rails, and in a very impertinent manner, proposed Mr. Mee to be chairman - I did not mean to take any part in the proceedings; I despised the meeting altogether; he then put it to the vote, forty or fifty hands were held up, and he declared Mr. Mee to be the chairman - I was still at my balcony - I heard what the chairman said - he addressed the meeting, and requested them to be peaceable and quiet, for it was essentially desirous for their purpose to have peace and quietness, and that he was very much obliged to the Whig government for advertising their meeting, for it gave them an importance they did not possess; he there halted and was desired by the people to go on, he appealed to the people if they were prepared to sacrifice one-tenth of all their earnings to support his wife and family, if they were not he requested them not to tell him to go on, and at this time the police made their appearance - the flags had arrived just before, and were all four near the chairman - when the police came they tried to seize the flags - I think I observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040021"/>one of the flag-staffs had a spear head; I did not see the American flag taken by Redwood - I cannot at all recognise the prisoner - I have seen Brooke and Redwood here - I did not see either of them do anything that day - I cannot recognise any of them - there was two distinct divisions came down Calthorpe-street; one had commenced the attack, and the other came up afterwards; I addressed the last that came up of the C division, with Mr. Thomas at their head - I did not see one body station themselves about the middle of Calthorpe-street; they arranged themselves on one side of the pavement afterwards; I saw them about the middle of Calthorpe-street, the latter part of the day, not before the American flag was captured - I did not see any person carry the American flag across the street - I believe Thomas was at the head of the C division; it was the E or C I think it was the E - it was the division which he headed I addressed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the divisions all join together? A. They did - I am sure the incursion of the police took place before the American flag was seized at all; I considered the proclamation not legal; I believe there are four or five principal Secretaries of State in the present government; Mee said they were puffed into importance by the Whig government, by that proclamation; I have seen puffs desiring people not to buy any thing on any account, and I considered them puffs to the people to buy them - I was made amagistrate by the present Lord Chancellor, and have been a reformer of the select vestry many years and continue so - I saw the American flag at a former meeting, when O'Connell was there - there was not the least row there, nor any police unless they were in plain clothes - I don't know whether that flag figured at Birmingham when the ministers were in some danger, it looks as if it had seen some service - I never saw a proclamation put out by the government of this country before, without the name of some Secretary of State to it, or being headed "By the King in Council" - the whole of the buildings about Calthorpe-street belong to me now; I built the whole of Calthorpe-street, it all belongs to me now except six houses, Gough-street, and Well-street, and the stables; also I have upwards of fifty thousand pounds there - I never saw the prisoner in my life, till this morning, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. I observe this anonymous paper desires the civil authorities to apprehend any person offending - was what you saw on the part of the police an attempt to apprehend or knock them down? A. They began to knock them down, and did not attempt to apprehend until I addressed them; then they took persons into custody, but not till then - I saw no responsible person on the ground directing the police except Mr. Thomas; he rode there on horse-back.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw of the meeting before the police rushed in, is it your opinion that half-a-dozen policemen would easily have prevented their meeting? A. If I had had half-a-dozen policemen, I would have taken every person without a blow - I beg to add there was not a brickbat thrown.</p>

                  </persName>
            . I am a reporter to the Courier newspaper - I did not know of this meeting till the morning of the 13th of May, when our editor sent me to attend; I arrived on the ground before twelve o'clock, and found small collections of people on different parts of the ground, but nothing to indicate a meeting; the appearance of the field was precisely as I have seen it on other Mondays; there was servants about with children, and people playing; and there was a preacher addressing a small body of persons; there did not appear to me any disposition to create a riot, either then, or at any time that day - I went there to make a faithful report to my employer of what I saw; about half-past two o'clock or later, I saw the van come up, into which one of the speakers got - this was the commencement of the meeting - I think at the time the first speaker got into the van, there was about two thousand people - there were a great number of women and children, I mean boys and girls of thirteen and fourteen years old. I saw several boys beaten afterward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any disposition to riot when the chairman got into the van? A. None, I think the feeling of the multitude was ridicule, for when the van was drawn off, somebody said it was the police had drawn it off - then there was a shouting and laughing - I heard it proposed that Mr. Mee should take the chair, and immediately after Mee began to address the crowd - I found the pressure inconvenient, and a person said "We can go up to this balcony," and the gentleman allowed us; I could see to the bending in Guildford-street to the right, to Gough-street north and south, and over the whole field to the Union, my view commanded the whole of Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to that time had any body of police come into Calthorpe-street? A. I did not see the police till I got into the balcony, but I heard Mee say "There are the police, I recommend that we send somebody to ask what they want." I heard that before we got into the balcony - there was not the slightest disposition to tumult - I saw some persons approach the hustings with flags - I was then at the hustings; it was before Mee took the chair - I think I saw the flag produced; it was on a pole floating and waving in the air; that is, the banner; it was afterward wound round the staff, and the chairman, I think, jumped out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the party attended by the banner, come towards the chairman? A. Yes; they came from Gray's-inn-lane - there was not any policemen on the ground then; at the moment the banners came down Calthorpe-street, the crowd increased very largely; but I don't know how many of the party marching in procession were abreast- I saw no disposition to tumult; the banner men were very loudly cheered - I think there were four with flags; they arranged themselves two on each side the chairman; one of them grasped his banner staff with his legs and arms, and the chairman put his hand round that staff. I was at the corner of Calthorpe-street and Gough-street, and the chairman was just the breadth of Gough-street from me - he was right in the centre opposite the middle of Calthorpe-street. I observed the person who carried the flag, but could not identify him - I think in going up to the chair three or four of the persons carrying the banners looked a little swaggering and triumphant - I don't think I had been in the balcony a second, when on turning round, I saw the police drawn up across the street and halting; they were about two-thirds the length of the street from the corner; they had advanced about one-third up the street - there was at the same moment in my view as I turned round, three other bodies of police, each of them completely blocking up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040022"/>the avenues to which they approached - each blocked up its avenue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they surround the persons who were at the meeting? A. No; the four bodies completely inclosed the meeting, surrounding it; completely inclosing all the people at the meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time where this flag stood? A. I cannot charge myself with remembering a particular flag - on the bodies of police advancing, the people fronting the chairman separated, part on each side, making a clear way for the police to come up to the hustings; that certainly appeared to be their object - the body of police in Calthorpe-street having halted about half a minute, proceeded to march, and as they went on, the end man of each rank pushed, thrust, and beat the people who were standing by them on the flag stones at a considerable distance from the meeting; all the end men did this as they advanced up the street; they just occupied Calthorpe-street from flag to flag - the people were crowded together - as soon as they began to march, they began to beat; and we on the balcony cried Shame! shame!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive over any part of the spot the meeting were dispersed, any act to provoke this? A. I think a crowd of policemen coming across from the Union might suppose the people were coming to attack them, as they were running from the other policemen; but they made no attack at all, and there was none.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand you to say, the police were going up Calthorpe-street towards the chairman, the people who had cleared the way retired down the other side? A. No; I say the policemen at the end of the ranks struck those who were on the flag stones; but as they reached the chair in the centre of the crowd, and the police in North and South Gough-street did the same, before the party coming from the Union could be seen - and it struck me, the police might suppose the crowd running from that body of police, were advancing to attack them. I don't mean the Calthorpe-street body, they could not suppose any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What body might suppose the people were advancing to attack them? A. The body of police coming from the Union, (which is at the eastern end of the street coming from the wall,) might suppose so; the other bodies had no such pretence; neither the Calthorpe-street nor the Gough-street. I saw the Calthorpe-street party follow people who were running away, and knock them down; they struck them on the legs till they fell - they stuck them across the shins, not one, but dozens; they were not offending - they were running away; the police ran after them at full stretch and struck them across the shins till they escaped - I don't know when the police first got into Calthorpe street, but the moment I got into the balcony I saw them, and they were standing, it appeared to me they were waiting for a signal - there was no means left for the people to escape, till the police in beating them, broke their own line; and then the people rushed by them and great numbers got off. If the police had not wasted their strength by three or four beating one man lying on the ground, I don't think one of the crowd could have escaped without a blow. I saw three policemen strike one man repeated blows on the head till he fell; and I saw other men beaten on the ground after they fell, by several policemen - I saw two or three policemen as they passed the man, strike him as he lay on the ground - when the Calthorpe-street party came to the end of the street, a man who was standing in front of the division, and who two or three times addressed them as they marched on, rushed towards the chairman; the banners then stood on the rail at which the chairman stood, and the place was quite open to them - when they got to the end, the person in front rushed forward to take the chairman, and he was followed by a greater part of the others from the middle of the division; the four banners were by the chairman at that time - the man in front rushed forward as if to seize the chairman, and the others rushed after him. I did not see what followed, for my attention was attracted by two girls being dragged and shoved under the balcony, and one of them was pushed down with the baton, not absolutely struck with it - these two girls were on the steps of Mr. Stallwood's door, which have a gate in front of the railing - that gate was shut, and a crowd of persons inside - these two girls were in these, they had no caps or bonnets, and as I went into the house, I opened the gate and let them in there. I looked over the balcony and saw the policemen beating the people inside the gate; hitting them indiscriminately over their heads and shoulders; and as one of the girls rushed across the street, I saw the policeman shove her with his baton, as she fell; she was screaming out Mercy, mercy. I saw the struggle at the banner, but what was done I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that about the time the rush was made at the chairman? A. Yes; just at the time I saw Mee leap down and run away - I saw a scuffle between one of the police and the bannerman - I saw the banner open - immmediately after, I saw the girl run across the street a man who was running away was struck by three policemen successively; I called to them to let the man run; one of them looked up at me, called me an odlous name, and said"You shall catch it too."</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that the crowd were desirous of remaining or escaping? A. Of escaping certainly - the conduct of the police seemed studiously to prevent their escape, I could have no doubt of it - there was no attack made on the police by word or deed till they commenced the attack; they struck the people over the head with their batons, with the full swing of the arm, as hard as they could; and they struck in that way over the crowds that were standing on the steps of the doors - I saw I should say from twenty to thirty persons laying on the ground, none of them were policemen - they were all wounded - I saw a number wounded - I saw the blood of many - at that time the crowd were endeavouring to escape - the police were beating them - the police were then as much scattered as the crowd was - they appeared under no control whatever, except the worst of passions - I saw two policemen striking a woman, that was after the banner was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Confine yourself to what happened before that.</p>
               <p>Witness. The girl was struck before the banner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear any attack made on the people by the police before the banner was taken? A. Certainly I observed it a very short time before the banner was taken - less than a minute - it continued after the banner was taken, and it was then frightful and appalling - I went out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040023"/>of Mr. Stallwood's house to rescue a woman who had been beaten.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment from the time the chairman was first in the van, would there have been any difficulty in dispersing the meeting without violence? A. None in the world; they appeared quietly disposed from the commencement; the majority seemed indifferent as to whether a meeting was to be held or not, for I spoke to several.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Were any of the people killed? A. I believe not; heads were broken and arms - since the meeting I have seen two or three persons whose arms were broken; I saw persons cut and laying on the ground senseless and bleeding - I have since seen two or three whose arms were broken that day - I know they applied to be examined at the inquest and were refused, for I made the application myself to the corner - I attended during the inquest except on the first day - I did not conduct the proceedings; I was sent for the paper to take the proceedings - and two or three days after when these persons were waiting outside I told the coroner two or three outside were wishing to be examined; they seemed exhausted with waiting - I did not see any placard calling the meeting - one colour was an American flag which has been produced; another had death's head and cross bones, and "death or liberty" on it; I don't remember the others - I did not see the procession, but the crowd was more than doubled immediately the banners came - there was a great cheering; I should infer that the mob had increased by the persons following the banners - I think all the four banners were unfurled; they were waved; the one with death's head and cross bones was waved; there was considerable cheering as the banners came up; I should not say it was particularly when that flag was waved; the four were placed right and left of the chairman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the cheering continue after the flags were placed there? A. No, there was perfect silence; the persons carrying the flags appeared a little swaggering and triumphant as they marched up; they did not wave their banners at that time; they carried them; the banners were floating at that time; I cannot recognize the person who carried the American flag; I have seen the prisoner since but don't remember to have seen him; I have no recollection of Redwood, and cannot say I saw him do anything - when the police came into Calthorpe-street, they occupied the whole street, from flagging to flagging, but were not on the flag; and in Gough-street from wall to wall; I should say there would be one hundred and fifty in Calthorpe-street, they were in close order; I should say there were three ranks and each rank might contain from twenty to thirty men abreast, or more, but I cannot be certain of that- there could not be so little as thirteen - I should not hesitate to swear there was more than twenty or thirty abreast as far as I could conjecture - I mean in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to swear positively there was as many as twenty abreast? A. I swear positively to my belief there was more - I did not count them; there was as many as there could be - I believe there was more than twenty - I hesitate to swear it - I don't know that I have seen Brooke before - I have seen the prisoner two or three times since he was committed - I do not recognise having seen him on the 13th of May - I saw the American colour in Calthorpe-street, and the man who carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the flag with death's head and cross bones been taken before you saw the American flag in Calthorpe-street? A. No, the time I saw the flag and the man who carried it was when they were coming to the chair - at the time the police came into Calthorpe-street I saw the American flag at the railing - I did not see it in Calthorpe-street - I think I can swear I did not see it at any time in any part of the crowd except at the railing after the chairman took his place.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand then you are not able to speak to what took place when the flag was seized in Calthorpe-street? A. No, I saw a scuffle at the railing - I saw no scuffling for a flag, and don't know what took place then - I have called on the prisoner in Newgate three or four times since the last sessions, last week or the week before - I think, I called on him four or three times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know there was such a person in the world before this disturbance took place? A. No, the first time I saw him to my knowledge, was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. You are asked if you saw a scuffle in Calthorpe-street about the banner; do you believe there was any scuffle in Calthorpe-street with a banner at all? A. On my oath I do not; I was not looking about all the time for I left the balcony for a few minutes, because I was taken ill and near fainting; that was after the attempt to take the chairman into custody - every thing was in my sight till after the police were in complete possession of that piece of ground and Calthorpe-street - till after the uproar had comparatively subsided; if any banner had been captured in Calthorpe-street I must have seen it; I think the banners were all captured at the rails - there was no struggle for any banner in Calthorpe-street - I saw no banner removed from the side of the chairman till the police advanced and the meeting was broken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible a man could have come across from the right corner of Calthorpe-street, into the middle of the street and there contest for the banner with a policeman, and a multitude at his heels, and you not see him? A. I should think it impossible - the whole scuffle for the banners took place at the rails - I could not distinguish one policeman from another; the incidents were too numerous to attend to the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe this conduct to be the act of individuals of the police, or was it the act of the body? A. The acts of violence were certainly the acts of individuals, but it was impossible to distinguish one's brutality from another; they were all alike - I cannot say whether Redwood or Brooke were among them; they might or might not be - there was no disposition to riot or tumult as the banners came up, nor any act of violence on the part of the people - there could not be less than five or six hundred policemen in the four bodies.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Did you see any policeman stabbed in Calthorpe-street? A. No; one might have been stabbed as it has been described, without my seeing it, or two - a dagger might have been used without my seeing it, and it appears it was done.</p>

            . I am minister of Bunhill-fields burial-ground. On the 13th of May, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040024"/>three o'clock, I was passing from Bagnigge wells round to Wilson-street, Gray's-inn-lane - I wished to inquire concerning a nephew who I understood was dying, and it was my nearest way to cross from Spa-fields across that place - I was not at all connected with the meeting, or its purpose - I observed when I got near Calthorpe-street, an assemblage of people; they were so peaceable that, although many hundreds, yet I should scarcely have thought it possible that above half-a-dozen persons were on the ground - I saw some colours flying where there was a van - I observed a rush made towards the persons who carried the banners by the Metropolitan New Police, who appeared on a sudden to come from all directions, but particularly from Calthorpe-street - up to the time of that rush, every thing was perfectly peaceable; they surrounded the assembly, and instantly commenced beating them indiscriminately with their staves; I saw this myself - I had not observed the smallest insult offered by the people - they attempted to escape, but were not able; for the new police who were in ambush, rushed out of almost every avenue and prevented their escape - I saw many persons knocked down by them; and one particularly streaming with blood, in fact, deluged with blood - I know Margaret-street very well; several people run up there, and were pursued by the police; and as they were running, I saw the police strike men, women, and children, indiscriminately in the street - I believe many of the police remained behind in Calthorpe-street - I continued there till about twenty minutes or quarter to four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time the rush made by the police commenced till you went away, did you observe any cessation of this brutal violence? A. I did not; I was not in Calthorpe-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went on the ground about three o'clock? A. About that time - I did not stay on the ground till a quarter to four o'clock, but about the place - I saw the persons bearing the flags come up; there was no shouting and cheering that I witnessed - I was about the centre of the ground; I should think there could not be great cheering without my knowing it - I did not perceive any person carrying the flags except the policeman who had them under his arm - I did not see the flags brought up; I saw them near the van - I continued mostly in Bagnigge-wells-road; that is not many yards from Calthorpe-street - I was quite in view of Calthorpe-street - I saw a policeman bringing two or three flags from that quarter - I did not observe what was on the flags; I saw no flags in Calthorpe-street; they appeared to me to be in the van; I did not perceive that they were set up, two on each side the chairman - I did not see them till they arrived on the spot - I was too far distant to hear the chairman address the meeting - I was not examined before the Coroner; I sent a note to the Coroner that I might be examined, but he did not call me - I saw nothing in Calthorpe-street about a man being stabbed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In the note you sent to the Coroner, did you state that you were a clergyman? A. I did not; I wrote it in this way, "Reverend J. S. Pearsey requests that the Coroner will allow him to step forward as evidence" - when I saw the flags in possession of the police, they were rolled up under the arm of a policeman; I did not perceive what was on them.</p>
               <p>A. JUROR. Q. I wish to know whether you could see the position the chairman occupied? A. I saw two or three persons; one might be the chairman; I was not acquainted with him - they appeared to be in the van - I could witness the whole of the transaction throughout the ground to the end of Calthorpe-street - I saw the van move off; who took it away I cannot say - I did not see what became of the chairman after the van moved off.</p>

            . I am a hair-dresser, and live at No. 17, Little Guildford-street, Russel-square. I went to this meeting a few minutes after two o'clock - I suppose at that time there were one thousand persons collected, men, women, and children - I went in consequence of reading a proclamation forbidding the meeting; I went to see what kind of a thing they had forbidden; that was the first thing that induced me to go - I saw the van drive up a little before three o'clock; I presume it was a quarter to three o'clock - it was at the end of Calthorpe-street, opposite Mr. Stallwood's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any little altercation between the persons in the van and somebody else? A. There was an altercation, but I don't know the nature of it - the van moved off - there is a railing close by, and a few minutes after a young man, about twenty-one or twenty-two years old, got on the railing and proposed a man, named Mee, to be chairman - he was voted to the chair by the acclamation of the persons surrounding; he stood on the railing and commenced addressing the multitude by first exhorting them to quiet, orderly, good conduct, to be particularly on their guard for they had their enemies about them, and if they saw a man commit the least breach of the peace to consider that man their foe - I was about twenty feet from the speaker, on a plug hole, and could hear all distinctly.</p>

               <p>Q. Up to that time had the meeting been peaceable and orderly? A. It was extremely peaceable - I remember the banner men coming, they were cheered a little as they came up towards where the speaker was - the banners were unfurled till they got a stand near the chairman, and then they were immediately furled - when there was a cry that the police were coming, I was elevated on the shoulders of two men, to see if it was a fact or not, and saw them coming down Calthorpe-street forming as they came, completely under military tactics; after they were formed completely, they occupied the whole space of Calthorpe-street, and marched up in regular military order; after some few had got away, from railing to railing, the inspectors were in front, the body marched up towards the railing; they pressed the people more compact towards the railing- I remember a tall man with full whiskers saying, "Seize this man," pointing with his hand towards the chairman - the banners were by the chairman at that time, and furled, and almost instantly an attack commenced.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that within hearing of the banner men? A. Within hearing no doubt - I think they were near enough to hear it - the police instantly commenced one rush on the people, knocking down those nearest to them, cutting away in all directions; while they were so doing, an inspector, on the right of those who marched up the middle, said, "Go it, my lads, that is right;" I was then immediately dropped down, and tried to make my escape down Gough-street, but I found that part was blocked up by the police; I was carried by the pressure of the crowd, who were try<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040025"/>ing to make their escape, into Calthorpe-street, and there a tall man, in the garb of a labourer, immediately before me, had his head cut, and the blood came trickling down on me - at that moment, I crouched a little till I got into the second doorway, No. 11, and the mob of course could rush by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any of the mob were knocked down? A. There was very few but were either knocked down or knocked about by the police indiscriminately; I saw one man very active in knocking down, and he struck an old man, and when his hat fell off he was grey-headed and bald-pated, and his head was streaming with blood; immediately he knocked the man down, he struck him once or twice after he was down - a lad was attempting to run by him, and he struck him and knocked him down with his staff - I afterwards saw that very policeman taken to a doctor's shop in Gray's-inn-lane, he had his hand in a sling, and was led by two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe a man with a banner? A. I did; he was being knocked about at the time I first saw him with the banner, by at least eight or ten policemen, they surrounded him, some pulling the banner and some striking at him; the inhabitants cried, "Shame, shame," - that cry was quite audible - when they were striking the man with the banner, a poor woman standing on the steps of a door said, "Oh you scoundrels consider their wives and families, and don't murder the men," and immediately after three policemen came up to the doorway, where she and I were; one of them made use of a very bad expression, and struck her down the face, cut it open, and fetched the blood out - she had given no provocation, except what I have stated - one of the others struck me with intent to cut my head open, but the blow came on my shoulder as I held my head on one side - as they first came up, they used a very awful expression beginning with a B; this man after striking me on the shoulder, raised his arm up to strike me in the mouth, I seized his arm and rushed behind him, in my trying to get away he fell down - I think he was intoxicated, or he would not have fallen so easily - I consider him to have been quite inebriated, or he would not have fallen so easily - the people all ran away, and I got another blow across my back, as I ran - the police said, "Run, d-n you, run."</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run after you? A. No; as they ran by, the police stood on the curb, and as each man ran by they tried to have a thump at him; directly I got into Gray's-inn-lane, I heard a cry of a policeman having been stabbed, and saw a man with his arm bound up, it was the same man as I saw knock the old man and the boy down, I am sure - for I went twice after him trying to get his number, but all I could see was, that he was of the C division, and had three figures; I said to him, "Thank God you have got it, for you richly deserve it," knowing him to be the same man as I had seen knock the old man and boy down - I tried to dress three or four persons' wounds, they were hurt principally over the head, rather towards the back part of the ear - I tried to dress three; I tied one up with rag, and two I tried to bandage with strapping - one was very severely wounded indeed, in fact, I advised him to go to a surgeons considering it very dangerous, for I could see the brains through his hair - I consider several of the police were not sober.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Look at that person,(Redwood) do you recognize him as having been present? I have every reason to believe this is the man; I have every reason to believe he is the man I saw strike the old man and boy - I swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do? A. Yes, provided he is the man I saw; but remember it was upwards of two months ago, but to the best of my belief this is the man; I believe him to be the man; it was in Calthorpe-street; I don't know that I saw Brooke there; I have no recollection of him - I only knew of the meeting from the government placard - I don't know the meaning of the word Convention, and went there for information, to see what the thing was likely to be - I was never at such a meeting before.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had been a meeting to put down the King, Lords, and Commons should you have thought it legal? A. Unquestionably not; I should not have attended it to make part or parcel in it; I might have gone from curiosity as I did then - I did not consider there was any meeting at all; I went to witness the nature of it, and to find out the meaning of these words National Convention - I saw death's head and cross bones on one banner, and I believe "Death or Liberty" - I did not read the others; when the banners advanced there was cheering and shouting - there were not a great many persons following the banner men.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not hundreds? A. Oh dear no, when they came the meeting increased about one hundred I should think - I think there were about one thousand on the ground when the banners came, and about one hundred followed them on a rough guess or calculation - I believe there was very few, if any, more than one hundred - they furled the banners when they advanced; they twisted the poles round to furl them, I could not then read the inscription, what with their playing in the wind and their furling them up - I don't know what an American flag is; I believe the one produced was there; I don't know who carried it, and don't know where it was stationed - I remember seeing it coming up; I saw it coming up Calthorpe-street towards the chairman, but not afterwards that I know of; it might have been furled - I saw no policeman stabbed in Calthorpe-street; it might have been done without my seeing it, or two or a dozen might have been stabbed; there might have been such a thing - the policeman who said "Seize that man," was a tall, powerful looking man with full whiskers, and he had a silver collar on his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the banners then by the chairman? A. Yes, as near him as they could get; all four were as near as they could get round him - I don't know how many banners there were; there might have been five or six for what I know; all that I saw stood outside the railing near Calthorpe-street - I saw the prisoner struggling with a banner, but whether it was an American one I cannot say - he was holding it in the road at the very end of Calthorpe-street, and seven or eight policemen were contending with him for it, and beating him, and others trying to force it from him at the same time - while he was struggling there this man, who I believe to be Redwood (on my conscience I saw him) he was about as far as I am from the prisoner when he struck the old man - when Fursey was struggling for the flag, the policeman I believe to be Redwood was about two yards from Fursey, and at that time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040026"/>he knocked down the old man making his way towards where the prisoner and the police were contending for the banner, and he cut down the old man at the time, and the boy immediately after; I did not hear any policeman groan or cry out, Oh - they were struggling with Fursey for the banner about two minutes in Calthorpe-street, at the very end.</p>
               <p>Q. Struggling to get the banner from him? A. Yes, beating him all the time, and the numbers were continually increasing - Fursey had the banner in his hand till they got him down on the ground, then he twirled his hands and feet round, and the police hurled him round and dragged him towards Gray's-inn-road way; they at last got the banner from him, by the second house, about the middle of the street, rather more on the north side; they there got the banner from him - I have not heard Mr. Courtney examined - nothing was said then about a policeman being wounded or stabbed; it was about four or five minutes after this that I saw the man with his arm in a handkerchief - I had not seen that man struggling with Fursey - I had seen him about two yards from Fursey at the time they were contending for the banner; I never saw him nearer than that; he might have gone nearer because after knocking the boy down he rushed past, and might have gone nearer - I lost sight of him among the rest of the police; I kept sight of Fursey till the banner was taken from him; I don't know what became of him then, for he was completely surrounded by the police, and my attention was drawn by the screams of some women towards the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did many of the police appear to you to be intoxicated? A. Not what I call downright drunk; I don't mean to say they could neither stand nor walk; they could just make a decent sort of a walk of it to conduct themselves - I suppose, I myself saw ten or a dozen who were greatly the worse for liquor, many others seemed partially the worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Might the greatest number appear partially the worse for liquor? A. No, I should think about one-fourth; Redwood seemed partially the worse for liquor - from the savage ferocity with which he went to work with his truncheon, and the apparently excited state of his feelings; and he nearly tumbled down at one time, when he was striking the old man, I imagine he was partially drunk - others were considerably more intoxicated than him; I did not see them take any liquor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you were not in their company in the public-house? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said a dozen men might be stabbed in Calthorpe-street without your observing it? A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there considerable riot and outrage all through the street? A. The people laid down prostrate in all directions; they fell down to the ground bleeding - I expected to find several dead myself, from the manner in which they bled.</p>
               <p>Q. How many in your observation might be tumbled down from the blows of the police, is it too much to say twenty? A. I hardly think twenty in Calthorpe-street alone - the greatest part was at the further end, I should imagine about a dozen were knocked down.</p>

               <p>Q. You have described a struggling for a banner, you do not know whether this is the one or not - was it such a struggling as might have smashed the pole of it? A. I wonder it stood it half so long - the manner of the policeman which I suppose to be Redwood, in rushing past the old man and boy was extremely violent, most outrageous violence; he struck every body who came in his way - when I lost sight of him he was cutting right and left - I had not the slightest concern with the meeting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw the banner taken from the prisoner - what became of him afterwards? A. He was so surrounded, and my attention being taken by the screams of some women I don't know what became of him; I did not see him afterwards till to-day.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. How near was you to the prisoner when the struggle took place about the banner? A. I should think a little further than I am from you, Sir, about half as much again (about ten yards).</p>

            . I keep an oil-shop, and live at No. 38, Upper North-place, Grays-inn-road. On the 13th of May, I was at my shop-door, about one o'clock; my house is next door to the Calthorpe Arms - a little after one o'clock, I saw bodies of the police advancing - one party went to Mr. Burbridge's stables, and the other to Dawson's - I was standing at my shop door, and saw them go in - I went into the Calthorpe Arms to get my family their beer, and saw some of them there - I afterward saw some persons come with flags, they went towards Calthorpe-street; that was before the policemen came out of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. While these persons were advancing towards the fields was there any disturbance? A. I did not see any- there was no violence used - there were a few policemen there then straggling about.</p>
               <p>Q. They did nothing? A. No, they did nothing but eat and drink at the public house - I should think it was not above five minutes after the procession came that I saw the police marched from Dawson's - I could not so well see them from Burbridge's - they took the same direction as the procession with the flags had taken - as they passed my house they all turned up their coat sleeves, spat upon their hands, and grasped the leather of their truncheons round their wrists, and they appeared in an agitated state, grasping their truncheons firmly - and marched at a quick pace into Calthorpe-street - I know Baker the inspector by sight; I saw him, he had his staff in his hand moving it in this manner, (waving it,) leading his men on - I did not go from my door; I cannot see down Calthorpe-street; I only saw into Gray's-inn-road - when Baker moved his staff, his men advanced with their staves in their hands; they seemed to look pale and agitated; I did not see them do anything - I saw several persons with their heads cut; I saw a man about fifty years old; I saw several people knocked about by the police, by my door on the curb stone; I saw one woman very much hurt, and I saw one boy from ten to twelve years old; these persons had done nothing, nor given any offence to the police, they were very quiet and inoffensive - I saw the people trying to get out of the way of the police but they could not, if they got out of the way of one party, another fell in with them, and then they knocked them about; I saw a policeman throw his truncheon after one man down the road, it was two policemen pursuing one man or two men, they could not catch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040027"/>him, and threw a truncheon at him - I took five or six women into my shop who were endeavouring to escape, two of them had children in their arms, and two or three young men - I cannot say whether my neighbours did the same, but I saw them standing at their doors - I saw Baker produce a dagger, there was a sheath to it - it was the same sort as the one produced - I cannot swear to it - he stated where he got it from.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Did you see any person struck in Calthorpe-street? A. No; I was never in the street at all, and do not know what took place there.</p>

            . I live in Penlington-place, Lambeth, and am one of the editors of an evening paper, I went to the Calthorpe-street ground, on the day of this meeting - I got to the ground about a quarter before one o'clock; at this time I should think there were scattered over the ground about three or four hundred persons - (I frequently cross the ground; it is a place of resort for idle boys and children to play) - there was no indication of a meeting being held there; I went, understanding one was to be held - as I went there I passed several bodies of the police who were going to the meeting - I continued on the ground till the persons who subsequently commenced the proceedings of the meeting arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. You passed several bodies of police apparently moving towards the ground, did you see those police afterwards approach the ground? A. I saw bodies of police; at that time the persons assembled were perfectly peaceable - I was standing on the ground when the persons bearing the banners moved down the street; and in consequence of the influx of persons at that time, I requested permission to go into the balcony of Mr. Stallwood's house - I got into the balcony, which commands an extensive view of the place - about the time I had got in the balcony I found the police drawn across the ends of Calthorpe-street, and across Gough-street, which runs directly across Calthorpe-street; and immediately afterward I heard orders given to the police who were drawn up at the end of Calthorpe-street to move forward - they occupied nearly the breadth of the street; they moved on, the persons falling back to allow them to go on; and as they went on the crowd was denser, and as soon as they were obstructed in their progress by the persons who were quietly standing in the crowd, they immediately began to use, their staves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that the obstruction was caused by the denseness of the crowd, or did the crowd attempt to strike them at all? A. Certainly not; all the people who could move on one side had done so; but when they got farther the crowd was so dense, it was impossible for them to do so, and then the police began to strike them with their truncheons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they seem to you to care where they hit, whether it was in the face, or head - did they seem to you to care where they aimed? A. I saw the truncheons being used in every possible direction - scores of them flying about in every possible direction - the body of the crowd were generally men, but towards the sides of the street, on the pavement, I observed several females, who could not move, as the police had crossed the other side of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. The females, from the pressure of the police could not move backward or forward? A. On one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear anxious to get away? A. No; I saw no movement; they did not move - when this indisoriminate striking took place the inhabitants cried, Shame, shame - I joined in the cry myself; and two or three gentlemen in the balcony, and some ladies, were crying out, Shame - Mr. Courtney was there; there were the same cries from various other houses - I was induced to cry Shame, from seeing the people surrounded by the police, and their retreat being rendered impossible - I thought it a most barbarous thing for this armed body of men to commence an attack on this unarmed and unoffending people - I saw several persons knocked down, and saw them struck on the head when they were down - this was after the crowd had dispersed; they were struck by the police with their truncheons - immediately under me I saw a crowd of persons who had got into a little area, apparently out of the way of the police - I saw policemen, in bodies of three or four, come from the ground where they had been dispersing the people, and going up to the persons standing in the doorways; I saw them lay hold of two or three gentlemen by the collar, and thrust them away - those gentlemen were standing quietly, and appeared to turn round to remonstrate with the police, and they were struck in this way - while I stood on the balcony I saw two females crossing the waste ground, coming in a direction for Calthorpe-street; I saw them surrounded by four or five policemen - this was at the identical period of the attack.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you saw the flags marching up to the van was it that you saw this uproar and outrage committed in Calthorpe-street? A. Three or four minutes; it was almost directly; certainly not more than five minutes; I had just time to get on the balcony - I did not in the whole course of the outrage, see any stones or brickbats thrown - I saw nothing whatever in the conduct or demeanour of the people to provoke the outrage on the part of the police.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Did you know of the intended meeting before you went on the ground? A. Yes, it was my knowledge of it took me there - I saw it stated as the intention of the meeting to establish a national convention - I saw it in various publications, and advertisements and bills I think - it was notorious I believe; Mr. Stallwood's is a corner house; one face of it is towards Calthorpe-street, and the other towards Gough-street - the balcony is in Gough-street, and the end of it is in Calthorpe-street - I had the range of the balcony; the party came up with the banners before I went into the house - there was a general shout raised when they came; I noticed the banner with death's head and cross bones, and liberty or death, or something of that kind on it - the people with the banners stationed themselves on this side the railing in which closes the waste ground; I took very little notice of the banners - I saw a struggle for a banner which I believe was a striped one, but cannot say it was this, it was at the end of Calthorpe-street, soon after the attack was commenced by the police on the people - I did not hear of the policeman being stabbed; it could not be above a minute and a half from the first attack to that struggle - I did not hear of a policeman being stabbed till I returned to the office - I saw the struggle myself; I did not see the banner actually taken - a policeman might be stabbed and I not have seen it - I am editor of the "True Sun."</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw the struggle for the ban<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040028"/>ner, about how many policemen did you see surrounding the man? A. There was a large body of police, I should think ten or more surrounded him - I cannot say whether they had truncheons; they were exceedingly violent; they had got hold of the pole of the banner - I suppose the man who held it, was trying to retain it; but I did not see the man; he appeared to be doing his best to prevent them getting it - there was a violent struggle for a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. So as to cause the use of both his hands? A. Yes. I have said I did not see the person who held the banner - I should suppose, certainly, that he was doing his very utmost to retain it. I went to the meeting to see the proceedings, and give an account of it in our paper, as all our reporters were down at the House of Commons.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, Bolton-place, Margaret-street, Spa-fields; and am a surgical instrument maker. On the 13th of May, I got to Calthorpe-street about half-past two o'clock, as near as I can guess, I did not see any watch or clock. I had come from Berner's-street, Oxford-street, and was standing in the field - I was there before the chair was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Up to the time that the chair was taken, was any disturbance offered by the people? A. Not any; the police had not come on the ground - I saw the police advance, it was after three o'clock - I could not see all the avenues leading to the field, on account of the crowd - I did see the Calthorpe-street avenue distinctly - I saw a very large body of them come up Calthorpe-street; they walked very steadily and very firm within a few yards of the speaker at the end of Gough-street - they were not molested or interfered with by anybody; the crowd in Calthorpe-street opened on each side for them, and offered them no violence; a space was opened for them to get up to where the chairman was - I both saw them use their truncheons, and had them used on myself; the few banners which were there, were near the chairman - I cannot tell how many there were, they were furled.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any of the bearers of the banners using any gestures with them, or doing anything offensive at all? A. Not at all; up to the time the police began to use their truncheons, they had received no offence or injury from anybody - I was in the middle of Gough-street - I parted on one side with part of the crowd to let them pass up to the chair - this was a little after three o'clock; the moment this was done, the police raised their truncheons - they had them laying on their arms ready for action, holding them in their right hand, and laying them on their left arms - they fell upon the people without giving them any warning, and knocked them down just as they came indiscriminately.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they knocked them down, did they require them to disperse, or say any thing? A. Not one word; I received a blow at the corner of my left eye; there is the scar now - I had done nothing either by word or deed to provoke that blow - I could not recognize who it was given by, but it was a policeman; it knocked me down and drew blood; I bled a great deal - six or eight fell on me while I was down on the ground, and beat me most unmercifully - they were all policemen; this was as they were advancing towards the chairman, before the struggle for the flag. I was one of the first they struck - I was struck on my arm and shoulder; I was on my left hand and knee endeavouring to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this while you were bleeding at the head? A. Yes; I was so muchinjured, I could not work for a fortnight - they ran from me to fall on a man and boy, and knocked them down. I then arose and made my escape - on my road home I overtook

            , he came up to me in the field near Bagnigge-wells by the side of the prison wall and said something to me; the field was full of policemen then; Wheeler and I walked to the end of Margaret-street, there were three policemen there, and one of them knocked him down - this was about a quarter of an hour after I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you drawn to the spot by having seen a placard or bill? A. No, I had not seen any; I was coming home; I had been out on business - I saw the flag bearers march up to the place where the chairman was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say they came quite peaceably, and no crowd after them, no hooting and hallooing at all? A. Not any, every body was perfectly silent; the people might have spoken, but they did not shout nor cheer - the flags were unfurled when they came up, and were furled after they took their standing; I did not take notice, and don't know what was on the flags; I did not notice any with stripes and stars on them - there was a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that the flags coming up brought people with them? A. People who brought the flags of course - I don't know whether the other people followed the flags, or whether they came by accident - I cannot calculate how many came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there ten or fifteen? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there fourteen or fifteen hundred? A. I cannot say, I cannot pass an opinion - they were quite quiet and peaceable - I could see down Calthorpe-street - I did not see the policeman stabbed, nor see him after he was stabbed; I saw nothing about it; I heard of it at near night, when I was standing at the end of Bolton-place, and Margaret-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, considering your bad eye, you were out very soon? A. Yes, but people after severe bruises don't feel the effects so bad till next morning; I felt it more a week after than I did at the time; I had my eye dressed by a surgeon - I work for the trade, I receive no weekly wages, but take jobs from surgical instrument makers, and make them according to their directions - I was examined before the coroner the last day of the inquest; I forget how long that was after I received the wound, it was more than three days.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you exhibit before the coroner the injuries you had received in the temple and otherwise? A. Yes - Bolton-place is only a few yards from my house, it is a little, short court.</p>
               <p>Q. From the commencement of the uproar to the conclusion, did you see any thing on the part of the people to warrant the attack which was made on them? A. Not any.</p>

            . I am a professor of music, and live at No. 30, Rawstorne-street, Clerkenwell. I had to go to Mr. Duffs, a string maker in Gray's Inn-lane, and passed through the Calthorpe estate ground, as well as I can recollect, at near three o'clock, every thing was then most remarkably peaceable - as I returned, I entered the ground again from Calthorpe-street, and in endeavouring to pass out at the Bagnigge-wells-road, I saw a quantity of policemen.</p>

             re-examined. When I went into Calthorpe-street I was quite sober; I was not in liquor at all - a man had come into the stable with some porter, and two friends of mine of the F division were there; I purchased a pot of porter of the man; we had a pot among four of us, I only drank once, and did not drink half a pint - I had drank no other strong drink that day, neither beer nor spirits; I had drank nothing more at the time I was struck - the men of my division were perfectly sober for what I saw of them - I saw none of them at all the worse for liquor - I never raised my truncheon to any body till after I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in health and strength enough to strike people after you was struck? A. I only struck one blow, and that was at Fursey.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you persist in swearing that none of your fellow-policemen struck other people in Calthorpe-street? A. I cannot answer for their conduct; I saw none strike while I was with them - I did not mention before the Coroner or magistrate, that I gave Fursey a blow after I was struck myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Although not tipsy, were not you rather excited by the scene, or anxiety of promoting and distinguishing yourself? A. Not at all; I was quite cool, as I am now, and I went up to Fursey in a cool manner.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did not many of the police strike before you struck Fursey in Calthorpe-street? A. Not that I saw - I heard no cries at all - I did not go more than half way up the street - I never went into Gough-street - Coldbath-fields prison is before you when in Calthorpe-street; Gough-street crosses Calthorpe-street, but I know nothing of the road; I never was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear the distance from the entrance of Calthorpe-street is more than sixty yards from the railing which separates it from the ground? A. I cannot say what distance it is; I am not acquainted with the distance- I was in the street, and saw the railing - I entered from Gray's Inn-lane - I suppose it may be about sixty yards - there was shouts from the mob, but my attention was on apprehending the prisoner - I heard cries of the mob hooting; I heard no cries of Shame - I did not see Mr. Stallwood - I saw no one struck while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the banners went up did you go up Calthorpe-street? A. That was the only banner that came into Calthorpe-street - when I was taking the colour from Fursey, there was about four or five of us about him; we were pulling at the colour, and he had hold of it; he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one hand? A. He had them in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had two hands holding the colour? A. For what I know he had - he had his hands to the flag-staff - he had nothing in his hand at that time that I saw, but the flag-staff.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. He had the staff in his hand, when was that? A. I saw him come from the right to the left out of Calthorpe-street, he came on from about the middle of Calthorpe-street to the left - I advanced out from my rank, and demanded the colour from him; he refused to give it up - I then told him I should take the colour from him; I accordingly seized the colour with both hands- I saw him raise his right hand with an instrument in it about six or eight inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he held the flag-staff with both hands? A. That was on the right hand side, as we were going out of Gray's-inn-road up to Calthorpe-street - it was on the right hand side of the street that he had hold of the flag with both hands, but that was after I was stabbed; I was stabbed on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he hold of the flag in both his hands before you was stabbed? A. No, only in his left hand; his right hand was down in this manner (straight down at his side) before I was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the flag been got from him before you were stabbed? A. Not that I saw - after I had struck him he ran into the ranks, and he still had the flag in his left hand, and he still had the instrument in his hand when he ran into the ranks.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw him holding the flag with both hands? A. After I had got hold of him, and got him over to the right, that was at the time I gave him into the custody of two officers; I had hold of him then with my right hand by the left collar; it was then there was a struggle with him, and four or five round him.</p>
               <p>JUROR. Q. I think you said there were four or five constables round the man after he had the flag-staff in both hands, was you one of the four or five that were endeavouring to take it from him? A. I was one; I never lost sight of him after taking him by the collar?</p>
               <p>Q. How could he go into the ranks? A. I had got hold of him, and went in with him.</p>
               <p>The following is a Copy of the Proclamation.</p>
               <p>Whereas printed papers have been posted up and distributed in various parts of the metropolis, advertising that a public meeting will be held in Coldbath-fields, on Monday next, May the 13th, to adopt preparatory measures for holding a National Convention, as the only means of obtaining and securing the rights of the people: and, whereas a public meeting holden for such a purpose, is dangerous to the public peace and illegal, all classes of his Majesty's subjects are hereby warned not to attend any such meeting, nor to take any part in the proceedings thereof. And notice is hereby given, that the civil authorities have strict orders to maintain and secure the public peace; and to apprehend any persons offending herein, that they may be dealt with according to law.

I was on duty, and heard the alarm - I ran up, and the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing five shillings; I took her to the station; I found one half-crown, two sixpences, and fourpence in halfpence in her pocket; the prosecutor told me he had picked up one shilling, and found another shilling in her gown-sleeve - I gave her back the other sixpence and the fourpence, by the magistrate's order.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor talking to a young woman - she asked him to give her something to drink; he said he had no money; the young woman then said to me "Come down to Page's" - as we were going there the prosecutor walked after us - the young woman met two tailors, who said to her "Poll, will you have a drop of gin"; we went in and had some; in about five minutes, the prosecutor came in, and he called for a quartern - he handed a glass of it to the young woman; she said she had just had one; he then handed it to me; I just tasted it, and he then handed it to a bricklayer's labourer, who had come from a wake, and said, "You drink it"- the prosecutor then came out, and we remained talking; I then went home with the young woman, and as I was going back I met the prosecutor again - he said where are you going; I said to my home; he said, "Will you have a drop of gin, I have got sixpence, that is all" - I went to the Golden Lion for it, but they were shut up; he then asked me to give him the sixpence back, which I did not approve of - he then began to maul me about, and said he would charge the police with me for robbing him; I said I would go with him; I made no resistance.</p>

               <p>The letter was put in, and the latter part of it was read, as follows: - "The money I have of yours I shall send or leave at the road, as I do not know the bearer, and I never could do my duty after the unkindness I received this morning."</p>
               <p>Witness. I had found some wine removed, and I told the prisoner the day before, that I should not keep him - on that morning, he asked me if I would give him a character, I said, I could not give him one that would be of use to him; he ought to have returned to me in the course of the day, but he did not - I understand he absented himself from home - he was taken in a week afterwards.</p>

The prosecutor described Gregory to me, and said he had been robbed; I went to the house with him, and searched the bed and room, but found nothing; I then went down and found Sadler in bed - he rents the house; he said he knew nothing about it, and he could not be answerable for what was done in his house. I took the servant who had the letting of the bed down to the office; and my brother officer took Sadler; he still said he knew nothing about it, but when we took him to Lambeth-street, he sent for me into the cell, gave me the key of his door, and told me where the watch was - I went and found it under the pressbedstead where he had been; it was wrapped in an old handkerchief; Mr. Powell who took this handkerchief off the prisoner's neck, is gone to Maidstone.</p>

               <p>Gregory's Defence. I unfortunately fell in with this good man, who asked me to take him home, which I did - he asked what he should give me, I said I should leave that to his generosity, he called the woman up and gave her one shilling and sixpence for the bed; he then gave me two half crowns - he asked me to lay down with him, which I did, for a little while; he then said I might go where I pleased; I went the next morning to get two gowns out of pawn, and as I was returning, the officer took me. I left the prosecutor asleep in Sadler's room - I ordered them to fasten the door; he had his watch safe when I left him - I had no more than what he paid me.</p>
               <p>Sadler's Defence. The prosecutor came to me and said, that girl has taken my watch; I said I will go and see if I can find her - he went out of the house and came back with the officer, who took me to the station-house, where I remained till eleven o'clock - I was then taken to Lambeth-street; as we were going into the office, some other person went in, and we staid in the passage; two women stood there, and one said to the other, "I was told the watch was under the drawers;" I was glad to hear that, and I sent for the officer, and told him of it - he asked me to give him the key which I did, and I was rejoiced to think that the gentleman would get his watch again; the officer knows there is not a word untrue in what I have stated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Was your master out? A. Yes, it was on Sunday; my master came home that night, but I did not tell him of it that night - Riddle was not much intoxicated; I did not see any one but Godwin standing opposite; the omnibus was directly opposite my master's - Godwin was right opposite my master's house, and must have seen it - Riddle took it over in his hand.</p>
               <p>CONRADE MANGER WEBB. I keep the shop. My shopman told me of this the next morning - I called Riddle into my room; he confessed that he took a ham on Sunday evening, and said he was sorry for what he had done, but he had taken a ham, and given it to the driver of the omnibus; I asked him why he had done so, he gave me no answer; I then sent for the officer; I could not miss the ham, I had so many.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took both the prisoners; Riddle told me he had been asked by a coachman, whom he did not know, to give him a rasher of ham, and he gave him a whole ham - I took Godwin, he said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you stated that he was charged with stealing a ham? A. No, receiving one; he said he knew nothing of any ham whatever.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this Mr. Rawlinson's hand-writing? A. Yes; this other is the writing of Mr. Phillips, the second clerk in the office - it was read over in presence of the prisoners (read) "The prisoner Riddle says I took the ham out of the shop, wrapped it up in a red handkerchief, and gave it to the coachman; he asked me first for a rasher - I rode down with him and back; he then said, get a small ham if you can; I was in liquor - the prisoner Godwin says I was in liquor."</p>
               <p>ELIZA LAWRENCE re-examined. Q. Did you see the coachman at the time the ham was taken? A. No, not till I got to the door - I don't know whether Riddle got off the coachman's box.</p>

I never saw the prisoner till the 21st of May, when he came and asked for Mr. Smith - I said Mr. Smith had been gone for four years, but Mr. Fuller was master now - I said "Do you want a job;" he said, Yes- I said I "don't think it is any use for we are very slack, but you may call in the morning" - he went up the yard- I thought him a long while; I looked and saw him with one lamp in his hand; he then lifted up a cloth, and took another - I went into the street and took hold of him; I said "This wont do" - he put down the lamps and I kept him till the officer took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not ask you who was the maker of them? A. Yes, I said it wont do - he was between two carriages when I saw him; he took the lamps from a chaise seven yards from where I stopped him; he had one in his hand, and then took another from the near side of a gig with his right hand.</p>

             (police-serjeant N 9). I live in River-street, Islington. On the 4th of June, I took the prisoner sitting on a stone in Chapel-street, Pentonville; I asked if his name was not Darby, he said, No; I said, "I am certain you are the person" - in going to the station-house, he mentioned two boys who had had part of the money, and requested him to do it; I said, "You had better say nothing;""Oh! No, no," he said; he then said they had robbed him of part of it; I asked him how, he said one of them had kept the change of a sovereign for a pot of beer - I found on him this box of powder, which he said he had bought of a waterman, at Gravesend, to poison fish; and that a landlord there had kept him till all his money was gone, and then sent him home to London - he also said he did not break the box open.</p>

On the evening of the 19th of June, I was passing Drury-lane, it was about half-past ten o'clock, when I met the two prisoners; who were strangers to me, they asked me to go with them - they took me into a house in <placeName id="t18330704-27-crimeloc144">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What are you? A. A fancy trimming maker. I was out of employ, and had been out seeking a situation - I had been about the West-end of the town - at five o'clock I sat down with a friend of mine - I had part of a pint of ale at a house - I don't know the sign of it, it was not far from St. Giles' church; that was the only house I had been at - my friend went home - he is in the same line of business I am; I don't know his name - I have seen him several times before; I was sober when I met the prisoners, and all I had with them was a quartern of gin - I laid on the bed in their room - all my things were off, but my drawers - I tucked my watch in the waistband of my drawers, and fastened the chain round the waistband, without making any hole - I gave Harris the shilling to sleep with me, she went away, but Field stopped, and said, it was all as one.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Had you had nothing but the part of the pint of ale and of the gin? A. No; I was not intoxicated, I was affected and fell into a doze - the prisoners partook of the gin after me; I did not see anything put into the gin - I put my watch in the top part of the waistband of my drawers, I then rolled it round and fastened the chain three or four times round - I ran after them the moment I recovered from the blow - I had not my trousers on when I met the policeman - I then went back and put my trousers on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any money? A. No; only the fourpence I gave for the gin, and the shilling I gave to Harris.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he seem to take it quietly? A. Yes, and I told him so at the time - he waited till I came to the door, and spoke quietly to me - he had no coat or waistcoat on - he looked rather drowsy, and as if he had been drinking in the fore part of the night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had he his trousers on when you came to the door? A. Yes; but not his coat or waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Then your family consisted of yourself, your wife, and the prisoner? A. Yes, that was all - I took these two £10 notes from Mr. Martin, for the furniture of my house in Frith-street, on the 9th of May; I put them into my purse the same day- I don't allow my wife the use of my keys; she is in a childish state; she is a weak woman in the head, which arose from a paralytic stroke in the head - I never found that my wife had been trying a key to one of my drawers, and broken part of it in the lock - I had not looked at these notes from the 9th of May, till I missed them on the 16th, when the prisoner had run away - I had gone out every day except Sundays - I had no friends to visit me; we have been there but a short time, and our friends have not come there - I cannot undertake to say that no friend had called on me, but they had not gone up stairs - I go out to buy all the provisions except the bread, which the baker brings, but he does not come into the garden - I cannot fix on the date on which I lost any of my property, but I missed it on the 16th - the prisoner had left my service on account of her father and mother being ill with the cholera morbus, and she returned; but not with my consent; my housekeeper took her in - my housekeeper left me on Easter Monday; she wished to go away because I wished to buy every thing myself, and she had been in the habit of buying when in London, but I thought I could buy things cheaper, and so I did - the prisoner did not leave me to go to pay her cousin a visit - I undertake to state, that she ran away; she left me without notice, and did not return.</p>

            , he lives at No. 2, Ball's-pond-road, and is a milkman, I knew the prisoner, as Mr. Lucas's servant; about nine weeks ago - (I think it was early in May,) she came one evening to my house, and asked if I knew where there was a jeweller - I said there was a new pawnbroker's-shop opened, and I wentthere with her, she bought a pair of earrings which came to eight shillings, she then went home- she afterwards asked me to go to tea with her sister, and on Sunday the 12th of May she came to my house, and came into the bed-room with a small bundle in her hand, which she placed on the table and asked me if I was ready - she said she had purchased two flannel waistcoats for her father; who was much troubled with the rheumatism, and she had given five shillings a piece for them- a little before four o'clock she lifted up the waistcoats, and took a small bit of paper from under them, which contained a sovereign and one shilling and sixpence - she asked me to put it into my purse, as she had neither pocket nor purse, which I did, and a little before four o'clock, we left my house and walked as far as Shoreditch Church- she then said she would ride, and she asked a coachman what he would take her to Parker-street, Drury-lane for - he said, three shillings and sixpence - we got in and went there to her father's - and in the evening we went to her sister's - between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, she engaged a cab and returned to Ball's-pond turnpike, it came to two shillings and sixpence - I gave her the sovereign at her father's; she paid for the coach and gave me the remainder of the change to take care of till we returned home - this was on the 12th, and on the 13th she came to my house at half-past two o'clock, and said, she wanted change for a £10 note for her mistress - I had seen her mistress twice - I took the note out of her hand, and said, I did not think I could get change, but I would send and see; I sent my servant to the barn, and told her the young woman at No. 9, Brunswick-place wanted change - the girl returned in about ten minutes, and gave the change to the prisoner - I did not have it, but I saw gold on the back parlour mantel-piece; the prisoner then asked me if I would go with her to have a tooth drawn, I said no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then I suppose on the 13th you went to Mr. Lucas? A. Yes, I went every day, generally in the morning, but sometimes I call in an afternoon - I supplied milk every day till Mr. Lucas dismissed me, in consequence of the note being changed at my house - I did not tell Mr. Lucas on the 13th what had been done, because I did not know but it was for her mistress - I had no suspicion - I did not know Mrs. Lucas was a weak woman - I believed the prisoner brought it from her because she said so - I had supplied the house with milk before Mr. Lucas came to it - the earrings were a low price I thought - I did not see the flannel waistcoats.</p>

            . I am servant to the last witness - I remember the prisoner coming to her house on the 13th of May, and asking my mistress to get change for a £10 note for her mistress - I was standing by at the time; my mistress told her she did not think she could, but she would send and see - she gave the note into my hand to go to the barn - I went there and saw my master - I said "The servant at No. 9, is come for change for a £10 note" - my master took it into the barn, but did not get change there - we then went to the King's Arms - I waited outside, and he went in - when he came out of Mrs. Wicks's, he gave me nine sovereigns and two half sovereigns, and I went back and gave them to the prisoner - she went into my mistress's backroom, and said to my mistress "Will you mind this?" my mistress said "No, mind it yourself" - the prisoner then said"I will throw it down here on the floor" - I made answer"Don't throw it down, put it on the mantel-piece" - she then put nine sovereigns and a half on the mantel-piece and took a half sovereign away - my mistress did not hear her say this as she was in an agitation, because master was not come in from the barn - it was a quarter after three, and they always go before three with the milk - the prisoner then asked my mistress to go with her to have a tooth drawn -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040040"/>she said she did not like to see any one's tooth drawn, and then she asked her to let me go - and I went - she had the tooth drawn, and paid a shilling and changed the half sovereign - we then went to a large comb-shop facing the Bull at Kingsland, where she bought a purse for one shilling and sixpence, a pair of snaps for five shillings, and a comb, and she had not money enough to pay for them, as she had bought a hair brush and two side combs at Mr. Rogers, where she had her tooth drawn - she then sent me to my mistress for half a sovereign more - I went home, and my mistress gave me the nine sovereigns and a half, and said, "Take that and give it into Mary's hand for I don't like to have any one's money but my own" - I went and gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had not often seen £10 notes? A. No, I never saw one before - I should not know the note again - I lost sight of it. I have heard my mistress say, she thought this was Mrs. Lucas's note, and I heard the prisoner ask my mistress to take care of the money because she was going to have the tooth drawn, and when I went back I found the money on the shelf - it did not strike my mistress to go to Mr. Lucas- she was all in an agitation - my mistress was in the shop when the prisoner said, if she did not take the money she would throw it on the floor - my mistress could not hear her very well, but I told my mistress what she had said - I did not go to Mr.

               <p>COURT. Q. You say you thought this note was Mrs. Lucas's, but you saw the prisoner change one half sovereign and then another half sovereign? A. Yes, and I told my mistress of it - I cannot say what my mistress said - the prisoner did not tell me to say nothing about it - I heard on the Sunday that Mr. Lucas had lost his notes; when my mistress went to the house with the milk, and then Mr. Lucas came to our house, and said, My servant has run away and taken two £10 notes, my mistress said "She brought one here for her mistress," and told him where it was changed.</p>

I left nobody in the house (I am rather shy of answering questions, as I believe the other party who was in the house, is in Court, and he will avail himself of what I say, as he had been hovering about the house) I left the door fastened, the street door was locked, and I had the key in my pocket. I left all my property perfectly secure - I returned just about one o'clock in the morning, and found the street door shut, but I have a door at the foot of my stairs very strongly secured by a patent lock, and I found that door split all to pieces. The street door was on the latch just as I had left it, but the inner door was broken - I heard some persons moving up stairs; I immediately went out of the street door - there were two crow-bars by the side of the door. I went out and met only one person in the street (that was Cohen), I said to him, There are housebreakers in my house, will you go in with me; he said, He did not like; I asked him to remain by the street door to seize anybody if they escaped, while I got a policeman, he said, he would. I went about twenty yards round the corner, got a policeman, and when I came back, I found the prisoner in the hands of Cohen struggling; I saw nobody else - he was secured. I went up stairs with the two policemen, and found everything overturned. On the first floor they had broken a box containing women's apparel, and all the things were piled up on the floor ready to be carried away, and two or three portmantua's were put ready to be taken away. A sword had been brought down stairs and laid in the passage - articles to a considerable amount had been moved; the property stated in the indictment was part of it - the party had entered by a false key, and two days before, I found a broken skeleton key in the latch.</p>

I was on duty - I had passed the house ten minutes before - the door was then shut; I afterwards went there, just as the prisoner was apprehended; I found on him a knife, a cord, and pocket handkerchief; the inner door of the house was broken to pieces - that had a Bramah's lock on it.</p>

On Monday, the 24th of June, I was called by the parish beadle to see a child, which was in his possession in the dead-house of the work-house - It appeared to me not to have been born a great many hours; it was a very fine, healthy looking, well formed grown child; when I examined it I found the navel string twisted three different times about its neck; the face of the infant was very much swollen and suffused, and of a very dark livid appearance - the impression of my mind was that the child had breathed, but had been strangled by the navel string; I examined it minutely, externally, and found no marks of violence about the body whatever; the lungs were taken out by another gentleman, which I saw, they floated on water which they were put into it; the lungs were in an extremely healthy state; it was my impression that the child had breathed - it often happens in the birth that the navel string gets round the neck; the navel string was not torn at all, it was merely separated; that is not an uncommon thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in the appearance of it to lead you to form an opinion that the child had not come by its death naturally in the birth? A. No; I considered that the head or some part of it had been born, so as to admit of its breathing, but before its birth was completed, it certainly might have been strangled in the birth by accident.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Denmark-street, St. Giles's. I am a midwife - I was present when Mr. Burgess examined the prisoner, on Friday the 29th of June - she told the surgeon that she had occasion to go to the water-closet, and the child was accidentally born in the privy, on the 20th - that she was very much alarmed, and perceiving no signs of life in the child, she took it up stairs, and put it into her box, and kept it there until the Sunday morning - I neither threatened nor made her any promise; it was found at some house in St. Giles's, in a water-closet- not in the house she was delivered in; she did not say whether anybody was with her when she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. In what state was she in then? A. She had the appearance of a woman who had been delivered eight or nine days, and was recovering from it; she was in a very weak state - she was told by Mr. Burgess and myself that she need not answer any questions, unless she liked, and we requested nobody should ask her any questions after we had examined her; I knew nothing of her before - she said she was not aware of what was going to take place when the child was born; I have every reason to believe it was her first child; I have known several cases of women being involuntary delivered without knowing it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you know me? A. I never saw you before; I know you by your countenance; I knew you from the other soldier, because you struck me with the bayonet - I saw you strike me with something you had in your hand - I never lifted my hand to you, nor gave you any blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Wood give the soldier any blow? A. No; we found the key of the door on the ledge of the window, when we came back from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you hold the prisoner? A. Yes; I never left him - the other soldier was very civil and persuaded him not to do it - I should not know the other soldier; I am sure the prisoner is the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You know you live in a street where prostitutes of the lowest kind live - what do you do for your livelihood? A. By selling fruit in the street; a great many unfortunate girls live there, I believe.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say, You know the bayonet was the instrument you were struck with - and before said, You could not see the instrument? A. I did not know what he struck me with, till they showed it me at the watch-house - when he drew it I did not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She struck me when she came out, and accused me of having the key. Witness. I did not strike him, nor lay my hand to him - there was a gas lamp facing me at the other corner, it was darkish - he struck me so that I was not able to stand the first time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You did not fall? A. No; I followed you afterwards - it is not customary to leave the key of the door outside; we had not come in many minutes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you think you would not have admitted me, if you had thought I had plenty of money? A. I don't know about that - a young woman found the key outside - the prisoner was close by the shutter when he struck me - he was in regimentals, and had a belt on, and I saw him draw out something from behind him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She swore at Queen's-square I was taken into custody by a serjeant, and now says it was a corporal. Witness. I did not swear it was a serjeant; I think not; I don't know a serjeant from a corporal; they told me before the magistrates it was a corporal.</p>

            . On the evening of the 3rd of June, I was with the prosecutrix at my house in Pye-street shelling peas; two soldiers came up, and wanted to come in; I shut the door, and said, No soldier's girls lived there - the key was outside the door, one of them took it out; I went out, and asked them for it, and so did she; they refused to give it me; I said if they did not, I would give them in charge of a policeman - I saw the prisoner draw his bayonet out, and he attempted to stab me with it - my door was open, I ran in, and the bayonet caught against the wall - I am certain I saw him draw it - I did not strike him, nor did I see Andrews strike him - Andrews said, "Let him do it, he must not do it with that;" and then he turned round, and hit her with it on the left side of her head - I saw him strike her with the bayonet - she was outside, opposite my door, in the street - there was not day-light enough to see, but my door was open, and I had a candle, and there was a lamp on the other side of the way - I was so frightened, after I saw him strike her, that I ran in doors, and did not see him strike her again; I saw him attempt it - she asked me to call a policeman, I went and saw one, but he would not interfere as he said he did not see it - I saw the prisoner in the custody of a corporal afterwards - I had never seen him before - I can't say which end he had hold of the bayonet when he struck Andrews; he had hold of the thick end when he struck at me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the prosecutrix, when she came out of the door, strike me? A. I did not see it - I know you from the other soldier, because we never left your company after you hit her; she followed you, and I followed you to the corner of the street - the other soldier did not go with you all the way; I saw the other soldier go another way - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did they knock at your door? A. No, the door was half open; neither open nor shut; they did not come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you know Simmon's-buildings? A. Yes, some of the houses are occupied by prostitutes - my husband gets a livelihood for me - I have been in the habit of selling things in the street - my husband is a hackney-coachman - Andrews lives at No. 16, in the street - the soldier was in liquor.</p>

            . I live in the neighbourhood of Pye-street. On the 3rd of June, I was standing in the street, about eleven doors from Wood's house; I heard Andrews ask several times for a key; I ran there directly, and saw nobody there but the two soldiers; the prisoner was one of them - the prisoner said he had not got it, as well as the other; both denied it - the prisoner said, if she accused him of taking it, and would not let him go, he would soon make her - she had not hold of him; she did not strike him - the prisoner turned round, and both the soldiers wanted to go towards Duck-lane - Andrews said she would give them in charge - the prisoner then drew his bayonet, and made a severe stroke with it at

             on the night in question, and found a bruised cut on the side of her head - the point of the instrument had struck her head; there was a cortused wound, the muscle was very slightly divided, but the point of the instrument had penetrated through the integuments - the wound was about an inch in in length; I am sure the muscle was divided - it was a slight wound except that part where some instrument had penetrated to the bone; the scalp was not laid bare, but the bone had been touched by the point of the instrument - it appears to have been struck vertically; the depth increased as the point descended - it could not have been done by the butt end of the bayonet nor by the side, it had been inflicted by the point of the the bayonet; the wound was not dangerous - a wound inflicted by a bayonet cutting in that way, would not be likely to endanger life unless it penetrated the skull, which it might have done, if struck with his holding the butt end of the bayonet, and struck downwards - there would have been no danger unless it had penetrated the skull - I examined her hand, and found a wound which must have been cut by the sharp end of the bayonet, not with the point but with the edge - it had been done with one of the sharp edges; it might have happened by her defending a blow which he was making with the butt end of the bayonet, it was a cut - there was no danger from that wound; I think the wound in her head must have been inflicted by holding the bayonet with the butt end.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say the wound on the head was a bruise, and inflicted with the point, how could the point of the bayonet bruise? A. The point of the bayonet would enter the integuments, not as if he was stabbing, but as if he was sticking the side of the bayonet against the head - the bayonet is triangular, it was a wound inflicted by a blow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That is not the way a person would have inflicted a wound if he intended to destroy life? A. No, it was a sort of blow, making a contused wound with the back part of the bayonet, and as the point of the bayonet descended through the integuments, it left a cut.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had intended to destroy life, or do her grievous bodily harm, he would have struck or stabbed with the bayonet? A. Undoubtedly.</p>

            . I am a traveller to a wholesale house in the city. On the 15th of June I came up Heath-street, into the Commercial-road, and saw three suspicious characters looking about; I took particular notice of their transactions; the prisoner was one of them - I never saw either of them before to my knowledge - I passed them, and on turning round, saw the prisoner cross the road, and go immediately to the side or private door of Mr. Levy's house; seeing the name of "Levy, silversmith and jeweller," over the shop window, I anticipated that they had gone to the synagogue, it being their Sabbath - not seeing a policeman on duty, I immediately went to the office in Arbour-square; the person who answered me at the office-door, wished me to apply opposite, which I did, and two policemen came out; I wished them to put on private clothes, they did so, and immediately followed me into the Commercial-road - before we got to the shop of Mr. Armstrong, which is nearly opposite Mr. Levy's, we passed by one of the men that I supposed to be on the look out; it was one of those who had been walking with the prisoner; I pointed him out to the officer - I and the policeman went into Armstrong's shop, and while watching there, the third person passed me, and I pointed him out also - we were not in the shop more than three or five minutes before we saw the prisoner come out of Levy's shop-door - I said that was the man; we were then in Armstrong's shop - the policeman immediately went over and secured him - I saw the prisoner go back with the policeman to the shop-door, and finding it fastened as I supposed, he took the prisoner to the private door and knocked - I saw the servant girl open the door to them; what conversation passed I cannot say, but I saw the girl close the door in their faces as if frightened, and immediately the policeman brought the prisoner across the road into Armstrong's shop where I remained - he searched the prisoner, and found the whole of the property on him, with five skeleton keys, and one picklock; he was immediately taken to the station-house in Whitechapel-road.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I went with Selth to Armstrong's shop, which is opposite Levy's nearly - while we were there I saw the prisoner come out of Levy's shop - I saw the door open when he came out, and he closed it too - I then went over and secured him - I endeavoured to take him into Levy's shop; I knocked at the shop door, and the prisoner told me to knock at the private door; I went to the private door, and a servant came; I asked her if the prisoner had just come out of there; she did not seem exactly to understand me, and being in private clothes, she slammed the door too - before I took him to the door, I asked him if he had just come out of Mr. Levy's; he said Yes, he had just been speaking to Levy; I said he must go back and see - we could not get in at the shop door and went to the side door - I did not knock very loud, and he said, "knock louder, the servant is up stairs, she won't hear" - when she came down, and I made inquiry, she appeared alarmed, and slammed the door in my face - I took the prisoner over to Armstrong's shop and searched him; I pulled off his hat and found that full of various him; I pulled off his hat and found that full of various articles; a silver milk-jug, silver boxes and thimbles, which I have here; I have had possession of them ever since - I went to Leadenhall-street; Levy came back with me to where I live and saw them - I have here a silver milk-jug, seven negligees, two spoons, twenty scent-boxes, twenty-eight brooches, seven coral necklaces, eight silver caddy spoons, and various other articles - I found five skeleton keys on him, and one picklock; one of them opens the private door, and a small one a passage door leading from the passage into the parlour; and the one which opens the private door, also opens the shop door leading into the street - the name of the parish is St. Dunstan, Stebonheath, alias Stepney.</p>

            ; it was Sunday night; I had a pint of porter there; I had two half-crowns in my pocket; I saw the prisoner there; I did not know him before; he was in company with some men and women; he did not join our party; he put his hand into my left hand trousers pocket while I was there; I felt him do it, and caught hold of the collar of his coat, he struck me and knocked me down, and jumped on me and four or five others; he had not taken the money from my pockets at that time; the half-crowns were in the pocket in which I felt his hand; I put my hand into my pocket and felt them there about three minutes before; my pocket was not buttoned; there was nothing else in it; I was knocked down after catching hold of his hand; and after I got up, I was looking for my my shoes, and two policemen came up; I felt in my pocket after I found my shoes, after the prisoner was gone- I found my money was gone then; I did not give the prisoner in charge for the robbery at the time - I charged him with an assault; I did not know my money was gone when I gave him in charge - I was looking after my shoes at the time - I found my money was gone three or four minutes after the policeman had gone, I went down to the station-house thinking he was in charge, and he was not; I gave information at the station-house of the robbery, and he was taken the Saturday following; they could not find him before; I had only one pint of porter that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. On your oath had you only one pint of porter? A. Only one pint the whole of the day; I was quite sober at the time; Moss saw me with two half-crowns that day; I mentioned my loss about five minutes after the policeman was gone; I told the two witnesses of it; I did not say it openly in the room; the people in the room did not hear that; we looked for the prisoner at all the public houses round the neighbourhood; I don't know where he lives on my oath- he does not live in the same street with me,; I live in Foster's-buildings; I had never seen him before I found him on Sunday after, at the Spread eagle, and he was taken to the station-house for being riotous, and I preferred my charge on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him in charge at the Spread eagle? A. I went out to the station-house directly I saw him there- it might be a minute or two; I drank with his brother before he came in; I took nothing after he came in; I said nothing to his brother about having a fall out with him, his brother said something to me about it; I cannot say what it was; he offered me the pot to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say "You and my brother have had a fall out?" A. Words to that effect; I drank with his brother that evening, but not after the prisoner came in; I did not see him come in - the half-crowns were the wages I had on Saturday night; a man in Oliver-row paid me; I cannot tell his name; I had worked for him; he is a master carpenter, and has a shop as there; I worked for him about three days; the prisoner jumped upon me and knocked me down after I found his hand in my pocket; we had no words before; I had not been mocking his Irish method of speaking; I met Moss first that evening at his own house; I went with him to the Spread eagle, and I showed him the five shillings at the Spread eagle door; he did not ask where I got it - I showed it him because I intended to take it home, and I had just enough halfpence for a pint of porter; I did not strike the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear there were only four persons in the house when you lost your money? A. I can't swear to one - I will swear there were not twelve; I saw the servant of the house there - I did not complain to her of my loss - I did not see the prisoner during the week - I did not know his brother till that evening - he said he was his brother - he had come down to me several times - I never went down to him - I was perfectly sober that evening - the floor was examined - I cannot say whether the people in the house were searched.</p>

            . I went to the Spread eagle on the Sunday in question, with the prosecutor and my daughter - just before we entered the door he put his hand into his left hand pocket, and pulled out two half-crowns, and said,"These are for my wife;" we had a pint of porter between us three - I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor - I did not see whether the prosecutor had hold of him at the time, for the prisoner was at my back, as I was standing - I was going to turn myself round to know what the blow was given for, and before I could get the word out of my mouth, I was knocked down myself by some of the party, and three or four were jumping on me - I had my face dreadfully cut - two policemen came in and took them off me, and cleared them out as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the prosecutor tell you that he had lost his money? A. Soon after I got up - the policemen were gone - they were clearing away the mob - there were about nine or ten in the house at that time, and many came afterwards - there were only two or three in the house when he told us he had lost his money, except the landlady and servant at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem surprised at finding his money gone? A. I did not take notice, for I had lost my shoes and ninepence out of my pocket - he said, "I have lost my two half-crowns;" everybody in the room might have heard it - they might have heard him at the bar - he did not say it privately - he did not whisper it to me - I went with him to the station-house, as soon as I got a pair of shoes to go- my back was towards him when he struck the prosecutor - I turned my head round and saw the blow come from him - the prosecutor stood nearly alongside of him - there had been no quarrelling before; I heard no remarks about the Irish - there might be as many women in the house as men; the prisoner's wife was not there - he is a single man - I know he lived with his mother, in Little Leonard-street, Shoreditch; I never was in the house - I know he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040048"/>lived there - I went to look for him during the week, but did not go to his house; I knew where his father lived.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prosecutor ask you if you knew where the prisoner lived? A. No; I did not know it myself; we found him at the station-house - the prisoner did not live in Shoreditch; I thought you were asking about the prosecutor - I did not know where the prisoner lived- there was a general row in the room; I believe only the prosecutor and I were knocked down; if I had had money in my pocket very likely it might have fallen out - I was not at the Spread-eagle on the night he was taken; we went to Bunhill-row station-house; I don't know how long the prosecutor had been drinking - I had been backwards and forwards - he had been at my place all the day; I did not see him have any drink.</p>

            . I was at the Spread-eagle with my father and the prosecutor - I saw the prosecutor with two half-crowns, just as we were going in at the public-house door - he had them in his hand; I don't know why he produced them - he said he was going to take them home to his mother - I saw the prisoner strike him in the public-house - I did not see the prosecutor's hand on the prisoner's coat before that - he was knocked down, and four or five jumped on him - they were the prisoner's friends; I can't say whether the prisoner himself jumped on him - it was done in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it was the prisoner's friends? A. Because they were all drinking together - I can't say how many women were among them - they were all cleared away after the scuffle, except me and my father and the prosecutor - when the prosecutor missed his money, he said "I have lost my money out of my pocket;" he said it publicly, not very loud - he said it so that anybody could hear him, but there was nobody else in the room, except the landlady - I heard him tell the landlady that he had missed two half-crowns out of his pocket, he said so to the person in the bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he complain of being robbed of them or losing them? A. He said he had lost them out of his pocket.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and a shoe-maker. I was at the Spread-eagle on the 12th of May, there was a row there - The prosecutor came in after the prisoner, he was drunk to my knowledge; he was cross in the house and insulting everybody, and insulted the prisoner's wife - he offered her some beer and made free with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by making free, did he do more than offer her beer? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did he say anything to the prisoner? A. Yes; as the prisoner was going home out of the public-house, he called on a man named Mike, to come home, and with that the prosecutor took him out, and the prisoner turned in and put his fist in his mouth, and said, if he came out again, he would make him kiss his fist; with that the prosecutor raised his first and struck the prisoner, and so the row began, and then there was a regular row.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner said he would make the prosecutor kiss his fist? A. Yes; the prosecutor struck the prisoner directly, and cut him in the nose.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. That was after he made free with his wife? A. Yes; then the row began directly, and the policeman cleared them all away - I was there on the Sunday week after, and the prisoner was with me, we went in together - the prosecutor was in before us; another witness came in with us and called for a pint of beer, I said, "You are the man that had the row with my brother;" he said, Yes, "Well, said he, if you fell out with him, I will fall in with you;" and they had a pint of beer and drank, and we all three drank out of one pot - he made no charge of robbery at that time; we remained together about an hour I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You staid an hour in company with each other drinking together? A. Yes; he did not say a word about his having lost five shillings at that time - he made that charge on the Monday; my brother (the prisoner) was taken by a policeman and locked up, and on the Monday morning he went and gave charge against him for felony - my brother was locked up about nine o'clock on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge then? A. A policeman was shoving my sister, and he gave him a tip on the umbrella on the back - on that Sunday no charge was made about taking the five shillings.</p>

             - they are no relations of mine whatever; I knew the prisoner before - I saw the prisoner first on this evening in the Lower-road, Islington, before I got to Newington; I was in company with the ladies at that time - he did not speak to us the first time I saw him; I saw him afterwards in the road near the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040049"/>Ball's-pond-road - he was then standing at the bottom of Green-man's-passage - he walked towards me and the ladies - we were on the left-hand side of the road; he kept on the right-hand side - we kept walking on the left side and he on the opposite; he walked up till he got, I should think, rather behind us - he then ran across the road towards us, and he struck Miss Harriet Clark (who was walking on my right-hand side) a blow - I turned round to look at him, and felt Miss Clark pressed close against my side, I then saw something bright flash in the air, and I saw the prisoner with his arms extended striking at Miss Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw something flash in the air, had any one hold of that bright thing? A. The prisoner; and when I saw him striking Miss Clark, I rushed at him (I saw him striking her, I then rushed at him), and don't know whether I struck him or laid hold of his collar.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you struck him, or laid hold of his collar, had he desisted his attack upon Miss Clark? A. I cannot say, for I laid hold of him directly - I got between the two ladies; he had a knife in his hand then - it was a large dinner knife - I cannot say that he struck Miss Clark with the knife - I saw him striking at her, but don't know whether he struck her with the knife or not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing when you flew upon him, and took him by the collar, or struck him? A. I think he was standing close to her; we were all close together - I flew at him from seeing him strike Miss Clark; while I had hold of his collar he struck me twice on the head with this knife - I did not see whether there was any blood on Miss Clark at that time; I had seen something bright in his hand before, which I now conjecture to have been a knife - he had not said a word to Miss Clark - he struck me on the forehead with the knife - it was done with the open blade of the knife - it went through my hat into my head (producing the hat) - it cut my forehead - it went into the skull I believe; I was attended by a surgeon - the first blow cut my hat through, and he repeated the blow, and struck me nearly on the same place, and the knife broke at the second blow, that blow also cut my hat, both blows took effect on my forehead, that blow also cut through the flesh, and the knife broke, and part of it he kept in his hand, and part flew on the pavement; I had my hand on the prisoner's collar at this time - the blows confused me - I cannot say whether I had hold of him or not - I was attempting to lay hold of him; the remainder of the broken knife continued in the prisoner's hand; we were both struggling very violently, and he attempted to cut me with it - he struck me on the collar of my coat several times; I cannot say what part he intended the blow for, but that took effect on my coat - I succeeded in throwing him down, and fell on him; he threw me off, and then got up and ran away; I pursued him, and eventually gave him in the custody of the police - I never had any quarrel with the prisoner at any time - I think he would not have struck me, if I had not rushed on him to defend Miss Clark.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He did not attempt to touch you, till you made a rush on him? A. I don't think he had; I don't think he would have attempted to hurt me, if I had not rushed forward to defend Miss Clark - I never had any quarrel with him - the rush I made at him was a very violent one; I was agitated at seeing the young lady in this way.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not undertake to swear, whether, at the the time you made the rush, he might not at that time have desisted on any aggression on Miss Clark? A. He might have done so - my face was exposed - I had my hat on; I had another wound in my head, but I think that was got in turning me round on the ground.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he his face towards Miss Clark at the time you flew at him? A. I think he had; I flew at him the moment I could; he had not thrown away the instrument at the time - he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your inducement to rush forwards? A. To protect Miss Clark from being assaulted by him again.</p>
               <p>HARRIETT CLARK. Mr. Clark was walking with me on the 6th of June? I had first seen the prisoner that night in the Lower-road, Islington - I live in Ball's-pond-road; I was with Mr. Clark when I first saw the prisoner; I have known the prisoner for two years; I did not speak to him when I first saw him in the Lower-road, - I was not near him, I saw him at a distance; I walked on with Mr. Clark to the road he has described; I saw the prisoner there; he was before us about twenty yards, on the opposite side of the way - it is quite a narrow road - I saw him standing still at first; I then saw him walking towards us at the end of this narrow passage on Ball's-pond-road; I then looked a contrary way from him - I was still with Mr. Clark and my sister; I turned my head away from the prisoner; I did not see anything more of him; I felt a blow on my head - I was close to Mr. Clark at the time, walking with my arm in his, and my sister - he only gave me one blow on the head; it was on my right ear - I did not see anything in his hand; I did not see him when I received the blow - I turned round on receiving the blow, and saw him standing behind me - I did not see anything in his hand - I received one or two other blows but I was so confused I could not tell where at the time - Mr. Clark got away from me after I had received these two or three blows; Mr. Clark then rushed upon him violently, being in a passion, seeing the treatment I received - I did not see any thing in the prisoner's hand at any time - my ear was only bruised with the blow; I should say it was given with the prisoner's fist - I soon perceived that I had a cut on my shoulder - that was before Mr. Clark interfered - after Mr. Clark rushed on the prisoner, a scuffle ensued, and I saw them on the ground, but I was so much terrified I did not see anything more then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you state you had received whatever injury you received at all, before the interference of Mr. Clark? A. Yes; I saw the prisoner at the time Mr. Clark made the rush at him, but the evening was dark; he was at that time standing quiet - the bruise on my ear was likely to be inflicted with his hand; the wound on my shoulder was very slight indeed; it could not be inflicted with any very great violence; I had on a thin dress, and a very thin shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner appeared very much excited? A. I don't know; I was very much confused indeed - I have known him two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is he? A. He has been brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040050"/>up to the sea - I had had no quarrel with him, rather an unpleasantness, but not a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you account for his striking you in this way from anything which had passed between you? A. He had wished to pay his addresses to me and I objected.</p>

             is the landlord, and lives in the house - I rent my room of him - on Whit Sunday I left my room to go into the country - I left my room door locked, and took the key with me - the prisoners at that time lived there; I returned on Friday, the 30th - I found my room locked; I discovered a band of my gown lying on the floor before I had been in the room ten minutes, and I missed various articles. I have recovered nothing but a piece of silk; I missed six silver tea-spoons, some brooches, a pair of sugar-tongs, two sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, twelve shillings in silver, one South-sea shilling, a fourpenny piece, a penny silver piece, and other articles - the prisoners were not living in the house when I returned; I lost a piece of silk which I have got back, it was in my drawer when I left the room (looking at it) this is mine, and this part of a necklace is mine, and this pin; they have been in Prendergrass' possession - I saw them in my drawer on the Saturday night - I had bought the silk for a bonnet, there was a yard and a half of it. The beads and pin were made a present of to me by a lady some years ago - I bought the silk of Harriett Jessup.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. And where did she get it from? A. She had it from the female prisoner, I heard her say so; the street door is left open at times; I don't know the name of this silk, it is a common colour - I know it is mine by the length, which is a yard and a half, and here is a piece of a pattern of it - this piece was cut off to make it even, on the Friday before I went out - I dont know it by anything else; I never saw Mrs. Jessup with any more of this silk - I don't know anything about any other part of the silk - I never saw any of the silk in the prisoners possession I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you and Mrs. Jessup and the female prisoner, have not all been together, when she has been in possession of a great deal more of the same silk? A. No;

             is the landlord of the house; I don't know that the outer door of the house was left open; I never saw it open particularly more one day than another - it is not usually left open - it was usually kept shut, and anybody who wants to enter, knocks - I had gone away on the Sunday and returned on the Friday - the prisoners were in the house when I left - they were in their own room; the landlord was living in the back parlour at the time; there is no entrance to my part of the house without going in at his door.</p>

            . I belong to the Lambeth-street Police Office. I know the prisoners - I went to Newcastle-court, Strand, on Wednesday the 5th of June, in consequence of information of Willis, and another being there,(a female) I found them there - the prisoner is the female; it is a common brothel - I knocked at the room door - I did not see the man then, for he refused admittance; I descended down the next flight of stairs, and saw him at the window; I asked his name, he said Hutton; I went up stairs again, and threatened to use violence at the door, and then he let me in - the female prisoner was in bed; I found this yard and a half of silk, some pearl beads, and part of a gold pin in a chest of drawers among their other wearing apparel - I brought them away with all the other things; I produce the beads and gold pin, as well as the silk, they have never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the part of the pin in a state capable of being identified? A. I should think not - nothing is more common than these beads.</p>

            . I am the wife of Joseph Jessup. Allen lived at our house, and so did the two prisoners; they are not man and wife, but lived together; Mrs. Willis owned he was not her husband; they left the house on the 29th of May; I did not see them when they left; they had paid their rent on the Sunday, and I did not know they were going till after they were gone - nor where they were going to - I know this silk - I first saw it about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040051"/>24th of April; I saw it in possession of the female prisoner, she brought it down to me; I had made her a dress of the same colour, and had that instead of money; and I sold it to Allen on the 25th of May - I have a piece of the same sort here, which I cut off before I sold it to Allen; I cut it off to make it even, a yard and a half - this is it, and here is the piece I cut off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the habit of acquaintance and friendship with Mrs. Willis or Jones? A. No otherwise than as a lodger - I first saw the silk about the 24th of April, she brought it down to me - Allen was not with me - the silk was in a whole piece then; Allen did not see it in the whole piece; she knew the prisoner had a dress like it, and she heard me mention that the prisoner had a whole piece; she never saw it, not to my recollection, but I am not sure - my husband is a carpenter, I am a dress maker, but don't follow the business; I made the dress for Mrs. Willis; I did not ask where she got the silk; she told me her husband had taken it out of pawn - I did not think it an odd way of paying me - she left quite on a sudden, without my knowledge - nothing was lost in the house before they came there, I am sure - I was never charged with taking other people's wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JESSUP. I am landlord of the house. Allen went out on Sunday the 26th of May, and returned on the Friday about six o'clock in the evening; and about five minutes after she called my wife up, and we found she was robbed - the prisoners had gone on the Wednesday - I tried all the keys belonging to the locks in the house, and found the key of the prisoners' room-door would open Allen's door, but no other key would do it - I had seen about a yard and a half of silk the week before Whit-Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Have you ever said you would try to get the prisoners transported for fourteen years? A. Not to the best of my knowledge, I will not swear positively.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you name the customer do you mean Mr. Underwood's servant? A. Yes; I did not see sixpence in change given to anybody; I was present when he came for the dozen candles; I saw the prisoner put the money into the till, and his hand came out empty; the other customer had some halfpence change to receive, and at that time he took something out with his two fingers, and put it into his left hand coat pocket; I answered at the Mansion-house to what was asked of me - I was going to state more, but was stopped.</p>

I don't think I did, but I will swear he did say so; the fact is the Lord Mayor was in a great hurry that day; he saw enough to send the case before a Jury; I don't come here having vindictive feelings; I cannot say that any of my witnesses stated before the Lord Mayor that he asked my forgiveness, but he did ask forgiveness; I cannot tell you why I did not tell the Lord Mayor that he asked my forgiveness- I swear he did ask forgiveness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell the Lord Mayor, he produced the half-crown and silver, and said it was yours? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you added to it that he begged your forgiveness, you will not say? A. No, the Lord Mayor committed the prisoner on the depositions; I have not come here with any design to hold back any truth or word in the case; I never had any quarrel with the prisoner; I never had the least reason to suspect him till within twelve months.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JAMES HOWARD. Q. Did you say one word to the Lord Mayor about the prisoner asking forgiveness? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was your examination very short, and the Lord Mayor merely took your name as a witness? A. That was all.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say you saw the prisoner put the money into the till, and take his hand out open; might he before he put the money into the till have taken the sixpence out, and placed it on the counter? A. The till was open before he put the money in, but I did not see him give the sixpence out; he was talking to the person who came for the candles; I saw his hand come out open when he put the money in; he did not take the sixpence out, at the time he put the money in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you consider he had an opportunity of taking change from the till? A. The till was open before he put the money into it; he had time enough to take change from the till during the transaction; I only looked when the money chinked, he had time to take it from the till before he put the money in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to state I am a married man and have one child; I have been in the prosecutor's employ twelve years, seven as an apprentice. I worked with him day and night to the great injury of my health and constitution. The character Mr. Hale gave me at the Tallow Chandler's Hall at the time I was admitted, was most capital, and I have endeavoured to preserve that character up to the present time; I was never in any company, either vicious or base. I beg to state with respect to the half-crown, that it was my own property: I served Wreedon with the candles to the amount of six shillings; I put the money into the till, six shillings and sixpence; there was twenty or twenty-five shillings in the till, but neither half-crown nor sixpence; there was about fourpence in copper, but not sufficient; I had money in my pocket which I always have, having never been without it since I have been in his employ. I gave the witness sixpence out of my own pocket, I put two shillings into the till with the same hand, having hold of the handle of the till; I took the half-crown out and put it into my waistcoat pocket; I wrote the bill and receipt. I deny serving a customer at all from whom I received one shilling; I bought some fat of a woman and gave one shilling and a penny for it. As to what Howard states, I would not take his oath, he is a man who don't revere an oath. I went then about my ordinary employment, and in twenty minutes or half-an-hour Mr. Hale called me into the parlour, and asked if I had a half-crown; I produced my money, and half-a-crown among it; he said none of that was his own: I left my silver on his desk. I was astonished at his behaviour, for I believed he would trust me with hundreds. He said "Have you not another half-crown?" I said "Yes, I have one in my waistcoat pocket," and produced it from there: he said it was his; he looked at it and sent for an officer. I said "Consider what you are about, Sir." As to saying forgive me, it was the last thing in my thoughts. I was taken to the watch-house, and asked to see Mr. Hale, but was not allowed. It is not likely I should rob a master who I looked up to as a parent; I served him as if I was his son. I had received £6 from my friends the previous week, and never was without £5 or £10 while in his employ. I certainly had 28s. a week, but for nights and days together, never had my clothes off, attending to his business. I made his interest my own, and took his advice in every step in my life. I trust the character you will receive of me from respectable witnesses, will convince you I am not in a condition to do such an act. In consequence of having been so long in his service, I trust you will give me the benefit if any doubt arise. Gentlemen, I feel more acutely the situation I am placed in, in consequence of an aged parent.</p>

On the night of the 1st of June, I heard the cry of Stop thief; I went towards No. 75, Fetter-lane, and looked down the area grating, and perceived a handkerchief - I got it up, and the prosecutor claimed it; I did not see the prisoner till I got to the watch-house - No. 75 is on the right hand side, about two doors from Holborn.</p>
               <p>JOHN GLENTON ATKINSON. I stopped him, I should think, six, or seven, or eight doors down Holborn, on the right hand side going from Holborn.</p>

             (police-constable G 28). I produce a certificate of the prisoner's former conviction, which I got from the office of the Clerk of the Indictments here - I know the prisoner, and was present in April, 1832, when he was tried and convicted; he is the person mentioned in the certificate - (read) - I know him to be the man; I was not a witness on the case, but I had taken him on the charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). The facts are as follow. On Saturday, the 1st of June last, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was walking in Holborn towards the City, and when near Leather-lane, and about to pass two gentlemen, one of them (the prosecutor) turned round, and feeling his pocket, accused me of taking his handkerchief; this I desied, and fearful I should be brought into trouble innocently, I attempted to make my escape and ran across the road, the prosecutor raising a cry of Stop thief, I was caught and taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the house - I had been to Walworth that afternoon - I did not see a person I expected to see - I met a friend and walked with him till half-past ten o'clock, and then went to the ladies' house and took a lodging for the night; I got up at seven o'clock in the morning - the landlady asked me to stop, to see that everything was right - I stopped - she desired the servant to go up stairs - the landlady desired me not to lock the room-door that night, as she expected somebody to come there that night; I put a few half-pence and a sixpence under my pillow, and forgot my purse in the morning; I said I forgotten something, and went up and took it from the pillow; the young woman was in the room two or three minutes; I took the purse from the pillow; she said the sheet was missing, and it was between the two beds, I took it and gave it into her hand; they pushed me in the room; I did not know what charge they might bring against me, and got out of window to go to somebody to hear the right of the story.</p>
               <p>MRS. TOMLIN. No purse was found.</p>

               <p>GEORGE LOCK. I searched him - he had a purse with fivepence halfpenny in copper and a silver sixpence.</p>

No; I never saw him till he pawned them; I never said he came there intoxicated on the Saturday previous, and I had told him if he did not go out I would kick him out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you perceive anything in the sack when I came out? A. I was not in the shop when you came out - you had a sack on your shoulder; a little boy unlocked the gate to let him in.</p>

I have done wrong, I know I have done wrong, but I did not pawn it" - she was rather tipsy - I saw something shine in her hand, which I thought was the watch, but I found in her hand four half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence - she said "I did not pawn it, Matthews pawned it" - I went and got the watch, and took Matthews.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are not quite sure they are the women? A. Yes, they are the women - I was not very drunk when I got to the Leopard - I was middling - I don't justly know where I met Smith, but we went to the Leopard together, and we went there again in the morning; we had not drank anything till we got there - I think I had half a pint of beer there - I did not sup the night before with these women, and have fish for supper - I did not give Thomas my money to take care of for me.</p>

My mother takes in washing - I go to fetch the dirty linen, and take the things home to the customers, and receive the money, which I ought to take home to my mother. I have given the prisoner a great many half crowns - I gave them to him because he persuaded me to do so; I remember the month of December, it is six months ago - I gave him some then, he told me he wanted to go to the country to see his father and mother, and when he came back, he would return it to me. I told him it was my mother's money, and we wanted it at home; when I went home I told my mother I had no money - I gave him a shirt in December - I did not give it to him, he took it out of my bundle and said it would just do for him to wear; I said it was too large for him; he said if it was he would pledge it. I asked what pledging was, he said, "Taking it to the shops where you see watches hanging in the window, come here, and I will show you one;" he took it to Mr. Harris's, pawned it for four shillings and kept the money - he used to meet me when I went out with my mothers' linen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are nearly as old as he is? A. He is older than I am, Sir; he took the shirt from me against my will, I am sure of that - the money had never been in my mother's possession at all; I went to the pawnbroker's with him and stood outside, while he went in and pawned the shirt - I wanted to get it from him, he stole it from me against my will; I did not want him to take it, nor give him leave to take it - I did not tell my mother of it when I went home, for fear she should beat me - he took the half-crowns from me against my will.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he have a shirt of you on the 7th of December? A. Yes Sir, and two half-crowns; I did not give them to him; he would not let me pass - he never took any liberties with me.</p>

               <p>SARAH HICKIN. I met the prisoner in December - I don't remember the day, but it was just by Hoxton-square; I had been to Mr. Shepherd's and Mr. Tisley's that day - the prisoner took Mr. Shepherd's shirt from me - I did not give it him; he asked me to go down Hackney-road a little way with him, and he took it to Mr. Harris's shop and pawned it, I stood outside - he took the shirt from me by force - I did not call out; I don't know why I went with him and stood at the pawnbroker's door - I did not tell my mother of it, she found it out on the last day of May; the prisoner had asked me if my mother had missed the shirt; I told him no; when she did find it out, I told her a woman took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate "He asked me if I had any shirts or cravats in the bundle, and I said yes; he said, you can give me one out, your mother will not miss it - I said, she will; and he said, she will not; and I gave him a shirt." Witness. A. No Sir; I did not - they must have mistaken the word.</p>
               <p>HANNAH HICKIN. When I missed the shirts, she told me they were lost, but not in what manner - I thought she had dropt them out of the bundle.</p>

            . I don't remember the 21st of December, but I gave the prisoner some shillings - I cannot tell what day it was, but I gave them to him between whiles - I received some money of Mr. Tisley, and some of Mr. Blackmore; the prisoner stopt me on my road home, and took it away from me against my will; I did not cry out - I did not tell my mother of it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where was the money when he took it from you? A. In my right hand; there were a great many people passing, but I did not cry out - my mother asked me if I had any money, and I said no; but I told my sister if she would not tell mother, I would tell her, and I told her I gave the money to Roberts.</p>

            . I am a saw maker, and live in Golden-lane. I was not at seven o'clock that morning, and saw the prisoner running down the lane, and the prosecutrix after him, she called, stop him - I went up and saw him strike her and knock her down; she asked him for her handkerchief, he swore he had no handkerchief, and knocked her down again, and walked away, leaving her on the pavement; the policeman came up and was going to take her; the prisoner stood swearing that he had not got the handkerchief, and the prosecutrix crossed over to him, took hold of his breast, and said he had the handkerchief there, but he had not - I saw this handkerchief half way out of his pocket; I told the policeman of it, who put his hand and drew it out - the prosecutrix said it was her's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Don't you think any one else could have seen this yellow handkerchief as well as you? A. Yes, the prisoner was not sober - I cannot say he was drunk, but he was not sober; he knew what he was about, and so did the prosecutrix - she did not see the handkerchief, but she had been knocked about in that cruel manner which makes a deal of difference - the prisoner was hiding the handkerchief - I have heard the prosecutrix swear it was nine o'clock in the morning, and then she had been an hour in the wine-vaults, but it was seven.</p>

             (police-constable G 23). I came up and saw a mob, and the prosecutrix told me the prisoner had robbed her of her handkerchief; I asked if she meant to give him in charge; she kept pulling at him to give it her - I endeavoured to disperse the people; I saw the prisoner with his back against the shutter, endeavouring to get rid of the handkerchief at the back of his pocket - I asked the prosecutrix what colour her handkerchief was; she said, a yellow one torn at two corners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the last witness there? A. Yes, he came up just afterwards - whether he was there when the prosecutrix said this, I don't know - she told me three or four times that it was a yellow handkerchief - I had never seen her before - it was between seven and eight in the morning - she had her cap on when I saw her, and to black eye.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 8). I was at the station-house when the charge was brought in; I know the prosecutrix well, and have known her for some time - the prisoner denied all knowledge of the handkerchief - I asked the prosecutrix to state what charge she had against him, which she did; he then said somebody must have put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that after the handkerchief had been taken from him by the last witness, that he said, he knew nothing of it? A. Yes, he said at first he knew nothing of the handkerchief; but after hearing what the prosecutrix said, he turned round and said, somebody must have put it into his pocket - the prosecutrix sells apples about the street - I was at Worship-street when she was brought up and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not guilty of taking it, she gave it me, and a bunch of flowers, and her cap - she gave me another handkerchief, an old red one, but the officer told her to stick to one handkerchief, and she would overthrow me - she confessed that she put this handkerchief into my pocket when I was tipsy.</p>

             (City police-constable No. 86). I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had taken some work home for my master, and was going through the crowd when this gentleman took hold of me - I told him he was mistaken; and a lady said she saw a man take it, but not me - four men laid hold of me; I wanted to speak to the lady to tell her to come forward, but they would not let me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KEWNEY. A woman came and said, "What has he been doing;" I said, picking my pocket; and she went away immediately; she said nothing else - there was another person helped me to take the prisoner to the officer; and the same person came to me the next morning and wished me not to prosecute; but I believe that was the person to whom the prisoner was giving the handkerchief - I swear it was not on the ground at all; I took it from his hand.</p>

            . I was in Fleet-street on the 18th of May; this witness came to me and asked if I missed anything - I felt and missed my handkerchief - I went down Bouverie street, and in the Temple we took the prisoners and accused them of it - Saunders took off his hat and said, "I picked up this handkerchief, if it is yours, you are welcome to it."</p>
               <p>Saunders's Defence (written). I stand charged before you with felony, but which charge I can assure your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am as innocent of as a new-born infant. I was going along Fleet-street and I saw a handkerchief on the pavement; I picked it up and put it into my hat, and was proceeding down Bouverie-street, Fleet-street, when I was accosted by the officer to know whether I had not got a handkerchief. I immediately answered I had, and that I had picked it up; but I said, "If it is yours, you are welcome to it." This said to the officer. I was not aware at the time he was an officer, he having plain clothes on; but was very much alarmed when he took me into custody. As for the other prisoner, I never saw him before he was taken into custody about the time I was.</p>

I was going along Fleet-street, in the direction to St. Katherine's Docks, with the intention of endeavouring to get myself a vessel; as I was proceeding along, I saw a handkerchief laying on the pavement, I looked round, and seeing no one to own it, I picked it up, and put it in my jacket pocket; I had not had it above two minutes before a gentleman came up and laid hold of me; he took it out of my pocket, and said it was his; he then gave me into the custody of a policeman, when I said that I had picked it up, not knowing to whom it belonged.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they say they would see you down there, or past there? A. Down there, I think; they went with me - we turned down a place called Court-street - we got to the gate of Mr. Smith's distillery, and there is a lane with two dead walls there - when I got past the gate the other man on my left side came and put his arms round me, held my arms back behind me, while the prisoner who is now at the bar put his hands in my bosom, and took out my money and the paper with it; they ran away from me momently - they instantly ran away, and I at the moment fell, just for a moment; I then got up and hallooed, stop thief - they ran straight down between the two distiller's walls, towards North-street, which is at the top - I followed them, and kept crying, stop thief, till I got to North-street, I saw the prisoner three quarters of an hour or an hour afterwards at the station-house, which is Mile-end watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given a description of the persons in whose company you had been, before you saw him there? A. I met somebody who inquired what had happened to me, and I gave him a description of the persons I had been with - I am quite positive the prisoner is the man who took my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came into the public-house did you see me sitting down or standing up? A. He was sitting on a bench under the window, and came up towards me - he came up from the seat to ask me if I would buy the comb; the man who was with him, and who assisted to hold me, was sitting down in his company.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why do you say a man was in his company at that time, did you see them speak together? A. They were both together when the prisoner asked me to buy the comb, they both got up and came to me - I was perfectly sober - I had had but one pint of beer and a slice of bread and cheese before, and that was at the Cock, at Holloway.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was that coming home from Highgate? A. Yes; I had something going there in the morning - I had been there all day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the public-house you met the prisoner at, in a direct road to your own home? A. Yes; I always turn up Court-street and go to North-street, and then go through the bars - the public-house is in a direct way from Highgate - I pass it always.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you account for this being your direct way home? A. In the day-time I go the canal way, but at night I always come down the City-road and Brick-lane - I turn up Court-street always, and then go between the two walls, through the toll-bar, and cross up at the Prince Regent; I live directly opposite the Prince Regent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there not a shorter way than between the dead walls. A. I always go that way, I know no other.</p>

             (policeman K 209). I was on my beat in Collingwood-street, on Saturday night the 29th of June, between half-past twelve and one o'clock, I heard a woman's voice, crying, stop thief, in the direction of Smith's distillery- I ran towards the place, and saw two men cross North-street (from that direction) towards me - they were running nearly as fast as they could run; they turned up Wellington-street - I overtook them, and took the prisoner into custody; the other man went off - he did not run directly, but he ran again soon after - when I stopped the prisoner, he said the other was the man, and pointed him out; and when I took him back towards where I heard the cry of stop thief, he said it was an old whore that they wanted to have connection with her, that they offered her fourpence halfpenny, and she would not take it; and then they were going away home, and she ran after them, and they ran away, and she cried, stop thief - I took him to the station-house - I followed the other man with the prisoner as far as I could keep sight of him, and sprung my rattle; no one came to my assistance to apprehend him, and he escaped - the prisoner repeated what he had stated several times going down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said anything of the kind as he states to you. Witness. I am quite certain he said what I have stated, another of my brother officers heard him mention it once, but he is not here.</p>

            . I am a policeman K 92. On Saturday night, the 29th of June, between twelve and one, I was on duty in Whitechapel-road - I heard the cry of stop thief proceeding from the back, towards Mr. Smith's distillery - I made my way up Thomas-street, and saw the prosecutrix opposite, under the wall of Mr. Smith's distillery - before I went to her, I went towards two men in Court-street - the woman complained to me that she had been robbed - she was crying - she appeared sober - she was very much frightened - I could not tell whether she was sober or had been drinking; she was sober when she came to the watch-house - that was about half an hour after - she gave a description of two men who had robbed her; she said one had a fustran coat on, and light trousers, and that corresponded with the prisoner's dress when I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040069"/>him in custody about an hour after - I took a man in custody about sixty yards from the spot, in Court-street; she said, she thought that was the man, she thought it was the man who took her money - those were her words - when we got to the station-house there was more light; and she said, she thought then still that he was the man, when she first went in; but as soon as she saw the prisoner, she said, that was him - when the prisoner was brought out of the cell, she clapped her hands together, and said, "That is the man that robbed me and no other" - the man I had taken into custody was dressed in a fustian coat and light corded trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she at first said the other was the man who took her money; give us her very words? A. I asked her if she thought that was the man? she said, yes, I think it is- she said, she thought it was the man who took her money, and said so again at the watch-house - I searched the prisoner in the watch-house, and found on him two shillings in copper, a silver sixpence, and this small-tooth comb, one old long comb, and one small one, the same size as this; there were three combs in all - I searched the other man; on him I found a tobacco-box, a pipe, and about fivepence in halfpence.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Is that a new comb which you have in your hand? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He found this money about me; I had been selling some combs.</p>

             re-examined. I recollect seeing the prisoner at the watch-house, when I said he was the man he denied it at first - he said he had not seen me before - I had then said I was sure he was the man and none else; but the other man who was in custody, was very much like the man who held me - I said to the officer, "I do think he is the man who robbed me," but not that took my money - I meant, that they both robbed me, although one took my money - I meant he was the man who had assisted; and when I got to the watch-house I knew he was not the man - I did not tell the officer he had taken my money, I said he was the man who robbed me - I did not explain whether I meant that he had assisted the other, or actually taken my money - neither the prisoner, nor the man in his company, had taken any improper liberty with me whatever - I am nearly forty-five years old - I have had fifteen children and am carrying my sixteenth - I was married in 1802.</p>

             re-examined. In Court-street, the prosecutrix said, she thought he was the man who took her money - she was so much alarmed, I hardly think she knew what she said; she was more collected at the watch-house - it was nearly half an hour before we got her to the watch-house; she was better then - I heard the prisoner say he had not seen her before; he said so untill the comb was produced - I had not seen my brother officer at that time; there was nobody present who could have referred to the conversation the prisoner had had with my brother officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the wine vaults in Whitechapel-road, sitting down with a man having a pot of half-and-half; the good lady came in with two penny pieces in her hand, and her gown was hanging down to the ground - she came to us and said, "Give us some beer" - I said it was half-and-half; I said "Sit down and you shall have some" - the other man rather objected at first, but she sat down and we gave her some- she said she would pay for another pot if we let her drink; and she did, and we drank that up, and came out of the house; and in passing Baker's-row, she said she would go in and have a pint of beer - after that was drank the other man called for six-pennyworth of brandy-and-water, and then another, and then she said she would pay for six-pennyworth herself; and we came out of the house, I said I must get home, and went towards my home.</p>

             re-examined. I declare positively, on my oath, I went no where with him till I went out to go home - I did not drink any brandy-and-water with him, nor enter any other house with him - I had in my bosom four half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences- until I changed a sixpence, I had no copper money whatever.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you buy the pies first or afterwards? A. I bought them in the house - I should have paid for some bread and cheese for him, as he said he had had nothing to eat, but they said they did not sell it - I lost a sixpence, but no halfpence - I am in the habit of collecting a great deal of money for Mrs. Ekins down at Globe-lane; and the neighbourhood, I have the care of about twenty houses, and she trusts to me to let the houses and collect the rents, just as if they were my own - the comb he offered to me was a small tooth-comb with the teeth out - it is the same to all appearance unless there are two alike- no further force was used to me than holding back my arms.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. On Saturday, the 22nd of June, a little after two o'clock, I went to <placeName id="t18330704-81-crimeloc410">Nichol-street, Devonshire-court, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What are you? A. A Thames police-constable - the other officers were in the room when I found the metal in the cloth; I cannot say whether they saw me find it - I have had it in my possession ever since - I gave Mr. Field the paper to wrap three pieces of metal in at the Thames police-office - Creber was the only person with me when I first went in and found the prisoners on the bed - he is not here - Mitchell and my brother came in, in a moment - Creber might have heard what the prisoners said if he had taken notice- he was not bound over.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. What part did Creber take in the transaction; I believe he found the money on Hill, but I am not sure.</p>

            . I am a Thames police-surveyor. I accompanied the other officers to the prisoners lodging - I and Mitchell went one way, my brother and Creber the other - as soon as I saw my brother go in at the door we entered - Chamberlaine was just then getting off the bed - he asked us to allow him to put his clothes on before we handcuffed him - I commenced searching the bed - pulled it off the bedstead, and at last (seeing a little hole in the tick,) I cut the tick open, and turned the flock and feathers out, and found a little bag containing forty-three counterfeit shillings - Mitchell has them, and in a paper I found six half crowns- I counted them in the prisoners presence, and gave them to Mitchell - Chamberlaine said he did not know they were in the bed - that he had been there two months, and knew nothing of them - he then said to the female "this will lag us all Sal," - that means transported - she goes by the name of Sal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was anybody in the room when he said that. A. The whole of the officers except Mitchell who I believe went up stairs.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the mint- I have seen there articles - I know from my experience what they are for - this is a mould of plaister of paris - having impressed on it the obverse and the reverse sides of a shilling, of the date of 1817, which mould I believe from its appearance, has been used for casting shillings - two of the shillings produced by the officer which are unfinished, appear to have been cast in this mould - the whole forty-three are counterfeit, and are all cast in white metal - there are some pieces of white metal here, similar to what the counterfeit coin is made of - I have selected from among these pieces, two which appear to have been run in these moulds - they are called gets - it is the metal which fills up the mouth of the channel of the mould - I have no doubt they were cast in the channel of this mould - this shilling would be attached to the get when it is cast - twenty-eight of the shillings are not of that year - here is a tobacco pipe, which has a small portion of white metal in the bowl, similar to the metal produced- that would melt the metal, to pour it into the mould, and here is a file with white metal in the teeth - that might be used to remove the roughness from the edge of the metal - the bowl would hold about a sufficient quantity to form a shilling and the get - this is plaister of Paris in a powdered state - by mixing it with water, the moulds are composed - they usually have a hand to confine the plaister of parish into a particular form, till it hardens- here are six counterfeit half-crowns of the same metal.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What did Chamberlaine say, after saying he knew nothing of them? A. He said, he had been living there two months; I told him I knew that, for I knew he had lived there two months - he then said, "This will lag us, Sal."</p>

            . I am a constable of Barnet. I was at South Mimms on the morning of the 18th, near the prosecutor's house, at nearly six o'clock; the outer door of the house was open; I went in, and saw the prisoner there in the first room - he was putting his hat on - I examined his hat, and found in it a child's petticoat and a woman's petticoat; they were in the crown of his hat - I took him into custody - he threw one petticoat out of his hat while he was in the house, and while I was picking it up he slipped by me, but never got out of my sight - I saw a box in his trousers pocket when he was in the house, and it was afterwards brought to me by a neighbour - I had not seen him throw it out of his pocket; it was a box like that - when I apprehended him, he told me he did it from distress (I neither threatened nor made him any promise), and I really believe he was in distress; I did not lose sight of him when he ran away - I found this comb in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said, what he did, he did from distress? A. He said, "I did it from distress," and he really appeared to me to be in distress - I never knew him before - I don't know whether he was committed for the larceny or housebreaking.</p>

            . These things are my property; this box I know particularly, it belongs to my child, this comb is mine, and these other things are mine; I don't know where they were before - my wife is not here - I know this to be my wife's petticoat, from seeing it several times before; there was no mark on it particularly - I know the comb from having used it for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is a common born comb? A. Yes; it has no particular private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you pulled the door too, if you wanted to get back to your house, how would you get in? A. By lifting the latch - my father lives next door to me, and several of my sisters - none of my children live next door; they were all in bed in my own house - when I came back my wife had just got down stairs - my wife might have gone down and opened the door - my relations next door frequently come to see me (it is a common thumb latch); we are frequently in the habit of running into each others houses - my wife had just come down stairs, and was half-dressed when I came home.</p>

No; the first time I saw it was at the watch-house, I believe, but I was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040072"/>confused; there was nobody but him near me - I did not state before the Magistrate, that I saw the watch in your hand; not that I recollect.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Butcher-hall-lane, and am inspector of the watch. On the night of the 4th of June, I heard the cry of Stop thief and saw the prisoner running towards Christ-church-passage, which is no thoroughfare; I helped to stop him, and the prosecutor said, he had been robbed of his watch - I laid hold of one hand and the watchman of the other; he wanted to get his hand at liberty, and at the watch-house I let go of his hand, he put it into his trousers pocket, and took out the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long elapsed from the time of your taking me till you got me to the watch-house? A. Not two minutes - I did not see the watch till I got to the watch-house.</p>

            EVERITT. Q. When you lost your watch, did you cry, Stop thief? A. Directly you ran from me, I felt the watch go, and said, "You have got my watch," and called out, Stop thief - I swear you took it from me; there was nobody else in Butcher-hall-lane.</p>

On the 30th of May, I was stationed near London Bridge, on account of a fire which had taken place there; about half-past three in the day time I saw the prisoners close on the prosecutor, and saw something move sharply into the left hand breeches pocket of Westbrook - I laid hold of the two - a person came up, and I gave one into his custody - I could not see whether the other prisoner did anything or not, but from the quickness of the motion I saw something was done, and laid hold of them.</p>
               <p>Daley. He had hold of the other, and said to a policeman "Go and catch hold of him," and he took me - I was three yards from the policeman.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. Did they appear in company together, or was it accidentally? A. I took hold of them at the same time; I could not see who took the handkerchief, but saw a motion which led me to believe something was taken - I considered they were acting in concert together, but cannot be certain of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Westbrook. When the policeman took me; he asked me what I was in my pocket - I immediately said I had picked up a handkerchief on the pavement; he kept hold of my collar, and said to a policeman, "Lay hold of the little one."</p>

               <p>Daley's Defence. I was coming over the bridge, from my masters about one o'clock - on this side of the bridge there was a fire, and a great crowd as I came through - a streetkeeper secured me, and said, "Come along with me," he took me to the prosecutor, and he had the handkerchief from a man who said he had picked it off the pavement - I never saw my fellow prisoner in my life before.</p>
               <p>Westbrook's Defence. I was going over the bridge to Lambeth-street - there were a great many people walking on the footpath - the handkerchief laid by the curbstone - I picked it up, and put it in my pocket - a policeman laid hold of me by the collar, and asked what I had put in my pocket - I said, I had picked a pocket handkerchief up - the gentleman was six yards before me - he told a policeman to go after this lad - the gentleman turned back, and asked the gentlemen round if they had lost anything - the gentleman stepped up, and said, he had lost a handkerchief - the policeman asked if that was his, he said yes - I never saw Daley before in all my life - I was half dozen yards behind the prosecutor.</p>

I said, yes; he said, "Do you know them?" I said, "Yes; there is a ticket on them; the officer looked at them, and the ticket was gone; the officer looked in his mouth, and saw a piece of paper which I suppose to be part of the ticket torn off - the trousers had a ticket on them in the shop, but it was missing from those found in his hat - he had not bought them - Mr. William Bousfield is in partnership with his brother John Bousfield.(Property produced and sworn to).</p>

The prisoner was an acquaintance of ours; he called on the 4th of June; I had a silver watch on my mantel-piece when he called, and I missed it about half a minute after he left; I caused him to be apprehended, and have since seen the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. On your oath, can you swear you did not give it me to go and pawn? A. Safely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not ask you if you had got any money, you said not, but there was the watch, and I might take and pawn it? A. I did not; we were not to have gone out together that evening, while my husband was at work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your husband there when he called? A. No; he was going out with his horse and cart - the prisoner saw him and spoke to him, and asked him what time he would be at home - he said about half-past eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040074"/>o'clock; he said, "I will stay till eight, and if you don't come till then, I must go;" this was about half-past three o'clock - he has many times paid me as long a visit in my husband's absence; my husband is a carman to a chemist and druggist - nothing but friendship made the prisoner's visit so long - he stopped about ten minutes after my husband left, which was about a quarter to four o'clock - he did not stay as he had said till eight o'clock; I did not employ him to pawn the watch; I did not allow him to take it - nothing was mentioned about a watch; I missed it about half a minute after he left - it is worth about 2l. - nothing has passed, to lead him to think he might use the watch, or take it away - the watch was in my use - it laid on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not on similar occasions when we were going to the play, gone out and pawned articles to raise money? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever gone out with the prisoner in your husbands absence? A. Only once - I think about Christmas - I went with him to the Haymarket Theatre- my husband knew I was going.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has been several times to my barracks, and called and got me out of the barracks, and got me drunk, and kept me away from my regiment? Witness. I only went to his barracks once, and that was in company with another young woman who went to see a friend of her's, and while I was there I called on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you call? A. Because he was a friend of ours - I went into no room - it was not at the barracks - it was a public house I saw him in - I drank with him - I staid about ten minutes - the young woman went to see another soldier, and she came away when I did - we had a pot of ale - the prisoner paid for it - the other woman was single.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What she has said is quite false - she came to me at half-past one o'clock on Sunday, and staid till the sergeant was obliged to turn her out of the barracks - we had about 10s. worth of drink among us. Witness. It is perfectly false - he is a false fellow - a wicked young man- I have not been out with him scores of times - only once - I was not with him at Bartholomew-fair - my husband was there likewise - we were altogether - I was never with him on Saffron-hill - I never went to a brothel with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what passed between you and me after Mr. Box went away with the cart? A. I don't exactly recollect the words; I don't think I spoke half a dozen words to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say when we went towards the window by the bed-side, and I put my arm round your neck, did not you say, "Don't they will see us through the window, wait until towards evening?" A. No - he took no liberties with me at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You charge the man with felony - on the solemn oath that you have taken, did you by any encouragement you gave him, lead him to suppose he might take the watch? A. No, there was never any familiarity between us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not last December encourage me when I was four days absent from my regiment, to come and visit you while your husband was at work? and what took place while I was there? A. I never had any criminal intercourse with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can prove there is a mark on her naked person; I leave it to you to judge. Witness. It is false; no further than what I told him - he asked me if I had once been bit by a dog; I told him yes; that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have cohabited with her since 1826; she is nothing but a common prostitute.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you, either before your marriage or since, have any improper connection with him? A. Once before I was married, and not since - I have known him eight years - I told my husband the watch was gone directly he came home - I did not know how it had gone at that time; I suspected the prisoner had taken it - I had had no quarrel with him - I told my husband who I suspected had taken it, and he was apprehended on Thursday morning - I missed it on Tuesday - I had not seen him in the interval.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Thames-street. On the 4th of June, the prisoner came to my house and asked for half a pint of rum, which he had - he had a watch swinging about when he came in; he was neither sober nor in liquor - he swore he would knock the watches brains out - I said "Don't knock the watch about, because hereafter you may want it again" - he said, "This watch has been with me into a great many countries, and I am determined to knock it to pieces" - he left it with me for the half-pint of rum - he then came up to me and borrowed 5s. - I said I have no wish to lend money on the watch - Mrs. Young said he might get into trouble, and I had better let him have the money - I lent him the 5s. to get himself some clean clothes to go into the regiment again respectably - he said he could not appear in the regiment in the state he was in; his trousers were dirty - he went away with a soldier who was there; I believe he was a horse-soldier - they went away together - they took a boat and went across the water - the soldier who was with him fell overboard; the prisoner was going to hold him, and says he had the money in his hand, and in catching the man from falling over, he let the money out of his hand; he came and said to me, "I have not been to my regiment, I want now 5s. more, will you lend me that on it"- I said no - my wife said, "You had better lend it him, he will get into trouble," and I lent him the money and he went away - he came back again next morning and wanted more money; I said I would not lend him any more - he begged very hard indeed, and I lent him 10s. more, making 20s. altogether - I gave the watch to the officer who came to me.(Witness for the Defence.)</p>

He came again on the Saturday evening late, and my fellow-servant answered him - that was on the 29th of June; they told me had been - and he came again about eleven o'clock, and I asked how he dare come at that time of night - he asked me to lend him a sovereign, I refused, and said, I knew nothing of him; he said, he had heard of a situation and wished to get a few things - I refused, and almost shut the door in his face, and told my fellow-servant if he came again, I would kick him away from the door - he has annoyed me ever since I relieved him; last Monday he came first about five o'clock and asked me to lend him money; I said, I would not, and told him not to come to me again; he came again in less than two minutes, and put this letter into my hand, and said he had somebody waiting for him, and would call on Wednesday for an answer, between twelve and one o'clock; I opened it and showed it to Clark, my fellow-servant - I afterwards showed it to the officer (looking at the letter) I can swear this is the letter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you deny that I never stopped in the house all night one Friday last January, until Saturday morning? I went into the house and stopped there all night, and came out in the morning at half-past seven o'clock - I was going along, the young man came up to me at a picture shop, and jogged me by the arm; he went away - I followed him; he said, "It is a very fine night is not it?" and said, "Are you going this way?" I said, yes; he said, "We will walk together;" and he asked me to drink; he walked down Blackfriar's-bridge to Bankside, and there he committed what was highly improper; he put my hand into his trousers, and said, he thought it was not safe in the street, but he would let me in for the night if I chose; soon after, we went over the bridge into a house, and came out with an old lady dressed in black - he said, "Come along, she is quite deaf and cannot hear a word;" he went with her to Great-turnstile, and he did a similar thing; and when he got to his house, he said, "I cannot let you in, the family are not all in bed, if you will wait and knock at the pantry window over the door when you see a light there, I shall be there" - I waited and saw a light, and the watchman asked me the time, I said, it was about twelve o'clock; the prosecutor said, "Go round to the front door, and I will open it" - I went; he said, "Take off your shoes" - I did so; he went into the second door; he said, "I must put the chain up to the door;" he went in the kitchen, and said,"Will you mind having something to eat," and brought me slice of bread and cold mutton - I eat about a mouthful of it and left the rest till morning; he let down the bedstead out of the wardrobe, and we went to bed - I awoke about half-past seven o'clock; we got up, I eat the rest of the mutton, and went out; and that night he did similar to what he did before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never went further with him than the shop to give him the drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You took the old lady to Turnstile, she asked who I was, and you said I was a friend of somebody named Sard. Prosecutor. The old lady I took to Little-turnstile, not Great-turnstile - it was her son's; I relieved him before I took the old lady home - I took her to Princes-street; I never on my oath, let him into my master's house, no let him pass the night in the same room as myself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I can describe the room to you.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He came and asked me if I was alarmed one night about eleven o'clock going to bed, if I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040076"/>heard somebody at my pantry window; I said, I did, and had heard them use very bad expressions, and I called my fellow servant up - I never let him in further than the passage - when he came to the end of the passage, I gave him the mutton and sent him off - he did not stop in the house five minutes - he came to the pantry window, I asked how he dare take the liberty; he said, he saw the light, and supposed it was me going to bed; and a person saw him get up and look into the room, and anybody looking through there, can look over my room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said to me in the morning, "You can call sometimes when you are at leisure;" and I called three times; and I asked him first to lend me sixpence, he said, he had not got less than a sovereign; I said, then he could not lend it to me; he said, he was obliged to maintain an old mother; after that, I was going down Holborn, I saw a young man who said, "Don't you know a person at No. 10, New-street, at the King's printing-office; I said, I did; he said, "His name is Robert, if you will have the goodness when you go there to take a note for me, and there is 6d. for yourself; and he gave me this letter.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is false; he says, I went to Great-turnstile with the old lady; I took her to Princes-street - he said the man's name was Bennett, who gave him the letter, and he would bring him forward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. A young man asked me if I knew the young man living in Shoe-lane - a lowish young man; and if I would take the letter, he would give me something to drink; I asked him what sort of a letter it was; he said, nothing particular, he should stay outside till I took it, and he did; he stood opposite on the other side of the way, while I took it in, and the prosecutor asked me who that young man was.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On my oath, I did not ask him who the young man was; I did not see any young man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked repeatedly who he was the young man stood close to the door; that was the person who gave me the letter for him; he said "There you can take the letter now," and I went and gave him the letter, and staid until he read it, and he said, "I have not got any money, if you want any recompense for what I have done, why not ask for it in an open way?" I said I did not write the letter, he said, who did - I said "Why that young man there - he says, if you don't give him money, he shall send somebody for it," he had said, "If you will call on Wednesday between twelve and one, I will give you 5s. that is all I can spare;" I said, "That is the young man who sent the letter," he said, "I know nothing of him," and when I went out the young man was gone; I asked where he lived he said in Cromer-street, but it is said no such person lives there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He did not tell me he received it from another young man, nor that a young man was waiting.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I never opened the note till he was gone, he said he would leave it, and he or somebody would call on Wednesday between twelve and one o'clock. I showed the note to a young man, and asked him, if I had not better have an officer in attendance? He said, by all means, and my brother-in-law wished me to go to the Lard Mayor; I went, but it was not office hours; the prisoner came for the money, and was apprehended; when he came to the door I asked him to come in, he would not; I asked him again, he would not, and then I asked him what he wanted of me, and he asked for some recompense for what I had done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say you would give me some recompense for what you had done? A. Never on my oath- he told the Lord Mayor, Bennett wrote the letter, (letter read, for which see indictment).</p>

            . I am superintendant of the nightly watch. The prosecutor came to the Mansion-house, last Tuesday evening, and showed me the letter - I consulted the Lord Mayor about it, and he desired me to take the man into custody; I went to the house about eleven o'clock on Wednesday morning, and staid till about half-past twelve, when the prisoner came to the door, and the prosecutor said, "Come in;" he asked him twice; he refused to come in; he then said, "What is it you want of me," he said, "I want some money for what you have done to me," and at that moment, I went and took him; I examined the outer part of the house, which leads to the prosecutors bed-room - any body could get up by laying hold of the rails, and see all over the room when he was going to bed; he don't shut the window shutters, because there is a dead wall facing his bedroom; and he says he never shuts his shutters because it should not be dark in the morning; his bed does open with folding doors right opposite the window, anybody can see it by looking in at the window; I did not ask the prisoner any questions; I delivered him to another officer; I knew nothing of him before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. There is no iron rails that side of the house, and it is too high to reach without a ladder; the foot of the bed comes nearly to the window; there is folding doors in the counter, and two cupboards on each side of the fire place.</p>
               <p>Witness. Anybody can see over the window with the greatest ease and see all over the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There is no hole in the wall where any body can put their foot in and get up.</p>
               <p>Witness. The window is about five feet ten from the floor; anybody laying hold of the window to raise themselves up can see it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are spikes outside. Witness. That I don't know, I tried myself to get up to the window, and did, and could see with case all over the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You could not see inside the kitchen by looking in at that window, for the kitchen is not in sight.</p>
               <p>Witness. The kitchen lies on the left; the prosecutor sleeps on the right; a person can see all over his bed room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could not get up there; I was not out of the house till half-past seven in the morning.</p>
               <p>JURY to MARCHANT. Q. Did you go into the young man's bed-room? A. Yes, I did and then viewed it from the outside - the bedstead opens with folding doors, and lies down right opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could see the drawers which are under the beadstead, there are two large drawers under the bedstead, and I could not see them when the bed was down - nobody could see them because the bedstead being down would hide them.</p>

            . Before the bed is let down they can be seen; but after the bed is down, I should say they could not be seen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could not see into the kitchen, which was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040077"/>facing the door, it is on the ground-floor, there is very large old fashioned clock there. Witness. There is a Dutch clock in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was at the kitchen door, when he fetched the light to go into his room. Witness. The clock could be seen from the kitchen door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can say nothing further than I have said which is all perfectly true; and what the young man says is perfectly false, every syllable of it - I saw nobody when I left the house; but when I went home I was asked where I had been all night, and I said I had been at Paddington - my mother asked where I had been to - I said I had been to a theatre at Paddington - the officer says, I asked for money, when I went - I said I wanted some recompense for what he had done - I never mentioned money.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARCHANT. When the bell was rang the prosecutor went, and opened the door, and said, "Come in," and he said "No, I wont come in;" he asked him twice, he would not come in, and he then said, "What do you want with me" - he said, "I want some money from you, for a recompense for what you have done to me."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I rang the bell; the young man asked me to walk in, and I said I would rather not, being in a hurry, he said "You had better walk in," and I said, no I would not, and he said, "What do you want with me;" I said, I wanted some recompense for what he had done; the officer said, walk in, and I went in the parlour, and the officer said, "You are in custody;" I said very well.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MARCHANT. I took him into the parlour certainly, and my brother officer who was with me, said,"You are in custody."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was in the parlour, a woman came in, and began kicking up a row; and when I went on the Saturday night, they said, he was out, and would not be home till late, and when I saw him, he said, I should not have come so late, he said, "When you come this way you can call again," and he has made one or two appointments to meet me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Am I to understand, that antecedent to the application of Pullen for payment of that bill, that that book was in your Lordship's possession? A. It was not put into my hands by the prisoner, but was found in the butler's pantry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe that book was left behind by the prisoner in your Lordship's house? A. It was - I did not find it, but I understood it was locked up in a cupboard, in which he kept other things belonging to me; I asked him on Monday morning, the 25th of March, for these books, telling him I wished to examine all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040078"/>bills and accounts, but he did not bring them to me, and, in fact he absented himself from my house from that time, except for one or two very short intervals on that day - on a subsequent occasion, he came to my house for the purpose of making up his accounts, and by mistake he was not permitted to enter - after what took place before the Magistrate in March, those things which were belonging to the prisoner, in my house, were by his own consent sold, and the proceeds were handed to my steward, they produced £61 12s. - my belief of this receipt being in the prisoner's handwriting, is founded on a perfect knowledge of his handwriting, which I have seen for two years and a half, - corroborated by the spelling of this name being similar - when I opened this book and saw this receipt, my expression was, "This receipt is a forgery in his handwriting" - I should have believed it to be his handwriting, if these words which are misspelt, had not come under my notice.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the amount of the prisoner's deficiency, at the time your lordship received the sum you have stated from the sale of his effects? A. I conceive not less than £200.</p>

            . I was in the habit of supplying the family of the Earl of Ripon with fruit and vegetables - I knew the prisoner as steward there - this receipt is not my writing, nor is it my name, it is Pullan not Pullen - these small books are what I used to keep accounts in; in July last, his Lordship was indebted to me £10 18s. 5d. and £19 2s. 10d. for fruit and vegetables - I did not receive that money at all in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this small book in your handwriting? A. No, my son's; I am but an indifferent scholar - my son gives receipts occasionally for me - he is not here - he never authorises other persons to give receipts for me, and he never gives receipts in my absence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is this receipt your son's writing? A. No Sir, nor any one belonging to me - I never authorised the prisoner to give receipts in my name - my son would have attended here if he had been desired.(The receipt was here put in and read. See Indictment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At the time I was in Lord Goderich's service I was deputed to be house-steward, and was employed to market in the best manner I could - I believe it is customary for noblemen to advance money in such cases, but I never had it; though I believe his Lordship would have given it me - I certainly employed Mr. Pullen as greengrocer, but previous to him I had employed Gosling, a greengrocer in Covent-garden market- he had transactions with me for twelve months, and I paid him up to about nine or ten months of his leaving us- Lady Goderich desired me to call in his account, which I did in a book similar to this one; I believe that book remained in her ladyship's hands for some time before it was settled; and I believe there was a greater account due to Gosling when he was paid; he presented me that account, but whether I presented it to Lady Goderich or not I cannot say, but I paid the amount, and never charged Lord Goderich a shilling for it; but it is in this book - I next paid an account of a greengrocer at Charing-cross, the name I cannot tell, but the amount was 3l. odd shillings; and these circumstances involved me very materially; I should no doubt by means of my friends, have had the power to exonerate myself, but I was not allowed that indulgence - I went to my master's house, but was refused admission, and could not make out my accounts, or I should have endeavoured to have set all right.</p>

            , a farmer; my farm is between Mr. Parris's and Laycock's-field. On Sunday morning, the 19th of May, I heard a person speak as I laid in bed, between four and five o'clock- I got out of bed and looked who it was, and the person on the left-hand side of the road was the prisoner Smith, the person on the other side I did not know, but he had a horses collar on his neck, and Smith had some horses gear on his shoulder - the person I saw on the other side of the road was dressed as Webb was when I saw him before the Magistrate - I stopped out of bed, and who should come by in less than ten minutes, but a lad with a wheelbarrow, and upon it I noticed a cart saddle with a double row of brassnails - the lad had a dark jacket on, a black cap, a gaiter on one leg, and a light stocking on the other- about seven o'clock the same morning, as I passed the

            . I am steward to Mr. Parris, at the farm spoken of. One of our men, who is Webb's brother, found some of the old harness in another field; the prisoner Webb knew my master's dog on the farm well - I cannot say whether the dog was fond of him, but he is a very good dog; he would not let me go into the yard - I know this barrow, it is Mr. Parris's, and made by his carpenter - this harness is his, it is worth between 11l. and 12l.</p>
               <p>Young's Defence. It is very strange that Ellis, who has known me all my life, should not know me, and Freeman, whom I never spoke to, should know me.</p>
               <p>Webb's Defence. I went to Mr. Brewer's, and stopped there till eleven o'clock at night; I got very tipsy, and laid down against the brewer's shed - I then got up, went round the road, and met four men by the side of Mr. Laycock's field, but neither of them were Smith or Young, they had long smock frocks on.</p>

            . I am daughter of the prisoner Smith, I live in the same house with him at Enfield. I remember the night this robbery is said to have been committed, my father came home that night at half-past eleven o'clock, and did not go out till seven o'clock the next morning - in the whole course of that night, he was not out of the house; we all sleep in one room - it is impossible that he could have got up and dressed himself and gone out without my knowing it; I and my two sisters slept in the room - he got up and went away about seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you a mother alive? A. Yes; she slept there too - I know Webb by sight, he is not in the habit of coming often to our house - I don't know that I ever saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be careful, for your own sake - upon your oath, have you not often seen him at your father's house? A. No, Sir, I have not to my knowledge; I remember my father being taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Webb there then? A. Yes, I had forgotten that - I came in just as the constable came in, and he was there then, but I will swear he was not there when I went out; I had been out about an hour - I had never seen him at my father's to my knowledge before - I remember my father being taken before the magistrate; I went there, I did not offer to give evidence - I did not say to any one, but to my sister, that I was able to prove that my father was at home all night; one of my sisters is twenty-one years old, and the other is eleven- I know a person named Hockett; he came to our house that Saturday-night, and went away at two o'clock the next morning, and my father went to bed at two o'clock - we were not sitting up so late for any thing particular; we had supper about a quarter to twelve o'clock - we had bread and cheese and porter; Hockett came about half-past ten o'clock - my father, mother, Hockett, and I, and my two younger sisters supped - I have three sisters in all - I am turned eighteen; one of my younger sisters is eleven, and the other eight - we sat talking over our supper, I had not been at home a week; Hockett was standing at the door, when my father went up stairs to bed - I then locked the door, and locked Hockett out; I then went up stairs into the room, but did not go to bed directly; it was half-past two o'clock before I went to bed - it was the first evening I had seen Hockett after I came home - he is rather paying his addresses to me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040081"/>I mostly make it a practice to look out at the window before I go to bed, and I did so that night, but I did not open the window - I did not observe it to rain; my father gets his living by work - he works for Mr. Laycock, to my best belief - Hockett went with us before the magistrate; I was with him when the prisoners were being brought from the magistrate's - I remember his saying to my father, "Never mind, old boy, I will give you a leg up upon your trial" - I did not hear him say,"I will swear you were with me all night."</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your solemn oath, did not he say, I was with you all night? A. I did not hear that - I will not swear that he did not say it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do not people in the situation of life in which your father is, sit up later on Saturday nights than on other nights? A. Yes, rather so; I had been before that in service at Clapton for seven months - I saw Hockett out of the door that night; I then locked the door, took the key up stairs with me, and put it on the shelf; I found it in the morning in the very same place - I am the person who unlocked the door with it at six o'clock; I found the door exactly the same as I had left it - no questions were asked of any person in defence of the prisoner before the magistrate; I was not there all the time the examination was going on - I heard Mr. Freeman examined - I did not hear any witness for the prisoner called - my sister who is older than me is here; her name is

             (police-constable E 141). The prisoner was given in charge to me by the prosecutor, for taking his hat and other things the day before - the prisoner said he was drunk and did not know what he was about - I was going to the office with the prisoner, and I was asking the prosecutor some questions - the prisoner said I had no right to ask any questions; I said, I knew my duty, I had a right to ask the prosecutor any questions, but the prisoner none - I found nothing on the prisoner but a bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>- YOUNG. I am the prisoner's mother. On the 19th of June he had a very good hat on, he had had it new about three weeks - he had no older one at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know where he bought it? A. No; I believe he bought it of a Jew - he never told me where he bought it - it was not a particularly good one, but it was new - it did not exactly fit him, and that was why he wanted to change it; he wanted to get a shilling, or 1s. 6d. for it, and an old hat.</p>

I was standing against the play-ground, and heard the cry of Stop thief - I saw the prisoner running with his left hand full of silver, he put it into his right hand - I followed him; when he got to the Antelope he stopped, and went in I told Collins - when I was at Worship-street, the prisoner offered me 2s. if I minded what I said, and he said he would give me 2s. if he got off.</p>

On the night of the 19th of May, I was coming down from Tyburn-gate, and met the prisoner with something under her shawl - I asked her what she had got; she said, Nothing to me - I stopped her and said, I insisted upon seeing what she had got; she said, a hat - I asked where she got it; she said her brother gave it her, who lived at Bayswater, but she could not tell the name of the street nor the number - I asked her if her brother had been at home all day; she said, Yes - I took her to the station-house, and went about a quarter of a mile and saw the prosecutor asleep on a step without a hat - I asked him where his hat was; he said, he had lost it - I took him to the station-house, and he saw the hat and claimed it - it was about half-past twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the hat; I kicked it before me and then took it up - I met the policeman, who took me to the station-house and brought this man - he asked me the next morning if I had any money; if I had he would tell me what to say.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). As I am now called on for my defence, let my fate he whatever it may, I am resolved to state the real truth. With respect to breaking or wrenching any place or chest, or anything else, open, as I now stand before God and man, I am perfectly innocent; but as I saw those two pieces of indigo lay upon the ground, I did not know that I was committing any offence by stooping to pick them up, for I was certain they were of no value to me; neither did I take them with any intention of making a property of them, for I thought they might do for my wife to use in washing. Under these circumstances I now throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

On Friday the 14th of June, I was going out on an errand; I locked the door, and took the key in my hand, it was about half-past eleven o'clock- I did not go out; I sat down below, and when I returned up, I saw the prisoner in my room; he came out, and I stopped him, and told him he had been robbing me; he said, "There is no harm done my good lady;" he ran down, and I ran after him, and cried, stop thief, till he was taken by a policeman, who is here - I saw one of my drawers had had its contents turned out upon the bed, and another drawer wide open, as far as it would balance; I missed one spoon when I returned to the room, it is worth about 1s. 6d.; I had seen it safe the same morning; this is it; it is my husband's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She collared me, and took me into the room, and when she found the things were wrong in the room, she called out - I was knocking at the door when she came up. Witness. No, sir, he was in the room coming out - I suppose, he was three yards inside the room; I did not see him doing anything; I did collar him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How had the door been opened? A. By a picklock key I suppose - we found four keys when we went back into the room where the prisoner had been searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What time did you find them? A. Directly I returned from the Lord Mayor; within an hour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who knocked the prisoner down and broke his head? A. I did not see it done; I had lost sight of the prisoner - there was a lad at the station-house, but I did not see him produce any handkerchief; he did not produce this of mine, for I had picked this up - I think the lad gave his evidence; I really forget his name; I know where he resides, but I have not brought him here; I thought my own evidence was sufficient - the policeman saw nothing of the transaction; when I first suspected some person intended to rob me, the prisoner was behind me - there was one other person behind me, but lower down, but that was not the lad who brought this other handkerchief; I was at that time opposite Mr. Bennet's, the coach-maker's, in Moorfields - I missed the handkerchief just at the corner of White-street, which I think was half a minute after I found it safe; the prisoner was then about five yards before me, he was stopped at the corner of Moor-lane - I am certain I saw the prisoner throw my handkerchief down.</p>

             (police-constable G 72). I took the prisoner, and have the handkerchief which the prosecutor gave me - here is a handkerchief which a lad came up and gave me when I had the prisoner in custody; he said,"Here is a handkerchief which I saw him throw away - I picked it up."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why did you not allow the lad to be examined? A. I did not hinder it; he went to the station-house; his name was taken down at the time, but I don't know what it was; I don't know that I heard it - I know the street that the lad lives in - I did not break the prisoner's head; I did not knock him down; if he broke his head at all it must have been in his falling down - when I went to catch him, he went against the wall, and then he fell down and I fell at the same time - I can solemnly swear I did not take out my staff at all till after the prisoner was in custody; and I never struck him with it - I took the lad to the Mansion-house; I did not tell him not to go before the Grand Jury; I said he might please himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was proceeding from my work in the Minories; I was going up Ropemaker-street; there was a cry of Stop thief - the police-officer came up and knocked me down; I said it was not me, but they would not let me go; a lad came up and said he had seen me throw away a handkerchief; I was then taken.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of June, I expected a remittance from my banker's, but it did not come that day, but on Sunday,(the next day,) I received this letter; it had nine £5 notes in it, and contained advice of the receipt of ten - there were No. 19577 to 19586, with 19585 missing - the seal was remarkable, it struck me there was something wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe the seal was so much unlike one used by people in business that it excited your attention directly? A. Yes, it appeared to me as if a penny and a thumb had been pressed against it - the person who took the one note, might have taken the whole, certainly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner? A. Yes, for nine years - up to this time he had a good character; his father and friends are respectable - it was his custom to come to his father on Sundays.</p>

I kept a receiving-house for general post letters, up to the 19th of June - I am the housekeeper - the house is in the parish of St. Dunstan in the West; the prisoner was my apprentice, he assisted in doing the business of the post-office; he had a key to the box of the letters which were brought in - if a letter was brought there before five o'clock, on the 31st of May, it would go the same night - the prisoner lodged in my house; he was in the habit of going to Mitcham, every Sunday, to see his father - he went there, on Sunday, the 2nd of June; some time after that I was sent for to the post-office - the prisoner was examined at Bow-street, and after that I had some conversation with him; I did not use any threat or promises to him - in the first place, he was asked what he did with the money - I believe it was by myself - he told me that three of the sovereigns were concealed at the end of the shop, on the top of some French books - he did not say how he came by the note - I asked him what he did with the rest of the money; he said he bought a brooch and gave a sovereign for it, and bought some trifling articles with the remainder of the money- I asked him how he became possessed of the letter - he told me he had concealed it about his person, and took it up to his bed-room at night; he then extracted the £5 note, and re-sealed the letter - I found the three sovereigns in my shop in the place he told me; this wax is similar to the common post-office wax.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you mean to seal the bags? A. Yes; this letter is very clumsily sealed - it does not look like any intention to deceive; the prisoner is a very respectable lad, he had been with me nearly three years - I had a premium of 150l. with him - he had conducted himself to my satisfaction in every respect - I sleep in that house.</p>

I had a search warrant directed to him at that house; I explained to him what I had come for; he said, he had none of Mr. Morley's property; I searched the room he was in, and in a trunk of which he had the key, I found some articles not the subject of this indictment; he gave me the key of that trunk, and I opened it; I asked how he accounted for the things in the box; he said, "My landlady bought them;" I asked, who she was; he said, "Mrs. Lee," and she was in the back parlour; I proceeded to the back room, and saw the female prisoner; I asked her if her name was Lee; she said, it was not Lee, but that she was the person I wanted; I said, "What is your name;" Bayly was not present, the door was open, he might have heard, it is not impossible, but not very probable I think, as I left Goddard with him, I did not hear them talking; it was in the adjoining room at some distance, the passage being between the two rooms; I think I spoke loud enough for them to hear it; the female prisoner did not speak loud enough for them to hear.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not make that observation to induce him to tell you what he knew, under the expectation that it would be better for him if he did? A. No, my object was to recover some of the property; he said,"I only took twelve pieces of cambric;" nothing else passed that day; on the following morning; I told him I had learnt, that a small deal box full of cambric was taken away altogether; I said, "There is a small deal box taken out from the warehouse; taken out from the other boxes, one of four; - and I know you have pledged the cambric, but what have you done with the box? - I did not see it in your house;" he said "It was cut up, and burnt in the kitchen fire."</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live at Lambeth-marsh, Charlotte-place; I did not take these goods in pawn; my young man did; he is not here; I was not in the shop when they were pledged; I took in three pieces of Scotch cambric handkerchiefs; I did not take them in; I only received a piece of cambric from Shepherd; she did not pledge this box of goods with me.</p>
               <p>HARRIET SHEPHERD re-examined. Q. Did you see that gentleman when you pawned that box of cambric? A. Yes, he was in the shop; I am certain it was at his shop I pawned them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you have already said you were in the habit of pawning very often? A. Yes; I have no recollection of the day on which I pawned the box; I pawned at different pawnbrokers, besides Dicker, by Mrs. Lee's desire.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Morley and Co. I know this box, it has an altered mark, by which I know it as Messrs. Morley's property; I have no means of positively swearing to the handkerchiefs; they are new handkerchiefs, and have never been washed; the prosecutors had handkerchiefs in their stock last May, of that pattern; the shawl I cannot positively identify; there is no mark, only that my employer had shawls of this kind, but we have not taken stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If this had been yours, is there anything to show when they have been missed? A. Yes, they have been missed between April and June; I can swear positively to the box and the handkerchiefs fit it, and agree in every respect with the price on the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your handkerchiefs packed in this sort of box? A. Yes, there is originally, two marks on the box; I was at the prisoner's lodging at one time when they were searching; I think it was on the 26th of June; I found in taking the fancy shavings out of the fire place, four tickets, they do not relate to this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have said, you have not taken stock between April and June? A. No, not of these goods; I have not missed this handkerchief, nor the twelve cambric ones; I cannot say the handkerchiefs are the property of my employers; but I believe they are; we are in the habit of selling such things; I cannot swear the shawl was not sold; if the handkerchiefs had been my masters I cannot positively say they have not been sold; they are usually sold with the box; we have sold some scores of boxes marked in that way; I suppose other warehousemen sell handkerchiefs in the same sort of boxes.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Where were these kept? A. In the Scotch warehouse which the prisoner had access to; it was in the floor below his bed room; he could get to it from his bed room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are they such articles which a man, in the condition of the male prisoner, would purchase for his own use? A. He would not; they are for women's pocket handkerchiefs; we sell them at 7s. 6d. a dozen.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you not many boxes with the same mark as that, which you have sold? A. Yes, we have some of this mark, and others of a different mark; all those at 7s. 6d. a box, are marked in the same way; we have about twenty men; if the shopmen wanted any goods we were at liberty to have them, by entering them in the book; if I had bought goods of my employers, I should either enter them as ready money, and pay the money, or enter them in my own name, - the young men buy articles at times.</p>

            . Q. Did you not state before, you were not certain whether you pawned the things in the box in May, or June? A. Yes; I cannot tell - I am almost sure it was May - it might be in June.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know when the prisoners were married? A. Yes; it was before the marriage; before the day I pawned the box and contents I had not received from the female prisoner any goods of that kind; I received pieces of French cambrics from her more than once - I had a great many from her.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. As far as you believe, Mrs. Bayly came by them honestly, or you would not have had anything to do with them? A. No; she told me her first husband kept a linen-draper's shop.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you tell about how many pieces of cambric you received from her, or saw in her possession before the day you pawned the box? A. I am not sure; I cannot say - I should suppose eight or nine pieces, worth £1 each piece - they were new; I pawned them for £1 each; I never saw above one of these pieces or so, in her possession at a time, when she gave them to me to pawn; I have also seen crape shawls in her possession - I think I pawned about six; I remember being in a cab with Mrs. Lee, before the box was pawned; there were some pieces of French cambrics in the cab - six or seven; they were taken to pawnbrokers in Shoreditch or Whitechapel, to different pawnbrokers - I was the person who generally went into the shop to pawn them; she told me, it being such a distance off, that I was to tell the pawnbroker it came from the street opposite - I was to say the name of the street opposite; that they came from that street; we had come from South-street in the cab - Mrs. Bayly lived in South-street at that time; I was in the habit of seeing Mr. Bayly there at that time - he did not sleep there; I have, since this has been inquired about, been round to the different pawnbrokers with Mr. Morley, and the officer, and showed him the places; I took one or two light shawls,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040092"/>besides the cambric, to Whitechapel - they were not pawned with the cambric, but on the same day; I did not take more than one piece to each pawnbroker - I went to six pawnbroker's with the cambric, and to two pawnbroker's with the shawls - the whole eight pawnbroker's were in the neighbourhood of Shoreditch and Whitechapel; the shawls were new - on the 27th of May, I took a piece of cambric to St. George's-circus, and pawned it for £1; I went to Collins's in Shoreditch - Mrs. Bayly told me that her husband kept a linen-draper's shop - that this was the remainder of her stock, and she wished to dispose of it; I did not leave her service before she married the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you say, she said she was desirous of disposing of it, you mean the large stock; she did not say that respecting the box of handkerchiefs? A. No.</p>

             re-examined. This I know by a number on it, and know it has never been sold; it belongs to Mr. Morley; the other piece is not numbered, but is the same make, and I have no doubt out of the same box - I believe they had not been sold, but cannot speak positively to it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Point out the mark on the piece you know? A. Here it is; it enables me to say it has never been sold; because there never was any sold out of the box, corresponding with this mark - you will find No. 2296 on it; that is not the number of the box - the box is No. 3; all the pieces in the box were different numbers - I believe No. 2296 was missing from that box; I looked to see, and did not find it in the box - It is difficult to say whether this is No. 2290, or No. 2296 - it is either No. 2290, or No. 2296; I will swear it is not No. 2299 - perhaps I did not look carefully enough before; No. 2290, and No. 2296 are both missing - I know they have not been sold, because I had the invoice in my own pocket, and nobody else knew the price of them, and could not have sold them; they came in three or four months ago, and not a piece in that box was sold - nineteen pieces were missing out of the box, corresponding with that number - I have not got the numbers of the nineteen pieces - I can say this is one of them, because it corresponds with those left - because the figures are the same hand-writing, and each piece of cambric is numbered; I cannot swear that the manufacturer might not have numbered two pieces alike - I don't think it probable; to the best of my belief, this number is No. 2290, and not No. 2299.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. About three months and a half ago, the cambrics came into your stock? A. They did; the box contained twenty-five pieces, according to the invoice; I took off the lid and saw the box was full - the pieces are numbered consecutively - I have two more pieces from the box here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the nineteen pieces missing, numbered beyond No. 2296? A. Some above, and some below; these things were under my particular management - I know the pieces the pawnbroker has produced, had never been sold.</p>
               <p>- BECK. I am a pawnbroker; I have a piece of cambric pawned on the 1st of June; I live at No. 94, Blackfriars-road; I took it in pawn from a young woman giving the name of Lee - I could not swear to her; it was not the female prisoner; I have seen the female witness; it was a person of her description, but I cannot swear to her positively - I don't remember her; this is the duplicate I gave for it.</p>

             is in our service; and on Saturday, the 29th of June, I had a communication from him - our usual hour of dining was three o'clock, but we generally did not sit down till five or ten minutes past three o'clock - in consequence of what Crawley said, I on that day altered the dinner hour to two o'clock; but a few minutes after two o'clock I said to Warren "Take this parcel to the Old Change;" it was a parcel of tobacco weighing sixty pounds - I said, "Let us see how quick you can be back"- after he was gone I examined the shop, and under the counter on the selling side I found a box, and in it three parcels of tobacco, each weighing about two pounds; two of them were tied up, and the other only folded up and the ends tucked in - this was not at all a proper place for the deposit of tobacco - our counter is about a yard high, or not quite so much - I called Crawley and Browne, who were in our employ, and showed the tobacco to them - we had no customer of my father's named Rainsford - Warren returned back from the City in about an hour and ten minutes, which was very quick for him - I was at home when he returned, but I don't recolect saying anything to him - in consequence of something being said to me I went out in about five minutes after Warren's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040093"/>return - I went to the corner of Wardour-street and stood there some time, but I could not see our shop from there; I then went to a place where I could see our shop, and I saw the prisoner Rainsford lingering about our shop with a blue bag - (I had received a description of a person from Crawley) - after he had lingered about for four or five minutes, he stood at the window where we keep snuff-boxes, and pretended to be looking at them, but I observed that he fixed his eyes towards the counter, and he at last went in; Warren was then in the shop - Rainsford came out again in less than five minutes with his bag much fuller than it was before; it had had a small parcel in the bottom of it before he went in - I and a friend who was with me, crossed over to him and asked what he had in his bag; he said, tobacco - I at the same time took hold of his bag and took it from him, and asked him if he would allow me to see it - he said, Certainly - we then returned to our shop, and I took out of the bag (before my friend) these two parcels, which are two of the three which had been in the box under the counter, and which I had replaced there after looking at them; I am sure they are two of them - I said to Rainsford, "Where did you get this tobacco?" he said, from his father's stock - I asked where his father lived, and he wrote down his address, "Edward Rainsford, 16, Cumberland-row, King's-cross;" which turned out to be his right address - he said this was a part of his father's stock, and he had brought it out to sell - he said he came into our shop to buy half an ounce of snuff; and on his being asked what he paid for it, he said, 1d., and Warren said 2d.; they both answered together - I then asked Warren, who was present, what he knew of the tobacco; he said he knew nothing about it, but he knew Rainsford by sight - no man of ordinary height, could reach the tobacco from under the counter from the customers side; Rainsford certainly could not - it is customary in our trade when we send out any quantity of tobacco, to give also a permit; this is one of them - there was no bill with these parcels, nor any permit; it was quite clear they could not have been disposed of in the ordinary way of trade - one of the parcels which Rainsford had was loose, the other tied up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you put any mark on the parcels when you put them back in the box? A. No; I opened one and found it was tobacco, and I weighed it - I am not in partnership with my father- I can swear to these two parcels as being my father's, and could if I saw them thirty miles off - I observed a mark on one of the parcels, but I did not make it - I am satisfied these are the parcels.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Rogers. I know Rainsford; I had seen him at my master's shop several times before the 28th of June - our usual dinner-time was between three and four o'clock; and Rainsford used to come to the shop about half-past three, while master was at dinner - Warren used to be there at the time, and he seemed to know Rainsford - my master had lost a great deal of tobacco, and he made it known to the servants - I told my master what I had seen about Rainsford - my master went off to Brighton on Saturday morning, the 29th of June, and my young master changed his dinner hour that day - I was called to look at a box under the counter which had three parcels of tobacco in it, two tied, and one rolled up - I went out for a pint of porter about half-past three; I saw Rainsford outside the door - my young master was just going out with Mr. Riley, and he turned back and said, "Here is the rascal outside the door" - I went to the inner part of the warehouse; I could not see the customers side of the counter from there, but Brown could - he said to me, "Here he comes" - I went into our snuff-room where there is a square of glass broken; I looked through, and saw Rainsford at the counter, and Warren behind the counter; they were opposite and talking to each other - Rainsford staid about two minutes then went out, and in about a minute he came in again with my master - I saw my master produce from Rainsford's bag two of the parcels which had been in the box under the counter; I am perfectly sure of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Rainsford before? A. Yes, I had seen him, but not spoken to him - I had known

             (police-constable E 41). I was called in to take the prisoners - I found on Warren 1l. 10s. 6d., in silver, and 1s. 9d., in copper, and this letter- I afterwards searched the lodging of Warren at No. 94, John-street, Fitzroy-square; I there found this other letter</p>
               <p>JAMES - . I am an excise-officer. It is customary in the tobacco trade for vendors of tobacco to issue permits with any quantity of tobacco sold above one pound in weight; but I believe they generally do so with half a pound - on the 29th of June there was no permit from Mr. Rogers for four pounds.</p>
               <p>Rainsford's Defence. I have been in the habit of purchasing this tobacco of Warren as smuggled; he having represented that he had a captain, a friend of his who brought it over; I had generally sent him an order on the previous evening for what I wanted the next day, and on that Friday evening I sent an order for 6 lbs. of tobacco, 4 lbs. of shag, and 2 lbs. of returns, but the tobacco in the box was 4 lbs. of returns and 2 lbs. of shag - I took the 2 lbs. of shag, and 2 lbs. of the returns; I paid him for them and was coming out of the shop when I was stopped by Mr. Rogers - I did not wish that he should know that we were mixed up in any smuggling transaction, and I told him they were my father's - we were then taken before a magistrate - I have been to Mr. Rogers' at all hours for it; on the Thursday I had sent 
               <persName id="t18330704-116-person1179">Warren</persName>
             an order for some, and I went for it, and Mr. Rogers was sitting at his own desk, and must have seen me; it is not likely I should have gone there in broad day-light, with two or three other persons in the warehouse. if there had been any guilty intention on my part, except knowing that the tobacco was smuggled.</p>
               <p>Warren's Defence. I admit that the tobacco in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040094"/>box was placed there by me; it was not Mr. Rogers's but my own; I had bought and paid for it of a smuggler - I shall not give up the name.</p>
               <p>The letters were here put in and read: -</p>
               <p>"Dear Warren - Let me have ready at half-past three tomorrow, without fail, 4lbs. shag and 2lbs. returns, positively, and if you can at the same time 4lbs. shag, or 3lbs. shag and 1lb. returns. I owe you to-day 1s. 6d., Thursday 3s., and Saturday last 5s. for cigars, which I will give you the next time I see you: let me likewise have on Monday next, without fail, 3lbs. shag and 1lb. returns; in haste, E. R.</p>
               <p>Friday evening, six o'clock."</p>
               <p>Dear Sir - As I shall leave home this evening to convey my mother from the country, it will be useless your coming down here to-morrow morning, as originally proposed, as I shall be from home; but if you can make it convenient to call here tomorrow evening, after half-past eleven, the old man will have left, and we can then come to a settlement, or if more convenient will meet you on Monday or Tuesday, after half-past eleven in the evening, at any place you may appoint.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On Wednesday evening, July 5th, I returned to my lodgings, which were situated at No. 3, Ball-court, Giltspur-street, about half-past nine o'clock, and being rather in liquor I refused to have any supper, and shortly after feeling very unwell I went to the door, where I remained till such time as the family were going to bed, and then went in to make my bed; having made it, and being thirsty, and the street-door being open, I put on my hat and coat and I went out of my lodging in Ball-court, Giltspur-street, for the purpose of having a pint of beer; I had a pint of beer at the King of Denmark, in the Old Bailey. When I returned I tried the latch of the door, but found that the door was fastened; not wishing to disturb the family, I determined to remain out that night. As I was walking about, I met two young lads that I knew, by having been in their company twice or three times before; they asked me to have something to drink I consented, and drank with them several times. When about half-past six o'clock, being in Shoreditch, we went into a coffee-shop, we had some, and shortly after they entered into conversation between themselves which induced me to listen; it was about a robbery they had committed the night before, which I shortly ascertained was the person that is now my prosecutor. I then asked the manner in which they got in, when they replied, that by chance, they happened to go up this court, and seeing my prosecutor's door open they entered into the passage, they found the parlour door which was locked with the key outside, they entered and took the property. After having heard thus far, and being convinced that it belonged to my prosecutor, I told them then, that it was entirely through my carelessness that they had got possession of this property - and that, if they did not give up the property, I would give them into custody; they hesitated for some time, and at last agreed to give it me, which was as follows: 8 silver tea-spoons, a movement of a watch, a half-sovereign, and 4s. 6d. in silver, which they declared was all they had taken, with the exception of four or five shillings. Shortly after we parted, which was, as near as I can possibly say, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning. I then considered that it would be best for me, as it was then so late, to leave it till between five or six in the afternoon; and in the meantime to write a few lines, stating that the property would be returned in the evening with a satisfactory explanation; I did so, and was going in the afternoon to my prosecutor, when I was taken into custody. The policeman - during the time we were in the coach, (which he made me pay for before I got into it) tried to get me to tell him the whole particulars of the robbery, and likewise to give him the property, and that he would make it all right with the prosecutor, and because I refused, he took a most solemn oath that he would do his utmost endeavours to get me transported.</p>

            . I was out that day, and stood up in consequence of the rain opposite to Mr. Isaacs - I saw the prisoner, who appeared rather the worse for liquor; she ran to Mr. Isaacs, and this witness objected to her coming - I saw her handling a shawl, and could see she was in the act of bargaining for it - when the rain abated, I heard an altercation between her and the man, and I went over; I saw him strike her repeatedly, and (whether over the threshold, or what I can't say, but) she stumbled, and caught the shawl with one of her hands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean she never had the shawl in her possession? A. No, she never had - she did not walk away till she was pushed - she had got three hundred yards from the door before she was taken - the shawl was never carried from the prosecutor's house.</p>

She had got to our second door; it is a corner house, one door is in Cutler-street, and the other in White-street; from one door to the other is about ten yards - I was on the step at that door when she was running, she would have run further if I had not caught her, we both fell.</p>

            . I was in Cutler-street, and saw the prisoner standing on the steps of Mr. Isaac's door bargaining for a shawl; this witness asked her 15s. for it, she said "I would not mind giving 10s." - he then pushed her from the door, struck her several blows, kicked her, and told her to be off; she did not go directly, but when she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040096"/>left, and got ten yards from the door, she was fetched back by the officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any body standing at the second door of the shop? A. I believe not; I did not see her carry anything to the second door, the shawl was left at the first door, as far as I saw, but I had my eyes on my own goods- I would not swear that she left it at the first door - she did not run, she was too much in liquor - I happened to mention what I saw to a neighbour who knew the prisoner, and I was subpoened.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - this woman was given into my charge on the 25th of May, about half-past three o'clock - I examined her side and found a fracture of two or three ribs; she was taken to the Middlesex-hospital, and died on the 8th of June, about eight in the morning - the remote cause of her death was the fracture of the ribs, but she had diseased bones, and the slightest thing would cause a fracture - the immediate cause of her death was a chronic cough, and the secretion of mucus in the lungs, but the fracture of the ribs increased the cough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not this have caused her death, independent of the fracture? A. Yes, certainly; but that no doubt, increased the cough.</p>
