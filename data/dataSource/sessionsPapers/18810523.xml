                  </hi>. I am a flour dealer, of 9, Bood Lane, City; the prisoner has been for some time employed by my firm—in October, 1879, there was some difference of opinion between us; and he was dismissed—a fresh arrangement was then made; he was to receive 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year salary, and to obey my instructions punctually in everything—he wrote me this letter of 20th October, 1879, to that effect (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—if he got a customer he would produce to me a sale slip, with the particulars of the order; and when he paid me money he would produce a cash slip—it was his duty to make sales and collect money on such orders and pay it to me—he generally called daily at the office about 11.30—he always gave me the money, or paid it into his own bank for his own convenience and for safety—he only paid in coin, cheques he would hand to me—he produced this sale slip to me, dated 12th November, 1879, of the sale of 25 sacks of flour to Mr. Bonthron, at 43<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sack; and on 20th March he gave me this cash slip for 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he paid me 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think—he did not account for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards made inquiries of Mr. Bonthron about the transaction, and he told me something.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the time the prisoner entered my service I did not know that he had been in business for himself; I know it now—he was paid no commission, and no money for expenses—this letter was taken down by me and he copied it—when he was first dismissed he brought an action for wrongful dismissal—my defence was that he had not obeyed my orders—afterwards I found out that he had been embezzling; I have also charged him with forging my endorsement to cheques that he received and paid into his own bank, the Birkbeck—he has given me cheques on his bank for sums that he has received—I always believed they were for cash he had received, not cheques—he did not endorse the cheques he</p>

               <p>received, with my knowledge—I very rarely told him the price he was to get for flour; occasionally I have—I was satisfied with the price he got, if he could not get more; he was to get as much as he could—he has not complained of my not allowing discount or commission or expenses, that I swear; nor havelreplied,"Well, then, you must <hi rend="italic">load</hi> the flour"—I know what that means—I know now that he has at times paid me more than he received from the customers—he had nothing to do with paying dock and granary charges—I have not gone into matters that occurred before I dissolved partnership with Mr. Bruce—the action in the Mayor's Court is not going on—I do not know that this prosecution has delayed it—I understand that he is now in employment in the same trade, in a rival business.</p>

I was 16 years old last birthday—I was in the service of Mr. Saillard, a feather manufacturer, of 85, Alders<lb/>gate Street, City—I went into his service about nine or ten weeks ago—it was my duty to wash the feathers downstairs in the dye-room—they are beaten down there, washed, and fastened up in bundles of about 28 or 30 each—there were two other lads in the service, George Fisher and Caleb Jarvis; they left the service some weeks ago—Jarvis gave a week's notice to leave, about three weeks after I went there—Fisher gave a week's notice when Jarvis's week's notice was due, but he left a week after Jarvis, before his notice was due, he was dismissed—Fisher is about 17, Jarvis is about the same age—Fisher left on the Wednesday—the day after he left he spoke to me, and from what he said I stole about 30 feathers off the line in the dye-room—that was the first lot I took—I put them under my clothes and carried them away—I gave them to Fisher round a back turning, and he went down Aldersgate Street in the direction of Newman's coffee shop in Hare Court—I waited at the corner of Barbican—he returned in about 20 minutes without the feathers—he made a statement to me and gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about the day after I stole another lot of feathers, I think about 28, from the same place—I gave them to Fisher round the same back turning; he went in the same direction as before, and returned without the feathers—he did not give me any money then; he afterwards met me and gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about a week after I stole some more, about 28—I took them myself to New<lb/>man; it was dinner-time; he was in the shop serving customers; he generally made a wink at me, as much as to say, "Have you got some feathers?"—I went out the back way with him, and gave the feathers to him—he said I was to come at night for the money—I was alone then—I went at night for the money, and Newman gave me 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave half to Fisher—Newman told me to get as many as I liked, and he would buy them of me—about a week after I got about 30 more—I gave them to Newman at his coffee-house at the dinner-hour; he gave me 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave Fisher half—when I gave him the fourth lot I went through the back way and halfway up the staircase and gave them to him—I did not take any more after that—I had another lot when the boy Munn found me out; that was on the 3rd May; I had got a lot under my clothes—after Jarvis left the service I used often to see him at Newman's in the dinner-hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 67, Myrtle Street, Commercial Road—I am 17, years old—I was formerly in the service of Mr. Saillard—I know Jarvis and Grimley—I and Jarvis left; Grimley remained in the service—I left about eight weeks ago—the day after I left I saw Newman—I had been in the habit of using his coffee-house—he asked me if I would ask Grimley if he would get a string of feathers, and he would buy them—he knew that I had got discharged from Saillard's—I used to see Grimley at the coffee-house—I afterwards saw Grimley outside Mr. Saillard's—I told him what Newman had said to me, and he went down to Mr. Saillard's firm again and got a string of feathers; there are generally 20 or 30 in a string—he brought them out under his shirt, and gave them to me—I took them to Newman's—I gave them to Mrs. Newman in the lavatory—Mr. Newman gave me the money in the shop the same day—I told him I had given Mrs. Newman the feathers, and he gave me 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I won't be certain which—I gave Grimley 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and kept the remainder—Mr. Newman gave me the key to get into the lavatory; he told me I was to go and open the door of the lavatory and wait in there for a second, and Mrs. Newman would come to me—you can get to the lavatory without going through the coffee-shop—it is next door; there is a passage and a side door—Grimley got the next feathers—I did not see them; he told me he had got them, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. outside the coffee-shop—I saw him go in—two or three days afterwards he got another string of 28—I did not see them—he went into the coffee-shop; I was there as well, to dinner—he was there about a quarter of an hour—he used to have his dinner before he came out; he gave me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on that occasion—there were three more occasions, I believe—I did not see the feathers on either of those three occasions—I saw Grimley the same day in the coffee-shop, and he afterwards gave me money; once he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I think twice 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.: that was my share; the last occasion was about four days before Grimley was taken into custody—I used to see Mr. Newman every day while this was going on—nothing passed between us as to these feathers—I gave the key of the lavatory to Mr. Newman when I found that Grimley was in custody on the 3rd—I was taken to the police-court by the police on the 4th—I was</p>

               <p>called as a witness, and gave evidence—Newman was not there at that time—I was not sworn on the first occasion, but I made a statement, and signed it—I went and saw Newman on the Wednesday, at half-past 2—I told him what I had said at Guildhall—I said that the gentleman asked me how many strings I had taken, and what I had had to do with them; what I knew about it, and what I had been receiving—Newman offered me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go right away; he said, "Don't be seen in it at all; you are putting me away"—he did not give me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he only offered it—Mrs. Newman said he had better wait till to-morrow morning, and see what turned up, and I went straight home—I did not go back to work any more that day—I told my landlady about it—on the Thursday morning Newman came round to my place, as I was coming out to dinner, about 1 o'clock—he was waiting outside for me, and he asked me if I would go to his solicitor—I said I would—I did not know what to do—he told me that I was to say to the solicitor that Grimley had asked me to ask Jarvis if he could get rid of any feathers, and that Newman told him to be honest; he told me to say that I had never seen any feathers there, or ever took any—he said if he got off he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went with Newman to his solicitor, Mr. Chapman—I saw the clerk—I made a statement which the gentleman wrote down; Newman was there at the time—it was all written down at one time; there were two or three pages—I signed it—I was there about an hour—Mr. Newman then told me to go round to Mrs. Newman and tell her that I had been—he said I could make a home there, and I stayed there till Monday night, the 9th—my cousin then came and fetched me—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the previous Sunday Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning—I did not pay anything from the Thursday to the Monday—I was afterwards called again at the police-court on the Wednesday, and I was asked about the interview at the solicitor's—I then gave evidence on oath—at that time Newman was in custody—what I stated on oath was true—what I stated at the solicitor's office was not true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was four months in Mr. Saillard's employ—I dis<lb/>charged myself on the Friday—one of the chaps said I was larking about, and I got dismissed on the Wednesday, before the week was up—before that I had been employed at Pelham Black's, a match factory at Stratford—I was discharged from there because I was not scholar enough; I had been there two years—before that I was at a printer's in Clerkenwell—I left there to better myself at Pelham Black's—I never stole anything there, nor at the match factory; the first thing I stole was the feathers—until I got to taking my dinner at Newman's I was a perfectly honest boy, I never stole anything—I don't say I have not told a falsehood sometimes—it was the day after I left Saillard's that Newman suggested my stealing the feathers—he asked me to ask Grimley—I did steal one string of feathers; Newman asked me to do it—it was night time when he spoke to me; when I had done work—it was then he suggested stealing the feathers—I at once said I would do so—I stole them, and got the money for them—I only took him one string that I took myself, and one string that Grimley gave me to take—I don't know the date that I took the string myself; it was about eight weeks ago; about a fortnight before Grimley was in custody—that was the only time I saw Newman himself about the feathers—I have been in the shop with Grimley, but I did not see him hand the feathers over—I was about a month in the service with</p>

               <p>Grimley—he and I had never been engaged in stealing before—I did not know whether he would be willing to steal—after Newman spoke to me I said to Grimley, "I have been told if you can get a string of feathers some one will buy them of you," and he brought me the feathers in about five minutes—that was the string I took to Newman—Grimley's subsequent transactions were with Newman himself—he always shared the money with me—after I had given my statement at Guildhall, I went to Newman and told him that the detectives had fetched me away from my employ<lb/>ment, and I had to go up to Moor Lane and Guildhall—I think I saw the two girls and Mrs. Newman first, and Newman came in while I was waiting there—I did not say to one of the girls that I had been to Guild-hall to make a statement which was not true; that was what Newman told me to say to his solicitor—it was on the Thursday that I went to Mr. Chapman's; that would be the next day after I went to Newman's—the statement I made to the solicitor was entirely untrue, a pack of lies from beginning to end—I told the truth at the police-court, and I am telling the truth to-day—Mr. Chapman's clerk took down the statement from my lips, read it over, and I signed it—I knew it was all untrue—I signed it because Newman told me just what to say—I thought I should get him off at that time—I do not remember being in the coffee shop one day before Grimley was taken, and his saying, "He won't buy them"—it was never said in my presence; nor did I answer, "Bill, if we get into trouble, we will blame b——old Newman for it;" that was what Newman told me to say—I did not say to Mrs. Newman that what I had said at Guildhall was untrue, and that I was very sorry for it—I never took any feathers to any place in Houndsditch, or said that the people there were very desperate people, and I was afraid we should be <hi rend="italic">corpsed</hi>—that was what Newman told me to say—I had used his house about a fortnight before I was dis<lb/>charged from the prosecutor's service.</p>

I live in Lansdown Road, Leytonstone—I am not in any employment now; I was formerly in the employment of Mr. Saillard—I left about the same time as Fisher—I am going on for 17—after I left I went to Newman's coffee-shop—I had been in the habit of going there before I left—on one occasion, about three or four weeks after I left, Newman said to me, "Ask Grimley if he can get me any feathers, and I will buy them of him"—I said, "I will ask him," and I did, and I after<lb/>wards saw some feathers given to Newman at his coffee-shop by Grimley—I can't say exactly what day it was; I think it was about three weeks after I had left Saillard's—they were ostrich feathers, tied up in a long string, I don't know how many—I saw that once or twice, and I saw Newman give him some money—the last time I saw it was I think the week before Grimley was taken—I knew where the feathers came from—I never took any, nor did I have any of the money—I have seen Fisher at Newman's; I never saw him with any feathers—I was sent for, and gave evidence at Guildhall—after that, I think on the Wednesday, Fisher came and told me that Newman wanted me, and Newman asked me to go to his solicitors to tell them that it was all false—he said, "Tell them you were frightened into telling lies by the constables"—he took me to his solicitors, and told me what to say—he was in the room at the time—I made a statement to the solicitor; it was false—the evidence I gave before the Magistrate was true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Philip Saillard, feather manufacturer, 85, Aldersgate Street—these three lads were in our employment—on the 3rd May my attention was called to Grimley, and I spoke to him on the subject—some feathers were afterwards brought to me from behind his box—feathers are usually taken into a room below to be beaten, to get the starch out of them—the pith is taken out, and they are strung together, from 25 to 40 each—all these lads had access to them—Grimley had the opportunity of taking feathers away—they are easily put under the clothes in small quantities—the feathers found behind Grimley's box are worth about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each; the average of those in Court would be about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we have missed quite 1,000 of these in two or three months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of 29 Stanmore Street, Homers Town—on Saturday night, 11th May, about 11, I was walking in St. Pancras Road, when three men came behind me; one got hold of one shoulder, and one the other—they said, "Down with the b——," and I was pulled down to the ground on my back—one of them fell across my face, and hands went into my pockets—I had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose in my pocket, I had seen it about 12 minutes before when I was at King's Cross, at the corner of St. Pancras Road—as the men were going away I stuck to one of their legs, but my hold was broken—I called out "Police!"—I recognised the prisoner's face—he got away, and the constable brought him back in about a minute or two; he was one of the three—I missed my 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the key of my street door—I had had a little more drink that evening than I ought to have had, but I remember what happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been over in the Borough to see some friends, and was returning home—I had something to drink with my friends—the last public-house I was in was at King's Cross—I had only been in one public-house that day; that was the Blue-eyed Maid, in the Borough—I had two glasses of ale at the Brewers' Arms, in St. Pancras Road, about 6 o'clock; I then went and did up my horses—I was not the worse for drink then, but I had a glass or two at one place and another—I took out my money to pay for what I had—I don't remember hitting the prisoner on the nose, or hitting any one that night.</p>

I said "That is just what I want to know; I imagine you know what is the matter across the road"—he said "I have not done nothing; "I said" I did not say you had, but you will have to go across the road"—he said "I shan't"—I said "You will;" he said "I am a hard-working man"—I said "You are a perfect stranger to me, jou will have to go across the road"—I took hold of his arm, and he soon capsized me—I got up and we had a struggle, and then he went down—he then said "Governor, I will take your advice, and I will go across the road," and I said "I don't know what sort of a game you are having, but it is a fine game at present"—he got up on his feet and said "I will tell you the truth; I was walking along the road, and not saying a word to any one, and he hit me a knock on the nose, and I hit him a b——smack and knocked him down; he is a big man"—I</p>

I am a commission agent, and carry on business at No. 2, Well Court, in the Minories—I have been in the habit of selling copies of the German newspaper called the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>—I first of all purchased those copies from an office in Percy Street, then afterwards at Rose Street, and afterwards at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>, 101, Titchfield Street—I know the defendant, and I have seen his wife, Mrs. Most—I could not swear exactly to her—I have seen the defendant several times at Percy Street, also at Rose Street; several times I have seen him at Titchfield Street; I have bought some copies of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>—sometimes Mr. Most used to serve me, and sometimes somebody else used to be there—I bought a number of copies of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> with the red border round it of 19th March at the office in Titchfield Street—of the first edition I bought, I think it was four or five dozen, but of the second edition I could not get sufficient—I had an order for more than I could get—I think I bought two or three dozen of the second edition—I sold all those, and could have sold a great many more if I had them—I sold them in the ordinary way of business to my regular customers—I think they generally used to make a second edition of the red border—that used to come out every year upon the nominal day of the Revolution of 1848, of which I used to be a member—there had been no previous copy with a red border round it this year, but last year, on the same date, and every year on the nominal day, the 18th March, the date of the Revolution.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 29th of last month I went to 101, Great Titchfield Street—I saw the prisoner there—I asked for a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> of 19th March; I spoke to him in German—he said there were no more of those numbers left, that they had had printed a second edition, but for the sale of the few they might still get rid of it was not worth while printing any more—I told him that I had a friend or some one to whom I should like to give one—he then gave me two printed sheets, which he said contained the leading article, and he supposed that was the principal thing I wanted—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—he took them off a pile about four inches in depth on a shelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in plain clothes—I spoke German to him; I tried to look as like a German as possible—I asked for a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>; I told him it was the article with the red border round it—I said, "Will you oblige me with a copy if you have it, as I wish to send it to my friends?"—I wanted to buy it; the friend was a pretence—he then said they were all sold out—I was sorry for that—I did not say I was sorry; I looked it; I put on a regretful countenance—after a little conver<lb/>sation about trifles, he said, "I have got some left; some reprints," and he gave me two of them—the conversation was merely relating to the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>, but not on details that were written in it, because I had not read the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> myself before going into the shop—I had seen no other copy before; I had heard of it—the conversation by which I induced him to give me the copy was that I was very sorry he had not one, as I really wished to send my friend one or two if I could get them, and I could not find out where I could get them now—I had never watched this office of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> before; I had never seen or heard of the prisoner before—I am a detective, but not on duty in the City of London—I was never sent on this sort of duty before.</p>

I carry on business as a printer in Great Titchfield Street; I am in partnership with my brother there—I know Johann Most, the prisoner, by that name; I have known him two years, I should think—I was originally employed to print the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> by a person of the name of Weber; that was two years ago last Christmas—I knew the prisoner in connection with that newspaper about the time it was first commenced—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105230017"/>
               <p>simply came with others in reference to the matter, in the first instance—at first we used to set up the type from the written manuscript, and print—the prisoner has paid me personally for printing the newspaper—he first commenced to do so during the 12 months preceding last Christ<lb/>mas—during the year 1880 we printed 1,200 copies—it was a weekly paper—these are bills made out by me and addressed to Herr Most; they are bills for the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> newspaper, and other things are included—one is receipted; they are headed at the top, "August 17th, 1880, Herr Most," and then comes the charge—we altered the mode of business and ceased to set up the type at Christmas, 1879, or at the end of the year—the type was then set up in Percy Street, I believe, and afterwards at 101, Great Titchfield Street—the type so set up was brought to us for the purpose of being printed—prior to March, 1881, the prisoner continued his connection with the paper just the same, and continued to pay us—other persons besides the prisoner paid us; various people, at different times, called with the money—I believe I never made out the bills to any one but the prisoner—he himself used personally to come sometimes to pay for the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Freheit</hi>—his name appeared originally as editor of the newspaper, upon its face—it was reduced in size and then the name was removed and no other name appeared—Most's name appeared up to the end of 1879, I believe—I printed this article of 19th March—I do not understand German; I did not know its contents; I printed it as it was—I retained a copy; I can tell it by looking at it, because there is a signature upon it—that is the copy—for this copy the type came to us in the usual way from Titchfield Street—we printed two editions; the first numbering 1,200, the usual number, and the second 500, I think—we had printed a second edition before, I think, but not as a usual thing—we had never printed the paper with a red border before this; we had printed one on red paper, and we printed one, with red ink—that slip (<hi rend="italic">produced by police-constable</hi>) was not printed by me, but looking at it as a skilled witness I should say it was printed from the same type that was brought to us to print the copies from.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). On 30th March, at 4.45 p.m., I went to the house of Most in Titchfield Street—I saw him in the printing-office at the back of the yard—I asked him if he was Johann Most; he said "Yes"—I told him in English that I was an inspector of police, and had a warrant for his arrest—I asked him if he understood English well enough, or if I should read it in German; he said "You had better read it in German," and I did so—he called a man named Martin, a compositor, and made a few observations to him which I did not hear, and then he took what he had out of his pocket and put it on the bench before him—I told him he could not give those things to Martin, he must either place them back in his pocket or I must take possession of them—he left them on the bench, and I took them up—before I read the warrant he said "I expected this, because I see in this morning's paper there is to be a prosecution;" he had a morning paper in his hand—he said this in German—he said "I suppose this is in consequence of my article on the Czar;" I said "Yes, it is"—after I had read the warrant he said "It does not appear from that warrant who is the instigator of this"—I said "The warrant is signed by Sir James Ingham, the chief Magistrate at Bow Street, and I have to execute it, and that is all I know about it"—there was some type there set up ready for printing, and a quantity of loose type—I handed them to the witness Barrett—as I was about re<lb/>moving the type the prisoner said to me "Before you remove those things I beg to draw your attention to the fact that they are not my exclusive property; they belong to an association of persons, of whom I am one"—this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in this small pocket-book, which I took possession of—I then went into the front parlour, and saw some copies of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi> of 19th March found in that room—the prisoner was taken to the station, and asked in the usual way his name and occupation; he said "I am the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Freiheit</hi>, and a literary man."</p>

               <p>"Triumph! Triumph! the word of the poet has accomplished itself. One of the most abominable tyrants of Europe, to whom downfall has long since been sworn, and who therefore, in wild revenge breathings, caused innumerable heroes and heroines of the Russian people to be destroyed or imprisoned—the Emperor of Russia is no more. On Sunday last at noon, just as the monster was returning from one of those diversions which are wont to consist of eye-feastings on well-drilled herds of stupid blood-and-iron slaves, and which one calls military reviews, the executioner of the people, who long since pronounced his death sentence, overtook and with vigorous hand struck down the brute. He was once more on the point of drivelling about the 'God's finger,' which had nearly saved his accursed life, when the fist of the people stopped his mouth for ever. One of those daring young men whom the social revolutionary movement of Russia brought forth, Risakoff—with reverence we pronounce his name—had thrown under the despot's carriage a dynamite bomb, which effected a great devastation on the conveyance and the immediate neighbourhood, yet left the crowned murderer to pray uninjured. Michaelovitch, a princely general, and others at once fell upon the noble executor of the people's will. The latter, however, with one hand brandishes a dagger against the autocrat's face, and with the other hand guides the barrel of a revolver against the breast of the same. In an instant he is disarmed, and the belaced, be<lb/>tufted, and by corruption eaten through and through retinue of the Emperor breathe again on account of the supposed averted danger. There flies a new bomb neat this time. It falls down at the despot's feet, shatters for him the legs, rips open for him the belly, and causes among the surrounding military and civil Cossacks numerous wounds and annihilations. The personages of the scene are as if paralysed, only the energetic bomb-thrower does not lose his presence of mind, and is able safely to fly. The Emperor, however, is dragged to his palace, where yet for an hour and a half he is able, amid horrible sufferings, to meditate on his life full of crimes. At last he died. This in reference to the simple state of facts. Instantly the telegraph wires played up to the remotest corners of the earth to make the occurrence known to the whole world. The effect of this publication was as various as it was drastic. Like a thunderclap it penetrated into princely palaces, where dwell those crims-beladen abortions of every profligacy who long since nave earned a similar fate a thousandfold. For three years past has many a shot whistled by the ears of these monsters without harming them. Always and always again could they indemnify themselves in princely fashion for the fright endured by executions and regulations of the masses of all kinds. Nay, just in the most recent period they whispered with gratification in each other's ears that all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105230020"/>
               <p>danger was over, because the most energetic of all tyrant haters—the 'Russian Nihilists '—had been successfully exterminated to the last member.</p>
               <p>"Then comes such a hit! William, Prince of Prussia, the now Protestant Pope and soldier Emperor of Germany, got convulsions in due form from the excitement. Like things happened at other Courts. Howling and gnashing of teeth prevailed in every residence. But the other rabble, too, which in the other various countries pulls the wires of the Government mechanism of the ruling classes, experienced a powerful moral headache and melted in tears of condolence, whether it consisted merely of head lackeys on the steps of an Imperial throne or of Republican bandits of order of the first class. The whimpering was no less in France, Switzerland, and America than in Montenegro or Greece. A Gambetta carried through the adjournment of the Chambers, and thereby put an insult on France from which even Austria was saved by the then President of the Reichsrath. Public opinion is startled, and seeks in vain for the reasons of such a miserable attitude. One thinks of diplomatic motives and the like, but one misses the mark. Much, perhaps, may indeed have contributed here snd there which resembles mere political hypocrisy. In the main the grounds lie deeper. The supporters of the ruling classes see just in the destruction of an autocrat which has taken place more than the mere act of homicide itself. They are face to face with a successful attack upon authority as such. At the same time they all know that every success has wonderful power, not only of instilling respect, but also of inciting to imitation. From Constan<lb/>tinople to Washington they simply tremble for their long since forfeited heads. This fright is a high enjoyment for us; just as we have heard with the most joyful feelings of the heroic deed of those social revolutionaries of St. Petersburg who slaughtered the tyrant on Sunday last. In this time of the most general humility and woe, at a period when in many countries old women only and little children yet limp about the political stage with tears in their eyes, with the most loathsome fear in their bosoms of the castigating rod of the State night-watchman, now, when real heroes have become so scarce, such has the same effect on better natures as a refreshing storm. Let some say behind our backs we are carrying on a 'game with Nihilists'; let others blame us as cynical or brutal; yet we know that in expressing our joy at the successful deed we were disclosing not only our own feelings, but were also giving utterance to what millions of men, down-trodden and tyrannised over, thought with us when they read of the execution of Alexander. To be sure it will happen once and again that here and there even Socialists start up who, without that any one asks them, assert that they for their part abominate regicide, because such an one after all does no good, and because they are combating not persons, but institutions. This sophistry is so gross that it may be confuted in a single sentence. It is clear—namely, even to a mere political tyro, that State and social institutions cannot be got rid of until one has overcome the persons who wish to maintain the same. With mere philosophy you cannot so much as drive a sparrow from a cherry-tree any more than bees are rid of their drones by simple humming. On the other hand, it is altogether false that the destruction of a Prince is entirely without value because a substitute appointed beforehand forthwith takes his place. What one might in any case complain of is only the rarity of so-called tyrannicide. If only a single crowned wretch were disposed of every month, in a short time it should afford no one gratification henceforward still to play the monarch. Moreover, it is certainly a satisfaction for every right-thinking man when such a capital criminal is done away with—<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, is punished according to his evil deeds. It does not occur to the jurists of civil society to hang no murderer or to lock up no thief because it is proved that these punishments do not remove murder and theft (both institutions of this society) out of the world. When one has entirely to do with such a subject as Alexander Romanow was, then one must accept his destruction with double satisfaction. If one could believe newspaper writers, then one must, according to their chatter, take it that the extermi<lb/>nated Czar was a real pattern of benevolence. The facts prove that he belonged to the worst doers of abominations that have ever disgraced humanity. Some 100,000 men were banished to Siberia during his reign, dozens were hanged after they had suffered the cruellest tortures. All these victims the Russian Crown Moloch claimed only because those concerned were striving for the improvement of society, wishing for the general welfare, perhaps had only passed on a single forbidden book, or written one letter in which a censure on the Government was expressed. Out of the war abominations which this tyrant conjured up we take but one scene from the last Turkish war. Alexander was celebrating his name-day, and wished a warlike spectacle. He ordered a storming of Plevna. The generals ventured to call to mind that such an one would not only fail, but would cost an enormous number of men. In vain! The order stood good, and in order</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105230021"/>
               <p>to witness the slaughter with more gratification the tyrant caused a special stand with a kind of Imperial box to be erected for himself, whence he might watch the storring without himself falling into danger. The result corresponded with the predictions of the generals. The storming was repulsed, and 8,000 dead and wounded covered the ground outside the walls of Plevna. But the 'little father', as the despot by preference caused himself to be called, had amused himself cannibalistically. All petitions, all wishes for the introduction of ever so slight reforms which were almost daily laid at his feet, he only answered by fresh meannesses of an Asiatic Government barbarism. Genuine dragonades followed every warning or threat, attempted but unsuccessful attacks on his person increased his baseness to the monstrous. Who is scoundrel enough really to bewail the death of such a beast? But it is said, 'Will the successor of the smashed one do any better than he did? We know it not. But this we do know, that the same can hardly be permitted to reign long if he only steps in his father's footsteps. Yes, we could actually wish that it should so happen, for we hate the hypocritical, mock-liberal monarchs no less than the despots sans phrase,' because the former perhaps have still greater power of retarding the development of civilisation than the latter. In addition, the persistence of the new Czar in the old principle of government must forthwith double and treble its enemies, because in Russia there are a number of people of that sort which has believed in the Crown-Prince legend usual in all countries, and at all times, according to which the successor spoken of only awaits the moment when he may be able to pour over the people a whole horn of plenty, full of blessings. All these enthusiasts are forthwith converted when they see that the new ukases smell as much of Russian leather as the old. Meanwhile be this as it may, the throw was good, and we hope that it was not the last May the bold deed, which—we repeat it—has our full sympathy, inspire revolutionists far and wide with fresh courage. Let all think of Herwegh's words—</p>
               <p>" 'And where tyrants still exist " 'Then let us boldly seize them, " 'We have loved long enough, " 'And we wish at last to hate.' "</p>
               <p>The following is also a correct translation:—</p>
               <p>"The Social Revolutionary adherents of Most (it should be "advanced Socialists") have appointed for their next task to prepare, by the institution of widely-ramified and secret groups and clubs, limited to determined persons, acts of violence, according to the model of the Nihilists, against the representatives of State and social order, through the execution of which the universal revolution is to be introduced." I have looked at this piece of paper produced from the pocket-book—this is a correct translation, "Trieste is a safe address for the storage of dynamite"—at the top and at the end of the paper the prisoner's name appears, with the address, "Printed and published at 101, Great Titch<lb/>field Street, Oxford Street, W."</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 70, Coleman Street—I first knew Copsey, I think, in 1868—I made him advances in 1876 and 1877 on a bill of sale when he lived in Finborough Road—it was rather a large house, but there was not very much furniture—that bill remained unsatisfied up to the filing of the petition—I have only received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Sheriff, I think, was turned out once under the bill of sale—some little time before 10th June I went to the house in Brammerton Street; I did not see Copsey there—some new furniture was coming in, and either he or Madam Copsey proposed that I should advance as much as I was willing, and consolidate the other with a new bill of sale; 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the suggested amount, including what I had already advanced Mr. Weir, and I went over the furniture, and we put it down so that we might make an advance to bring the debt up to 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard that it came from Whiteley's—nothing came of the proposal; I did not carry it into effect, and on 10th June he filed his petition, of which I received notice in the ordinary way—I attended the meeting of 3rd July at Mr. Micklethwaite's office with my father's proxy; I was the only Mr. Crow there—I was subsequently appointed trustee by the Bankruptey Court—a committee of inspection was appointed at the meeting—Daniel Levy was in the room, and Mr. Edward Laurence Levy; they were holding proxies on behalf of creditors—on the advice of Mr. Willes we adopted the motion that was made to commit Mr. Whiteley for contempt of Court—ultimately the goods were returned, and Mr. Weir, who was my clerk, gave this receipt for them in my name—the Copseys continued to reside</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105230028"/>
               <p>at 16, Brammerton Street—I had a valuation of the goods in August; it amounted to 321<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gross—no suggestion had been made that I know of prior to that that the goods should be purchased on behalf of the debtor—I then wrote to Copsey on the subject of the valuation, and I no doubt saw him afterwards—it was said that no doubt some person would purchase the goods for his daughter, but the price mentioned by me was too high, and he stated that some of her goods were included in the valuation—I received an offer in writing from Mills and Carpenter in Brompton Road, and then got another valuation made by Dyson and Co., money lenders, of 23, Cornhill, who, said that what we could get over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would materially benefit the estate—I saw Madam Copsey after that, and if he came into the office I may have spoken to him—I did not tell her what Dyson's valued the furniture at; their valuation was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold it for 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a man who gives the name of Squeezy, of 6, Great Win<lb/>chester Buildings, City; that did not include Miss Copsey's goods or the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of plate—the plate was in Copsey's possession from the day I sold the furniture to the date of the hearing at the police-court, when I received it on behalf of the creditors—I gave Mr. Squeezy a receipt for the 205<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have never seen him since—I received bank-notes—I have not paid any dividends—about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are left—this is how the money was expended (<hi rend="italic">Handing in a list</hi>)—I paid myself 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have also entered, "Trustee, remuneration, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" that is myself—I have received nothing from the sale of the furniture—Mr. Whiteley's plate was returned—the furniture is still at 16, Brammerton Street, and they are living there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My bill of sale is registered, and it had to be paid before anything could be done—the first valuation was by Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">Dated September</hi> 4, 1880)—I once or twice asked Copsey to pay off the old bill of sale—the largest valuation was assuming that the goods could be sold on the premises, but they could not be—Copsey's daughter is about 16; she is on the stage—I understood that the furniture was to be bought for her—Copsey was actually living there as far as I know—he has obtained a situation at a tobacconist's since the filing of the petition—his wife and daughter lived there—I know my own goods, and I saw them again afterwards, and some new things—I have gone through Whiteley's account; the total is 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with deductions, leaving a balance of 417<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took out items on a sheet of paper for ladies' clothing, amounting to about 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not lend on wearing apparel, and I never saw it at all.</p>

George Funk speak at the police-court, and the voice was the same—his figure was just the same, but I do not know his face—the light I first saw was not in the room the man came out of, but under it.</p>

I am an engineer, belonging to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, stationed at Whitecross Street—I was called to this fire about 8.5 p.m., and went with a hose-truck and escape to 45, Barbican, and five minutes afterwards another escape and hose-truck came—our station is only 200 yards away, and I got there three minutes after the alarm—the house was padlocked; I ordered a man to get an axe; a man asked me if he should get the key; I said "Yes," and while he was gone I got the axe, broke the padlock off, and went upstairs to the second floor—the floors of both the second-floor rooms were fairly on fire, and particular spots were burning more than the rest; I ordered the engine to work and extinguish the fire; the floor and all the partitions were on fire they were of wood—I crawled along the floor, the place being full of smoke, to the double door leading to the leads; you pass one room door before you come to the other; I believe the first door was secured top and bottom by bolts; one door was, but I can't say which; I believe both were secured—I went out on to the leads with another fireman, with a lantern in my hand—I looked round on the leads, went some few feet, and then we both returned to the room with our lamps in our hand, and in six or seven minutes a person entered the room from the leads; we were then turning over the fire and extinguishing any little fire we could, find: the man passed, making his way towards the staircase without speaking; the door he was making for was all burnt away, and it was all open—as he passed me I put my hand on his shoulder and asked him what he was doing there; I could hardly understand what he stated, as he spoke very indifferent English: at last, after a while, I got out of him. that he came there to settle a bill; he said, "I was upstairs along with Mr. Funk, junior, and he went away, and I was making myself a cigarette to smoke, and before I had finished smoking it I saw some smoke coming up the staircase, and I went and got out at the back attic window on to the leads; I came here to settle a bill which has been due for three weeks"—Goldman is the man—I communicated that to the officer in charge of the premises, leaving Goldman in charge of the senior engineer; we then went and informed Inspector Foster, the chief superintendent—when I returned to the. room I found Goldman on the leads with Frogden and Johnson and several other firemen; I did not hear what passed—they all came in together, and went downstairs—I went to the station with</p>

               <p>Goldman—I returned next morning to the premises, went into the top room, and examined the window; it is a casement window, opening like a door; the glass had been broken by some one inside, and not by the fire—on the Tuesday night after the fire was extinguished, and before I saw Goldman, I saw that the gas was full on from the main, and the end of the pipe looked melted away, and the delivery pipe also; the cock was turned full on; there was an iron pipe on the meter side; the gas was escaping—about six weeks before this I was called to the same premises, about 10.30 a.m.; a fire was then burning in the front room second floor—the printer's people were engaged in extinguishing it when I got there, and not much damage Was done—when Goldman came into the room from the leads he passed Johnson before he came to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fireman, of Whitecross Street—on 8th March I assisted in extinguishing the fire at 45, Barbican—after it was extinguished I was very hot, and went out on the leads to have a blow; Bane had been there before me; while I was standing at the door a man passed me—Dane, who was then in the room, stopped him, put his hand on his shoulder, and said "What are you doing?"—I could not under<lb/>stand what the man answered, but shortly afterwards he was brought but on the leads with two or three of our men—Goldman is the man—I followed them behind; they had a conversation, and I understood Gold<lb/>man to say that he had come there to settle a bill with Mr. Funk; he mentioned Mr. Funk's name, and to the best of my recollection he said it was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the police officer then came, and he was taken away from the leffcis into custody—he was about five or six feet from the staircase when Dane stopped him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of health and public analyst for the City of London—on 12th March I received this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Wright, containing a lot of charred paper and pieces of rag, remnants mixed up as they are now; it was about three</p>

               <p>times the size which it now is; a greasy substance was smeared over them which was mixed with water—these are the fragments of a material known as swansdown, which has a fluffy appearance, and that was tied in bundles as this is; the paper was chiefly newspaper smeared over with some greasy substance, and saturated with moisture—the general bundle was moist as if it had been wetted with water; the swansdown was moist, but I did not observe the greasy substance there; it had a very strange smell of burning and also of paraffin—between the time of my getting the Magistrate's order to analyse it and my doing so next day it was placed in a closed cupboard in my laboratory for 24 hours still intact and, not knowing what it contained, I asked my assistant if he had upset a lamp, as I was met by a very strong smell of paraffin; the parcel was then intact—I untied it, and took about a quarter of the whole; I divided my operation into two processes—I first filled a retort with fragments of the materials, between two and three pints of it cut very small; I subjected that to the process of dry distillation at the temperature of boiling water, and from that I distilled between three and four ounces of a fluid, of which this bottle contains one-half—I burnt it, and found it contained a spirit of hydro-carbon nature, which is a constituent of paraffin, but it was mixed with water in certain proportions—I burnt it as I should a spirit lamp, and it gave a very black flame, peculiar to hydro-carbon spirit, and it had also had the smell of it—my second process was simply to boil in an open vessel another fourth of the same material at the temperature of 212° Fahr., or boiling water, and at the end of 10 hours I got a distinct film of pure paraffin wax, which is contra-distinguished from the oil; it has the physical characteristics of spermaceti—in my opinion that was solid paraffin; it is called paraffin wax—I think the parcel had been smeared over with paraffin oil, but scarcely saturated—I could form no idea how much paraffin had been used; if the whole of the moisture was from paraffin I should have got a much larger quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR H. GIFFARD</hi>. Paraffin is distilled from coal and shale; it represents a solid form and a liquid form—all mineral oils would not produce the same result—paraffin chemically is a hydro-carbon in which hydrogen combines in the highest form that it will combine with carbon. (<hi rend="italic">Giving the chemical formula.</hi>) Benzole is one of the hydro-carbons, and is known commercially as benzoline; it varies in purity; it is also called belmontine and benzine—the base is popularly known as benzoline and benzole; that would not be chemically pure, it is very often adulterated with naphtha—it has half a dozen different names in common, and a great many more than half a dozen degrees of purity—impure benzoline would not produce the chemical results which I found—such a flame as I found would not be found from adulterated benzoline—I have not the least recollection of saying so before the Magistrate; I did not say "Benzoline is a dear and pure oil, such a flame might be found in adulterated benzoline, "my deposition is not taken correctly, a portion of it was read over to me, and a mutilated part of it—very likely I did say so, I can't recollect; but it is highly improbable that such a flame would be found from adulterated benzoline—benzoline is extensively adulterated—it is familiarly known to be used by furriers and other persons when they want to get rid of grease—the operation is this: the fat is taken up by the benzoline, as it would be by ether, it dissolves the grease when it finds itself in contact with it, and it is held in solution, and can be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105230045"/>
               <p>recovered by evaporating the benzoline—I do not think paraffin would have that effect, but I won't speak positively, I have not tried it—a mixture of benzoline and paraffin would have the same effect in a lesser degree; the benzole would seize a portion of the fat, and the paraffin would remain intact—paraffin has not the effect of dissolving grease, but I do not speak experimentally—I do not know whether benzole is more expensive than paraffin, because I never bought either, except for chemical purposes—I cut the substances in pieces about the size of a nut before putting them into the retort—when I said the grease was smeared over I meant that there was a trace of a person, having intentionally smeared it over; I say that some substance of a greasy nature was spread over the pieces of rag—I do not mean as if there had been oil on the floor, and it had been wiped up with paper; it was more uniformly spread over the paper, as if produced by the action of smearing; it certainly was not done in the way you describe, because if oil was poured on this it would go right through to the under-layers, but it was very distinct from the water—what I mean by smears is that oil had passed through the paper in some way—I won't say it was saturated, because it was not all over it—the oil had gone through successive layers of paper, principally newspaper—this had not the appearance of that which I analysed—I do not see any<lb/>thing like it here; this piece looks a little more like it than any of the others, but it has not the fresh grease which it had then—I think I ought to say that I took the worst portions for the purpose of analysis, I took those most affected—this is not in its original condition, it is dried up, but subject to that effect it is as it was when it came to me; it is stiff now, which has curled up the cardboard—if you were to empty this oil on your brief it would gradually spread all over it, assuming the fluid to be of the same density—by smearing I mean that it had spread by capillary attraction or in some other way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If I had subjected benzole to the same experiment I should not expect to find so much film or paraffin wax; in fact, benzole boils at 187 deg. Fahr., and consequently would not have come over into the receiver for distillation at 212 degrees—I do not consider the fluid which I found there efficacious for removing grease from furn.</p>

He came to 53, King Street two days ago yesterday. He told me to wash and dress, then he would take me out and make me a present of a mantle and dress. We first went to Jay's about 3 p.m. I got a mantle from there for six and a half guineas. We paid by cheque. Then we went to Marshall and Snellgrove's, and bought a hat and a pair of gloves.

"He told me he would buy me a mantle, and he done so, and paid 12 1/2 guineas for it. He bought me a dress as well; the bill came to 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he paid by cheque. We then went to 53, King Street, taking the things between us. I took the dress out of the box and gave it to Madame Poli to pawn—Madame and I then went to the pawn-shop at the corner of a court in Wardour Street—I waited outside, and Madame went in to pawn the dress, but she came out and told me that they wanted to see the receipt. We then went back to 53, King Street, and not being able to find the bill, Dave, Madame, and I came to 136 for another, Dave waiting outside.

I am a surgeon, of 55, Kentish Town Road—Blackwell was brought to my surgery about 1.30 on 4th May suffering from a wound in his left thigh, about six inches from the joint; it was punctured and incised, there was very great hæmorrhage; it was about 2 1/2 inches deep, and might have been inflicted with the large blade of this knife—it was dangerous from its position and from the hæmorrhage; it was very near the femoral artery, and if it had punctured that he would have died in the street—I sent him to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Store Street, Bedford Square; I keep the West of England Loan and Discount Office—about 6th December a Mr. Coghlan called and asked me if I would entertain a loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his landlord, Mr. F. Reading—I said I should be pleased to entertain the application if the security was good; I asked what references he could give me—he said, "You do not want much reference, if you refer to the Directory you will find his name there; he has been a householder for many years, and all the furniture belongs to him at 7 and 9, Lancaster Road"—I referred to the Directory—he arranged for me to send some one in the afternoon—I sent Mr. Cook—the next day I went myself, between 11 and 12 o'clock, to No. 7—Johnson opened the door—I asked if Mr. Reading was in; she said, "No"—I said, "Can you tell me where he is; I have called in reference to a loan he required"—she said, "He told me he expected somebody; kindly take a seat in the front room"—I said, "Does this furniture belong to Mr. Reading?"—she said, "It does"—I said, "Is he the householder?"—she said, "He is"—I said, "May I</p>

               <p>ask who you are?"—she said, "I am his housekeeper"—I was there about ten minutes—I then went by the side of the stairs and told her I could not wait, I would call back in half an hour, and told her to ask him to wait, as I had called according to appointment—when I returned I saw Harris in the front room—I said, "I have called respecting the loan; I have called to see the furniture in reference to the application for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I had not seen Harris before—he took me upstairs, and showed me some of the bedrooms—when I came down I said, "I should like to see the receipts, for the rent and for the furniture and whatever receipts you have—he gave me these receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of a side table.

Reading, and I let him have the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was to be charged the furniture—while the negotiation was going on, Cogahn came into the front office—I said, "Do you know Reading is inside there?"—he said, "No; I did not"—I said, "He wants a further loan of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; is he right for that amount?"—he said, "Well, you have been through the furniture; you cannot have any fear at all in the matter"—this cheque is part of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid, the rest was in cash. (<hi rend="italic">This was in favour of F. Reading and H.

               <p>went into my private office, and I arranged to make a further loan of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Harris said, "Now, when will it be convenient for you to send your solicitor and clerk to get this bill of sale attested? she never leaves the house; she has undertaken to look after the house for me, and to look after the lodgers"—I sent a solicitor and a clerk named Phllipson for the bill of sale—he brought back this bill of sale. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st February, for a further sum of</hi> 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">the amount to be repaid being</hi> 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—the interest was about 25 per cent.—Phillipson made a communication to me, in con<lb/>sequence of which I sent him back with another clerk—two or three days afterwards I went and saw Mrs. Johnson—I said, "What is the meaning of this?"—she said, "You have nothing to do with the furniture here; you have been <hi rend="italic">had</hi>; you have not got the right Beading?"—I said, "What did you mean by telling me he was the householder and you were his housekeeper, and the furniture belonged to him?"—she said, "I did say so, but I was not obliged to tell you," and she walked out of the room—I called her back and said, "Have you a portrait of the original Mr. Reading?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Surely you have got a por<lb/>trait of your nephew in the house?"—she said, "Well, I will go and see"—she went out and brought photographs of three men—I had asked her, "What sort of a man is your nephew?"—she said, "He is a clean-shaved man"—when she brought the photographs, I asked her to point out her nephew, and she pointed out some one with a beard—I said, "You told me your nephew was clean shaved?"—she looked again and said, "Oh, I have made a mistake; it is the middle one"—I looked at the middle one—I said, "You are playing some game with me; I must have some<lb/>thing to show this furniture belongs to you; unless you show me or give me' some note that it belongs to you, I shall instruct the auctioneer to take possession"—she said that it was hers—I said, "Let me have a paper to show that you claim the property—she was reluctant to do so, but she afterwards showed me this paper. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I, Mary Johnson, do claim all the furniture at 7, Lancaster Road, and formerly 7, West-bourne Road, Lancaster Road, which I have paid for, and can show bills to prove. Mary Johnson, 7th February, 1881.") I said, "I must see Reading; I have asked three or four times, and cannot get to see him; I must place the matter in the hands of my solicitor"—I asked where Mr. Reading was—she said, "Oh, in Oxford; sometimes he goes away for weeks and weeks; it is very difficult to see him"—I asked who it was that signed—she said it was a man named Harris—I said, "Does he live here?"—she said, "No; he does not"—I said, "Well, it is jolly strange Mr. Harris should show me right over the house, living here, and being well acquainted with it"—she smiled—Reading subsequently called at my office and said, "Do you know me?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Have I signed anything? because I have never seen you before; I am Mr. Reading"—I said, "Are you Mr. Reading; I have just received an anonymous letter showing that you are implicated in the matter, although you have not signed the paper"—I knew the writing of the letter; it was the same party who signed the deed—I showed him the letter and said, "Here it is, showing you are a party to this affair, and that you changed the cheque at Mr. Rowley's, the pawnbroker's—he said, "Did I?" and walked out—I told him I would take proceedings against the whole lot—on 1st February I advanced 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash, and I gave him a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. marked "Not negotiable"—I have seen that cheque, in the</p>

I have been a money-lender about three years on my own account—I have been four or five years in the business, and have had a great many cases of money-lending, in each of which I have made a great many inquiries, and have been to the houses of different people to see that things were right—I have had a great many conversations with a great variety of people in those cases; I did not take notice of them—I had nothing to do with Thornton till he became a witness—I never saw a woman named Saunders; my clerk did—Coghlan told me that Mr. Beading was landlord of 6, 7, and 9 Lancaster Road; he did not mention Mrs. Johnson then; I only referred to one directory—Mrs. Johnson opened the door when I went; she was rather inquisitive, and said, "Who are you?"—she said she expected some<lb/>body: I had nobody else to make inquiries of—I am almost positive I told her that Mr. Beading wanted a loan; she might have been a ledger for what I knew—I adhere to the statement I made at the police-court—I said, "Can you send anybody for them?" she said, "Nobody is in"—I said, "I will call in half or three-quarters of an hour"—when I asked for Mr. Reading she said, "I am his housekeeper;" she did not say that she was housekeeper to Nos. 7 and 9—I asked her if the furniture belonged to him; she did not say, "I do not see that I have any questions to answer you"—she seemed by her manner to be anxious about the loan—I don't think she looked upon me with suspicion—I have been active enough to detect a great many, but I was not sharp enough in this case—when I returned in three-quarters of an hour Harris let me in; he said, "This (Mrs. Johnson) is the occupier of these two houses, and lets them to lodgers"—I knew she had lodgers, but I under<lb/>stood</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. I do not always find persons truthful who want advances of money—they often say that their property is of more value than it actually is, but very likely they pay—I know Coghlan's father; I lent him some money—I have seen him since this fraud—Coghlan has not been apprehended, though the detectives have had my clerk's assistance—Coghlan introduced Harris as Reading, personally, but not at first—he said "My landlord, Mr. Reading, wants a loan"—the two were in the room at the same time—the advance of the first 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was on 7th December, and the first installment was due on 7th January, and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid on account—the second bill of sale was on 1st February—the information was sworn on the 14th—after discovering the fraud I directed my clerk to go and see Mrs. Johnson—I did not direct him to take possession under my bill of sale—I said "If you claim the furniture let me have it in writing"—I threatened to take possession, and then she gave me the writing—I had sent Cook before that—when Harris produced the two receipts I believe he took them from a side table—I don't think he went out of the room while I was there—I don't think he went downstairs, but he went upstairs to show me through the furniture—I said "I swear the receipt was not brought from the kitchen," and I don't believe it was—I went up with him to the bedroom to see the furniture, and it was after we came down again that the receipts were produced—I do not remember his ever leaving my company—when I called after the second bill, and was told that Reading was not there, I said "If Mr. Reading does not call up I shall put the matter into the hands of my solicitor"—she said "You can't see him"—he called next day and said "I am Mr. Reading"—I believe he added "the original Reading"—he afterwards said "Have I signed any</p>

               <p>paper? "—directly I found out the conspiracy I placed the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I should have been very glad at that time to get the money back—no suggestion was made that if the loans were returned the case would probably never go to trial, or that it might go from session <hi rend="italic">to</hi> session, and a little money might pass and the case never go to trial—the real Reading called at my office about the 8th or 9th February, handed me a card, and said "Do you know me? "—I said "No, I have never seen you before"—he said "I am Mr. Reading"—I then told him about this business, and he said "I know nothing about the matter; I have nothing to do with it"—I forgot that on Saturday—I said "Oh, you have changed the cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with Mr. Rowley, the pawnbroker"—he said after a time, hesitating, "Yes, I did change that cheque," not "Did I? "—I said on Saturday that he said "Yes, I did,"and laughed and went out; what difference is there?</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Acland Road, Notting Hill, and work for my lather, a bookbinder's clerk—I know my friend, James Hayes, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Harris, and I have known Mrs. Johnson five or six months, and Reading about the same time—I have known Coghlan more than five or six years; he lived at 107, Lancaster Road—I don't know where Harris was living—I know Mrs. Sanders as a friend of Mrs. Johnson's, but do not know where she lives—on 23rd December I met Harris at Notting Hill, and met him afterwards in the City by arrangement, at the Ship, I think it is, at the end of Moorgate Street—Mr. Benton was with him, I do not know who he is; and Charles Coghlan and Reading—Harris asked Reading for the money which he required; he said "I can't pawn my <hi rend="italic">bleeding</hi> watch for you, <hi rend="italic">go</hi> and get the money where you got the previous sum, at the West of England Bank;"that is Mr. Blai<lb/>berg's office—I went there with Harris; he went in, and left me outside—he came out, and said "They will want your name in there to a pro<lb/>missory note for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,"and he said he would pay me the sovereign he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188105230092"/>
               <p>owed me—I went in and signed this promissory note—this is my signature, and Harris signed it "F. Reading"—I asked him why he did so, and when we came outside he said that Reading had given him authority to get the previous money in his name, and had given him authority to go and sign his name—Mr. Blaiberg, I believe, gave this cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment of the amount in favour of Messrs. Thornton and Reading—this endorsement, "H. Thornton,"is my writing, and I believe the "F. Reading "is <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Coghlan's—Reading cannot write very well; I have never seen him write his name, and never heard him say whether he can write or not—from Mr. Blaiberg's office we went to a public-house a few doors off, where we found Reading and Coghlan—we then all four took a cab, which I paid for, up to Blagrove Road, Notting Hill, and spent part of the evening together—Harris was slightly inebriated, and there was a conversation between him and Reading, and then Coghlan and Harris had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—Reading asked Harris what he went in there for; Harris said "I went and got the money for you, as you asked me to"—there was a good deal more conversation which I don't remember—during the evening Harris was leaning his head down on the table, and I saw Reading take the cheque out of Harris's pocket—Harris was in<lb/>capable of seeing it done—he called on me next day, and said that I had the cheque; I told him that I had not, but I had seen Reading take it out of his pocket—Reading called on me next day, and said that Harris told him I had the cheque in my possession.; I told him that I saw him take it out of Harris's pocket—a few days after that Reading called on me, and wanted me to write a letter to the County Bank, where the cheque was payable, to clear the cheque, and he offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to do it; I said that I would not have anything to do with it—I then went to Reading's, 7, Lancaster Road, he and Harris were there—Reading asked me to write a letter to the bank to clear the cheque; I would not do it, and he offered Harris 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to do it—I did not then know that an advance had been got from Mr. Blaiberg on a bill of sale—just after the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque Reading told me that Feast or Frost, of Finsbury Square, had written to him to tell him he had got a bill of sale on his house, and if he should want instalments paid up he would lend him the money to do it; it was a printed paper, and he has it now—I have heard him say "Here is a paper here. I can always get the money to pay my instal<lb/>ments"—I talked over the matter with Harris before 5th February—I had put my name on the promissory note, and I wanted to know how I was situated; you have not gone into that evidence—about the beginning of February I went to 7, Lancaster Road, and saw Mrs. Johnson, F. Reading, Coghlan, and a man named Murray in the kitchen—I heard Reading tell the girl to go and show a gentleman about the house who was coming about the whitewashing—nothing was said about what "whitewashing"meant—Harris came down stairs, and put a paper before Reading, who told him what to write on it—Harris asked Reading who the landlord was, and Reading said "I believe it is Williams, of Ham<lb/>mersmith," and directly Harris went upstairs Reading turned round to me, and said "Can't you be the landlord?" I declined—the whitewashed name was not mentioned—I cannot tell the exact date—both Harris and Reading told me that Mr. Isaacs was coming that day—some time after<lb/>wards I was at the Burlington Hotel, Bayswater, with Harris and Coghlan; Reading came in with a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., marked "Not nego<lb/>tiable"—I</p>

               <p>cannot tell who it was drawn by, I did not see it closed enough—Reading said "They have been round to 7, Lancaster Road, and have seen the right Mrs. Johnson"—a day or two afterwards <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi> Coghlan asked me to call at Lancaster Road, which I did, and saw Mrs. Johnson; she said "They've put in, and I have got the brokers here, but I will soon put them out"—I asked her whether an instalment was not due; she said that she knew it was not due yet—I asked her about the amount; she said that she did not know it was as much as it was—Reading said that he had taken his watch and chain and some other jewellery out with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque which he got out of the bill of sale—I was with Harris at the Alexandra Hotel, Bayswater, on the evening of the day when Mrs. Johnson appeared, and Reading put in a certificate saying that he was too ill to appear—Reading came in there, and said to Harris "You fancy yourselves b clever writing that letter to Blaibere, I will put you in the hole for it"—Coghlan was there—Reading said a lot more—he had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—he told Harris that he had no right to write to Mr. Blaiberg about the affair, and if we and Coghlan had only kept out of the way they could get clear off—this anonymous letter is in Harris's writing—I saw it written after Harris found out that Reading did not intend to pay the money back that he had had on his supposed furniture. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 8th February</hi>, 1881, <hi rend="italic">and stated that the money was borrowed for the people at</hi> 7, <hi rend="italic">Lancaster Mood, and that the cheque for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was paid to Mr. Rowley, the pawnbroker, and that if the screw was put on every penny advanced would be repaid.</hi>)</p>

Reading at the back of the cheque is not mine; it looks very like Charley Coghlan's, but I have not seen him write in this way; it looks like his, it might pass for his—I did not commission anybody to write my name—this is not Harris's writing—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque marked "Not negotiable "is made out to F. Reading and M. A. Johnson—I do not know whose writing this "F. Reading "is at the back of it; I have no idea—I said at the police-court "The F. Reading at the back seems to me to be in the writing of Harris;" but that was the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, not the cheque I said just now was in Coghlan's writing—I said the "Thornton" was in Coghlan's writing—Coghlan stayed at Mrs. Johnson's from the end of November to February 5th, when he came to lodge with me for three or four nights—I cannot tell you the date, as I did not charge him—I have here in my pocket-book "C. Coghlan came to stay with me the day the bailiffs were put in at Lancaster Place"—that was 7th February, not the 8th—I won't let you look at the memorandum. (<hi rend="italic">Putting it into his pocket</hi>)—this is only a summons which was left at my house for Charley Coghlan; you won't see it. (<hi rend="italic">Handing it to the Judge</hi>)—I took a message to Mrs. Johnson from Coghlan on 5th February, and she told me that the brokers were in—this diary has not the date on it because it is a new one; if I were to let you see it, you might see too much—the other is destroyed—I destroyed it because I wanted to—I had got nothing in it about this case, it was about something else.</p>

I went out to New Zealand on 28th February, 1878, on business engagements—I was working for my father before that—I never give cheques—my mother died and left me some money, and I spent it in going to New Zealand—I never forged a cheque—I knew Harris some years before that; he was, I believe, working for an auctioneer—I knew him when I first came up from Manchester with my father, who was a resident in Manchester, and I worked for him in London as clerk at St. Stephen's Chambers, Telegraph Street—he was then an autioneer's agent—the firm was Henry Mann and Co.—when I came back from New Zealand the commission agency was not going on—my father was and still is a bookbinder's cloth manufacturer in Bowling Green Lane—I am with him still—since I came back from New Zealand I have seen Mr. Mann; it was an old-established business at St. Stephen's Chambers; there was nothing of a long firm about it—Henry Mann and Co. can stand against anybody—while I was with Mann I met Harris as a friend, but had no business transactions with him—I was frequently with him in the evening, but had no idea what business he was carrying on—I knew his mother and sister and all his friends—I wish the Jury to under<lb/>stand that I am the dupe of Harris, and Harris is the dupe of Reading—Harris and Coleman are both old friends of mine—I knew him as Haines first, only as Harris recently—I never knew him as Lloyd or Russell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer—early in February I went to 7, Lancaster Road, with Mr. Blaiberg, who said to Mrs. Johnson, "You remember when I came here some time ago to inquire for Mr. Reading?" she said, "Yes, and Mr. Reading was out, but said he would be in shortly;"he said, "I asked you who you were, and you said, 'I am Mr. Reading's housekeeper,' why did you say that?" she said, "I was not obliged to tell you the truth;" he said, "Is Mr. Reading the occupier?" she said, "Yes;" he said, "Now, tell me the truth?" she said, "I shall not tell you any more about it;" he said, "What sort of a man is your nephew whom you speak of?" she said, "He is a short and rather fair man, with very light whiskers, I think I can show you who he is by a photograph,"which she fetched, and told him that that was her nephew; he said, "This does not look very much like a short fair man;" she said, "I have made a mistake, perhaps this is the one," pointing out another; he asked her what had become of the money, and called her attention to a sideboard and goods taken out of pledge from Mr. Rowley by money obtained from him; she said, "That sideboard was not taken out of pledge with money received from you"—that was the last time I saw Mrs. Johnson, but I had seen her several times before—I questioned her very seriously about Mr. Reading, and until then I never understood that there was a second person representing himself to be Mr. Reading.</p>

I live at Halfway Street, Bexley—on Saturday evening, 14th May, I saw the prisoner chasing his wife on a piece of waste ground against Pope Street Railway Station—I had never seen them before—he was carrying a dog—she was running, and he too—I saw him pull her down by the hair of her head, and he kicked her somewhere on the back of the head or neck, I could not see exactly where—she did not make any sound or cry—he only kicked her once; he fell on his back as he kicked her—I never saw her move afterwards—her hat fell off as she fell—the prisoner got up and picked his dog up and then stood by his wife—after a little while he said he was sorry, and asked her to get up—I did not hear her make any reply—they told him she was dying—I did not believe she was, I thought she was only fainting; I went to her and held her head and somebody fetched some water—I never heard the prisoner say anything more—constable and other persons came up; the prisoner remained there till the constable took him into custody—I was there all the while—the kick seemed a very light kick, for as he fell his foot seemed to slip by the side of her head; it wa not a very hard kick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were running from me across the ground towards the bridge; they were side face to me—I heard no quarrelling—the piece of waste ground was between us—they both seemed to have had drink—it did not seem like her dress that he caught hold of—I was not close to them—I saw a bag and a purse fall out of the woman's hand as she ran, and the dog fell out of the prisoner's arm—the woman fell on her side and the prisoner fell on his back; I saw his feet go up when he fell—when I got up to them he was standing there—I did not hear him say he thought she had a fit—she fell on the grass, not on the pavement—I never heard her speak.</p>

I am a carpenter, and live at 23, Pelham Terrace, Eltham—between 6 and 7 o'clock on this Saturday night I saw the prisoner chasing his wife across a piece of waste ground—I saw him take hold of her dress or shawl, then she fell, and then he kicked her once on the head—I should call it a hard kick—I don't remember that be fell; she raised her head once and then dropped beck—I was at the back of my house, standing against the palings; when I first saw them they were running towards me—to the best of my memory I heard the prisoner say</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went over when there was a lot of people there; that was about two minutes afterwards—I say to the best of my memory he said he would make her remember kicking the dog—no one has told me that he said so—I have heard people talking about it—I don't remember his falling; it all took place in an instant—I don't remember seeing his feet go up in the air and his falling on his back—I don't remember the dog being under his arm till after the accident—I don't remember seeing anything in the woman's hand—I never saw any basket—I didn't see him catch hold of her dress as she was falling—I saw a purse on the ground afterwards, where she fell—the place where the woman fell was about six yards from where I stood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Brooks, a butcher, of Pelham Terrace, Eltham—on this Saturday evening, in consequence of hearing something, I went out into my back yard—I saw a woman lying on the ground and the prisoner standing by—I went at once and got a glass of water and gave it to a girl over the fence, and then I went round to the woman; she appeared to be dying—I said to the prisoner "Are you sorry for what you have done?" he said "No, it served her right"—he asked for a doctor to be sent for—I remained with the woman. till she was taken away—she died while I was by her, in seven or eight minutes—I did, not know her before—her hair was plaited behind, it was hanging rather loosely—I saw a dog in the prisoner's arms—I did got hear him say anything about it—the policeman came up and the woman was carried into a cottage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could see that the prisoner had been drinking; he appeared not to know that she was dying—he said he thought she had a fit; he did not say she had been subject to fits—I did not hear him say he was sorry it had happened, and ask her to get up—she was lying partly on her back and side; she did not speak at all; she appeared to be quite insensible.</p>

On this Saturday evening, about 6.30, I was riding on the Maidstone Road—in consequence of information, I rode to the piece of vacant ground, got off my horse, and went to the deceased—I found her lying on the ground on her back; her head and shoulders were supported by Mrs. Brooks, and a number of people were round her; the prisoner was standing a short distance behind the crowd—I felt the woman's pulse; I could just feel it beating—her lips were black, and her eyes open and fixed—the people pointed to the prisoner and said, "That is the man that did it; that is the man that kicked her"—I went to him and said, "Your wife is dying fast," at the same time taking him into custody—he said, "Never mind me, send for a doctor; I shan't run away"—I took him over to the house of Sergeant Hawkes, which is nearly opposite, and left him in his custody, and at once galloped on to the doctor's surgery, about one and a quarter miles distance—I told Dr. Ford what had occurred, and immediately galloped back—he afterwards came—the woman appeared to be dead when I got back—she was taken into</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at Eltham—on Saturday evening, about 7.15, I was sent for to see the deceased, at Pope Street—she was lying on a bed in a house, quite dead—I examined her, but noticed no external marks of violence—I made a post-mortem examination the following morning—I then saw no external marks of violence—there was no fracture of the skull; there was a considerable effusion of blood within the cranium at the base of the brain, and a clot in each lateral ventricle—I believe the cause of death was extravasation, of blood within the brain, tile effect of the blow which she had received—a violent kick or blow would account for the appearances I saw—death following so soon it would not be so likely that external marks Would be found—she had rather luxuriant tresses of dark hair, in a somewhat tangled condition, I found a hair pin, it had evidently been curled up into a knot—all the organs of the body were in a very healthy state, with the exception of slight pleuritic adhesions on both sides of the chest; these were not recent, and had nothing to do with the cause of death—she was in an early stage of pregnancy—I could not trace the actual rupture of the vessel in the brain.</p>

               <p>some abraison, unless it had been intercepted—the effusion would be the result of the breaking of some small blood-vessel—excitement would no doubt render a person liable to a rupture* of a vessel—there was nothing in the post-mortem appearances to show that she had been subject to fits—the black appearance of the lips would mainly be the result of effusion; the effusion would cause insensibility—I should say there must have been considerable external violence to cause that effusion.</p>

I said "Wait and see"—that was after we made the fresh agreement—I cannot recollect when that list was given to me—it was on a Monday morning—I would not swear it was 11th April—I was not satisfied that the list contained all the the moneys he had received and not accounted for—it was in consequence of that I took proceedings against him—I commenced to find out the extent of his defalcations by writing to mycustomers—I had my reasons for taking preceautions to prevent myself being wronged in prosecuting the prisoner—I took a solicitor's advice.</p>

I said, "Yes"—we went to the Post-office together; he filled up one form for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw some mistake, and called his attention to it, and he tore the form up and gave me one to fill up for him at his dictation—I filled up this form (No. 66,549)—he directed me to put in 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if his name was spelt Maxted; he said, "No, Maxped, with a 'p'"—the whole of the manuscript is my writing—the prisoner sealed it up, and asked me to put it in the box—I posted it in his presence—the address on the form is printed—we remained together about an hour and a half—he went back to Charing Cross station with me—he said at first he was going back by the train, then that he had a free pass on the boat—he said, "I do not know what I shall do without the money, as I have none, could you lend me some?"—I said, "I cannot think of doing so, as you are almost a stranger to me, unless I have some security"—he men<lb/>tioned a sovereign—he said, "You know me well enough to lend me that amount till to-morrow; my father and mother are coming from Canterbury, and I will return it to yon before 12 o'clock"—after some further con<lb/>versation he gave me his book as it is now—it was to be returned on his giving me the sovereign before 12 o'clock next day—he said, "I cannot part with the bank-book, as I must show it to my father and mother to-morrow"—I said, "I cannot lend you any money unless you let me hold the book"—he said, "Very well, take it, then;" and I gave him a sovereign—I did not notice the book, as the train was coming in—he shook hands with me and said, "You are the best gentleman I have met for a long time"—my attention was then called to the other end of the station, and I immediately missed him—I suspected him, and searched in every direction for him; not finding him, I went direct to the Post-office—I looked at the book directly I missed him, and thought there was something wrong—the entries were as they are now—I had not made any mark whatever in it—I have only parted with the book to be produced before the Magistrate—I gave it to Mr. Triptree—the following day this communication arrived at my lodgings.

I said to my son "You can go round to Perren's and get him one"—the order was brought, and the prisoner filled it up for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me to look at it to see if it was correct—I asked my son in the prisoner's presence if he had seen the book; he said "Yes"—I said "You have made it payable at 4, High Street, Woolwich" (that is my address), "What is your motive for this?" he said "I do not wish Mrs. Mason, the landlady, to know anything about it, or else she will write and tell my parents"—the order was returned next day; I met him the same evening—I said "Your order for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has arrived;" he said "All right, I am glad of that, can you let me have a couple of shillings till I draw the money to-morrow?

I am a greengrocer, of Thornton Terrace, Victoria Eoad, Peckham Eye—on 4th May I was in a beer-house in Orb Street, Walworth, about 6 p.m.—I saw Forman, and we had a conversation about buying a pony—I had been in his company the greatest part of the day—he said he knew some one who had a pony to sell—he went to fetch it—he came back in about 10 minutes with Stewart and Waldron—there were five of us altogether—Stewart said he was brother to a taller man, who asked me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pony—I ultimately purchased it from Stewart's brother for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him in gold—he said if I came down and purchased a cart he would give me a receipt in full—it was the cart that the pony drew—I said, "I don't like the look of these men, George"—Stewart said, "It does not matter as long as I am with you, they won't interfere with you, as I know the whole of them"—they had some beer after that—I paid for two pots of ale—they all drunk—I had not drunk more than I do every day—I was perfectly sober—I said to Forman, "I had better separate my gold from the silver, and put the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I buy the cart, in the left-hand pocket, because I do not like the look of those men, although you say I am all right"—I told Forman in the morning what I had got within a few shillings—I had come with him from St. Martin's Lane—I had over 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Forman saw what pocket I put it in—when I left the public-house I was led to believe the pony was gone forward—I had left it with a boy, outside—I have not seen it since—we all walked together down a turning—Stewart's brother and Forman led the way—there were some houses, sheds, and stables in it, it was a mews—it was between gas<lb/>light</p>

               <p>and twilight—it was between 7.30 and 8—Forman seized me by the throat—I could not say anything, I was held so tight, and he threw me violently on the ground—Stewart's brother had me at the back of the neck, and Forman had my throat—Waldron put his hand in my left pocket—Forman said, "I know where the b——<hi rend="italic">quids lay</hi>, in the left<lb/>hand pocket"—I was almost choked—I was on the ground—the two Stewarts and Waldron ran away—Forman still held me by the throat, and when he let go I said, "George, I did not think you would rob me in that manner"—I held him by the leg—he made a kick at me, and said some word, I could not exactly say what—I was kicked on the body and hit on the head and the face—I could not say which delivered the blow on the head, but Forman kicked me—he gave me a parting kick—I called out "Police!"—I saw two or three coming towards me—I went to the station and described the men—I have known Forman six or seven years—I never saw Waldron or Stewart's brother before—I was in their company two hours—the following day I saw Forman at the station—on the 10th I identified Waldron, he had a longish coat on and a cap with a peak before, but when I identified him he had a black coat and a light hat, he was different altogether—I had not the slightest difficulty in picking him out—on the 20th I identified Stewart from 10 or 12 others without hesitation—Stewart and his brother changed caps in the public-house—they went out at the back—I have no hesitation in saying the prisoners are the three men who were engaged in knocking me down and robbing me.</p>

Forman was my fellow-workman—I did not say I was with Forman all day—I began to search for a horse about 11 a.m.—I had six or seven drinks, not 10—I believe I was stupefied while I was in the public-house by some ingredient or another—I do not know anything about the beer-house nor how many customers were there—George Forman brought me the pony—I had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. about.</p>

I am a beerhouse keeper, of Orb Street, Walworth—on Wednesday evening, 4th May, about 5.30, I saw Pratt in my house with the three prisoners and another person I don't know—I have known Stewart about two years and a half; I do not know his brother—I first saw Waldron when he entered my house the evening before that—I did not know Forman—I heard them talking about a pony—Forman said it was to be sold for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; ultimately I saw Pratt buy it for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because it had a bad back—I saw the two sovereigns pass, but no half-sovereign—Stewart's</p>

               <p>brother wanted a dollar for the harness, but Pratt would not give more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pony and harness—just before they left Pratt said he would buy the cart—the man that is not here offered 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the pony—I saw Pratt put some silver back into I believe his left-hand pocket—I heard the prisoners use threatening language to Pratt; one of them said, "I will turn you out and take your money from you" three or four times; that was in the front bar during the bargaining—Forman had been drinking, and I fear he was not in a condition to carry on any duty what<lb/>ever—Stewart was sober; Pratt was silly, stupefied—Waldron had his cap over his eyes, but he appeared sober—Pratt paid for a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale—he drank about half a glass; he left a glass of stout and mild—I saw Stewart and another go to the back; when they returned they had changed caps—they left about 6.30.</p>

About 3 in the afternoon of 21st June I received information of the death of this woman, and went to 101, Mint Street, where I saw the prisoner—I asked him if he could account for the woman's death; he said, "I can't account for it any more than what she told me as she was going to the hospital on Sunday night, that she had fallen downstairs"—at the station he was charged with causing her death—he said, "We were drinking in a public-house; about 5 on Saturday evening I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get some tea with; she went with other women to a public-house and spent a shilling, then went to another public-house and spent the other shilling; when I returned home she was drunk, and there was no tea for me; she then wanted to go out, I told her not to go out, and she then fell downstairs; I went downstairs, picked her up, and carried her upstairs and put her on the bed"—I noticed the staircase leading from their room: there is a small landing, about a yard square, at the top, and a fencing on each side.</p>

I shall be 17 next birthday—on Sunday night, 17th April, I was in the Coach and Horses public-house—I saw the prisoner there—I saw Mr. Pemberton come out with two girls; he went down the court—the prisoner followed a few minutes afterwards—I heard him say when I got to the bottom "We do not want a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> to-night"—I saw Mr. Pemberton on the ground—I picked up a piece of chain, and gave it to the gentleman—I am sure the prisoner is the man I saw.</p>

I was frightened, and he said "If I catch you with him again I will kill you"—I did not see any more of him—I saw White come to take my brother away—she said "Do not hit her, she is doing nothing"—I was too frightened to notice where my-brother went—I did not see him do anything to the prosecutor—I did not say to him in consequence of what I saw "Come away"—I was too frightened to speak a word when he hit me—I went to the terrace for no other purpose than to go to the Pabnerston; I did not go there because my brother ran after me—I was in the Coach and Horses that evening with a man and Johanna Collins, and we had three pints of stout and mild with him.</p>
