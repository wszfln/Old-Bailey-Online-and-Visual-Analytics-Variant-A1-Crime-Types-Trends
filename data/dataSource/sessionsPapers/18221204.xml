On the 25th of August, my man lent a chaise cart to somebody; he is not here - it was never brought back. I saw the prisoner three weeks after at Enfield, and told him I wished to have my cart brought home, and was determined to have it - he promised it should be brought home in a few days. About a fortnight after I got a warrant Five or six weeks after it was hired, the prisoner brought it home without the lamps or cushions. I believe he was not there when it was hired.</p>

             (being questioned, appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I am eleven years old, and live at Heston, with Mr. Bell. About two or three months ago, in the harvest time. I met the prisoner at <placeName id="t18221204-5-crimeloc22">Windmill-bridge</placeName>

               <p>"I'll be d - d if I don't have a shoot at you;" I said, " Oh! Ah!" and when he picked up the stones and crossed the road, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you think I should hit you there?" I said, Oh! Ah! He put the gun up to his shoulder, and put his fingers to the trigger - I put my hands to my face, and he fired off directly; I saw the flash - it hit me is the hands, arms, and face, and in my eye, in consequence of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040004"/>which, I have lost the sight of it. Some of the stones were as big as peas. There was not room for more then two carts to pass between us when he fired. I had no quarrell with him. I never saw him before. When he saw I was wounded, he went and told Mr. Coleman that his gun had gone off, and he had shot this little boy in the face. Mr. Coleman said,</p>
               <p>"Take him down to the canal, and wipe his face," which he did, and rubbed it with brown paper, and took me through the field towards home. He then asked which was my way home - I pointed to it, and he left me to go home; I walked back towards the bridge, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long had you been in his company - A. About half an hour. He was put there to keep the birds off the barley. I had been talking to him. There were some boats near us with people in them when he fired - they were at the lock below the bridge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he fired his gun before he fired at your hat - A. I did not see him fire before - it was loaded before he shot at my hat. His powder was in a bag in his pocket I - saw him pick up pebbles and put into the gun, and ram ti down after the pebbles were put in. I said Oh! Ah! thinking he was only in fun - I did not think he was going to shoot me. I could have ran away or stooped down if I liked. I did not go before the Justice till about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>PRESS BELL. The prosecutor lived with me. On the 17th after the accident, he came to my house. I saw him about half-past ten o'clock that night; he was in a dreadful state, and was under the doctor's care ten weeks. I went to a Magistrate about it next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you go to Bow-street - A. About the 16th of November. I know Mr. Haydon - I told him if the prisoner discharged the doctor's bill, and paid the expences my wife had been at, I should not trouble him further. The boy was entirely under my care.</p>
               <p>MR. FROGLEY. I am a surgeon, and attended the prosecutor nine or ten weeks. I saw him the morning after the accident, and found him much wounded from the effects of it. I took several stones from his face, and some from under the skin of his hand. I expected he would have lost both eyes, but he has the sight of one. Some of the stones were very small; the largest was not bigger then a pea. He was unable to leave the house for six weeks. There was danger from the number of the wounds - he was out of danger after six weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was an accident. I had the gun in my hand, and was going away from the boy, and getting over a stile - the but-end of the gun knocked against it and it went off. He called out; I ran and picked him up. I saw Coleman and told him of the accident, and went and washed him and wiped it with some paper, having no handkerchief.</p>
               <p>- TRUMPER. I am a farmer. The prisoner was in my service - I set him to keep the crows of the wheat. It was an old gun, and went off very easy at full cock - it was pretty strong at half-cock. I gave him one charge of shot in the morning in a hurry. He was not to shoot the birds, only to make a noise to frighten them away. He was a humane boy, and particularly fond of children.</p>

The prisoner brought Beckett towards me, and said his gun had gone off unawares, and he had hurt the boy's face - he lifted him up to shew me his face. I lifted him over, and he washed him very carefully, and neither of us having a handkerchief, he poured the water on his face with his hands. He was very attentive to him, and appeared sorry.</p>

On the 30th of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went out and left him at home - I returned between one and two; he was not then at home. I did not see him again till I saw him at Leeds on the 13th of November - I had no expectation of his leaving; I had missed my keys after going out that morning, and immediately on my returning I went to my scrutoire and found the key in it, and the scrutoire shut. I missed from a drawer in it where I kept my money, a green purse, which I know contained a 100 l. a 50 l. and ten 10 l. Bank notes, of which I had the numbers, and several other notes and sovereigns; also a diamond ring. On receiving information of his being apprehended, on Sunday fortnight I arrived at Leeds, and next day saw my ring in possession of the constable.</p>

I returned about ten o'clock, and found the door open, but nobody in the house except the lodgers. The room was hired by my father, who is a broker, to put things into. I missed two new mattresses, a new feather bed, and the bed I slept on, two sheets, two bundles, some quilts, and other articles. I made the new bed myself - it is worth 2 l. 10 s.

On Monday morning, the 11th of November, about a quarter past seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with a truck in Featherstone-court - he put a mattress on the truck; there was one on it before. I sent my brother watchman off with information, and when he returned I saw the prisoner put a bed on the truck. I took him in charge, and delivered the property to Walker.

I was standing at the door about ten minutes, and saw a man come into the court with a bed on his back - he put it down on the stairs, and the prisoner came out of his room and helped him with it into the prisoner's room - a woman lit them up. I saw nothing else broght in. I suspected they were only cheating the landlord, and went away directly. I do not know whether the prisoner had been out. I had been at home all the evening. I was not further out than the end of the court. I think I must have known if he had gone out at all between six and seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>HENRY MARTIN re-examined. I live in the garret over the prisoner's room. I had been at the door about ten minutes when the bed was brought in. I had come from my own room, where I had been all the afternoon. After the bed came in I went to Whitecross-street. The prisoner was in his room at the time I went down - he could not go out without passing me at the door; his door was shut. I had not heard him move about in his room. The prisoner came down to the man of his own accord - he carried it up three or four stairs before the prisoner came and helped him. The prisoner lives up one pair. The man did not call him - I must have heard if he had called.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long Defence, stated that a man had called on him two days before, and asked if he might move his goods to his room, as he was fearful of their being seized for rent, and that when they came, he found them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040006"/>too bulky, and desired him to remove them, and they agreed to pay him to move them in the morning.</p>

On returning I found the stable door unlocked, and bolted inside. There is a stair-case leading from the stable to my room, which is over the coach-house. I drew back and stood quiet. A man gently opened the door, and locked out - I ran up, locked him in, held the door and called the watchmen; we burst the door open, and found the two prisoners there, who were strangers. My box coat was moved off the coach box, and put on the splinter-bar; it was my master's, and worth 5 l. Four coats were taken out of a box in my bed-room; also two pair of breeches, and four waistcoats, and all put in a heap ready to be tied up, and carried away. A phosphorus box was found, which was not there when I went out.</p>

I gave them 6 d. each, and Travers said they would have 1 s. more before I went out; I said, I would if she would let me out. I took my purse out to give her 1 s., and Wood knocked my purse out of my hand - the other woman held me behind. I tried to seize Wood, but the other prisoner let her out - I struggled with her for five minutes before she got out, and tore her gown - the room was on the ground floor. I ran into the street, where several people were standing, and asked for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040007"/>help nobody would assist me. Some man knocked me down. I seized Wood, but another man pulled me back, and she got from me. I lost sight of her for half an hour - I saw her again in the street, and she was secured. A waistcoat was taken from her, which she said belonged to a gentleman in her room - we went to the room; it was not the room I was in. I saw Travers in custody next morning. There was a candle in the room. I never saw them before; but am certain of them. I lost twenty-seven sovereigns and a cheque for 15 l. 10 s.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 26th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prosecutor in Winfield-street. He crossed the way, and seized Wood, saying she had robbed him - he appeared sober, but distressed at losing his money. In taking Wood to the watch-house, I found a silk waistcoat under her arm, which she said she was going to pawn for a man in her room. Upon going to the house I found a genteel man there without a waistcoat. I searched Wood soon after. The prosecutor said he had torn her gown at her bosom; she undid her gown, it was not torn. I took Travers next morning. The prosecutor saw her at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You met her in Wentworth-street - A. Yes. If she had the sovereigns about her, I must have found them.</p>

I had left it in my pocket - I slept in my clothes. My brother and cousin were with me, and came to the door to awake me. I found a pocket and some duplicates in the room, by which means I found her in bed, alone. I said I would give her two sovereigns to produce my watch - she said she knew nothing about it. My brother found it in the bed without the cases. She was quite intoxicated. I said if she would say where the cases were I would give her a sovereign - she would not and I called the officer.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. Three of the shirts were cotton, and one linen. My husband had only worn two of them. I was obliged to pledge almost every thing we had to maintain the prisoner. The house had not been broken into. They were missed on the morning of the 3d of November. Another man besides him lodged in the house - he was not absent. My husband charged him with it directly; but he denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you make the prisoner's shirts - A. No; I washed them. His were a different stripe and colour to my husbands - he slept three nights in the house after the robbery, and went before the Magistrate to complain of our detaining his things for what he owed us.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN. I am a watchman. On the 10th of November, I was called, and took the prisoner for breaking the windows, and on examining him Mrs. Simpson claimed the shirt on his back. He said he could prove he had had it made at Cumberland-gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not afterwards say he must have taken it by mistake for his own - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his Defence; stated that he took the shirt by mistake, for one of his own, which laid on the same table - that his things were detained, and he only owed them 16 s.</p>

She put one hand on my thigh, and the other on my neck, and pressed me up against a shop front. McDonald came up, and thrust her hand into my trowsers pocket, and took out some money (I had 9 s. 6 d. there); I seized her hand while it was in my pocket, and saw some money pass from her to Evans, who returned some to her again. On my calling for assistance, McDonald gave me a shilling, and said that was all she had taken, and she got away. I gave Evans in charge of the watchman - she said, she knew nothing of the other woman. McDonald was not taken till next night. Evans was never out of my sight. I did not see McDonald myself for two mornings after. I am certain of her - she was pock-marked. I missed 5 s. from my pocket, besides the shilling returned me. It was a moonlight night - and I held McDonald by the gas light for three minutes.</p>

Two or three minutes after we got in, a man came and joined the prisoners company, and wanted me to play at some game, I said I had no money to play games - the prisoner then took 4 s. out of my hand, and the other man took 3 s. 6 d. I told them they should not have my money, they started out of the house immediately without saying why they took it - they took different directions. I followed the prisoner a little way calling out that he had robbed me. Taylor, the officer, met him and stopped him, without my losing sight of him; he had called for a pint of beer at the house, which he paid for on delivery, and offered me some of it, this was before he took my money. I described the house to Taylor, it is about twenty yards from where he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not game there - A. No, he returned me the 4 s. just as Taylor came up - Taylor was dressed in blue, turned up with red.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was crossing from the end of Cornhill to the Mansion-house, and saw the prisoner coming down Lombard-street, with something in a handkerchief under his arm, he passed me, and turned down Charlotte-row; I went up and felt the bundle, and asked what he had got, he said a blue coat, which he was going to take to Crown-court, Fleet-street, that he brought it from Mr. White's, No. 15, Fenchurch-street. I found it did contain a blue coat, I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me a lie, and send me to Fenchurch-street to no purpose;" he said," I will tell you the truth, a man, at the corner of Lombard-street, gave me the coat to carry to Mr. Smith's, in Crown-court." I went to No. 15, Fenchurch-street, but could find no Mr. White there; I then went to Crown-court, and found that one Smith had lived at No. 9, some time back, but nobody at No. 3. I returned, and Mr. Dutton claimed it.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On Monday morning, the 4th of November, about seven o'clock, I met the prisoner in Jeremy-street, with the copper in a bag, on his back; Foxhall and I went up and questioned him, he said he brought it from Duke-street, and was taking it to his master. in Fleet-Market. We followed him, and saw him near an old iron shop in Blue Cross-street, and then stopped him; he resisted a good deal, but Foxhall took him, and I took the copper; he slipped off his coat and ran off - we followed and overtook him - we found a crow-bar and basket in the bag, he was stopped in Regent-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040011"/>without my losing sight of him. As he was brought back to the top of White Horse-street, I saw a quantity of lead and a knot, wrapped up in a black cloth - it was in the direction he went. I compared the crow-bar with the marks on the house in Duke-street, where the lead was wrenched, it fitted, and the pipe matched with the rest - the edges were quite fresh cut.</p>

He came to me and said he had laid them in my yard, and asked me to put them into my shop, and on Monday morning I found they were sash cills, and immediately suspected they were stolen. He was at my shop on Monday and Tuesday mornings - I told him they would not do for the shafts - he told me to cut them up and make the body of the cart with them; the cills laid before us all the time.

I picked it up - they both denied having seen me. Pillar opened the window and threw something out - the watchman said it was a note.

               <p>"Do you know this man"; she said she thought she did, and that he had been there that night - she came down to open the door in her shift. I went with him up stairs. She denied the charge. Fowler took a bag off the bed and said,</p>

            . What the prisoner at the bar says is very right indeed; the prosecutor came to my place and gave her this note, in my presence, to go and redeem her clothes. She said she could not get change, he said, never mind, as he could get it in the morning from the waggoners. She put it in her bosom. She had no place to sleep, and I let her sleep with me.

I asked how he came there, he said he went on an errand from his master, Mr. Ward, French-alley, Goswell-street, and afterwards said he went on his own pleasure.</p>

I know they were safe at twelve o'clock, and the next morning, about day-light, she awoke me, by opening the door to go out. I instantly looked for my clothes, which were under the pillow, and missed them from my watch pocket - I got up and wrote a note to the landlady, requesting her to detain the prisoner if she returned, and that I would call at seven o'clock at night, which I did, and found her in custody of an officer. She said she had spent 1 l. 12 s., in Field-lane, and had 35 s. of my property left, which she threw on the table in the bag, it was in when I pinned it in my fob.</p>

I was confined to my bed five weeks, and after that I missed a gown and waistcoat, about four months and a fortnight ago; they were taken out of a box which stood outside my bed-room door unlocked - the prisoners both lodged at my house. On the 7th of November, I saw Clark pass my door, with my gown on, and had her taken, next day I took Pomroy, and found the waistcoat in pawn, at the Minories, on the 9th of November. I cannot say whether they were taken at the same time, I missed them before Pomroy left, which was four months and a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Prisoner POMROY. Q. When did you take the possession of the shop - A. Ten months ago. I had not seen the things for twelve months. I did not mention the loss, thinking she would move if I did, and I wished to find it out. Pomroy lodged there before we took possession, which was before Lady-day.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 28th of October, between five and six o'clock, when I came near Duke-street, Houndsditch, I observed three persons behind a female, going towards Houndsditch - I followed them, and when she came to the corner of Houndsditch, I observed a bustle - I did not see them take anything: but she turned round, and looked rather confused, I asked if she had lost anything - she said</p>
               <p>"Yes, a parcel." Bitton was then going towards Aldgate-church, and Clark crossed to the opposite side - I could not see the other. I looked for half a minute, then crossed over, and laid hold of Clark, opened his coat, put my hand between his legs, and took the parcel from there - it contained the articles stated in the indictment. Bitton was at that time crossing towards Clark - I said to somebody who was near,</p>
               <p>"Lay hold of him;" he immediately ran down the Minories a short space, then turned back and walked; somebody laid hold of him, and delivered him to me - he said he knew nothing of it. When I took Clark, he said,</p>
               <p>"I picked this parcel up at the corner of the posts." Several persons besides them were round Miss Walford, as there was a stoppage with a coach. I did not see either of them stoop; they might without my seeing them. My eye was fixed on them. I cannot say whether the pavement was clean or dirty. I think it was a dry night.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BITTON'S Defence. I was returning from Gracechurch-street, and as I crossed a gentleman laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>CLARK's Defence. I was coming home, and by the corner of Houndsditch, I kicked this parcel with my feet, took it up, and held it in my hand ten minutes to see if anybody owned it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Billingsgate. On the 7th of November, about eight o'clock at night, I and Mackey having information, went in pursuit of a man - the prisoner was stopped by somebody and given into our charge; we took him to a public-house, and found a coat on him. We sent for Mr. Telfor, who claimed the shirt on his back; also a handkerchief, and flannel bandage, which he had on. He said his mother gave him the shirt, that she had made it, and he had the fellow at home - I asked if it had any mark; he said, No; we found it marked G.T. He said there was a blue mark on the flannel bandage, and Mr. Telfor also claimed it by that mark - he denied knowing anything of the papers or trunk for two or three days, but afterwards said voluntarily that there was another man in the robbery - that he gave him the things which he had, out of the trunk, and the cannister containing the ship's papers, and finding them of no use to him, he threw them into the Tower-ditch. He took us to the spot; but we cannot find them.</p>

About two months before the prisoner was taken up, I was going for a pail of whitewash, I found a bit of old rag, with some rivets tied in it, as I crossed from the pawn-broker's shop to the Pitt's-head, public-house - they were copper, and new, I believe, but did not take much notice, as I was in a hurry to get my breakfast. They looked fresh; there were 10 or 12 rivets, to the best of my belief. I took them home, and gave them to an old woman who lived in the house named Pettit. I have not seen them since, and should not know them again. There was no piece of copper with them; they were about the same size as those produced. This was two months before the prisoner was taken.</p>

            . I lodge in the King's Arms yard, Coleman-street. I put the articles stated in the indictment into a bag, and sent them by coach to the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street, to be left till called for. I walked to town. The watch was in my pocket - I met the prisoner in my way to town. I arrived on the 1st November, and stopped at the Cherry-tree, Kingsland-road, for him, as I had given him my watch to sell for me, and he had gone away with the money. When I got to the Spread Eagle, the bag was gone - the prisoner was taken next day. I had told him I had sent my property there.</p>

On the 2d of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street; the porter of the inn was with me; I told him I took him for stealing some clothes from the Spread Eagle; he denied the charge. I took him up the yard, and Penny identified him as the person who received the property. I found a waistcoat on his person, with Mitchell's name at full length on it, also a pair of stockings, neck and pocket handkerchiefs, with his initials, and 14 s. 6 d. in cash He denied having any property when I searched him.

I did not see them taken, or see the prisoner near the shop. I was informed they were gone - went out, and saw the prisoner about five hundred yards off, in a back street, towards Duke's-place; he was secured, and denied the charge, the property was not found - it was worth 40 s.</p>

            . I am a scale-maker, and live in Golden-lane. On the 2d of November, I was at work for Mr. Shurey, of Hounsditch, nearly opposite Smith's, and saw the prisoner and two young men talking together, at the corner of Castle-street, within two or three yards of the shop. I was working at the door, and watched them with my master - the prisoner left their company and looked into a pastry-cook-shop, within two doors of Mr. Smith's, then one of the others went in and came out, then he joined company again. I saw the prisoner leave them and look in at the pastry cook's window again - the other two went up to Smith's door and took the clothes; the prisoner immediately followed them, and went off with them. His face was towards them when they took the dresses - he must have seen them. I saw him beckon to them, and they directly went up and took them; and he followed them up Castle-street. I went and told Mr. Smith, and when I came out I saw them again, but when they came to another corner I missed them - he turned the same corner and was laid hold of; he said he lived at a cheese-monger's in Mile End-road, and denied it.</p>

I did not see Russell that I know of; there was a person waiting outside, looking in at the shop. I cannot tell who it was. In the afternoon of the next day, the officer called. I did not miss them till he shewed them me - they were in the same paper as when they laid on my compter. I had not sold them.

I missed the articles stated in the indictment - Mr. Coe lodged in the house - my things were in two separate bedrooms. I found most of them at Bow-street next morning.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Monday morning, about nine o'clock, I was coming up the Strand, and at the end of Hewitt's-court, I saw several people - I saw Coe standing by the side of Mumford. I found his property in the front garret of No. 3. New Round-court, Strand. Baylies and Welsby were in bed there together. Coe asked Baylies for his property, and she produced a great deal of it from under the pillow. They acknowledged that they brought them away - Baylies said they came there the night before.</p>

A coachman gave me information, and next morning I went to Hewitt's-court, Strand, to Acker-man's, a pawnbroker, and gave information there. I remained in the court, and in half an hour the pawnbroker came out of the shop with Mumford and my coat, when I gave her in charge. I asked her no questions - I then went to No. 3, New-round-court, and found Baylies and Welsby there in bed. Wormald came almost directly after, and I found the property produced in the room.</p>

I returned about half-past three o'clock, and did not go into my room till I went to bed; I then found my handkerchief opened, and the things taken out. I saw the prisoner next morning at the Three Crowns, public-house - he denied it. My trowsers were produced to me at the Coach and Horses, public-house. I afterwards went to Riley's.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Chelsea. I saw Trayner at a public-house at Chelsea, one Wednesday night, about ten o'clock; I met him in the passage, and he asked if I wanted to buy a pair of shoes - I said No; I examined them, and should know them again. I met him in the street next morning, and asked him if he had sold them; he said he had, but he would get me a better bargain in the course of the day. I took Banner to the Three Crowns, where Trayner was; I said he was the man who offered me the trowsers - he was given in charge. (Trowsers produced) - these are them. I saw No. 12 on the waistband when he offered them - it was about ten o'clock at night.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 31st of October, about eight o'clock in the morning. I was fetched in the Three Crowns, and found Trayner, Draper, and Banner there. Banner said he had been robbed of this property, and gave charge of Trayner. In the way to the watch-house, he said of his own accord that he took the things and sold them, being distressed. About an hour and a half after, I went to Riley and asked if had not in the course of Saturday bought a shirt and a razor, and described Trayner to him; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I did not" - I said I am told you did. As I was coming away, I saw the razor laying on the board in front of his shop, where he puts his goods; he said he bought it yesterday for 2 1/2 d. - I told him not to part with it till I found whether it was Banner's, and said</p>
               <p>"I think you must have the shirt;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I have none but one which hangs there," which was a calico one, without a frill. I fetched Banner, who claimed the razor - I then said he must have the shirt - he said I</p>
               <p>"have not." I said he must go to Queen-square, to say where he got the razor; he said,</p>
               <p>"Well shall I get into trouble about the shirt;" I said I could not say - he said,</p>
               <p>"Well I have it," and fetched it; it was not the one which hung up. Banner said it was his, but the frill was gone. He said he bought it of Trayner - he is a dealer in marine stores. He went out willingly with me.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>TRAYNER pleaded distress.</p>
               <p>RILEY's Defence. He came to me, and said he had nothing to eat for a week, and asked me to buy the shirt - I gave him 18 d. for it, and next morning found it was stolen. I told Champion I had not got the shirt, as I had sold it, and while he was gone I got it back.</p>

On Monday morning, the 24th of November, I missed about 7 cwt., which I had seen safe about ten o'clock on Saturday morning. I traced footsteps of two persons from the house, and also four resting places. I traced them towards Druce's house, and sat up all night watching, and on Friday morning I saw his cart, which Barnes stopped. I afterwards took Ings and one Jordan. I saw some lead in possession of Atkins, and found the rest buried in Drnce's garden. There were between 3 and 4 cwt of lead, it fitted with the top of the building; the whole was stripped off. I have no doubt it came from this building.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On Tuesday, I stopped Druce with his cart. I was with Chapman on the 24th; we traced footsteps 200 yards from his house, until we came to the turnpike road. When I saw Druce with his cart, I told him I was directed to stop him; he asked me for what, I said on suspicion of the lead in his cart; he said he had some lead, but he did not know where it came from, that Jordan and Ings were to meet him at the Maidenhead, Battle-bridge, to take the lead from him. I secured him. The lead was in two sacks in the cart; he also had some empty fish-baskets and a coat in the cart. We proceeded to the Maidenhead, but found nobody there. In the evening I apprehended Ings. I saw the lead compared with the building, it fitted. I had seen the two prisoners and Jordan together on the Saturday night about eight o'clock, at the Swan with two Necks public-house, Finchley Common. Ings had his coat tails tucked up into his pockets, somebody said to him,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you put your tails down?" he said</p>
               <p>"That is just fit for my business." They live about one hundred and fifty yards from the public-house. I saw Ings and Jordan at the same house on Friday night, about nine o'clock, talking very low, I heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"It won't do." Druce keeps an ass and cart, and goes about the country. He made no resistance.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I had been working for Mr. Mathews. On the Saturday night I saw Ings and Druce at the Swan with two Necks on Finchley Common. Ings had been talking about the house at Coldar-bour about a week before. We had no conversation about it on the Saturday night. Ings had said there was some lead in the gutters which might be got at; I said very well - he said, but we must have a ladder to get at it, and that he had been round the premises, and seen one laying there. He said nothing about it to Druce, but said to us on the Saturday night, that I must give him a good load of something before Christmas. Ings and I went to the house that night between eleven and twelve; Druce did not go. We took all the lead off the three gutters; it was about 7 cwt. We carried part at a time down in the meadow field which leads down to Druce's house; we then carried it on further, resting at times, and took it to Druce's house; he was at home; Ings went round to his windows, where he slept, and knocked; I saw him give out the shovel to dig a hole to bury it in the garden. I did not hear him say any thing. We buried it all in the garden. Ings went home, and I slept with Druce. (I lodge at the Swan.) I told Druce where we got it from, and what we had done with it. Ings and I met that day at Druce's house, and it was agreed that Druce should take it home on Monday morning, and we was to assist him in loading it; but we overslept ourselves, and did not go to Druce's on Monday, so it was not taken away. I was at the Swan on Sunday night; Druce was not there. On Tuesday morning I went to Druce's house between four and five o'clock - Ings did not come - Druce was up, and had a fire; and after having some tea, he said, " the harness is on the donkey, you can get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040021"/>some of the lead out of the garden." He gave me the shovel; I went to the garden and dug up two pieces, and brought them into the house; he assisted me in putting them into two sacks, and then he helped me with them into the cart. I then left him; he said he should take them to London. I had not agreed to meet him any where.</p>
               <p>BARNES re-examined. The lead had a little dirt on it; it has been brushed off outside - there were two pieces in each sack, and some clay on it. I could only trace the footsteps of two people; some were about the size of Ings's, the toe was very round. I did not see the prisoner at the Swan after eight o'clock on Saturday night.</p>

The officer wished me to leave the room, which I did. I found two duplicates in the fob of his old trowsers, which were in a box, that did not belong to him - I never knew him to use it. Next morning I went to the pawnbroker's, and found a child's dress and a pair of black trowsers, which were mine, and had been in my shop; and at Benton's I found another dress; I don't know when they were taken - I had bought one only a month before.

On Monday morning, the 28th of October, I sent him to Goldsmith's-hall with two silver butter-boats to be stamped, and gave him a sovereign and four half crowns to pay the duty; he was to leave it at the hall, and return in an hour. He did not return at all, and on the Wednesday evening, when I came home, I found he had come to my house drunk, and was asleep. He said he was very sorry he had spent the money, but that was robbed of the boats; they weighed twenty-three ounces.</p>

They said they had plenty of money, and ordered half a pint of rum, and a pipe; the prisoner gave me a sovereign; soon after his companions went out, and he told me he had been robbed of two sovereigns and the change I had given him; a woman had been with him, who, he said, was his wife.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged in Almstrong's rents, and was to go to my master at eight o'clock in the morning, I got a man on the first floor to call me. I got the boats from my master, and went into a public-house and got 2 d. worth of rum, then went home, and tossed with the lodger for two glasses of gin; he came out with me, and took me to a house by Baker's-row. I found it was too late to go to the Hall, as I must be there by nine o'clock, so I got some breakfast, and the man went with me to a public house in Church-street. He asked me what I had in my bag, I said china; he wanted me to leave it there, and sent me out for eggs, but I took the bag with me. I returned to the public-house, and drank there till twelve o'clock; the liquor made me drowsy, and where I went to I have no recollection, but was at the Turk's Head just after three o'clock, and remember that after that I got robbed; for they put my hat over my face, and extended my arms. while they emptied my pockets and tore away my fob. Next day I went to ask the landlord if I had a bag with me, as I was told I had been in the privy at the Feathers asleep. A witness was at the Turk's Head, who saw the whole transaction.</p>

I agreed to supply the sacks, he accompanied me to my warehouse, and went in my cart with me to the Basing-house, where the sacks were put into a cart in our presence, to be taken to Waltham Abbey, and to be returned on the Wednesday following full. I saw him on Monday, he said the sacks were filling, and would be in the barge in due time. Nicholls and I said we should come down to Waltham market on Tuesday; he told us not to come, but we went and could not find him. We went to the mill and found the sacks were not there. I saw him that afternoon and charged him with deceiving me, and asked where the sacks were; he said, at the mill; I said they were not - he persisted that they were, but I said I should get an officer unless he told me where they were - he was taken to Edmonton, and said they were at Crouch's, and there we found them. I was told in his presence that he had obtained one pound on them, having sold them, as his own before I had delivered them - he admitted that he had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You found them at Edmonton, which is in the road to Waltham Abbey - A. It is; we were in his company at the Red Lion public-house, Waltham Abbey, we sat down and took a meal together as good friends.

            . I live at Edmonton, and am a miller. Three bundles of sacks were brought to my house. I never counted or opened them. I contracted for fifty or sixty of the prisoner's old sacks, the price was to be settled after they were examined - the business was first mentioned five weeks ago last Tuesday; he said he had some sacks which he should like me to buy. I was not at home when they were brought. I advanced him 1 l. on them, on Saturday evening, the 9th of November, and on Sunday morning called him over, and said,</p>
               <p>"Corney these are not your sacks," he said, they were not, but his would be down in a day or two. I consider by that that he meant to exchange them.</p>

I did not miss it till I saw it in the possession of Forrester, who held the prisoner by the collar. He said he did not take it.</p>

Mr. Gelder stopped once or twice on the bridge, and they stopped also at a little distance from him, and when he came near the Surry side, where it was being repaired - there was a railing up and the passage is narrow. I was on the opposite side, and saw the flap of Mr. Gelder's coat drop - I could not observe whether it was the prisoner or the other who took the handkerchief, as a carraige passed. A small piece of the handkerchief was out before - seeing it was gone, I crossed and saw the prisoner tucking something into his trowsers, (I have seen him about before) - I took hold of him; he was attempting to get it out of his trowsers, but I seized him, and took him to Mr. Gelder, and took the handkerchief out of his trowsers.</p>

The shop door, which was double locked over night, was open; no violence was used to it. The lock was forced off the till, and about 6 s. worth of copper taken; two drawers in the same room were opened, and this property taken. The prisoner lives directly opposite; and when I came down in the morning, I saw him at his bed-room window looking out, talking to the drayman. He was taken that evening.</p>

Have you any distinct recollection of all the facts to which you have spoken to, or are you speaking under some degree of uncertainty - A. I speak from the letters; I recollect the application to the Bank for the power and so on. It is by looking at the letters that I speak with positiveness. I transact a good deal of business, but am not employed to obtain many powers of attorney; I supply the broker with what he wants to buy or sell; I recollect obtaining the power from the Bank, which I sent to Bristol, whether the one I sent was returned to me I cannot swear. I sent it by post, most likely I did not put the letter into the post myself. Mr. Wait is a stranger to me, I am certain the power of Attorney produced is that I received from Bristol, for my writing is at the back of it. I cannot swear that I received it on the 17th of September, as I might misdate it. I applied at the Bank, to act upon it myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. When you applied to obtain it in 1821, what did you do at the Bank - A. I wrote instructions for it on paper, which I put on the box, which is in the usual mode, (looking at a paper,) these are the instructions I delivered at the Bank, on the 24th of September 1821, and in consequence of which I got the power and forwarded it to Bristol.</p>

             re-examined. (Looking at the instructions and power,) I filled up this power of attorney from this ticket of instruction, on the 24th of September 1821. There is a memorandum on the power, which enables me to speak to the date. I have no recollection of filling up any other of the same sort on that day. I know the power by the figures on it; a folio of the account from which it is taken is put on the instructions; and if I had made out two from the same account, they would have that folio. We make a memorandum on the account of having made a power. If a second application was made to me for a power to sell the same stock, I should object to it, if I recollected it. It would entirely depend upon my recollection.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT PELL. Q. You are carrying on business on your own account new? - A. No; I am assistant at a grocer and cheese-factor's. I was never in Bristol. I became acquainted with Mr. Wait at Birmingham; he left some time after I left him. The last I knew of him was in May 1819, he carried on business at Birmingham as grocer; my business was to serve behind the counter: he had two assistants besides me, and a porter.

               <p>Q. Do you believe the whole of both the letters to be the hand-writing of Mr. Wait - A. Yes. I look to the signatures. I believe the body of both to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not the characters of the two very unlike each other - A. Not very. My belief is formed more upon the signatures. There is a likeness in the bodies.</p>

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. While you were with him, how many opportunities had you of seeing him write - A. I was in the habit of seeing him write most days; he has made out invoices to the customers.</p>

            . I live at Birmingham. I was in Mr. Wait's service eight or nine months; I left before Drury. I had opportunities of learning the character of his hand-writing (looking at the letters;) they appear to correspond with Mr. Wait's hand-writing; but that dated 16th September, 1822, corresponds more than the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CAMPBELL. Q. You do not think the signatures of both to be so much like his - A. The signatures of both correspond more than the body; the signature of that dated 1821, corresponds more than the body. I think the whole of both are his writing, but one is more like it than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear disguised at all - A. It does not correspond so much. I was principally behind the counter, and went out collecting a little.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him - A. I gave him notice; I had no dispute in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, had you any dispute with him before you left - A. I never had any particular dispute. He was rather afflicted at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any charge made against you of any thing that happened during his illness - I do not recollect any thing particular; I cannot recollect when it was, but I was behind the counter, and had taken a note, and Mr. Wait said he had looked into the drawer at night, and it was not there; but it was on the following morning, I do not recollect how long it was before I left. When I left him, I went to live with Mr. Bishop. Mr. Wait wished me to continue if I chose, and offered to get me a situation at Worcester, but I preferred going to Mr. Bishop. I have since been in business as a tobacconist at Birmingham, for two or three months, and then came to live in London.</p>

               <p>Q. You ran away from Birmingham - A. I had an error with the Excise, and left in consequence of that, but returned again, and settled the fine with the Excise.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. What was this transaction of the note - A. It was a local note payable some distance from Birmingham. I took it of a customer, Mr. Wait recollected my taking it and looked into the till at night, and said it was not there, and on the following morning he went to look and said he had found it there, this was cleared up and he wanted me to continue with him if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040028"/>choose; he had said nothing to me about the note till he found it in the till, and after that he wished me to continue and gave me a character to Mr. Bishop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you took the note did you put it into the till - A. Immediately that I took it, that I swear, he said nothing to me about it till morning, I had no quarrel with him except about this.</p>

Mr. Wait and Mr. Nash were appointed trustees: Nash never acted, and this was communicated to Mr. Wait, and in consequence of which I and him went in October 1815, to the Castle Bank, Bristol, to invest the stock. I mentioned in Mr. Wait's presence to Mr. Courtney the banker that Mr. Wait wished to invest this sum in the three per cent. consols, there being a deficiency of assets, the money did not amount to 2000 l. I told Mr. Courtney that Nash declined to act. that Mrs. Fitcho was likely to live many years, and as the money came ultimately to my brother and myself, and as Mr. Wait was the only gentleman named, we might all die before the old lady, and as the money might come to my brother's children, there should be another trustee. Mr. Courtney suggested to me to put my name in the stock, I said if Wait had no objection I would; and the stock was purchased in our joint names, no other stock was bought in our joint names (looking at the power of attorney).

               <p>"Cox" is in the same state now as when you saw it at Wrington - A. No, it is not, the letter C was then of a different character to what it is now, it was the same shape as a small c is usually made, with a dot, it has now a loop added to it. The dot is still visible, and the bottom of the C passed immediately into the o without a turn to it, but now there is a complete turn.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your usual mode of writing your name with a C of a similar description to what this now is - A. Yes, Mr. Day gave the instrument into my hands, it was with me an hour. I had it repeatedly in my hands during that time, when I returned it; the C was in the same state as at first. I stated to several people that it was no imitation of my hand-writing, as the C was of a different character, and it was very remarkable that the C in the attestation and in the execution was of the same character. It is clear that the fine stroke in the C has been written since, for there is the appearance of two strokes where it joins the dot; there has been an attempt to make it, and the first stroke did not meet the dot in the regular form, and so a second is made.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever received a dividend on the stock yourself - A. Never. I very seldom receive dividends on any stocks. I have executed powers.</p>

            . I live at Penley near Bristol, and am in the pilot service. In the beginning of October a person hired my boat to go to Clovelly, about eighteen miles from Bristol, on the coast of Devon, to bring a gentleman, and put him on board the brig Aurora. I got to Clovelly on Friday evening, the 4th of October. I found the prisoner there; he came on board. I had no conversation with him. I was only in the boat two days. The person who hired us told us he was going on board the Aurora, which I knew was bound for Philadelphia. We ran up the Canif on the Welch coast out of the bad weather to wait till the brig came down. I asked him no questions, nor did any body in my hearing. I came away on Sunday night, leaving him on board the vessel.</p>

            . I am a police officer; in consequence of information, I went down the river on the nights of the 8th and 9th of October; and in the Roads I found the gentleman at the bar in a small skiff down below, a man and a boy were on deck. I told him I had a warrant against him; he said how did I know he was there. I did not shew him the warrant, or tell him what it was for. I have known him twenty years; he lived in Wilson-street, I believe. I never saw him there, but I went to No. 5 Wilson-street, and saw his wife and family there.</p>

            . I am a wine and brandy merchant, and live in Mark-lane. I was in partnership with Mr. Wait from September 1811, to September 1816, and had frequent opportunities of seeing him write; for the last three years of that time I saw his writing three or four times a week. (looks at the letter dated September 1822.) I have seen this before, somebody on the part of the Bank produced it, and asked if I thought it was Mr. Wait's hand writing, or whether I knew it was his. I have been subpoened here on the part of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. (Looking at the letter) Tell me whether you believe it to be his hand-writing or not - A. The two letters</p>
               <p>"it" at the end of the name, I think resemble it in a small degree, but every other part of it I think very unlike Mr. Wait's writing; at least very unlike any of his writing that I ever saw. I stated this to the gentleman who applied to me, and that I did not believe it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. After having intimated that, had you any message from the Bank - A. I had a letter on the 3d of December, stating, that it would not be necessary for me to attend the prosecution. I have known Mr. Wait, eleven years; every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040030"/>transaction of his with me was of the most honourable kind, his general character was an upright honourable man.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you not when applied to on the part of the Bank, desire you might not be called, because it would be unpleasant - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you not at the same time state that there were many other persons much more able to speak to his writing than you, because you had not seen it lately. - A. Exactly so, and the gentleman said it was probable they should have sufficient evidence. It is six years since I saw him write, I said the</p>
               <p>"it" at the end of the name bore a resemblance.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. Was it after you said it would be painful for you to be called as a witness, and that you did not think it to be his writing, that you were subpoened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You applied to the Bank that you might not be called upon - A. I requested I might not at the moment I saw the writing. I had seen it at the time I wished to be excused from attending, but upon reflection, I considered it my duty to appear after forming my opinion on it.</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE. I am a wholesale wine and brandy merchant, of Bristol. I was in partnership with Mr. Wait, about five years, at Bristol, and had an opportunity of frequently seeing him write; he did not take an active part in the business (looks at the letter dated September, 1822.) I believe I have seen this before - the magistrate's clerk at Bristol shewed it to me. I was subpoened on the part of the Bank, and afterwards had notice that I need not attend. I had not expressed any opinion on the letter - I told them I did not conceive myself called upon to give an opinion, and I should decline it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you believe that to be Mr. Wait's handwriting - A. From the opportunities I had of seeing his writing, (which was certainly very frequently) this is certainly very different indeed from what I recollect of the character of his writing. I always considered him a gentleman of the highest propriety, and that was his general character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did your partnership with him cease - A. I think six years ago, but I have seen his writing since.</p>
               <p>Q. If you received a letter in that hand-writing what would be the impression on your mind - A. I should have doubted its authenticity. Mr. Jones was in partnership with us.</p>

On the 29th of November, about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening, I was writing in the parlour, behind the shop - my candle had been lighted above an hour; nobody was in the shop. I heard an unusual noise, rose up, opened the parlour door, and found the shop door wide open - it had been shut, and has a bell to it to give notice if it is opened. I cast my eye on the counter, and missed three reams of paper, which I had received two hours before - I ran to the door, saw nobody, and thought no more of it; but next day some was produced to me, which corresponds in quality and quantity. I had bought it of Messrs. Wilson. I had been out of the shop about a quarter of an hour, and left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040031"/>the door on the latch, in the usual way. If it had not been opened with great caution the bell must have rang.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 29th of November, a little after six o'clock at night, I was with Westcoatt; we turned into George-street, and saw the prisoner standing with something in his arms; he was seven or eight minutes walk from Miss Morris's. We passed him a few yards, turned back, and by that time he had got inside the door of one Joseph's house. I looked in, and asked him if he lodged there, he said he did; I asked if there were any other lodgers - Westcoatt came in and seized him. I took this paper from him. I found Miss Morris out next day.</p>

I went out, leaving her alone in the room; returned in a quarter of an hour, and missed it. I told her of it; she said she had not seen it; I said it was there when I went out, and asked if any one had been there in my absence; she said no. I told her she had got it; she said she had not. I said if she had, and would give it to me, or if she had pawned it I would redeem it, she said she had not seen it. I found it in pawn on the 8th of November.</p>

I said I would not have that done in my room, she sent me word yesterday that if she could not transport me, she would get another person that would.

I live in Rosemary-lane, Hinton, the prisoner and myself, all lived in a house together, and when we had no money we pledged our clothes one for the other, as far as it would go, and after that she left us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040032"/>and lived opposite, and brought a duck-frock for Pomroy to pawn for her and her man to buy a breakfast, I did not notice it; it was lined with blue; I believe, she delivered it in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no secret at all about it - A. No, they were good friends. Hinton brought a man in one night, and robbed him. Pomroy found it out and did not like such goings on, and gave her leave to quit the room, this was about three weeks before the frock was brought to pledge; she brought Hinton the money. I think it was 15 d. I believe Pomroy kept the duplicate - See page, 14.</p>

I saw it safe five minutes before it was taken, and the prisoner in the yard; he was employed to carry meat about the market. I was unpacking my goods in the yard, and missed it; and on Wednesday last I went with the officer and took the prisoner in his master's yard, in Chick-lane, and told him it was for stealing a coat, he said he had nothing on his arm but a cloth.</p>

            . I am salesman to Messrs. Challis and Company, Newgate Market, and have known the prisoner some time. Yesterday week, between five and six o'clock, I met him in Stationer's-court with a rough great-coat on his arm; I spoke to him and went on. I am sure he had a coat. As soon as I went to work, I met Mr. Mumford enquiring after his coat, I told him I had met a person with one, and afterwards told him who it was, and described the coat to him. I saw it after the prisoner was taken; it appeared like the one I saw him with; he is a slaughterman, and was in his working dress at the time.</p>

            . I am collector of the City tolls. On Friday morning, the 29th of November, between five and six o'clock, I stood at the bottom of Paternoster-row, and saw a man with a coat on his arm coming from the market. I looked at him, and suspected him; he stood still looking about in Warwick-lane, near Amen-corner. I had seen him two or three times before, and am certain he is the man. I left him, and went on Ludgate-hill. Jackson afterwards asked me about it, and at first I denied having seen him, not wishing to be in trouble about it, but afterwards said he was the man.</p>

I wanted to issue two writs, and bought the stamps for that purpose; and last Monday I called at the City Arms for Thompson, a law writer, who fills up writs; he was not there, and the prisoner offered to do it. I said if he would do it properly I would give him half-a-crown, and put the stamps down before him; he set to writing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never expected to receive the paper in the state you delivered it to him - A. He was to fill them up; he sat down and began writing. I went to another part of the room for the newspaper, and he went out at the other door with the stamps and papers; there was two papers not written on; I laid them down with the two affidavit stamps for him to fill up, and also make the affidavits. The papers were stamped with a 5 s. stamp. I was not alarmed at missing them, but sat a few minutes, and then began to wonder where he was, and from what I heard, I went to Mr. Hildyard where I bought them, and found he had been there and sold them; he was to fill all the papers up. He heard me inquiring for Thompson, and said he could do it, and shewed me an affidavit to convince me of it. I found him the same evening at the City Arms, and took him. I told him he had treated me very ill. I had written</p>
               <p>"17 s. 6 d." in figures on the stamps before I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Q. Did you not ask me to fetch the stamps - A. Yes, I called there before I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not say to you,</p>
               <p>"have the goodness to wait, and I will return" - A. No.</p>
               <p>J. B. HILDYARD. My father is a law-stationer, and lives in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street. The prisoner came with these two stamps, and asked me to return the money. I asked if he himself had bought them, he said No, he had sent a tall gentleman in black for them, but it was for a job of his own. I returned him 10 s., which was paid for them, and in about half an hour the prosecutor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040033"/>called about them. I produced them. I know them to be the same, as they are folded, and all the rest I had were not. I am almost certain of it, but cannot swear these are the two, as some others might be folded.</p>

               <p>"S. Ogle, Leeds," marked on them. In about half an hour I saw a man lay hold of one of them, pitch it on an end, and put it on his shoulder, and go towards the gate. I came up with him outside the gate, and said,</p>
               <p>"My good fellow what are you going to do with that chest;" he mentioned some name. I collared him, he gave a hollow like an owl, and the prisoner came from over the way, struck me on the mouth, and cut my lip without saying any thing; I had hold of the man at the time, and he threw the chest down; it struck me on the toe. He got away leaving it behind. I laid hold of the prisoner; he dragged me six or eight yards through the mud, but I held him. Hodge came up, and he was secured.</p>

No. There was five or six people round me inside the gate after the scuffle, but at the time he came over I saw nobody else near; some people were a few yards off; it was five minutes before I could get assistance. I am sure he is the man who struck me, for I never lost sight or let go of him.</p>

            . I live at Richmond, on the the 11th of November, about one o'clock, I received a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040034"/>dividend of 40 l. at the Bank, and had 60 l. before in my pocket-book, which was in my outside coat-pocket. I was going to dine in Serle-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, there was no coach at the Bank, and I went to the Mansion house, public-house, and had a pint of porter with my friend Brownley, who came out of the Bank with me. I had no conversation with any one at the public-house, we came out, and at the end of the court leading into the street, I saw some persons and one of them gave a spring forward, I turned round to my friend and said,</p>
               <p>"Let us get a coach, for we are in bad company," I saw the person who sprung forward sufficiently to know him, it was the prisoner; I saw him again ten days after, but was not very positive of him, when I first saw him, I thought him very like the man, but he was differently dressed. When I came out of the public-house door, I buttoned my coat and perceived my pocket-book there, I walked along the passage, the man sprang forward and in two mintutes, I felt and missed it and have not since seen it. There were five or six people about me, they continued where they were on the man's springing forward, I got aside of them and got away; I got into a coach at the end of the Old Jewry, and found my pocket cut through when I got to Mr. Ross's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you when you first missed your pocket-book - A. At Mr. Ross's, twenty minutes or half an hour after I left the public-house, I came out of the public-house near two o'clock, it was the day Hunt came to town, but before he came, there were a great many people all along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first pointed the prisoner out to you - A. I saw him at the Mansion-house sitting down, I called an officer and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man who jumped out, but I cannot swear he robbed me."</p>

            . I am acquainted with Mr. Prentice. I came out of the Bank with him, and came towards the Mansion-house public-house. A man who appeared like a coachman, stood at the back of my chair, in the public-house, and when I got up to come away he walked out before us, we came into the passage and I believe the man who jumped out from the wall was the same who was in the house. Just as we came out Mr. Prentice said he thought we were in bad company, we went on to the Old Jury, called a coach which he got into, and I left. I saw the prisoner in custody at the Mansion-house last Thursday week, I could not exactly say that he is the man, but very strongly suspected that he was, and I am almost sure of it. I am possitive of it now.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you more positive now than at the Mansion-house - A. I have considered it more and am more convinced that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY - Q. What are you - A. A baker. I will swear the prisoner is the man I saw; when he was at the Mansion-house, he was in a different garb, he was the same stature, and I believe the same countenance.</p>
               <p>Q, Do you mean to swear you are positive, or that you only believe he is the man - A. I believe it.</p>

            . I am one of the day patrol. On the 27th of November, I went with Mr. Prentice, to the Fleece, public-house - I sent him into the parlour, and told him to take no notice of me. I went in afterwards and Gilbert was not there. The prisoner was in the bar, and said Gilbert lodged there, and would be in between eight and nine o'clock. I said I came respecting a 10 l. note, which had been paid by Gilbert to the pawnbroker, and which was a stolen one; he said he had sent a 10 l. note by Gilbert, to redeem a pledge. Gilbert did not come in, and I told the prisoner he must go with me to the Mansion House - this was a little after seven o'clock; he put on his hat and walked with me. I left Mr. Prentice to wait the arrival of Gilbert. I then asked the prisoner how he became possessed of this 10 l. note; he stated that on the afternoon of the 11th, the landlord and landlady were out, and he was minding the bar all the afternoon, and between five and six o'clock a person came in, and had some brandy and water, and asked for change for a 10 l. note - that he gave him change out of his own pocket. I asked what address the person gave; he said he thought he had sufficient knowledge of a good note from a bad one, and did not ask him, and that he could not write and could not put the address on if he had heard it. In about three quarters of an hour the prosecutor and his friends brought Gilbert. We sat in the porter's lodge, where there is a good gas light - I think only me, the porter, and the prisoner were there. The prosecutor called me out in a few minutes, and stated that he was confident, and would swear the person who was there was the person who sprang before him at the time he came out of the public-house. After we went in again, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I have not yet seen the note, and wish to see it." This note and two others which had gone into the Bank, laid on the table, and he picked out this one as that he sent by Gilbert. I said then if he could not write he could read writing; he said</p>
               <p>"I can write a little, I did not mean to say I could not write at all - there is my writing on the top of the note," and he thought he wrote it for the name of Day; but on looking at it, it was Mr. Davis, King-street, Cheapside, written in a very bad hand. He was taken on Wednesday, and detained till Thursday, and taken to the Mansion House, and we were sent to Guildhall. The prisoner told me he wore a white coat and a cap on the day of Hunt's entry, and went out to see Hunt, but went no farther than St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you were talking with him at the public-house was the prosecutor there - A. No; he was in the parlour, and the door shut. I think he saw me taking the prisoner away; he could not see his face - the bar is very dark. He might go into the parlour without seeing him.</p>
               <p>Gilbert being called did not appear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was assisting a friend who keeps the public-house in Little Knight Rider-street, and on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040035"/>11th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes past one o'clock, some persons came in, and said Hunt was coming - two young men ran out, and I followed them. I went opposite the South door of St. Paul's, till Hunt passed, then returned, and in Sermon-lane, met Peer, and told him he was too late, for Hunt was gone by. I was not absent more than ten minutes, Mrs. Christie asked if I had seen Hunt - I said, Yes. She went up to dress, and went to meet her husband about three o'clock, and left me in charge of the house. Three persons came in about five o'clock, and had brandy and water - one of them came and asked for change for a 10 l. note; I refused - he said he could not pay me, I sent the servant girl to get change, she could not, and having money in my pocket, I gave change; I asked his address, he said,</p>
               <p>"Davis, King-street, Cheapside;" a few days after, I sent Gilbert, who had lived servant with me before, to redeem some articles, and he gave the note. The prosecutor saw me attending to the business of the house sometime, and said nothing about me. Directly I was asked about it, I said, I sent Gilbert with the note, and explained every thing.</p>

I burst the door open, and saw silver articles on a deal table. Watts, Fuller, and Brown were sitting round the fire; the table was between Watts and Fuller. I knew Watts, ran to him with a cutlass held it to his breast, and told him if he moved I would run him through. Handley then was holding a pistol to Herd's head, who was in bed with Banfield. Cooper secured the property - there were fourteen silver spoons, and a wine-funnel on the table. I handcuffed Fuller and Brown - while doing so, I saw a snuff-box (which I now produce) drop from either Watts or Fuller, but which I cannot say. Handley handcuffed Watts. We then ordered Herd to get out of bed, which he did; he dressed himself all but his coat, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go to the other side of the room for my coat, which hangs on a chair." I followed him, and when he had his coat in his hand, and was going to put it on, this knife dropped from the pocket. We ordered Banfield to get up and dress herself. Cooper asked the prisoners who the plate belonged to; neither of them made any reply, that I recollect. When Cooper had searched the room, I said I would have a search, and by the right-hand side of the fire-place, I found a board loose in the floor, which I took up; there was a hollow space under it, and some way from the hole, as far as I could reach my hand, I found five skeleton keys, and one other key, tied together, a hook, a chisel, a screw-driver, a stock for a centre-bit, an iron crow-bar, and dark lanthorn; and on the back of the chair where Fuller sat, was this old blue coat, very wet; and on the side of the bed where Herd lay, I found a pair of old worsted stockings, very wet and very dirty. We took all the prisoner's to the watch-house, and from there to the office. The coat Fuller had on was dry, and had feathers on it, as if he had been on a bed. Brown's hat, coat, waistcoat and pantaloons were very wet indeed, and all their shoes were dirty with fresh dirt; they appeared to have been dried by the fire. They did not say where they had been. On the Monday following, I and Cooper went to the prosecutor's house, with all the implements, also the knife and snuff-box, and on examination I found the sash had been forced up, and the chisel and screwdriver exactly fitted the marks on the cill and and bottom of the sash; the window-catch was forced off and a hole bored through the shutter. We found in the front kitchen a cupboard forced open by the side of the fire-place, and the same two instruments fitted the marks on that door. In the middle door of the back kitchen were marks of centre-bits; at each corner of the pannel which was taken out (I produce it), the beading which confined the pannel was cut away with a knife, so that it came out. We examined the wall and the vault door, it appeared that they had climbed up on the door, and then on the wall. It would take a full half hour to make an an entrance with these instruments; the robbery altogether would occupy above three quarters of an hour. The prosecutor claimed the knife and snuff-box immediately on seeing them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you get to Castle-street - A. About seven o'clock - it was day light then and did not rain. I got up between five and six o'clock; it rained hard then, and I went to bed. I arose again about a quarter to six, it was then a gentle mizzling rain, and did not rain heavy afterwards; it left off about six o'clock. It rained hard in the middle of the night - I do not know whether the previous evening was wet. I was never in the house before. I did not then know who belonged to it. I only saw one bed in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Five people don't usually sleep in one bed - A. I have seen as many. There was a good fire there. Brown sat in a chair on the left of the fire - the bed was in a recess. I think the room is not twenty feet square. The moment the door was opened, Brown looked over his shoulder - he had his shoes and hat on; his coat was very wet; it was a blue one. I did not ask to see his shoes; they appeared wet, and it was fresh wet as if he had been out that morning. He was very wet altogether - his clothes and shoes satisfied me that he had been out that morning. They were all sitting round a good fire. Euston-place is on the same side of the way as Pancras New Church.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Watts and Fuller were fully dressed - A. Yes; their clothes were dampish. Fuller's coat appeared to have been taken off the bed. He denied that the coat at the back of the chair was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Herd was in bed quite undressed - A. Yes - so was Banfield; she said she was very ill, and I beleive she was; she had a black eye and bruises about her. There were nobody besides the prisoners in the room. I looked at the stockings by the bed before Herd got up; I wrapped them up, and brought them away - he put on a clean pair of white ones, his coat was on the left hand side of the bed - I found nothing on him, but saw him drop the knife, his coat was dryish, it did not hang by the fire; his breeches were not exactly dry, they were not in the state they would be if he had been out in a heavy rain. I believe his waistcoat was dry, but did not notice it - his hat and shoes appeared to have been out in a heavy rain; he might have dried his clothes - his hat appeared to have been dried by the fire; I can tell that because I am a hatter by trade. Herd asked me before the Magistrate if the stockings were not in the pocket of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040037"/>coat - I said No, I picked them up by the bed side, and then put them myself into the coat pocket. The snuff-box, implements, and pen-knife have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. DE REIMER. I think the pen-knife is mine; it appears the same as was taken that night. I had it three or four months - I have no mark on it. I am certain of the snuff-box, it is marked with my initials.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It is a common pen-knife - A. Yes; if I saw it in a person's possession I should not claim it by any mark.</p>

            . I went with Pace to Castle-street. We got there about seven o'clock. Pace had called on me a little after six; it had been a very wet night, but did not rain when I came out. We went up stairs, broke the door open. Fuller, Brown, and Watts, sat by the fire. Herd and Banfield were in bed together. We told them we came to take them into custody, and on the table we found a wine funnel, and fourteen silver spoons in a blue rag, which was very wet, A tortoiseshell box was dropped, which Pace picked up. Herd was dressing at the time. Pace found a hole at the corner of the room, and pulled from under the floor the house-breaking implements. We did not find the centre bit belonging to the stock. I took from the mantle-piece a gardner's pruning knife; and after Herd and Banfield had got up, I found a silver box in the bed, with thirty silver counters in it; we found the owner for that. I found a wet blue coat hanging on the back of a chair in which I believe Fuller sat. By the side of the bed was a pair of worsted stocking with the feet wet. When Herd got up he put on a pair of clean while stockings. Two pair of their shoes out of the four were wet; one pair which Herd put on were soaking wet through. I think Brown had on a wet pair too; and the other two pair which appeared more dry, looked as if they had been dried by the fire. In a box claimed by Banfield I found a red pocket-book of this year, with a silver lock to it, with several cuts of a knife in it. After taking them away. Handley and I went back, and made a second search in the same room; this was between eleven and twelve. Handley found a letter and a file. We then went to Russell's, White Lion-Court, Seven Dials, to the first floor, back room, and found a woman's reticule basket, with seven picklock keys, and one latch key; and in the table drawer we found a googe bit, which would drill a hole. We also found a hat and coat there, which Fuller claimed; there was a bed in that room; we found nobody there. An umbrella was found on the landing-place in Castle-street. The prosecutor's cook claimed it as her fellow servant's property. The wet had ran from it; it must have been there some time, for the wet from it had soaked into the floor. We went to the office, and the prisoner's were put to the bar for examination; and Fuller claimed the hat and coat which I brought from Russell's. On the Monday following, we went to the prosecutors; the chisel and screw-driver fitted the marks in the window. I have no doubt those instruments had been used there. and also at the kitchen and cupboard doors.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The spoons were concealed in a blue rag - A. Yes, I did not see them till I undid them. I found what they were, and asked them all round if they were theirs; nobody claimed them. I did not take them out of the rag; the funnel was not covered over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Herd and Ban-field were undressed and in bed - A. Yes, I believe Herd's coat was damp, but not so wet as the others. I did not examine his waistcoat; his shoes were wet; his hat was very wet; it did not appear to have been dried by the fire; the streets were wet and damp. Banfield appeared very ill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not the night before very rainy - A. I went home about eleven o'clock, and it had not rained all the evening then.</p>
               <p>MR. DE RIEMER. The fourteen spoons are mine and have my initials on them. I believe the funnel to be mine from its size and appearance.</p>

            . I am officer of Queen-square. I accompained Cooper and Pace to Castle-street. We broke the room door open, and found the five prisoners there. Herd and the woman were in bed; the other three sat round the fire; there was a table standing between Fuller and Watts; the spoons and funnel were on it, and I took off a phleme. I saw the impliments of house-breaking found under the floor. Herd's shoes were very wet, and some of their clothes. I went to a lodging at Russell's, White Lion-street, which I suspected to be Fuller's, and he claimed a coat and hat which was brought from there; they were dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You examined Herd's things attentively - A. I examined his shoes, coat, and hat. I did not examine his waitcoat or breeches; his coat appeared dry, but his shoes very wet and dirty.</p>
               <p>MR. DE RIENER. I lost a phleme from the parlour, but cannot swear to this one.</p>
               <p>HERD'S Defence. I was in bed from twelve o'clock till I was apprehended, and I let these men in when they came in the morning.</p>
               <p>WATT'S Defence. On the night previous to my apprehension, I was with Fuller at a public-house, in St. James's. I told him I was going down to Richmond next day, and asked him to accompany me, which he agreed to, and appointed me to to call on him before six o'clock in the morning to breakfast. I called at his lodgings at the appointed time; he got up and dressed. His wife (who is Herd's sister) had words with him about going; he said he would go to his brothers and get breakfast, and we went there to breakfast. I knocked at the door. Banfield asked who was there and said, if we stopped while she unlocked the door and got into bed she would let us in, and did so. We asked for Herd; she said he was out, but she expected him in every moment, and asked us to sit down. We sat by the fire; and in about quarter of an hour Herd came in alone; and about ten minutes after Brown came up, and then Herd went to bed; the room was so dark I could discover nothing on the table till I pulled the curtain aside, I saw the funnel, but know no more.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040038"/>BROWN'S Defence. I called up there as I passed, but know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>BANFIELD'S Defence. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. Herd came home between twelve and one, and never got out of bed till three men knocked at the door. I awoke him; he got out and let them in; two very decent men saw Herd home in liquor.</p>

On Sunday the 27th of October, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw my tin cash-box safe in my bed-room, on one corner of my drawers. I had omitted to put it away in its usual place, as my mother-in-law was then in a dying state. Physwick had at that time lived not quite a week in my service, she left about seven o'clock that evening. I had a character with her, she gave me no notice of her going, nor did she wait for her wages. At the time she left we were at tea, and she was desired to take the tea up stairs to my mother-in-law, she came down, she was sent to feed the bird in the shop and we did not see her after that. In taking the tea up she must pass the room-door, where the cash-box was, she left the street-door on a jar. I apprehended her on the following Saturday the 1st of November, at Chatham. I have found the box with the writings that were in it, but all the money was gone. I have got one of the 5 l. notes from the Bank, and am sure it is one of those which were in my box. At the time it was stolen it contained two 5 l. notes, seven or eight sovereigns, a crooked guinea, one or three half sovereigns, a seven shilling piece, and about 5 l. in silver, with other things. I found the box at Mary-le-bone office. I don't know Stephenson; when I took Phywsick, I told her she had stolen my cash-box and money, she acknowledged taking it, I neither threatened or promised her. I found nothing on her.</p>

I gave her the change, I was to have a pair of black stockings, a flannel, and a black petticoat. I said I did not wish any thing, the stuff bought, would make two flannel, and two black petticoats, she told me to take the things home and make them; this was on a Monday morning. and on Tuesday she came to me and said a young woman had robbed her master, and she was afraid she herself would get into prison, and the young woman too. She went away telling me to make her gown as soon as I could, and to take care of the things. I told this to the constable, when I was before the magistrate, the week after, I saw Physwick on Tuesday morning, she came with Stephenson, but was not by when she mentioned about the note.</p>

I went with Mr. Baker to Chatham, and took Physwick, who confessed to me voluntarily that she had taken the box out of her master's bed-room, and took it to a court in Islington, which she did not know the name of, where she opened the box and took out what she could, and left the box against a wall there; that she afterwards came to Westminster, and went to Stephenson's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040039"/>with the two notes in her hand, but she only saw what amount one of them was, and that was a five. That Stephenson took both notes out of her hand, and said she would get change for them; that she returned in an hour or two, and gave her four sovereigns, telling her she should have the remainder another time. When she was at the office, I shewed her the box, which somebody had taken to Mary-le-bone office, she said it was the same. Stephenson denied all knowledge of the notes.</p>

I gave him two sovereigns, and the rest in silver. He told me on the 19th of August, that Mr. Rane had left off the wholesale trade, and could not serve me.</p>

            . I live in Cottage-lane. On the 12th of November, about two o'clock in the day, the prisoners called on me, and asked if I was in the habit of buying potatoes; I said Yes, but it did not suit me then, as I only had sixpence; they said they had almost done, but they had a few left, and as I was a poor woman they would sell them worth my money; I said I thanked them, but I had none. One of them went to the waggon, and brought three or four in his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"See, they are good ones;" I said they might be, but they did not suit me; they said they dare say I could raise money to buy what few they had left, they brought in about 1 1/2 cwt. in a bag. I said, what do you want for them; they said they wanted to empty the waggon, to take home some dung, and would I give 4 s. 6 d. I offered them 3 s. 6 d.; there were three men; one said</p>
               <p>"She is a poor woman, let her have them." I borrowed the money, and paid them. I believe the prisoners are two of the men. I saw them at the police-office three days after, and had no doubt of them. I really believe them to be the men.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of November I was in Edgware-road, and saw the prisoner with a basket in his hand, about five o'clock in the evening. I stopped till he passed us, and asked what he had, he said glass, that he brought from Mr. Smith's to do some work at Chapel-street, Paddington, that he brought it at night to save the trouble of going for it in the morning. We were near Chapel-street; he said he could not tell the house he was to go to, and afterwards said Mr. Peters's foreman of Park-street, gave it him, saying it was glass out of old coach sashes. He had twenty-seven pieces of glass.</p>
               <p>JOHN WITH. I am foreman at Messrs. Smith and Maberly's, builders. They were employed at Mr. Peters's manufactory. In November last the prisoner was working there. I saw the glass at the office; I cannot swear to it positively. I ordered two men to cut glass out of old<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040040"/>sashes, and place it in a room in the house, of which the prisoner kept the key. I missed some, and this is of the same description. I never gave him leave to take any. He bore a good character.</p>

I have known the prisoner a year and a half; I used to see him at the Globe coffee-shop, Beech-street, and at the St. John's, Cowcross-street. In August last he made an application to me, which I communicated to the police, and by their instructions I met him at the Globe coffee-shop on Monday evening, the 9th of October. I met him on several other occasions, and always with the knowledge of the police. On Friday afternoon, the 18th of October, about two o'clock, I met him at the St. John's, Cowcross-street, to receive the remainder of some money I had received the day before, two counterfeit half crowns and a shilling. I was to pay 10 d. for the half crowns, and 4 d. for the shilling. I met him on Friday to receive a half crown and a shilling more. I had given him 3 s. 6 d. on the Tuesday, to supply me with as much as that would produce at the rate I mentioned; three half crowns and two shillings were to be given me for 3 s. He then owed me 4 d. I had met him on Thursday and Friday to receive counterfeit money for the 3 s. 6 d. which I gave him on Tuesday. It was marked money, given to me by Armstrong. I gave the counterfeit money I received of him to Attfield, but what I received on the 18th I gave to Armstrong. He did not give me the 4 d., as he had not got it, and said the next purchase I made he should want 3 d. for the stuff to do the money over with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STIRLING. Q. You was not present when he was searched - A. No. I am a smith by trade, and now work for one Burt. The prisoner asked me to buy counterfeit money. I occasionally get jobs for myself. I never informed against people. I got money from the officers to buy the counterfeit money. I believe I have had about 22 s. from them besides, for loss of time. This is the only transaction I had with the police. My reason for informing of him was, because he asked me to go out with him several times, and afterwards asked me to buy money.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Being out of employ, he asked you to pass had money with him - A. Yes. I refused, and thought it my duty to inform.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have heard Eyles's account, it is correct. He first gave me information on the 8th or 9th of October. I informed the solicitor of the Mint, and supplied him with money from time to time to purchase counterfeit coin. On the 10th of October I supplied him with 3 s. 6 d. to purchase, and 2 s. 6 d. for himself to spend. I marked the 3 s. 6 d. so as to know it again. I apprehended the prisoner on the 23 d. Eyles had given three half crowns, and 2 s., on the 18th of October, all counterfeit. I gave him two marked shillings on the 23d of October, at night, (about two hours before I took the prisoner). I told Vann to go to St John's Coffee-shop to watch, and after waiting some time, I saw the prisoner and Eyles, and another man, come out together. I followed them up a court; Eyles and the prisoner were talking together. I followed them to the Queen's Head public-house, where I had stationed Attfield. I secured the prisoner, and took him into that house. Vann junior was with me. I said I must take him for uttering bad money to the carroly man who had just left him, he denied it, saying, he never sold any in all his life, that he had all good money about him. In his right-hand breeches pocket I found a purse, containing five or six shillings of good money - it was not the silver I had marked. In the same pocket, I found two loose shillings, which he said he had had some time, I found that it was the money I had marked and given that night to Eyles. I said that very money had been in my possession not an hour ago, and he said,</p>


               <p>"Lord bless me! the man who was walking with me must have put it into my pocket." I have kept the 2 s. ever since, I gave Attfield the counterfeit money I received from Eyles on the 18th; I could not take him on the 18 h, as it was very rainy, and I did not see him come out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You cannot say how the two marked shillings got into his pocket - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did he say he had but five shillings and not seven shillings - A. No. The purse and the two shillings were in sight when I asked how long he had it; he could not avoid seeing them; he was much agitated at the time.</p>

            . My father is an officer. On the 23d of October, Armstrong gave me information, and I went to St. John's coffee-shop, in Cow Cross-street, and saw the prisoner standing in the coffee-room. Eyles was sitting down, and I sat directly opposite him, about four yards from the prisoner, who was talking with Eyles for about ten minutes, and they appeared well acquainted. I heard the prisoner say he could not get them without - but I could not hear the rest of the sentence. Eyles gave him a paper over the settle; he took it and put it into his pocket. In about five minutes I came out and went to the Queen's Head, at the corner of St. John's-lane, where I saw Attfield, and I told him the prisoner had received a paper from Eyles. At that moment the prisoner came by, and Armstrong was behind him. Another man besides Eyles was with him. Armstrong then took him into the Queen's Head. I held his hand while Armstrong searched him; his account is correct. I saw Armstrong give Eyles the two shillings about an hour before he went to the house.</p>

            . I am assistant to the solicitors of the Mint, and have been so thirty-two years. The three half-crowns are counterfeit, and of the same die; the two shillings are also counterfeit, and from the same die; they are merely washed, and have not been in circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The charge is totally false. I never had any dealing with the witness, and only know him by seeing him at the coffee-shop, where I went to look at the advertisements for a situation. The man came and sat down by me; he had been drinking, and said some friends had been treating him, which I suppose was the officers. I came out in a quarter of an hour, and was followed by him. I was seized and taken into a house. The officers asked what money I had, and took out my purse, containing 8 s. 6 d., and at the same time he had 2 s. in his hand. I said the money and papers belonged to me, and I did not know I had more than was in my purse, and if it was in my pocket it must have been put in. I received this man in the light of a friend at first, but find him a villain. Under all the circumstances, what credit can you attach to such a man.</p>

She laid down a sovereign, which I took up, and found it a good one. I had laid her down the change, 18 s. 2 d., she then hesitated, and said it was not for herself, and the person she bought it for would think it too dear. (I had told her the price as soon as she laid the sovereign down,) and she thought she should not take it. I took the change off the counter, and pushed the sovereign back to her, she took it up; she then said she would take it. I tendered her the change again; she put a sovereign across the counter. I never suspected it, concluding it was the same; and she went away with the change and soap. I discovered it was a bad one when I went to put it into my purse. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When she put the sovereign down you told her the price - A. I cannot speak to that. I did not tell her the price till she offered to pay. The counter was between us, She took the sovereign up and held it, as I thought, between her fingers and thumb. I discovered it was bad before I put it into my purse, and did not put it in. I had put it into my pocket first; there was no other sovereign there; it has not been in my possession ever since, but it was marked about a fortnight afterwards, and I can swear to it; it was in my pocket all that time, except when I produced it at Guildhall. I shewed it to several people myself, but never lost sight of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is this the sovereign - A. It is. I put it into a paper, and put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. SEWELL. I am assistant to the solicitor of the Mint. This sovereign is counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not officers of the Mint who know the coin - A. Yes. They are only examined in capital prosecutions. I have been clerk to the solicitor of the mint for thirty years, and attend particularly to business of this description.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Puddiford, I hope you do not think I have got it;" I said, one of them must have got it; one of them then said,</p>
               <p>"There lies your note behind you," I then took up a 20 l. note, about two yards from the gig - I said,</p>
               <p>"This is not all by a great deal, you have got 40 l. more;" the watchman stood by and said,</p>
               <p>"What is that you say, have they got your money" - I said</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I give you charge of them." Howse immediately whipped his horse and galloped away - we went after them - the watchman sprang his rattle, and hollowed,</p>
               <p>"Stop the gig;" they drove on nearly half a mile, till they came to Baker-street, then Howse was thrown out and secured; he said,</p>
               <p>"Puddiford, I hope you are not going to leave me locked up." I found a 10 l. and two 5 l. notes, about three hundred and fifty yards from Lisson Grove, between that and Baker-street. I went home, returned, and found in the same road nearer to town, some notes, but as I cannot read, I cannot tell what they are; they were trod upon and torn all to pieces. I had drank two pints of ale with another person - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is not your name Pettiford - A. I don't know how it is spelt, some spell it</p>
               <p>"Ped" and some</p>
               <p>"Pud." I had a box coat on, which was buttoned up over my clothes. I sat in the corner of the gig, Bull sat nearly on my thigh - we left the house just before four o'clock. I only had two pints of ale. I do not think that the landlord refused to give me more liquor. While I was in the gig I asked them twice to stop and drink, they refused - they pulled up for me to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you charge one of the patrole with stealing your money - A. No; as I came out of Mary-le-bone office, I saw the dog which followed the gig, and said, that was the dog." I did not complain of any officers not taking a patrol into custody. I cannot swear the rattle did not frighten the horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said he whipped the horse - A. Yes, I generally feel for my money when I leave company, the note laid about two yards behind me - it was not a windy night. I did not go in the track the notes were found - they were found on the left side of the road, fifteen yards from the path.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I came up just after the prisoner got out of the gig, he was speaking to the two men, I asked how he came to loose his money, they at that moment drove off, but not very quick, for about twelve paces then turned round and came back, and said</p>
               <p>"What do you mean Puddiford, to say we have got your money," he said he had lost it and had been no where but with them in the gig, he persisted in saying they must have it, and said,</p>
               <p>"take charge of them." they immediately turned the gig, whipped the horse, and made off as fast as they could, a man had hold of the reins, they snatched them from him, I pursued calling</p>
               <p>"Stop-thief," they drove by all the watchmen, I came up with Howse who was dirty, and asking for his hat, I think he had been thrown out. I saw Puddiford pick up the 20 l. note; the road is very wide.</p>

            , Esq. I reside on my estate at Crickoel, South Wales. I came to town on the 9th of November, and lodged at the Hummums; but on Monday, the 18th, when this happened, I was lodging in Norfolk-street, I was out walking with two ladies, and returned with them to Norfolk-street, Strand, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. I went in, and we were sitting down to lunch, and all at once a person, whom I should know again, knocked at the door, and said a man in Howard-street wanted to speak to me. I went round the corner, and saw the prisoner - I am certain of him. He said to me,</p>

               <p>"Sir, do you recollect being in the coach with me on Saturday week?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Me! in a coach with you! I was 160 miles from London." Upon which he said,</p>
               <p>"Then I will accuse you of an unnatural crime, if you will not give me 10 l.; and you cannot get off, for I saw you go into the Hummums on Wednesday night, and I will therefore accuse you of it on that night." Upon which I said,</p>
               <p>"You filthy beast!" and endeavoured to seize him. I did not then see the person who brought the message. Before I endeavoured to seize him, he said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not give me the 10 l., you shall have plenty of our sort after you." I endeavoured to seize him, and he ran away as hard as he could down Surrey-street. I followed, calling stop thief, but nobody would assist me, till I at last gave the people to understand, as well as I could, that he had charged me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040044"/>with an unnatural crime; then plenty followed him. He ran down the steps into the river, jumped into the mud. I saw him secured. He was almost covered with mud up to his breast. I then said to him,</p>
               <p>"You have accused me with an unnatural crime, and I shall take you to Bow-street." He turned round in the presence of the people, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have no charge to make against you whatever, Sir, except that you met me in the street, and told me that you was a pawnbroker's clerk, and promised to get me a situation, and desired me to call at No. 8, Norfolk-street;" - which is all false, for I never saw him before in my life. He was taken to Bow-street and committed. He appeared to have a slight impediment in his speech, but not much.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you positively swear that I said I would charge you with an unnatural crime - A. On my oath he did.</p>
               <p>

            , JUN. I am a waterman, and stood at the bottom of Surrey-street. I saw the prisoner running, and Mr. Goldsmid pursuing him. There was a cry of Stop thief. On seeing me he ran into the mud - if I had not been in the way, he could have run into Strand-lane. Mr. Goldsmid came down and told me what was the matter, and ran round to intercept him. I ran into the mud, and secured him. I asked what made him run away - he said he had done nothing; he was no thief. I brought him to Mr. Goldsmid; he then said Mr. Goldsmid had promised to get him a place; Mr. Goldsmid denied having any knowledge of him before, and said he had charged him with an unnatural crime. The prisoner said it was all false. He spoke very well at first, but afterwards stuttered a good deal.</p>

            . I live in Howard-street. I heard a dreadful cry of Stop thief; ran up stairs; came out and saw a mob running down Surrey-street; the prisoner was brought out of the mud; his clothes were muddy up to his arms. Mr. Goldsmid said he had charged him with an unnatural crime; he said he had made no such charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of November I met a gentleman, who asked the way to Covent Garden-market. I shewed him the way; he asked what I was - I said I wanted a situation; he said if I came to the Hummums he would get me one. I went in after him, and asked the waiter his name - He said Goldsmid. I went on Monday; the waiter said he was gone to live at No. 8 Norfolk-street. I had a friend with me, and sent him to ask him to speak for me, as I was not able. The gentleman came out; I asked if he had heard of a situation - He said</p>
               <p>"You do not know me." I said he had promised to get me one; I was leaving him, and there was a cry of Stop thief. I went down by the water to see what was the matter, slipped into the mud, and somebody collared me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and took him on Monday to the building, where the opening had been made, and fitted his shoes to the foot marks on the ground; there were three impressions particularly deep, and all of the same size. I told him to put his foot into them, and it fitted exactly. There were no nails in the shoe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why not take his shoe off and compare it - A. I thought it fairer for him to put his foot in, as he might say I disturbed the mark. He did not object to it. They were right and left marks, and of a common size. I said it was very odd your shoes fit this mark exactly. He made no reply. It was a stiff clay soil.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left work about six o'clock as usual, and took the keys to my master's house, and staid there till twenty minutes past eight; then went and had a glass of gin, and went to Little Coram-street; remained there till half-past eleven. I had a swollen face, and a handkerchief over it. I then went to the Marquis of Cornwallis public-house, and then to bed; and on Monday morning about eleven, when I was at work, a man came, and said Scott and the officer had been after me. I went over to Scott, but he was not there. I returned to work, and between two and three o'clock the officer came. He took me to the building, and put my feet into the marks; they did not fit by half an inch at the toe, but he said they were a good fit. I said they did not by half an inch.</p>

On the night of the 16th of November, he was in my house from six to twenty minutes or a quarter to eight o'clock, sitting by the fire very ill; he had a tremendous swollen face, it was quite out of form, and so altered I should not have known him myself.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras. I was in Pall Mall, and saw the prisoners in company together, at the door of the Goat, public-house. I watched them, and in a minute I saw Mr. Cotton; they were on each side of him - he stood between them at the door. I saw Marks draw a watch from somebody, and give it to Ryan. I pushed Marks into the public-house, and secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been an officer - A. Not quite a year. There might be seven or eight persons about him.</p>

            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. I was in Pall Mall, and saw the prisoners there - I had seen Marks before, but not in company with the other; he and Ryan stood on the steps. Mr. Cotton appeared to be hustled, and in a very little time Hunt's coach came up; I tried to get into the passage of the house, and three or four who stood in front said there was no room. I forced myself in, and asked Mr. Cotton if he had lost anything; I had seen nothing taken, I only suspected - he said his watch was gone. Marks stood next to him I assisted in securing him. Ryan went away. I found a watch on Marks, which was his own. He cried and said he was innocent.</p>

I was in Pall Mall with Taylor, and saw the prisoners, and followed them to the Goat - I saw Marks on one side of Mr. Cotton and Ryan on the other. I kept my eye on them, and saw them very busy doing something, what I could not tell. Taylor caught hold of Marks, and he was secured. I saw Ryan at Worship-street, about twenty minutes past three o'clock that day, and identified him as having been in Marks's company.</p>

            . I am a wine cooper. I was in Pall Mall, in the Goat, and saw Marks there; but saw him take no watch - I must have seen him if he had. I was behind him, and think he could not take it without my seeing him. There was great confusion - I did not see Ryan.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear of a watch being taken - A. Taylor asked the gentleman if he had lost anything - I did not hear his answer. I could not see his hands. I can swear I never saw him take anything; he might take it without my seeing him - I was about a yard from him, behind. I do not think any body was between us; I dare say there was. I said nothing to the officers, but gave Marks my card in Pall Mall; I got it written down. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040047"/>him I would speak for him; but did not tell him what I could prove. I live in Blucher-buildings, Dorsetshire-place.</p>

On the 10th of October my brother went up to bed a few minutes after the prisoner, and about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning I heard somebody coming down stairs and go into the kitchen. (I had seen the hat on the kitchen shelf after they went to bed.) I heard a person come from the kitchen, and unfasten the street door. I jumped out of bed, went into the passage, and saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm; he pulled the door in my face, and went off. I partly dressed and followed him in six or seven minutes, but could not find him. I returned, and missed a blue and a black coat from the garret, which I had left there at ten o'clock at night; one was under his bed, and I had seen him put the other in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Every thing was in the room except what you missed - A. Yes. I never saw any clothes of his, except what he wore. Only one man worked there besides him at that time, and he went home at eight. Three persons besides the prisoner slept there.</p>
               <p>JOHN MEEK. I am the last witness's brother. The prisoner slept with me. I saw one coat which the prisoner had been at work upon that night; it was my brother William's. I went out in the morning after the prisoner, without knowing of the robbery, and did not see him again till the 30th of November, when I accidentally saw the prisoner at a public-house at dinner; he got up and wished me to go out and speak with him; I went out; he first asked me if we had not received a letter from him about the articles; I said No. He said he had written to my brother to meet him to make it up; that he had pawned the articles, and left the duplicates with a friend at Hoxton. We returned to the public-house; he said he would go with me to where the duplicates were, but he gave me the slip and ran out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not articles in the room of his - A. Nothing, to my knowledge; he was three weeks there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were the coats finished which he took - A. He was at work at one all day, which was not quite finished, but it was a perfect coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Defence. I left a man at work there on the previous evening, with my two shirts, which I told Meek's wife to wash. He employs women and men at work, all on the same floor. I left the coat in the room. I had seen a person who had been at work in the morning right opposite the house. I always arose before the rest of the work people, and generally went into the back kitchen to wash. I went to look for better work, and engaged with one Ragnull. I met a person a fortnight after, who told me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JURY to MEEK. Q. Had you paid him for making the coat - A. It was not finished. I paid him something in advance. I expected him to go on with the work.</p>

               <p>- DOBEL. I am a book-binder. The prisoner is a stranger to me, but being in the gallery I heard this boy's evidence. I was coming by at the time and consider that she was taking it off the shelf to take it in to see what she was to give for it, the boy is set as a spy to look out, and it might appear as if she was thieving. I saw it taken out of her hand, but I did not interpose or go before a magistrate.</p>

            . On Sunday the 1st of December, I went to fetch some beer for supper, and on returning, as I opened the street-door, there was a great many people bustling about, as a stage had broken down, the prisoner took hold of my whittle; I did not see him until then, I ran a little way down the passage and he followed me, having still hold of it, I put down the beer and recovered the shawl again, he took it off my shoulder about half a yard, two young men came into the passage, I ran and called my father; my mother brought a light and they got out, my mother shut the door and somebody kicked against it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the least doubt but it was a frolic - A. I don't know, he did not speak to me, he appeared tipsy, they could have escaped if they liked.</p>

            , a clothes salesman, who lives in Rosemary-lane. On the 14th of November, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked me to buy a timepiece and shirt. I said I was no judge of any thing of the kind, and asked how a sailor came by a time-piece; he said the shirt was his mother's, but he brought the time-piece from Hamburgh; he left the shop, and returned about a quarter past seven, with a bundle much smaller than what he had before; he still had the timepiece, and asked me to buy the things. I said I did not think he came by them justly; he pressed me to buy them; a man came to the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, I want to speak to you;" and when he got to the door, I caught up the bundle, and said,</p>
               <p>"Take your bundle with you, but he ran off without it." I was alarmed, and threw it out of doors; I sent for

I looked round, and saw the prisoner running across the Five-fields with something in his hand. We both followed him. I saw him throw the bundle away.

Welch stopped him without my losing sight of him; another boy came up and tried to rescue him.</p>

He had sat close by me - it was safe ten minutes before - I had been with him from eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>

A man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came to my house on the 21st November, and had dinner in the little parlour, and went away, and said he was going to spend the evening in the neighbourhood, and asked if he could have a bed at night; he returned and slept there, and went away about nine o'clock in the morning. About eleven, the servant missed the sheets off the bed, and about four in the afternoon, I missed the articles stated in the indictment from my bed-room - he slept in the back-room, second floor, opposite to my bed-room. I had seen them all in my bed-room the morning before he slept there, (Wednesday the 20th), but not after. The tea-pot and cruet-stand were silver - the cruets were glass, silver mounted. My bed-room was not kept locked, nor the cupboard in which they were; the stair-case is a good distance from the room where he dined, and there is a door at the bottom of the stairs, which is always shut, but not locked. I found the property on the Saturday week following, at Turner's, in Brydges-street. They are family plate - I am certain they are mine, they have my father and mother's initials on them.</p>

I advanced 2 l. 15 s. on the silver tea-pot, it is worth 3 l. I advanced two guineas on the cruets and stand, they are worth two guineas and a half as old silver.

               <p>Prisoner. I stand here overwhelmed with shame. I have not been in this country above twelve months from the West Indies, where I had been eleven years. When I came to town I had 1100 l., the hard earnings of a toilsome life, both on sea and shore. In a few weeks I accidently met with a person who I knew in Jamaica - he introduced me into one of the houses in St. James's, which have been the destruction of many besides myself. He deprived me of 300 l., and in the course of three weeks, I was deprived of 1500 l. more. I was an alien, and had no where to resort, and God only knows the feelings I experienced before I could bring myself to this. I never was the companion of loose or abandoned characters. I must throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court.</p>

I stopped about ten minutes. Careless said she was out, but would be in in a moment. I stopped in Careless's room; Wood was with her; I was not there two minutes before she asked for something to drink; I went out and got some gin, asking Careless to take care of the bundle, telling her there was property in it. When I returned the bundle remained; they drank the liquor. I took up my bundle and left. There were three quantities of poplin in it, of eleven yards each. When I got out I found the bundle very loose, and upon examining it one dress out of the three was gone. I went back and charged them with it; they denied it. I fetched a constable, who found it in a room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are a hairdresser - A. I served my time to one. I deal in various articles. We had a quartern and a half of gin. I do not think I had seen Wood three times before. She did not tell me she had taken it. I had been there a short time before; I went to see Miss Roberts. I seldom went but I saw Wood. She did not say I owed her any money. Roberts came in just as I went out. I knew it was a brothel. There was a man at dinner there when I brought the constable.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor applied to me. I went to the house about six o'clock in the evening; he was quite sober, and said he had lost eleven yards of poplin. I found it between the bed and sacking in a back room on the first floor. Careless was down stairs in a back room. I saw no other woman there; the prisoners denied ever having seen him. Wood was there undressed.</p>

               <p>- SMITHERS. I was dining at this house with two women; Wood and the prosecutor were in the front parlour. Wood said she had the property; that he owed her 20 s., and she would not return it till he paid her; he made no answer. She said he had owed it her fourteen days; he did not contradict her. She afterwards said he should have it for 5 s. I am a packer, and live at No. 29, Bell-alley, Coleman-street.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If Rawlings's account, in folio 136, is examined, it will be found that no deficiency whatever occurs, though it may not appear in the amount of 10 s., it appears as 20 s.; he acknowledges receiving 2 l. on the work he was on when I left, and 3 l. is entered, and the extra 1 l. is designed to cover what is stated in the bill; it was not entered at the time through the great pressure of business.</p>

He was the only person who went into the yard. About five or six minutes after the gown was missed, I sent after him; the servant brought him over, with three or four persons who were with him. He denied taking it, I sent for a constable. The gown was produced, and he begged for mercy.</p>

We had passed close by these steps, I went that way, and must have seen it, had it lain there then. Nobody was near the house but himself and the two men. I gave the gown to my mistress, and told her where I found it. He said he hoped my master would forgive him.</p>

            . On the night of the 5th of December, about eight o'clock, I met the prisoner in Golden-lane, with something in his apron; he said it was ham; I found it was two hands of pork, and a piece of beef. He said the boys who were with him gave it him. He told the magistrate that the boys went into the shop, telling him they were going to take the beef; that they brought it out and gave it him to sell, and he was to have fourpence for his trouble. It was claimed by Janes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met three boys on Saffron-hill, they said they were going into the shop to buy a bit of beef, and if I would carry it to Playhouse-yard they would give me fourpence.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of November, I went on an errand, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, leaving the door a-jar; I returned in five minutes, and found it more open than I left it, and the prisoner coming out with these things under his arm. I missed them off the line, and pursued him. I called for Patrick who lives close by; he stopped him in about five minutes, in my presence, with them under his arm. They consisted of three frocks and a petticoat.</p>

            . I live in the same house as the prosecutrix; I was coming down stairs last Friday week, she came up and said she had lost her purse, and that the watchman had it, I went out and met M'Cabe, I went round into Warren-street, heard a watchman say to the other</p>
               <p>"What have you done with her," the prisoner said " I sent her home about her business," he said</p>
               <p>"I have her tickets, and if you come round with me, I'll shew them to you," I saw him put the tickets into the purse, one by one, and saw the crape, I went home and told the prosecutrix and told her to go to the watch-house at twelve o'clock, or to Howard-street, at four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you say all this to Guest - A. Yes, I did not go to the watch-house with her, for I was not at home till dinner-time next day - Q. What are you - A. The same as Mrs. Guest - unfortunate, I believe she is the same.</p>

            . The prisoner sent for me to Newgate, and told me to find the woman whom he had told he had the property, I went and found her and the prosecutrix at No. 22, Fitzroy-market, she said she did not wish to prosecute, and would rather make it up with his friends, I agreed to meet her next evening, she came and agreed to take three pounds not to prosecute, the prisoner's wife and I were to raise it, I promised to bring her the money next day, at ten o'clock I went and gave her five shillings in part, and on Thursday next I was to make the rest good, but when I went she said she must prosecute, or she should not get the property, but she would take good care to throw a flaw before the grand jury.</p>
               <p>JURY to HOWARD. Q. Have the watchmen any instructions if they find any thing on their beats - A. They are not to be discharged if they do not bring it to the watch-house.</p>

I watched him into a house in Charles-street - I waited outside - he came out with this lead on his shoulder - I followed him to White-Lion-street, Seven Dials, into a plumber's, he came out without the lead. I took him and asked what had become of the lead, he said he had none. I took him back and found two pieces of lead which were what he brought in, he denied it but afterwards said he did bring it in, and that it was Mr. Brooks's. Brooks said it was his, and then said he knew nothing of it, and referred me to his man.</p>

I discharged her last Tuesday week, and on Wednesday evening she came to know if I would give her a character. I gave her no answer - she went through into the ironing room by the wash-house, where these things were, except the shift, which was stolen before. Mrs. King gave me information and on Thursday morning I went to Mr. Trails, the pawnbroker's, and found three table cloths and a shift, belonging to a person I washed for, which had been in my place while she was with me. I found a table cloth at Briant's - the pawnbrokers are not here.</p>

               <p>"Will you put your watch in that tea-caddy, and we will find porter." Bradshaw and another woman were in the room, I refused and then he drew near to me, and made a snatch at my watch, my fob was twisted, the chain which was steel broke, it had a gold seal and key to it, which cost me 4 l. 10 s., he rushed out of the room directly, I pursued but he got off with it, Bradshaw said nothing, I gave information at Lambeth-street, and he was apprehended, I have not recovered my property, I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you perfectly sober - A. Yes, when he robbed me, I might have been intoxicated three-quarters of an hour before, only one link on my chain was left, I had been drinking with a friend in George-street, Minories, about four o'clock that afternoon, we had three bottles of wine between us. I left there between six and seven o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street, On the 21st of November, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prosecutor who complained of being robbed, he pointed out the house in Chapel-street, I found Bradshaw there, he described the man to me, I took Bradshaw to a public-house, and as I came out I saw Archer pass, I called to Plunkett and the moment he saw me he ran off, I pursued, he got away, Plunkett took him, I knew him before, we took him into the public-house where the prosecutor was, he said that was the man who snatched his chain and seals. I found nothing on him.</p>
