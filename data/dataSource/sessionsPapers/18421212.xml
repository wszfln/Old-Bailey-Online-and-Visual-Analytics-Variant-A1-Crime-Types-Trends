               <p>Smith, he is not a friend of my cousin's, but I have teen him there)—he said he had got letters from Lord Stanley, giving him the appointment of Government Emigration Agent at Melbourne, Port Philip, with a salary of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and if I accepted his proposal of partnership, and advanced him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a bonus, I should have a third share with him of the emigration agentship, and of the other business which he would have in that colony—I said I would speak to my friends on the subject—he said, if I entertained the proposal, I was not to consult with any one, and that I was quite competent to judge of it for myself—and then he specifically said that I was not to consult with my cousin or Mr. William Smith—I said I should wish to write to Scotland, to consult some of my friends there—he said he had already lost too much time with Mr. Smith; that he had several valuable consignments depending on his going off shortly, and that therefore he could not allow me to write to Scot<lb/>land, as I must give him my answer is two days—I then said that I would think of it, and would see him, at any rate, at the end of the two days—he then took me down to his lodging, in the Mile End-road, and read me several letters from the Hon. Mr. Murray, Queen's Consul at Melbourne, with whom he said he was very intimate, and who wished him to enter into partnership with him there—I staid at his lodging till about eight o'clock—I was there for about three or four hours—I had a little wine—I was to see him again in two days, and give him my answer—on the 4th of August I called at the office in Broad-street, and saw him—it is Mr. M'Queen's office—the prisoner used to get his letters left there, as Mr. M'Queen was in Scotland, and the prisoner had the use of hit room—I told him that I had been too unwell to give his pro<lb/>posal due consideration, and therefore I could not decide yet—he said it would be folly for roe to think of going anywhere else than to Melbourne, where I had such good prospects before me; that he had this appointment from Lord Stanley, of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and that I, having one-third a-year, should have my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. repaid in the first year, besides the profits of the business—he said I must either decide then or give it up altogether; and on this assurance I accepted it.</p>

Overton and Hughes, No. 25, Old Jewry, and I found him there—also Mr. Hughes and Mr. Ramsay, a wine-broker, who was the messenger the prisoner had sent to me—Mr. Hughes read over to me the deed produced—the prisoner stated that I objected to that part which I have mentioned—I should have objected, but he stated it for me—Mr. Hughes asked him if he had made any consignments to Melbourne—he said he had, and he said it was all right then—the prisoner and I then signed it—Mr. Hughes asked if I had given the money to Mr. Adamson—I said, no—he said I should have done so—I had not got it with me—I said I did not understand that I was to pay it that day—I then walked out with the prisoner, and we went on to the London and Westminster Bank, in Threadneedle-street—I asked the prisoner why we were going there, and he said, to have my money, the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him my money was not there, it was at the Bloomsbury Branch—that was my 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had got out of Chancery—my deposit receipt for that money was at my lodging—the prisoner said as he had given a receipt for it, he must have the money paid now—I said I was not aware the money was to have been paid that day, that I was too ill to go there about it—he. then hired a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we drove first to my lodging, and got the receipt, and then to the Bloomsbury Branch, and drew out my 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we then went to the London and Westminster Bank, in Threadneedle-street, where the money was paid in—I gave the prisoner a bank-note for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he paid it into the London and Westminster Bank—he had no account there, but he opened an account with that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him pay the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I gave him into the London and West<lb/>minster Bank—I also opened a separate account with my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note I gave him I had got from the Bloomsbury Branch—I accepted it at a 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and paid it to him as such.</p>

               <p>to leave in three weeks, and now that I saw he had no prospect of leaving at all, I wished my money back, as he had neither consignments, or done any<lb/>thing—he stated to me that he had no consignments, and that he had no ap<lb/>pointment, that he was only going about it then, making a plea that I had been ill—he would not return me my money—he subsequently offered to give me a bill of 1002. at six months, and have the agreement cancelled—I was in communication with my friends at that time, and declined.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner's representation to you this, that he had obtained letters from Lord Stanley, the Colonial Secretary, to the Governor of Port Philip, to give him the appointment of emigration agent there, a situation of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the expression I used before Mr. Alderman Gibbs was, "Securing him a situation as emigration agent for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—the first statement he made was at my cousin's, where he stated that he had an appointment from Lord Stanley—it was on the 24th that he told me he had got letters from Lord Stanley to the governor to give him the situation—that was not the statement he made to me at first—he said that he had letters of appointment, not that he had letters from Lord Stanley, directing or request<lb/>ing the governor to give him the appointment—I have never made any state<lb/>ment different from that which I am now making—during my walk with him, after he had been at my cousin's, he told me that he had been a wine-mer<lb/>chant and agent at Leith, and Government emigration agent to the Australian colonies—that was before I parted with my money—I do not know that he has been an agent for the Australian colonies, except from his own words—I have not inquired at Leith as to bow that is—I have not sent to make any inquiries about his being an emigration agent—I sent to make inquiries about the way he left Leith, about his taking some money from there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on the same occasion of his telling you that he had been Govern<lb/>ment emigration agent for the Australian colonies, at Leith, did he not tell you that he had got letters from Lord Stanley to the Governor of Port Philip to appoint him emigration agent there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he had letters front Lord Stanley appointing him emigration agent there; letters of appointment to the Governor of Port Philip, not letters to appoint him; the appointment is made here—he said that the letters appointed him to the situation; that he had the appointment; that they were letters which gave him the appointment, not to appoint him—I will swear that he represented to me that he had the appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not tell you that he considered it quite as good as an appoint<lb/>ment, and that it was the same thing as an appointment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he said that on the 24th, when he said there was no vacancy, he said the letters were as good as an appointment—I called with him at three or four wine-merchants', and different places—he appeared to be known there—he did not tell me that the appointment was in the gift of the governor—he told me that he was appointed here, that he had letters of appointment addressed to the governor.</p>

               <p>to the governor ensured him the appointment; that they were letters of ap<lb/>pointment addressed to the governor, ensuring him the appointment—he as<lb/>sured me that he had the situation—I cannot swear to the exact words he made use of, hut he assured me that he had the appointment; he made me understand so—he said he had letters of appointment—I cannot say that he always used the same words—the first time I saw him at my cousin's, he said he had an appointment—the next time, when I saw him in Broad-street, he told me that he had this appointment; that he was at present on terms with Mr. Smith to enter into partnership, but if Mr. Smith did not agree with him he would then make me a proposal—I understood that there had been a negociation between him and Mr. Smith—I never met the prisoner at Smith's brother's—Mr. Hughes read over the deed at full length before I signed it, but he never consulted me before that—I have been employed in Scotland as a clerk to a corn-merchant about three years, and have also been about eight months in a distillery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on the 25th of Nov.—I found him in bed, labouring under severe contused blows and wounds about the eye, with extensive inflammation of the parts about—I continued to attend him until his death, which took place that day fortnight—I saw him on the Monday morning preceding his death—he was then in a dying state—we expected that he could not get through the night, and that was the opinion of Mr. Callaway of Guy's-hospital—I had not told him that I thought he could not live through the night—I told his wife and daughter so—I did not learn from anything he said, that he was aware of his state—he had extensive sloughing of the cellular membrane of the neck—matter was form<lb/>ing to a very large extent under the facia of the temporal muscle, and extend<lb/>ing behind the ear, so much so, that we were apprehensive from the inflam<lb/>mation, that it would burst under the clavicle—there was gangrene and mor<lb/>tification from imperfect circulation of the parts—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination—I found in the lateral ventricles of the brain, effusion of, not direct blood, but of a sanguinious character, blood mixed with the fluid—there was nothing else remarkable—I believe death was caused by the external inju<lb/>ries he had received about the head, and the extensive inflammation that en<lb/>sued,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184212120023"/>
               <p>as a consequence—violent blows with a man's fist about the head would account for the appearances, and I believe that was the cause—when I first saw him, the injuries of the head were so great, and he was in such a depressed state, that I was apprehensive of danger in making any further examination—I saw no material injury about the body after death, no marks or bruises—there was extensive suppuration of the integuments under the skin on the head—matter forming and burrowing all about, extending to the occipital bone—there were two wounds on the orbit of the right eye—the extensive inflammation was an after consequence of the injury sustained—when the facia of a part takes on inflammation, it is very serious, and he was not a young man—blows would produce inflammation of the cellular membrane, which is tantamount to erysipelas—after contused blows we generally have diffused inflammation of the cellular membrane, and in this case such was the fact, without anything denoting that it was really erysipelas—it is very diffi<lb/>cult to draw the line between diffusive inflammation and erysipelas—it is that sort of inflammation which we have after blows—if the body is not in a good state, the mischief would of course be greater—his depression was great, but he was perfectly conscious—I thought very seriously or it at first.</p>

I did not accuse Mountain of unna<lb/>tural practices, nor did I ever tell any person that Mountain got his living by * * * *; nor did I tell Mountain that he got his living by * * * *; nor did I speak to cither Mountain, Rason, Davey, or Hart, that day.

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Marlborough-row, Marlborough-street. I was in Foster's auction-room on the 23rd of Nov.—the three pri<lb/>soners, Hart, and Nathan, were in the room—I saw Rason go and speak to Mountain, and saw them talking together in the room—I then saw them go from the left-hand side of the room to the right, where the fire-place was—Nathan was near the fire-place, and Mountain said to him, "Did you say that I was a * * * * gentleman?"—Nathan said, "Yes, you are a s——, you know you are; it is right enough"—Mountain turned to Rason, and said, "You hear what he says, and you know I am not"—he appeared very angry and very excited—he asked Rason to go out and state the case to a police<lb/>man, for him to give Nathan into custody—Rason and Mountain went out together to state the case to a policeman—they came in again in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and Mountain went to the left-hand side of the room—Nathan went across to him, and nudging him with his finger, said, "How is your temper now? what I said is right enough; it is right enough; you know you are so"—Mountain turned to Rason, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> I can't stand this any longer; I must go and have something to drink"—Nathan said, "Oh, something to drink; aye, something to drink; <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> something to drink, and we will say no more about it"—Rason went towards the door leading to the passage, followed by Mountain, Nathan next, and Davey next—I fol<lb/>lowed close behind Davey—I saw Mountain turn round, seize Nathan by the collar with one hand, and strike him over the eye with the other—Rason said, "I can't see this," and seized Mountain by the collar, to drag him away—Davey seized him as well, to drag him away—I was there during the whole of the struggle that took place—neither Rason or Davey used any expressions of encouragement; far from it.</p>

I was at Foster's sale-rooms, and saw the three prisoners and Nathan there—I saw Davey come up to Mountain and Rason, and say something to them—they were standing, talking to me—in consequence of what he said, Mountain and Rason went over to Nathan, and said, "What do you mean by telling Mr. Davey that I am a * * * gen<lb/>tleman?"—Nathan tapped him on the arm, and said, "I mean s——y"—I then went to another part of the room—about a quarter of an hour after I heard a cry of "Murder"—I pulled open the folding glass doors, and dis<lb/>tinctly saw Nathan bleeding from his head, and Rason and Davey trying to pull Mountain back from Nathan, trying to prevent him from striking him—I was taken in charge about this, but was dismissed the moment the Magistrate heard the case.</p>

I am a draper, but am out of business, living at present on my property, till I get into business—since I have been in town I have been living at No. 2, Gray's Inn-lane—I have been in town little more than three months. On Tuesday, the 6th of Dec., about half-past three o'clock, I was passing down the Strand—I stopped for a minute or two at a print-shop window near Southampton-street, on the same side of the way—after I had been there a minute or two, a young man came up to me, and pressed himself against my left side, apparently with his person; but deeming it an accident, I took no notice—almost immediately after, Le placed his hand slightly and indelicately on * * * *—I immediately left the window, passed on, and turned up Southampton-street—I had not proceeded above eighty or a hundred feet when I heard a person coming after me, and as he approached me, he asked me, in an under tone, to give him half-a-pint of beer—on turning round, on the question being repeated, I ascertained it to be the same person—it was the prisoner—the question was repeated two or three times—I said, "No," left him, and crossed the road, to avoid him—he followed me, and still urged the request, entreating me to give him half-a-pint of beef, or money to procure it—I said I would give him nothing, and desired him to be off about his busi<lb/>ness—he said he would not leave me unless I gave him half-a-pint of beer—I then took from my pocket a penny-piece and two halfpence, and gave them to him, laying, "There is half-a-pint of beer for you, be off"—he took them in his left hand, laid them in the palm of his right hand, and holding it out to me, said, "Now, I will produce these to the first policeman I see, unless you give me more money"—I became greatly agitated and alarmed, and told him I had no more money, but a few halfpence—he said, "Give me what you have, and I will go away"—I gave him two more halfpence, which was all I had—he, said, "I shall hand these also to the policeman, and give you in charge, unless you give roe more money"—I told him I had no more money—he said, "You have something you can make money of, you have a watch"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "Then give me that," which I refused—he said, "Unless you will give me a crown I will hand you over to the first policeman I find, and will expose you"—I said I had no money—he said, "Well, pledge your watch, and give me a crown, than I will leave you directly"—I said, to him, "Where is there a pawnbroker's?"—he said, "I will take you to one"—he led the way through several courts, and brought me into Long Acre, nearly opposite Mr. Priest's house, the pawnbroker's—he then said, "No, I will not take 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will have some more money, you appear a respectable person, and your character is worth more than that to you, or I will expose you"—I said, "How much money do you want?"—he said, "Give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will not wait a minute or two; unless you give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old. On the 2nd of Dec, about ten o'clock at night, I was in Broad-street, going to my aunt's—Paul Francis was with me—I saw the prisoners coming down Broad-street—Johnson took my cap, and put it under her shawl, and ran away without saying any thing—I followed her to get it—Smith was with her—I never saw them before—I followed them up George-street, to a house in Church-lane—they went in—I and Francis stopped at the door for a second or two, and then went in, through a passage through a yard, and then turned to the left into a front room on the ground floor, with a candle and a fire in it—I saw Johnson standing there with my cap, and Smith sitting in a chair—Johnson threw my cap down—Smith jumped up—Johnson ran to the door, and said she would murder me if I did not give her my money—Smith jumped up, and laid hold of my hand, and Johnson struck me by the side of my head—I said, "You had better leave me alone"—she asked if I had got much money—I said that was my business—she put her band into my pocket, and took out 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Smith holding her hand over my mouth—Smith then struck me, and said, "Have you got any more?"—I said,</p>

               <p>"No"—she then felt in my pockets, called me a b—, and said there was a shilling, and if I did not give it her she would kill me, and Johnson struck me—I was obliged to give her the shilling out of my pocket, because the made me—she then said I might go, and opened the door—we both went out—Francis was in the room with me all the time—they did not try to rob him—he had no money—we went out of the passage into the street—they followed us and bade us good night—I thought I would watch which way they went, but did not see a policeman that night—I afterwards gave a person in charge on sus<lb/>picion, who looked like Johnson, and when I was at the station, Smith brought a breakfast to that person, and I gave her in charge—I am sure of her—I next saw Johnson at the station at Bagnigge-wells—I am sure she is the person—I made the mistake, because the other person looked like her in the face, but I was not sure, because she did not have scratches on her face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I lived at No. 3, Mary's-place, Peckharm, New-town. I know the prisoner—he called upon me in Sept. last year—I cannot tell the day—we went out together, and he gave me a watch to pledge for him—it bad the appearance of a gold one—he said his father had come to town, that he wished to make an appearance, he had not money, and he wished to raise money on this watch—he told me his name was Stanhope—I bad known him some time—in consequence of what he said to me, I pledged the watch at Mr. Filmer's, in the Walworth-road in my own name, for I think 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot exactly say—I gave the money and duplicate to the prisoner—I should say there was a glass to the watch, but I had it in my hand a very short time—the dial was gold—I pledged another watch for him, not at the tame time—I cannot say how long afterwards—one was in Sept., and the other I think in Nov., both in the last year—I pledged one at Tur<lb/>ner's—I do not know whether it was the first or second one, and the other I pledged at Filmer's—I pledged hoth in my own name—the second one had also a gold dial—the prisoner had a little black dog at the time I knew him—I believe it was a valuable one—he told me when I pledged one of the watches that he had an allowance from his father, that his father had stopped that allow<lb/>ance, that he wished for money to go to the Isle of Wight, and this watch was Merely a temporary thing till he got his money—I gave the pawnbroker di<lb/>rections to put my own name on the duplicate of the one pledged at Filmer's—I said, "You had better put the maker's name on"—the prisoner said it was a valuable watch, and I thought if I did not take it out, it would be all right, not being accustomed to such things—I gave him the duplicate and money—he took the duplicate, read it, and said, "You have pledged this in your own name and the maker's"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Quite right,"—folded it up and put it into his waistcoat pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Elizabeth-street, Dorset-street, Ratcliff. On the last Saturday evening in Nov., about six o'clock, I was coming home with some grocery, and by the railway I saw two boys running with a great bundle between them—one of the boys was about seventeen or eighteen years old—I do not know either of them; it was so very dark I could not see their faces—they were abort forty yards from the prosecutor's house, coming as from Stepney-causeway—that does not lead from the prosecutor's—they were going at the side, not going by it—about ten minutes afterwards my mother sent me out for some bread, and as I came back I saw another boy at the same place, by the rail<lb/>way, with a blanket rolled under his arm—it was a person about the same size as Allen.</p>

On Saturday, the 3rd of Dec., I was in my back parlour—I had been in the front room half-an-hour previously—when I left it I shut the door—there was no lock to it, and I fastened it with a rope to a nail—be<lb/>tween seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I observed, through a glass par<lb/>tition, a light in the front room—I had left no light there—I immediately ran into the front room, and found the door open—there was no light then, but there was a strong smell of lucifer-matches—I called for a light—my wife brought one—I looked about—my brother-in-law ran out in pursuit of an<lb/>other party, and on his return I found the prisoner behind the door of the front-room—he flew out on me—with some difficulty I got him down, and he then pretended to faint away—I missed a gown off the bed-post, and a pair of trowsers from a box in the fire-place, which I had seen safe about half-an-hour before—I found the trowsers close to the door, rolled up with a sailor's bed of my brother's, ready to take away—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the gown—he said, "I have given the gown to a man named Fagan, who is dancing at the Crown, in Ratcliff; I will give you any money to let me go, and if you doubt my word, you shall keep my clothes till I return it—I sent for a policeman and gave him in charge.</p>

At a quarter past twelve o'clock, in the morning of the 7th of Dec, the pri<lb/>soner entered the bar—she waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I had occasion to go up stairs with some liquor—I returned in about three minutes, and she was walking out—I saw her back as I came down stairs—I had some money to put into the till—I went to the place, and the till was gone—I looked after her, but she was gone—I spoke to two policemen—she was brought back afterwards, and my till was found—it contained two shillings, a sixpence, some pence, and halfpence—no one had come in but her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to George Smellie, a pawnbroker, in Shadwell. On the 12th of Dec. the prisoner came about a quadrant and a ring—he put the ring on his finger, and talked of buying it—I made him put it back, and said I did not think he wanted to buy—he went away without baying either quadrant or ring—when he was gone I missed a cameo-ring—I went after, and overtook trial about 130 yards off—I desired him to return, and charged him with stealing a ring—he said he had not got it—I said I should give him in charge—he said, "Don't—come home with me, and I will make it all right"—I sent for an officer—he then began to feel about his pockets, and pulled out a piece of rag, and this ring fell from it—I said that belonged to me, and I should give him in charge—he said, "Don't give me in charge, come with me, and I will give you a couple of pounds"—this is my master's ring—it in a box cameo-ring, and the one I lost.</p>

               <p>seen when he was there first—Bush said he had emptied it into a barrel or tub which he pointed out—I went and found in the tub oats, beans, and bran, mixed together—I saw Green take up these two sacks of Mr. Coleby's—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at them</hi>)—Bush said he did not know how Coleby's sacks came there, but in his business sacks sometimes got mixed—I went into the barn, and saw a load of straw—we moved it about—Bush said we should find no sacks there—Green continued to search, and found a sack of oats with no name on the sack—Bush said, probably it was a sack that his man put there—he afterwards said he had bought one quarter of oats of Mr. Tanner, that he had sold one sack to Mr. Pottle, and this, was the remaining sack—I then left—I took Ruffell into custody at the King's Head—I told him Mr. Sheppard charged him on suspicion of stealing a quantity of oats from him—he said he knew nothing about them—after that I took Bush—I said it was on suspicion of receiving a quantity of oats which had been stolen from Mr. Sheppard—he said he knew nothing about them—I produce a sample of the oats taken from the sack found in the straw, a sample which Green took from Mr. Pottle's, and a sample I took from Mr. Sheppard's bin which corresponds with the sample taken from the sack in the barn—this sample from Mr. Pottle's does not cor<lb/>respond, it is very light.</p>

Police!" several times—I followed up the road the way Edward Taylor had gone—Smith pointed out the way to me—I overtook him—Smith was there at the time, but whether by me at the moment I cannot say—I knew Edward Taylor again—I have no doubt he is the person—he ad<lb/>mitted at the very moment he was the person who struck me—I then said I would never leave him with my life—I charged him with assaulting me without any cause, and attempting to commit a robbery—the policeman came up and took him to the station—he did not do anything when he struck me—I had not spoken to any person at all previous to their rushing on me—I had never seen them before to my knowledge—I lost nothing—I do not remember anything being done to my person while on the ground—I found my waistcoat open, and my handkerchief torn from my neck when I came to my senses.</p>

On this Saturday night I had been to Woolwich to get my provisions for the week, and was returning towards Greenwich about half-past eight, I saw Edward Taylor beating a marine who ran away—I afterwards came up to the marine—about a quarter of an hour after I saw Brown and Carter walking along the road arm-in-arm—they were sober—I was before them, close to the turnpike, about fifty yards off—I heard a cry, ran towards them, and saw Edward Taylor knock Brown down very violently, and he said he would knock his b—y head off—I assisted in getting him tip, and Edward Taylor collared him again, look him several yards, and very nearly knocked him down again, while I was standing by—he walked towards the White Horse—I saw Brown knocked down twice by Robert Taylor—picked him up, and walked to the White Horse—his head waft bleeding very much, and Carter had a black eye. which was swollen as big as my fist—Robert Taylor and Carter struggled together, and never let go of one another till they got to the White Horse, which was between thirty or forty yards—the two together went on hanging together, into the White Horn—I did not go in, I stood outside—I lost sight of Robert—he had a hat and white frock on when he struck the prosecutor; and when I saw him, about half an hour after, he had a cap and a jacket.</p>

I am a watch finisher, and live in Brewer-street, Woolwich On the night of the 26th of November, about half-past eight o'clock, I was coming across the Greenwich-road, and saw Edward Taylor kick Brown, I think in the face, as he was on the ground—he appeared insensible and was bleeding—Robert had hold of Carter at the road-side—they appeared wrest<lb/>ling—I had never seen the prisoners before—I ha passed them and Brown and Carter, and at the solicitation of the two prisoners' wives went back—they said they had been ill-used by Carter and Brown, that they had attempted to rob them in the road—they said, "For God's sake, young man, go back for our husbands are gone after them, and we are afraid they will get injured"—I immediately went back, and found them struggling together—I knew no<lb/>thing of the women before—I heard a cry, but I returned at the solicitation of the women.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and am agent to Mr. William Carpenter, of the Greenwich Steam-mills—I go round to various customers, in my gig to sell the flour—I take a boy with me. I was out on the 1st of Dec., and saw Mr. Carpenter's wagon standing opposite the prisoner Onions's house, in the Old Kent-road, on the other side of the road—Johnson had charge of that wagon—I saw a sack of flour, with Mr. Carpenter's name on it, being carried across the road from the wagon—the man who carried it was going towards Onions's house—he went down a sort of hill, and towards a lane, where, I suppose, he thought there was a side-door to Onions's house—Johnson beck oned him—he came back, and went to Mr. Onions's—the way he was going would have taken him by an indirect way to Onions's house—at this time Johnson had not an opportunity of seeing me, because I was behind a wagon—Onions was standing at his own door, and saw all that was going on—Johnson had joined the man who had the flour, assisted him up the hill with it, and then went into Onions's house—I then drove up to the door, and said "Well, Johnson, what are you after?"—he said, "I have brought Mr. Onions a sack of flour"—I asked how he received that flour—he said the order was given at the mill, and he received it out of the delivery-book—I asked him to show me the ticket—he said it was in the house—I requested he would fetch it me—he said he would, and went in—I expected he would bring me the ticket—I sat in my gig some time—he did not come—I got out of the gig and ran into the house—there was no one in the shop, but I heard a talking below—I ran down stairs to the bake-house, where I saw Johnson, with the sack in his hand, and the flour was shot into the trough—I said, "Johnson, where is the ticket for this flour?"—he said he had not got one—I said "Then, I won't suffer this, this flour is stolen"—Onions, who was there, said "The flour is shot now"—I said, "I do not care about that, I will have the flour put up again; I will send for a policeman, and have you put into cus<lb/>tody"—I took charge of the wagon, and when Johnson was at the station I asked for his delivery tickets, and he gave me two, one to Mr. Amos, for thirty sacks of flour, and the other to Mr. Dyer, for one sack of meal—the wagoner is bound to have a delivery ticket with every parcel of goods de<lb/>livered to him—Onions had been a customer of Mr. Carpenter's several years</p>

               <p>ago, bat at this time he was not trusted with goods, he had to pay the money beforehand—he paid ready money, and took the goods away with him—the delivery tickets are given from the counting-house—when a person gives orders for floor, he goes to the counting-house, and a delivery-ticket is made out, and the wagoner is charged with it, and has the ticket—there is no mode of taking out flour without a delivery-ticket made out from the counting-house—both the prisoners were aware of that—when I sent the wagon home I told Bell, the boy who was with me, to follow the tail of the wagon, so that he could swear that nothing was taken out of it; and when I got home to the mill I counted and found thirty-one sacks of flour in it, and one of meal, in<lb/>cluding the one Onions had had, and which was put back again.</p>
