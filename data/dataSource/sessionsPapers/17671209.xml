            . I am butler to the Goldsmiths company. On the last Lord-Mayor's day there was lost a silver tureen ladle, a table-spoon, and a butter-ladle.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of the tureen ladle?</p>
               <p>Key. That is to ladle the soup out of the tureen.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that last?</p>
               <p>Key. I saw it between three and four in the hall in the afternoon that day; I delivered it out somewhere on the table, and some in the beanset; there were half a dozen of them on the first table; there were butter-spoons and table-spoons upon all the four tables; by counting up the number of them after they had been used about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, I found one tureen ladle, one table-spoon, and one butter-spoon missing; in the whole there are six dozen of table-spoons, two dozen of butter-ladles, and thirteen tureen ladles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivers them back to you?</p>
               <p>Key. They go into the kitchen to be washed, then they are brought to me by my waiters; there were ten waiters that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner employed there?</p>
               <p>Key. No, he was not employed by me; I was present when he was apprehended on the Wednesday between three and four in the afternoon.</p>

            . I have the honour of being beadle to the worshipful company of Goldsmiths. Last Lord-Mayor's day I attended at the hall, I saw the prisoner there; there were a great number of people in and about the hall; we asked their business; several of them informed me they were servants waiting for liverymen; I asked the prisoner whose servant he was; he told me he was employed as a whiffler to wait upon the cook; I called to the porter Mr. Wren, and said, pray see this whiffler out of the hall, knowing he had no business there, that is all I know of Mr. Whiffler. I saw him passing and repaffing several times between the kitchen and the hall, and I obliged him to go out of the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he employed in?</p>
               <p>Cawthorn. In carrying dishes, and taking dishes away.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him at the time of dinner?</p>
               <p>Cawthorn. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not many whifflers there?</p>
               <p>Cawthorn. There may be many, but they have no business at the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these whifflers employed to attend the cook?</p>
               <p>Cawthorn. No, they are not, no farther than to carry dishes to gentlemen's tables.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>

I dined at Goldsmiths-hall last Lord-Mayor's day, the 9th of November; as I sat at dinner, being the last person at the end of the table, the door was open, I saw the prisoner bring dishes to the door, and the waiter received them of him, and I saw him take dishes from the waiters and carry them towards the kitchen, but I can't be particular what dishes they were; there was a dispute with the waiters; they told him he had no business there; he said he was employed by the cook; the beadle took him by the shoulder, and said he had no business there; I remember seeing him with one tureen in his hand.</p>

            . I am a silversmith; I have known the prisoner from a baby. On the 11th of November last he brought some silver melted in little comical ingots; it weighed 10 ounces 13 penny-weights; I suspected it might be the silver advertised, as it answered to the weight that was taken from the Goldsmiths company at the hall; he said it came from Portsmouth, and he had a letter of advice about it; he desired me to get an assay made of it, and then he was to send it down, (produced in court.) This never cou ld be melted at Portsmouth in this manner, they know there how to melt it as we do, this is not in a workmanlike manner. I went with the constable to Gutter-lane, and sent for the prisoner; then he told Mr. Fair he received it from Chatham; Mr. Fair asked him if he had a letter; he said he had, but no letter could be found. I was at his examination before my Lord-Mayor; there he said he kicked against something in Goldsmiths-street, Wood-street, and he went to a tavern for a light, and they refused him one; then he went home and got a candle and lanthorn, and went to the place and found the silver. I have trusted him in my shop when I have had a thousand ounces of silver, and I never knew any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hardy. I belong to Mr. White; Mr. Swift brought this silver to our house, upon which there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176712090009"/> was some enquiry made after the prisoner at the bar; I saw the prisoner at the public-house in Gutter lane, he said he received the silver from Chatham; and before my Lord-Mayor he said he found it in Goldsmiths-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cawthorn. Did you hear the prisoner examined?</p>
               <p>Cawthorn. I did; he prevaricated when Mr. Fair examined him, saying he had it from Chatham, and he said before my Lord Mayor he had it from Portsmouth; I told him he made out a lame story, and if he expected any lenity from the company, the best way would be to tell the truth; he sighed and hesitated a little time, and at last of all said that he was guilty, and it was poverty and the want of business that drove him to it, and he desired to speak with Mr. Fair, and they went out together.</p>
               <p>Q. to Key What was the weight of the silver lost at the hall?</p>
               <p>Key We weighed a dozen of butter spoons, a dozen tureen ladles, and a dozen of table-spoons, and we found three of them, one of each sort, to come up to the weight of ten ounces thirteen pennyweights.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hardy. What is the weight of the silver?</p>
               <p>Hardy. It weight ten ounces thirteen penny-weights</p>
               <p>Q. to Cawthorn. Mention the words as near as you can, that you said to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cawthorn. I said, if you expect favour of the company, it will be better to make an ample discovery; and in answer to that, he did acknowledge taking the things two or three times over to me. I put this to him before he was before my Lord-Mayor, but I did not tell my Lord he had made that confession; he denied it there, and said he had found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was at Goldsmiths-hall on my Lord Mayor's day; I went with my wife to see the table laid; Mr. Cartwright the head cook seeing me in the kitchen doing nothing, said, have you any thing to do here; I said, no, only I came to see; he said, take this key and go to my wife for a shirt and stockings; I sent my wife; she brought them and delivered him the key; then he gave her and me some wine; then things were going in; he said, take hold of this dish and follow them; I believe I carried two or three dishes, but never a tureen. I was going through Goldsmiths-street in the dark, and kicked against something; I saw a watch key; I had some suspicion there was a watch; I went to the Sun Tavern in Milk-street, and asked for a candle, saying I had kicked against something in Goldsmiths-street; the young man said, he had not a bit of candle, but desired me to go to my own house, which I did; and when I came to the place, there lay this silver in a brown paper all over dirt.</p>

            . I am son to Mr. Swift that has given evidence here; I live at the Sun Tavern in Milk-street; the prisoner came to me on Thursday the 5th of November in the evening, and required a piece of candle; he said he had kicked against something in Goldsmiths-street, and had picked up a watch key, and thought there might be a watch; I said I could not let him have a bit, and advised him to go home for a bit, and go and see what it was. On the Monday morning after he called again, that was my Lord-Mayor's day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's character?</p>
               <p>Swift. I think he deserves a good character; I think he is not guilty of this charge; he and I are very intimate.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the Sunday before my Lord-Mayor's day?</p>
               <p>Swift. He called at the tavern where I live when he came from church.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him on the Friday?</p>
               <p>Swift. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him on the Thursday night?</p>
               <p>Swift. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what part of the street it was that he kicked against something?</p>
               <p>Swift. No; he said he thought it jingled like silver, and he thought it might be a watch, or the case of a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he attempted to look for it?</p>
               <p>Swift. He did, but the moon did not shine on that side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Swift. He lives in King's-head-court, Gutter-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the Sun Tavern from the place where he said he found the silver?</p>
               <p>Swift. It is about an hundred yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is his house to the place?</p>
               <p>Swift. That is about a hundred and fifty yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not ask this intimate friend of your's on the Sunday, whether he had found any thing, when he imagined he had kicked against a watch or some silver?</p>
               <p>Swift. I did not; I was with him but a little time, and I never thought of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Field drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He was very drunk, he could hardly speak; the prisoner was drunk also, he went towards the fire; Mrs. Field said, stand away fellow, I do not want any of Justice Fielding's gang here, she said, here is a quart pot, I will take care of it, may be you will put it in your bags; he said, I shall not hurt you: then the landlord and he went to clapping of hands together; they did not shake hands; Mr. Field stood with his back against the bar, he could hardly stand without holding, and could not speak plain: after that Mrs. Field came to me, and said, have you got my husband's ring; then Mr. Field said to the prisoner, you have got my ring, and I will stick close by you.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the clapping of hands, that he charged the prisoner with taking the ring?</p>
               <p>Fisher. That might be half a quarter of an hour after the clapping of hands; the prisoner submitted freely to be searched; they took a candle, and looked all round the room; Mrs. Field said, do not let the man go; no, said the prisoner, I shall not go; he was taken into another room, and searched, but no ring found; I saw the whole transaction: Mr. Field went out of the room after the clapping of hands, before he made any complaint of losing his ring.</p>
               <p>There were other witnesses, but the jury declared they were satisfied, so they were not called.</p>

Mr. Gray said, you have more money than is your own there; the prisoner said, take it if you dare; I said, then put it in your pocket again, that is not what we want; the Frenchman said he thought he saw him slip something in his shoe; he was desired to pull off his shoes; he very readily put up his right foot, and pulled off the shoe; then I felt in his fob; then I desired him to pull off the other shoe; then he began to abuse Mr. Gray; he found I was resolved to have that shoe off; he shuffled about it, and wanted to get the money out; when it was off, one guinea dropped on the table, and another I took from him; I put them two in my pocket; we then took him to the Computer, and searched and found 9 s. 6 d. and some halfpence; I kept the two guineas and 5 s. to bring here, and delivered the rest back to help him in prison.</p>

            : knocked at the door about seven the next morning, I came down to him; he asked who we had in the house all night; I said, nobody but my fellow servant and myself; then he said, I am afraid your house has been robbed, for I saw a man and a woman with a child go out of your house about half an hour after six; I begged if him to run after them, he and another man did; then I and my fellow servant went to search about the house; we found the kitchen window open, the sash frame cut away, and the sash up, the bolt on the inside was forced; this was a window fronting the street; it is in the area part of the window, is rather higher than the ground. I ran down into the kitchen first, there were two chairs thrown down; the kitchen was wet with two bottles of wine broke, one had red and the other white; there lay two large tallow candles; we had none in the house but what were locked in a candle chest, we used a bit of a wax one to light us to bed. I missed a new striped muslin apron, and three quarters of new striped muslin, and about 18 s. in money, which I left locked in a little trunk when I went to bed; then we went up into the dining-room, there we found a great deal of linen scattered about that had been in baskets, and there was a great deal missing. There was missing out of my mistress's room eight or nine shifts, a pair of sheets, a counterpane, a cotton gown, a table cloth, napkin, pillowbear, a petticoat, aprons, and a great deal of small linen; the lock seemed as if it had been forced.</p>

            . On the 12th of October I was at work at a public pump in Park-street, about twelve yards from Mrs. Nevell's house; that pump drains the water from the kitchens of all the houses there; the pump is in the street against a wall that divides Queen's-square; I could see a little way into Mrs. Nevell's door when it opens from there; I went to pump as the clock struck six, and in about half an hour after I saw a man and a tall woman come out of Mrs. Nevell's house, the woman came out first, and the man after her; the woman turned and pulled the door to; I did not see the woman's face, but I can swear to her habit; she had a blue and a white striped silk gown, a little draggled up the tail, a black cardinal, and a black hat; she had a large bundle under her right arm, the outside like a white counterpane; the man was a short man, in a sort of a fustian frock, the stocking down of his right leg; he had dark brown hair tied behind in a club; he had a child lay cross his two arms, I saw it move; I kept pumping till about seven o'clock; I went to get a penny worth of purl, and saw Mrs. Nevell's door a-jar; I went and knocked at the door, and the first evidence came to me, she clapped her hands together, and said, Lord, Richard, how came the door open; I desired her to shut the door and fasten it, and I and a carpenter that was in the street went to see for the man and woman, but we missed them. When I saw the prisoner's two days after, I knew them again, and followed the man, he had lived at Mrs. Nevell's; I knew him, and have drunk with him when he lived there, but he was got so far out of my knowledge that I did not recollect him then; he has been discharge from thence about a year, I believe; I saw his face very plain as he came out of the house, but it did not strike me that it was he. I was sent for to the lady after she came to town, and described the man and woman; the prisoners were suspected from my information; I was informed they lodged somewhere in Peter-street; I went to the house, and asked if such people lodged in the house; the woman of the house said yes; I said I should be glad to speak with the woman; the woman at the bar came down; I said, pray madam, is your husband at home; she said, yes, pray walk up; she had the same gown on as she had the morning when she came out of Mrs. Nevell's house; I went up stairs, and desired the coachman who was with me to follow me; there was the man at the bar; I clapped my hand on his shoulder, and said, you are the man, I want and said the same to the woman; the coachman and I took them in custody; the woman knowing the coachman said, Lord, Phil, what is the matter: we took them before Justice Miller; they took the child with them: they denied the charge there; I told the Justice I would not swear downright, but to the best of my knowledge they are the people; they were discharged, not finding any of the things upon them. The next morning we searched their lodgings, but found nothing; they were taken before Sir

I waited till the Thursday following to see if such a ring was advertised; finding none between Wednesday and Saturday, I advertised it in the Daily and Public Advertisers, and Gazetteer, and on Saturday the 31st of October Mrs. Nevell applied to see the ring; I shewed it her; she said she believed it to be her ring, her daughter was with her; she seemed more clear in it; Mrs. Nevell told me she had a suspicion of two people that had lived in her house; I took the woman up; she then denied knowing any thing of the ring.</p>

On the 28th of October my Lord and Lady set out in a post-chaise with four horses and two postilions, to come to London about six in the evening, coming over Shooter's-hill, I was with them; there were two footmen on horseback; I then saw the large leather trunk behind the carriage, it was very safe; I gave the footmen charge of it, to watch that and the carriage  and I came forward to get supper for my Lord and Lady. When the carriage came to the door, neither of the footmen came with it; I told the post-boys to take every thing out of the inside, and likewise to take care of the trunk behind; they came to me instantly, and said, the trunk is no t here; I went to look and saw it was gone; I found one of the straps between the pearch and the axletree of the carriage, it appeared to have been cut by two or three attempts, with some instrument; I took an account of my Lady's woman of what principal things she could recollect were in it, and went immediately to Sir

In a little time I told him I was an officer, and he was my prisoner; he said he had nothing about him; Mrs. Lowrey said to him, you have a dozen pair of gloves; then he took and delivered them to me, (produced in court.)</p>

About a fortnight after I came to town, (I had met her some time about August, I asked her where she lived; she said, I am out of place, but I shall be at Mr. Bogey's in St. Martin's-lane, opposite Chandois-street, where they sell tobacco;) I called at that shop, thinking they might give me some intelligence of her; I asked there for Mrs. Turner, (a name she went by;) the woman of the house said she did not lodge there, but she had lodged there, and she had seen her that week; I said, if Mrs. Turner should call here again, tell her there is a relation or an acquaintance of her's from Chertsey would be glad to see her. On the Monday evening I and Mr. Spur, an attorney, called at Mr. Bogey's house; I went in, he stood at the door; I asked for Mrs. Turner; said the woman, she lodges in the house up three pair of stairs, and was at home; then I said to Mr. Spur, come in; we went up; there were two young women that it seems lodged with her, they said Mrs. Turner was gone somewhere about Soho-square; I left word with them I would call the next morning.

After some time the prisoner and the other young woman came home; the other came up; I said, where is Mrs. Turner; she said she was below; Mr. Noaks ran down, and whether he took her in the house or street I can't say; she came up along with him, and said, how do you do, master; I said, where are the tankards and mugs you have robbed me of, I am almost sure you was one concerned; after some little time she said, I am a dead woman, More forgive me, you shall have your things again; I told her it was out of my power to forgive her, she must take what the law will allow; she took Mr. Noaks and I to a house in Compton-street, and shewed us a deal box with my plate in it, (produced, and the plate deposed to;) we went to Sir

            . I went on board this ship; I found she was broke open, I struck a light, and went down into her; then I heard a foot walking softly above; I went up, there was the prisoner; I secured him, and took him on shore to the watch-house, he told us if we would let him go, he would produce all the things, that they were all done up in a blue jacket; I told him, if he would produce the things that night, I would not hurt him; he wanted me to make oath that I would not; we never got the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to M'Daniel. What things were missing?</p>
               <p>M'Daniel. There were all the things mentioned in the indictment missing, and as I had the care of the ship, I am liable to make them good; there were, of my own property, two jackets, a white shirt, and a pair of pumps missing; the prisoner pretended there were two men concerned with him, one was taken, but it appeared before the Justice that he was innocent, and he was cleared there.</p>

            . I am servant to Mess. Smith, Wright, and Gray, bankers. On the 20th of November there was a bill due on the prisoner: according to my master's order I had it out on Saturday; there was only the prisoner's wife at home, she said she could say nothing to it; on the Monday I presented it again; then the prisoner was gone out of town; I told the wife I would leave directions who it was drawn by, and to be paid to. When I came home to settle my accounts with the head clerk, I found this bill was wanting.</p>

               <p>Pooler. I cannot be positive how many, I went out about nine, sometimes we may have 40 or 50 bills to carry out in a day; I had been at Wapping, the Tower, and Rotherbithe; I went to Wedgeborough's again the very moment I perceived it missing, and told his wife the bill was lost, and desired she would inform her husband of it, and that he pay it to nobody. (I don't know where I lost it;) the next morning I went, she informed me her husband had paid it away about eight in the morning to one

               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Allcock. It is what is fixed in the brick-work, that the blast of the bellows goes through into the fire; I lost also 36 pail-hoops at one time, about the 6th of March, they were finished; I had them over night, and they were gone in the morning; I lost a great many more than I put in the indictment; I have laid it for 54 of them; I lost numbers of pail-ears at several times, at least six dozen pair, they I lost about March last; I lost an iron riveting tool, and a trassel gage, I cannot mention the exact times. The prisoner Dollymore is my apprentice; I was first informed of him by an indifferent person, and when I taxed him with it he owned it all; he owned he had taken several ears of pails and pail-hoops, and things from me; that he delivered the tool gage to Linney, and hoops and ears. I searched at Linney's, I found none of them upon him, they are things soon disposed of; I found there a sledge-hammer, my property, but that is not put in the indictment. When Dollymore was examined before Justice Girdler, he owned to all I have said here, as to him; Linney said, I do not think that is a proper person to be an evidence, for he has not told you half, expecting to have been made an evidence; he said he had the goods that the lad had charged upon him, but he had not told half of them that he had taken from me; this I heard; the Justice said, Mr. Linney, you hear what the lad has said, have you any thing to say; Linney said, no, I own I had the goods. The three prisoners, every one, owned to the charge against them; Smout said there, there was a tew iron brought to his house, and he had some pail-ears; Linney said, they had sold the goods, and they were gone, they neither of them said a word in contradiction; they both said they had nothing to say for themselves; Linney said, coming out of the Justice's, if I go for 14 years, you will be dead and d - d before I come back again, and I shall be better than you.</p>

I heard Linney say to the apprentice, you have not told half; the Justice asked them; if they had any thing to say in their defence; they said, no; they had received what the apprentice had mentioned: the apprentice had mentioned things which he had taken and carried to each of them; I saw the truss-hoop gage in Linney's smiths-shop, about May last, he did keep a shop in the Bowling-alley in Turnmill-street, I have worked with it many a time; I told my master of it a day or two after, but he is an easy man, he said he should not trouble himself about it.</p>

            . I am almost 15 years of age, I am servant to Mr. Bundy, we have a dog goes under the cart. On the 30th of October the prisoner came when I was licking the dog because he would not go under the cart, he asked me what business I had to beat him; he said, you dog you shall not beat him; presently I heard the pia of the tail board fall, I ran behind to see if my master was there, I found the rope was cut; I saw the prisoner with a basket under his arm, running cross the road as hard as he could; I ran and said, where are you going with that; he said, you dog, what is that to you, if you have more business than I, I'll soon let you have it; he canted it at me, I believe intending to knock me down; I called stop thief; his hat fell off, and he was stopped in Leadenhall-street by two butchers; he was but just out of my sight when taken; I had hold of his coat when he flung the basket down; I know the prisoner is the same man, this was about six at night; (the basket and things were produced and deposed to)</p>

Stenbank, I served my time by Newcastle.</p>
