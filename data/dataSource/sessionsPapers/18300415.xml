On the 2nd of March I had occasion to leave the chambers for a short time - I shut the inner door, and left the outer door open; I was not absent more than a quarter of an hour - I do not think it was more than ten minutes; I left nobody in the chambers - on my return I found a latch-key in the key-hole of the inner door; one key opens both doors - it is a Bramah's lock; the door was shut - I shortly after saw the prisoner about half way up on the second pair of stairs, with a bag and umbrella; our chambers are on the first floor: the bag and umbrella were Mr. Moody's - I asked the prisoner what he wanted there - he said he wanted Mr. Farrant; there is a Mr. Farrant living on that staircase - I asked what he did with Mr. Moody's bag; he said it was not Mr. Moody's - I said it was of no use to deny it, for the name was on it, on a brass plate, which was the case; I laid hold of his collar, and he dropped the bag and umbrella on the stairs - a scuffle ensued; he succeeded in getting out of my hands, and ran down stairs; I immediately followed him, and did not lose sight of him - he was secured, and brought back to the chambers - the bag and umbrella were found on the stairs, where he dropped them, and on his person was found some keys; and a pair of sugar-tongs belonging to Mr. Moody; most of the keys were for Bramah's locks, and of different sizes, the same kind as that in the door - the bag was opened, and contained a cloth cloak, worth eight guineas, and a great coat of master's, a black coat and a pair of boots of mine - I had seen the bag, umbrella, and sugar-tongs in the chambers ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, just before I left the chambers; Mr. Moody sleeps there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you left a notice on the door that you should return immediately? A. No - it was so short a time I did not think it necessary - nobody ran down stairs as I came in; the prisoner's way out if he had been in our chambers would be down stairs, but I suppose he heard me coming up; he was half way up the second floor stairs - Mr. Farrant lives on the third floor; I never saw the prisoner before - I had not double locked the door, but left it on the latch; the key in the lock was one of Bramah's - a common key would not open it I should think; I have one key, Mr. Moody and the laundress another - persons are constantly going up and down stairs; Mr. Moody has no other Christian name - it was not his key.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Could you get the key out of the lock again? A. We were obliged to get a blacksmith to get it out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As you went up stairs, would your footsteps be likely to be heard by a person close to the door? A. Yes, for I ran along the passage; if I had met him on the stairs I must have seen him with the bag. I have lived with Mr. Moody nearly four years - he has lived there all the time; I never saw the prisoner there before - if he had been employed there I should have known him.</p>

The prisoner Norris was in my service for about twenty months, at fourteen guineas a year; she was the house servant, and lived in the house; I never saw Jones till he was apprehended; we have about ten servants in our business; I generally lock up the warehouse myself at night, and am certain I did so on the 5th of March; I generally take the key in my pocket, and at night take it with me into my bed-room; I am sure I did so on the 5th of March; my practice was to send it down in the morning by Norris when the porters and two apprentices came, which is usually about the same time; they rang the bell, which I generally heard; Norris used then to come into my room for the key; she had nothing to do with the warehouse, and had no business there at any time - subsequent to the 20th of January, circumstances excited my suspicion, but I never intimated them to Norris. On the 5th of March I know that a piece of black silk was cut for Mr. Pallister, sufficient to cover a stock; it was a particular fabric, very rich and stout, and cost us more than 6s. 3d. a yard; eleven yards were also cut from a piece of slate coloured silk to make a cloak or something for one of his family, on the same day. On the morning of the 6th, Mr. Lane made a communication to me; I then examined, and missed those two pieces of silk, which had been cut the day before, and at a subsequent examination of our stock book I missed ten or twelve more pieces; this was on the 6th of March; we examined the stock-book as far back as January; they had been purchased at different times in the course of this year; I went to the Mansion-house for White, and officer, who came with me to the house; I took him up stairs with me to question Norris, and questioned her myself; she answered with every appearance of fairness and candour, and told me I might search her bed-room; I had not the slightest suspicion of her at that time, and sent White away; in consequence of information respecting a woman having been seen about our premises, I afterwards fetched Martin, the officer - he examined the different young men in the warehouse, and afterwards went up stairs with me to the kitchen to examine Norris; we both went up to her bed-room with her - nothing was said to induce her to say any thing; we found nothing there at that time - I think Martin observed to her that she had a remarkable stock of clothes for a person in her situation; she said she had been in better circumstances, and had taken great care of her clothes - this was on Monday, the 8th of March; she had been out on Sunday the 7th, with my permission to see her friends - she had asked leave the beginning of the week to go to Highgate to see her friends; I knew she had a mother and sister living in Hornsey-lane - she went on the Sunday; Martin said nothing to her about that to my recollection. On Tuesday or Wednesday, the 9th or 10th, I saw Martin again, and saw Norris - he asked her several questions with regard to her acquaintance and connexions, who they were; she said they were very respectable - we asked if there had been any body about her at any time, that she herself had any reason to suspect - she still pleaded the respectability of her connexions, and said it was impossible for any of her connexions to know any thing about it; when questioning about her connexions she said a woman named Jones, had occasionally assisted her as charwoman - we asked her where that woman lived; she persisted in saying she did not know - she said so more than once, and that she had not seen her since the last week in December; I saw Martin again on Thursday, the 11th, and he went with Norris into her bed-room - I did not go with them that day - they afterwards came down - neither I nor Mr. Pallister had held out any promise or threat to induce her to say any thing.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect in the bed-room saying there was no use in concealment, for more had come out than she was aware of? A. I said nothing about concealment - I said, "More has come out than you are aware of;" that was not for the purpose of making her tell any thing - on the contrary, when she felt disposed to say any thing, I said, "I will not hear what you have to say, you must state it to your employers."</p>
               <p>MR. PEARCE re-examined. When Martin returned with her down stairs into the kitchen, I asked how it was she could have been guilty of such a delinquency, and she said, "The poverty of my own relations has driven me into this situation;" I asked her what quantity of property she had taken at different times - she stated that she had taken four pieces on the Saturday morning previous, which was the 6th - she acknowledge that Mrs. Jones was her sister, but in consequence of her poverty she was ashamed to own her; she had given Martin, Jones' address before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she state where she took the four pieces from on Saturday? A. Out of one of the presses in the warehouse; I asked how she got possession of them - she said she obtained the key of the warehouse from my bed-room about five minutes before the porters came in in the morning, by causing the bell to ring, which signified to me that they had arrived, and then applied to me for the key,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150005"/>which I had no hesitation in giving her, having heard it ring; I inquired about other silks taken - she at first stoutly denied having taken more than these four pieces, but afterwards admitted that she had; she acknowledged that whatever we had lost she had taken.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. In consequence of what happened on the Monday I went to Hornsey on Wednesday afternoon, and in consequence of what I heard there, I saw Norris' mother, and brought the prisoner's sister, Harwood, to her at Mr. Pallister's house - they had some conversation together which I did not hear, and then Norris agreed to go with me to Jones'; she took me to No. 19, Baldwin's-gardens - before this I had asked her a great many questions about Jones several times, and she always denied knowing where Mrs. Jones lived; when Harwood came Norris said she would go with me, and show me where Mrs. Jones lived - she went with me on the Wednesday night; she went up stairs, before me, and called out Mrs. Jones! the door was opened and I went into the room - the male prisoner was there; I asked Mrs. Jones, (who was there) when it was she had last seen Norris - she said the last week in December, and that was exactly what Norris had said; I pretended to be satisfied with that account, and came away - on the following morning, Thursday, I received some information respecting Jones' wife, and went again to Jones'; I took two persons, showed Mrs. Jones to them, and asked them in the presence of Jones if that was the person they had seen so frequently opposite to Mr. Pallister's door - they stated that it was; I then returned to Mr. Pallister's, and went up to the kitchen with Messrs. Pearce and Pallister; Norris was then there alone - I told her what she had stated was untrue respecting her not having seen Mrs. Jones since December, and said I had two witnesses to prove to the contrary, and had taken them there to see Mrs. Jones; she said, "Then I will tell you the whole truth, that person is my own sister, but on account of her poverty I have denied her" - I told her I had sufficient evidence to justify me in taking her into custody, which I should do; she was the only female servant in the house - I then searched the kitchen more minutely, and found in a drawer, of which she had the key, something less than 3l. in money; I then desired her to accompany me up stairs to her bed-room - when I got her into the room I told her more had come out than she was aware of; she said, "Can any thing be done?" those were her very words; she said, "I have saved 10l., and I will give it you if you can assist me - what I have done was to assist my relations in their distress;" I said, "Can the silks be got back?" she said she thought the last two pieces might - I asked what she had done with them; she said she had given them to Jones, her brother-in-law - he was not present then; she again said, "I will give you the 10l. if you can assist me," and seemed very agitated; I told her I had no power to assist her, if she had any application to make it must be to her employers - they were the only persons who could shew her any lenity; I then brought her down stairs - she had some conversation with Messrs. Pallister and Pearce, which I did not hear; I left her in the house, desiring the prosecutors to see she did not go away, and went to the Mansion-house for Roe, and officer - I then went and apprehended the prisoner Jones, in Baldwin's-gardens; I told him as we came along that I had information that he had had a portion of the silk which came from Mr. Pallister's - he denied it; nothing more passed till I brought him to Mr. Pallister's - I took him into the kitchen; Norris was up stairs; I sent for her down, and on coming into the kitchen, she said to Jones, "Oh, John! what have you done with the last silks I gave you, for you know I have had no money for the last four pieces?" Jones made no reply - I then said to him, "What have you done with the light coloured piece?" he said he had left it with his sister - I asked what his sister's name was; he said Elizabeth Edmonds, No.27, Swan-place, Bermondsey - I went there, and got it at No. 26 instead of 27; I got it from Edmonds, who is now here - I said to Jones, "What have you done with the other three pieces?" he said, "I have burnt them" - I said, "Is it possible that people's property can be so wickedly destroyed?" he then said he had not burnt them, that he had sold them to a Jew, named Benjamin, who lived in Golden-lane, for 5l. - I understood Benjamin's house was out of the City; I sent Roe to Worship-street to endeavour to get a search-warrant, but believe nothing was found - I sent Jones to the Compter by Roe, and brought Norris to the Compter myself; I then went in search of the silks.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Norris she had seen Jones since she had stated - did she say when she had seen her last? A. No; the prisoner Jones said Norris had been there on the Sunday. On the following morning (Friday) I searched Norris' bed-room, and found three silk dresses, which appeared not much worn; they were shown to the prosecutors - there were not more than six silk dresses in all, but these were selected; there was a great many other dresses, calico and others, eighteen or nineteen; I also found jewellery, which I gave up, by desire of the Magistrate; Mr. Pearce, in a small paper box in another of her boxes, in her bed-room, found ten sovereigns - I found in an old night cap, in another box in the bed-room, twenty-five sovereigns. On Friday morning I took her to Guildhall, from the compter, and on our way I said "I thought I understood you to say you had only 10l. - I have found twenty-five sovereigns in a night cap, in addition to the 10l." and said, "Is that 25l. part of the produce of the silk?" I did not name any particular silk - she said the 25l. was, but the 10l. was not; I also took Jones from the Compter, and said to him, "I understand there has been some money found in your place; he said Yes - I said as much as 33l.; he said Yes: I said"I understand you have said part of that money is the produce of the silk;" he said 28l. of it was the produce of the silk, and the other 5l. he had saved to get his wife through her lying-in - she was delivered two days after I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In your conversation with them did you tell them whether you had evidence against them, except what you could get from their answers? A. I told Norris I had more evidence than she was aware of, and from that this conversation arose - I had no conversation with Jones till we were coming along; I then said what I have stated - I did not examine or cross-examine him; I did not say I should make use of any answers they gave me - I understood Jones had made a previous statement to another officer; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150006"/>these questions with a view to discover the robbery, and if it was requisite to make use of what they said - if I had told them I should give what they said in evidence, I should not have discovered the robbery; Mr. Pallister and Mr. Pearce, were present when Norris stated about her sister - I believe neither of them were present at the conversation with Jones; I intended at the time to give their answers in evidence, if it was requisite - my object was to discover the robbery, and give what they said in evidence certainly; if I had said I should make use of their answers I should not have discovered the robbery; Jones and I were walking alone in the street when we had the conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you in any manner invited the conversation in the kitchen, when Norris said to Jones,"I have had nothing for the last silks?" A. Nothing at all - it was quite a conversation between themselves; the prosecutors were not present - I pursued my further inquiries in consequence of that conversation; I did not tell them they were obliged to say any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure you neither held out threat nor promise to Jones, to induce him to say what he did? A. I am quite sure I did not.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. I went with Martin to Jones', and searched the premises, on Thursday, the 11th of March; he was not at home the first time, but the second time he was - I found thirty-three sovereigns in a bag, under a heap of rubbish, up in the cock-loft at the top of the house; I afterwards counted them out before Jones - there were twenty-eight loose in the bag, and five wrapped in a piece of paper, and in the bag; Walters, a Worship-street officer, was with me, and he asked him how much of that money was the produce of the stolen property - neither threat nor promise were used to him; he said, twenty-eight were the produce of the stolen property, and the 5l. was his own money; I told this to Martin.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not Martin present when he said this to you? A. Certainly not - he said nothing to me about saying it to bring his wife through her lying-in- I was not with him when he went to the office nextday.</p>

            . I am a mantua-maker, and live in Old'Change. I was employed by Norris to make up a muslin dress and other things; she brought me some black silk to make into a petticoat and aprons - this is the silk I was employed to make up (looking at it) - she brought it to me on the 6th of March, and said it was for a friend; I am sure this is the same silk.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman in the prosecutors' employ. I remember a piece of black silk being cut off to cover a stock for Mr. Pallister; I have got the piece which was cut off here; the silk produced is of the same sort and quality - I never saw two so closely correspond, and the selvidge is the same; between forty and fifty yards of this piece were left when the stockcover was cut from it - it is worth between 6s. and 7s. a yard to us, to buy.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the slate coloured silk - do you remember a piece like that being cut for Mr. Pallister's family? A. Yes, I have the pattern of it, and the cloak that was made from it; the pattern corresponds precisely with the piece produced - I have no private mark on it. On the morning of the 6th of March, about eleven o'clock, I missed the two pieces of silk which the stock and cloak had been cut from, and on going over the books we found two other pieces were missing; the value of the black and slate coloured pieces is about 22l. the lowest value; I have no doubt of these being the same two pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is rather hard to say you are certain of it? A. No, it is not - I never saw one before with the sort of selvidge the slate coloured one has; there may be hundreds of them by this time - they were introduced this season; there are some figures at the end of the black silk which I cut - there is no private mark on the petticoat - it is by no means a common silk; there may be a hundred of the kind - I should not say there were hundreds; I judge them to be the same by comparison, and by missing them.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you any doubt that this silk is the same texture and every thing the same as that which is made into a cloak? A. Not the least - our marks are in pencil, and would rub off in making up: I never sold Norris any silk - she had no business in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was in the house when you went to bed, besides the prisoner and your brother? A. A little boy about twelve years old, who is his brother; the prisoner was not in the house when I awoke - my brother was still in the room; we got up and made inquiry about the house - every body remained in the house except the prisoner; I have recovered none of my money - I saw him in custody in a month or six weeks after; I had been making inquiries for him before, but could not find him till I saw him in custody at Worship-street - I did not promise him any thing or threaten him; he acknowledged that he had robbed me, and said he had sold the 40l. for 20l. - the Magistrate asked what he had done with the 20l.; he said he had spent it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you sober went you went to bed? A. I had had a glass, but was not tipsy - I was tired and fatigued with my journey; I believe you were sober - I had been with your father that night, and left him at home.</p>

On Friday, the 29th of January, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came to my brother's house to take a lodging - we had a bill in the window to let one; I showed him the second floor back room - he agreed to take it, and was to come the next day towards evening; he referred us to No. 3, Judd-place; I sent somebody there, but got no account of him - he came on the Saturday; I told him we could get no account of him there: he said I had made a mistake, for he told me three times No. 28; he came to the lodging so soon after that: did not inquire there - he slept in the house that night, Saturday, and on Sunday he went out in the morning, and came back about five or six o'clock, and said his brother was taken suddenly ill, and if he was not back by ten that evening he should not come home till next morning - he came again on Monday, three times in the course of the day; I told him his luggage was not come, which I expected - he said instead of it going to No. 108, Seymour-street, it went to No. 111 - he went out again in about half an hour, returned, and went out again, I think about six or seven o'clock; he said he should return in about two hours, but did not - I went up stairs about twelve, and discovered the robbery; I missed from my own room a trinket-box, I had not seen him go out the last time - I heard his voice; he came into the kitchen before he went out, and returned three brushes which he had borrowed - the trinket-box contained a gold watch and chain, two seals, and two gold rings; the seals were not gold - a metal watch, and a metal chain, which was not attached to the watch, a pair of ear-rings, and a great many other things - I think them worth more than 50l.; there was also a trunk gone, containing shawls, scarfs, veils, India handkerchiefs, and various things - I had seen all the things perfectly safe in the course of that day; I was present on the Tuesday week, when he was taken in the fields behind Union-street, Somers'-town, where he lodged, he had robbed me on the Monday - I saw all my things when he was apprehended.</p>

No. we have separated- he left me last May; he went away once before and returned - I have not seen him since; I do not know where to find him, but have no doubt of his being alive - most<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150008"/>of the property was my trinkets, the rest wearing-apparel - very little of it was bought by my husband; I had most of it before I was married - there was no marriage settlement; the property belonged to me entirely - a Mrs. Aldridge lodged at the house at the time; she is not here - I was present when my property was found at the prisoner's lodging - Limbrick asked him if it was mine; he said Yes, and that it was all safe - my brother's Christian name is George; he rents the house by himself, and has no partner - he is a tin plate worker.</p>

I know the prisoner, and remember his coming to the shop on the 3rd of February, to pawn a gold watch for 5l., in the name of Burgess; we sometimes give more than the value of articles - I should not think the intrinsic value of this was 5l.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the intrinsic value? A. To melt down; if it had been hung in our window for sale we should not have charged it above 7l. - there was no chain to it.</p>

On the Tuesday on which he was taken, Limbrick left me alone, and while he was gone I saw the prisoner in the field at the top of Union-street, Somers'-town; I told him there was a letter from his mother at my house, and he had better go there with me - he went, and when I got to the house Limbrick was passing; I called him in, and he took him - his mother is not in any business.</p>

            . I have retired from business, and live at No. 31, Gun-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner was in my employ two years ago, when I was a retail brewer at Shadwell; I am on half-pay, and have been a lientenant in the army - he lived with me till Christmas, 1828, and then went to Mrs. Storey, my next door neighbour, at Shadwell: he remained with her till eight or ten weeks ago, and could not get employ - after that he went to Sheerness to enter the navy; he bore a good character - he did not live with me in Gun-street; I ordered her to bring no carpet.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had no quarrel whatever? A. No - I cannot say whether the woman was tipsy, the time was so short - I believe she was his wife; she was laying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the young man who was with the prisoner is now in Clerkenwell prison, for an alledged assault upon you? A. I do not know - I left it to the Magistrate's discretion to do what he chose with him; I stated the case before Mr. Broughton, the Magistrate, as I have now, and how far the young man participated in the act; I do not know what was done with him - I said he took up this weapon, and I certainly felt an increased apprehension from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them touched you till you seized the prisoner by the wrist, and grasped him as you have described? A. Certainly not; I grasped as tight as I could, for my own preservation - he had threatened to strike me, and was over me in this way; I was afraid to turn, or I should have had the instrument in my neck - he was in a dreadful passion, and did not seem to know what he was doing; the prisoner and the man were in the front room, which they call the shop - I was not trying to get in; I was in the room when the man was there.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the instrument struck your eye was not the door half closed between you and the prisoner? A. I stated that my umbrella was between the door and the jam - I was not pushing to get in at the door, nor did I make a push at the men inside - it never entered my mind; my umbrella caught between the door as I was retiring - the pointed end of it caught in at the door; I was carrying it as I usually do - I did not push with it at the people inside; I could not move it - it was fast between the door and jam; I did not attempt to withdraw it - I never thought of entering the room, and did not push to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent his rushing out at the door at you if he thought proper? A. I should think not; he did not attempt to do so - I was taken by the arm, and walked away from the place; I should think it all passed in less than five minutes from the time I entered the house till all was over.</p>

            . I was with Mr. Trapp on Tuesday afternoon, the 16th of February, between three and four o'clock - when I got half way up stairs I saw a female laying on the ground, and two men standing over her - directly they caught sight of us they turned; we retreated down stairs - they followed us into the shop, and I saw the prisoner with the chisel; I did not see it in his hand before he followed us down stairs - after we had retired down into the shop, he held the chisel up as if going to strike Trapp, and threatened him; he threatened every one in fact; the other man was in the act of trying to get hold of something in the cupboard, and I caught hold of him, to prevent his doing mischief - I found Trapp had disarmed the prisoner of the weapon he had, and had let him go; he immediately seized hold of another weapon - it was a chisel; they are tools he uses in his business - I did not see the blow struck, as I got out immediately; I did not see Trapp do any thing with his umbrella, either striking or attempting to strike: when I retreated from the house into the street I heard somebody say Trapp was stabbed - I went and found him with his handkerchief up to his face; I took him to a surgeon, and got the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went down stairs immediately after seeing the prisoner and his companion with a woman? A. Yes; I went down very quickly - I will not swear he might not have had the chisel in his hand at first.</p>

            . I was at this house, but did not go up stairs; I saw them come down - Trapp and Woo came down first; I was just at the foot of the staircase - it is a small house; I did not see any thing in the prisoner's hand when he came down - I heard them scuffling on the stairs, and withdrew immediately to the front door; I saw Wood and Trapp come down, and the prisoner immediately turned to the left, towards a sort of cupboard without a door, where he keeps his tools, and immediately after I saw him with a long handled chisel in his hand, struggling with Trapp, who was behind him, and holding his wrist; before that he was holding the chisel up towards Trapp in a menacing way; Trapp did not give him time to turn round, but seized his wrist, grasped it, and the chisel fell - I did not hear him say any thing, it was so momentary - Wood came out of the shop; Trapp followed: I saw his umbrella entangled between the door and frame or cill, as if somebody had shut it in, he being outside the door -I never saw his umbrella pointed to any body; very shortly after I saw the prisoner pass the window, and take a large sharp turner's gonge, which is a circular tool. and very sharp - he seemed to take it from a work bench; I saw him put his hand through the aperture of the door, with this gouge in his hand, and strike Trapp on the face; Trapp immediately turned round, and said, "Oh, dear, he has cut my eye out," or words to that effect; the prisoner opened the door soon afterwards, with a kind of laughing grin apparently; Wood led Trapp away to a surgeon's - a Police-officer came; they would not open the door, and the officer broke it open - the prisoner did not appear to be drunk: shortly after a tall gentleman, who said he belonged to the Excise, was remonstrating with the prisoner - he immediately knocked him down, and cut his mouth; the prisoner appeared to me to be sober - I went to the Police-station with him, and when he and his companion were put to the bar, the prisoner said to his companion,"Mind, they don't know which of us did it;" I am quite sure he is the man who struck the blow, for he was in his shirt sleeves, and the other had his jacket on - I did not see Trapp give him any provocation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the shop door open in or out? A. Inwards - in his hurry of coming out, I suppose, his umbrella got entangled, for they thrust the door too immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they not try to shut the door too to keep the persons outside from coming in? A. I do not think they did, for they could have done it if they liked - it appeared to me that the umbrella was caught in the door by accident; if it had not been there the door would have shut - if they had relaxed the door the umbrella would have been loose; Trapp had held his umbrella by the handle, and was trying to get it out, which caused his face to be towards the door - I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand when he came down, but after he get to the cupboard he had the chisel - whether he had it before I will not positively swear; he appeared in a violent passion - I suppose the whole affair lasted four or five minutes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I got up at three o'clock to finish some work I had in hand; I returned about nine - my wife was not at home: I asked my child where her mother was - she did not return till near four o'clock in the afternoon, and then came through the streets, roaring, singing, and crying; I was ashamed of her - she came in doors, and went up stairs crying and singing; she was going about the place, puking and crying Murder! I went up stairs, as I could not work for the noise - I said, "If you don't leave off that noise you must leave the place;" I helped her up, and persuaded her to go to bed - she resisted me, and I went away certainly in a great passion, having been at work very hard, and really I could not tell in my passion whether I stood on my head or my feet - I have stated to you the real facts of the case; this is not the first time she has been guilty in this way - I am a hard working man; not a neighbour can say I ever used a bad word, or said harm of them. I acknowledge I was in a most violent passion, and being with an hungry belly, from waiting for my dinner, to have at four o'clock a drunken wife come home; I never struck her all the time she has been my wife - no person can say a word against me; when she has come home in that way I have gone out of doors, as I could not stand it.</p>

Plummer said, "Water-cresses, master" - I then laid hold of Juxx by the shoulder, and said, "Let us look at them then," and at that moment Plummer, or the other, threw the pot down and ran away - Juxx tried to get away, but I told him it was of no use; I looked into his basket, and found a quantity of pairs of breeches - I called the landlord to take the baskets, and took Juxx into the public-house; he said, "What are you going to do with me?" I said to take him to Bow-street - I said, "What are you going to do with these?" he said, "I don't know, some man gave them to me, and asked me to give him some bread and cheese;" I locked him up - he behaved very ill, and we had a great deal of trouble with him; I described Plummer; I am quite certain he is one of the men; I saw him pass by the gas-light and noticed him; I afterwards spoke to him and he said they were water-cresses - on my oath he is the man - I produce the property and baskets; the shop tickets are on the things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a ticket porter? A. No, I attend sales - I am not employed by any auctioneer; I never saw the prisoner before - I still work as a porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your suspicious a little raised at the time you asked the prisoner what you should say, if they asked any questions? A. I thought myself it was not all right, but he was so particular in getting my address in case I should not bring the money; Doubleday's is a public-house; I was to take the money to him; I told him it was strange to stop a stranger in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell him to take back his cheque, if you thought all was not right? A. He was so particular in taking my address; I went back to Doubleday's with the officer - I went to the coffee-room and the bar; I was not accompanied by any person between the 9th and 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cheque was given to you did he point to the name and say, "That is Sir

            , 47 or 27, New Bond-street - the letter I found on him was wafered up and directed to Shaw; I gave it to Shaw in his presence - he opened and read it in the prisoner's presence, and returned it to me - he was kept in custody, and about two o'clock in the morning, he came to me at the desk, and asked if I would be kind enough to show him what charge I had got against him; I said I would, and showed it to him - he said that was not right, that his name was not Thomas but Mc-Donald, that he wished to say something to me, as he had told an untruth, and truth went the furthest; I cautioned him not to say any thing to me, but he said he had been lodging at a public-house in King-street, Golden-square, and the person who he had received the cheque from he had seen there two or three times; that he was in company with him at that house the night before the cheque was presented; he described the person, and said that person was in liquor the night before when he was in his company, and that the person told him if he would meet him there next morning he would give him a job; he said he knew him by the name of Thomas, that they met next morning at this house, and this person gave him the cheque, and asked him to go and get cash for it - he said, Yes, he would if it was all right - that he at first said it was all right, and afterwards said it was not right, but that Thomas had told him he would get the money, as it had been done before - he did not say in what respect Thomas had told him it was not right; he said he and Thomas then went out of the public-house together, and proceeded towards the City or Strand - that they were together two hours previous to meeting the porter - that they met a porter in Chandos-street and he went up to the porter and asked him if he would go and get cash for that cheque, but that Thomas kept back at this time; he said he told the porter that he would meet him at a house in Bedford-street, that he went to the house in Bedford-street, to wait for the porter coming back with the money, and that Thomas followed the porter to the City to see if any person came out with him; Thomas saw some person come out with Shaw, and came running to him to the house in Bedford-street, telling him some person had come out as if they thought that it was not right; that he (the prisoner) then ran out of the house, and did not see Thomas again for a day or two, and then he said he met him the next day in Oxford-street, and Thomas wished him to write to Shaw, thinking perhaps he had got the money - he did not write then, but two or three days after Thomas came and beckoned him out of the shop, or as he stood at the door beckoned him from the door, and asked him to go and take a walk with him - that they went away from the shop together towards Holborn, where Thomas and him went into a coffee-shop, and he wrote a letter to Shaw - that he asked Thomas at first to write himself, but he declined on account of having something the matter with his thumb, and then he wrote - that they parted that evening, and Thomas came on the Saturday on which evening he was apprehended, and again beckoned him out of the shop, and they went away that night together from the shop of Mr. Richards, in Oxford-street where he said he lived - that they went on talking together towards Holborn, till they got towards Hoxton, and came together to the corner of Pitfield-street, Hoxton, and Thomas requested him to go to Shaw for the money - he asked Thomas to go himself, but Thomas made some excuse and he went himself; I said, "Why not state when you were brought to the watch-house that such a person was waiting for you, I might have apprehended him then" - he said he was in such a flurry he did not think of it - he said he had seen Thomas at King-street, Golden-square; I went next morning at seven o'clock to King-street, Golden-square, and found a person named Thomas, and took him into custody; the prisoner afterwards saw him, and said immediately that was not the man; I took a person named Grant, in consequence of a description given me by the prisoner - he did not see that person - he is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This must have been a very long interview between you? A. Yes he was not out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150019"/>presence all night; I did not think it safe for him to be out of my sight; he was not locked up in the watch-house; he could not get away; I did not tell him it would be better for him to make a statement to me; I put him on his guard; I asked him no questions, except the description of Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state before the Magistrate that you could not tell but he might have said he had seen Thomas a week after? A. Not to my knowledge - my evidence was so long, I will not swear I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he had been the dupe of a man named Thomas? A. Yes something to that effect - he told me as we came down Pitfield-street that night, that he had heard from Thomas that the cheque was not right after it had been presented.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. But he told you at the watch-house, Thomas had informed him before the cheque was presented that it was right, and then afterwards that it was not? A. He did.</p>

               <p>I was very much surprised at your not returning with the money I sent you for yestraday, and went down the Strand after you, but could see nothing of you; but having got your address I did not quite despair of seeing you again - if you will write me a note, or send the money enclosed, addressed to Mr. Thomas, 2d. post, Brewer-street, Golden-square, to be left till called for, as I have had a terrible row with my employers; I do not like to trouble them with it, as they have made me responsible for the money.

               <p>I have been three or four times at Hoxton, but could never find such a place as Boot-street.

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at Chatham. On the 14th of January I was at home - Whitehead, my shopman, brought me a 40l. note, and from what he said to me I went up stairs into my shop, and saw the prisoner; she had no bonnet on - I changed the 40l. note for her, and after writing her name on it I put it into my cash-box - I had some conversation with her about it, and am certain she is the person; I wrote on the note the address she gave me, and gave her the change; between the 14th and 18th of January I found a 50l. note in my cash-box - I did not change that myself; I sent that same note to Leaf, Son, and Coles, with the 40l. note - the prisoner made several purchases at my house after I changed the 40l. note, but not before.</p>

I went and began to tell the publican's wife how I got them - she said, "Never mind, go over to that shop, and you will get change for it - never mind who you are."

            . I know the prisoner quite well. I was playing near the prosecutor's house on Sunday, the 7th of March, and saw him return home in his chaise, and saw the prisoner Clark jump from a gateway by his house; I am quite certain of him; he had a small bundle under his arm, and I heard something jingle - as he jumped from the gateway his clothes caught in the spikes on the top of the gateway.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who told you to say it was the 7th of March? A. My mother - I cannot tell how long ago it was; I have often seen him - I live in the same court as him; I do not know his wife; he did not live at the prosecutor's at the time I saw him jump from the gateway.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this on the Sunday evening that Mr. Amsdell came home in his chaise? A. Yes, and I heard the house had been robbed that evening.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you recollect how he was dressed? A. A black hat, a black coat, and light trousers - I am sure he had a black hat on.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of March, about half-past nine o'clock, at the Red Lion, Whitechapel-road - I told him I wanted him for a robbery at Mr. Amsdell's, at Poplar; he said he knew nothing about it - I asked where his residence was; he said no where - I then asked where he slept on Sunday, the 7th of March; he said at the Unicorn, Shoreditch - I made inquiry there; I took him to the watch-house, and took his shoes off and on the 10th I went to Mr. Amsdell's; there were some footmarks on a waste piece of ground adjoining his premises - I compared his shoes with those marks, in Amsdell's presence - they corresponded right and left, and the nails in the heels exactly corresponded, the toes being towards the gateway; it was a clayey soil; there are nails on the gateway adjoining the premises - I examined his trousers, and found a tear about an inch long; they were lightish trousers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by lightish - were they the colour of this book (brown)? A. About it, not quite so dark as that - the waste piece of ground joins Amsdell's premises; it is enclosed, and not a thoroughfare.</p>

            . I was chief turnkey of the House of Correction, Clerkenwell, in January, 1829, and know the prisoner; I was present at his conviction at Clerkenwell January Session, as a common utterer of counterfeit coin; I received him into my custody - he was imprisoned one year, and was to find sureties for two years then to come; he went by the name of William Wilson.</p>
               <p>The copy of the record was here read, as in the indictment.</p>
               <p>SARAH WINFIELD. I live at Mr. William Martin's, the Ship public-house, Chichester-rents, which is in Middlesex. The prisoner came there on the 15th of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and asked for a glass of gin, which I drew him - he put down a 5s. piece; I saw it was bad, and told him it was a bad one - he then began to use very bad language, and I called Mitchelson, a porter of Lincoln's Inn, who was standing by at the time; he saw it was bad as well as myself, and detained the prisoner till Sullivan, a constable, came - the prisoner took the crown up; Mitchelson took it from him, and marked it, and I marked it after him; Mitchelson took it again - this is it (looking at it) - the gin came to 2d.</p>

My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - In last June I was apprehended, with one other man, on suspicion of the robbery, and, on our examination, the Magistrate thought proper to discharge the other man - I was remanded for five examinations; the Magistrates, finding nothing tending a committal, discharged me also - I returned home to my father, and kept to my work, during which time I was frequently accused of the robbery by the parties stating this to my father; he threatened them with prosecution for their unjust assertions, which is the only cause of the parties for the prosecution acting so unjustly, and bringing me to trial after so long an elapse of time - conscious of my innocence as to any part of the felony of which I now stand charged with at this bar, with fortitude and resignation I await the issue of a grand Jury of my country.</p>

On the 17th of March, in the morning, he came to my room - my children were with me; he came, and said, "Mrs. Stripling, my father wants to speak to you to tell you where they are giving away beef and bread in St. John-street;" his father lived in the next street to me - he told me to go to his father's house directly, as he wanted to tell me where to go; as he went down stairs, he said, "Don't take the children with you;" he did not say why: I washed my two children, and then went - it was half-past ten o'clock in the morning when I came out; I shut and latched my door, leaving the children in the room - nobody could go in from outside without opening the door; I left the key inside the door, and did not lock it - nobody could open it from without, unless they forced it; I went to try to get some bread and beef - I went to his father's house, but could not find him; I came back immediately - I was absent about five minutes, I ran all the way; when I came back I was coming up stairs, and saw my room door open - the door had been forced, and the staple of the lock laid in the room; I saw my bed very much pulled about, and missed two pairs of trousers and a coat of my husband's from under the bolster, which had been disturbed - the trousers were worth 3s.; I had left the bed rolled up in one corner of the room.</p>

On the 6th of April I apprehended the prisoner at his father's house, No. 26, Thomas-street - Lawson was with me; I went to his father's about half-past seven o'clock in the morning - he was up; as soon as I saw him I told him I wanted him for a robbery, and collared him - he made a great resistance, laid hold of the latch of the door, and held by it; his father caught hold of me by the collar, and tried to pull me away from his son - he found he could not do it, and called to his daughter to bring him the poker; she brought it, and he began to lay upon me most unmercifully - the prisoner succeeded in getting into the back room; I was obliged to let go of him - I left Lawson there, holding him, and went for more assistance; I got Read, and as I came back I saw the prisoner running down Hare-street as hard as he could; I secured him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

On the 17th of March about half-past ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs; I had seen him before and knew him; I had heard him go up - I heard him say to the prosecutrix,"Don't bring the children;" and that there was meat and bread giving away; I saw him come down stairs as I was going out; I did not see him again till he was at Worship-street.</p>

            . I live at Notting-hill, and have known the prisoner from his infancy; his mother used to rent a cottage of the prosecutor. I met the prisoner in the Bayswater-road, about ten o'clock on the morning of the robbery - I saw a black silk handkerchief round his neck, and asked how he came by it; he said his cousin Polly had given it to him - I saw he had a pair of trousers on, and asked how he came by them; he said Mrs. Jordan gave them to him - he went to wash his face in a ditch by the road side; he took the handkerchief off and gave it to me to hold - I told him that was dirty water; he then went to the horse trough - I went on with my cart; I saw him in the road afterwards, and called after him to give him the handkerchief, but he ran away - I afterwards met the prosecutrix, and gave it to her.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Flint, of Edgware-road. On Tuesday, the 30th of March, in the evening, this shawl was pawned for 2s. 6d., in the name of Thomas Thomas - to the best of my recollection it was by the prisoner; I believe it to be him - I did not know him before; the prosecutrix claimed the shawl a day or two afterwards.</p>

               <p>ISAAC LONON. I rent this cottage. I do not know what parish it is in. On Saturday, the 3rd of April, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner at Kilburn, and said,"How came you to rob me, Tom;" I knew him before - he made no answer; he had got my wife's shoes on his feet - I challenged them as her's; he had trousers on, but not mine - I said, "Tom, how came you to break into my house? how did you get in?" he said, "Why I took a pane of glass out at the back window, and got in;" I did not threaten him or make him any promise.</p>

            . I am a constable and watch-house-keeper. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington. I found the prisoner at the watch-house, searched him, and found on him a pair of glasses, nothing else.</p>
               <p>MRS. LONON. This is my shawl; it had never been worn - I am sure it is mine; I have no mark on it - it is just the same as I folded it up; this silk handkerchief I know to be mine, and the one I lost - the two glasses fit the frames.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Their son used to pick the fat off the wash-tub, and tell me to go and sell it, but I would not; that was the first indication of my going thieving.</p>

            . On the 12th of January, I was in Kingsland-road, between seven and eight o'clock at night, coming from Kingsland to town; I had been to Kingsland - I had not dined there; I was sober - I had five 10l. notes rolled up together in my fob, and one 10l. note, six sovereigns, five half-sovereings, and one King William and Queen Mary guinea, in a purse separate from the other money; as I went along the road I met the two prisoners - they said they were in great distress, and asked me to relieve them; I passed on endeavouring to get from them - they followed me, and held me by the arm, one on each side, not holding me forcibly; they were very meanly attired - I told them I was not accustomed to stand and talk to people in the street; they pressed on me to go and see their situation, for they were certain I would take it into consideration, and recommend them to some society - I objected to go to their place of abode, and was about to give them some money, when they refused it, and still pressed me to go and see their situation - I then went to Hoxton-town, which is where they said they lived, and when I came to the corner of Davis-place I objected going further; I had not gone<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150028"/>into a public-house, but about one hundred yards before, I got to that place (as it was very cold) I stood at the door, and gave them some English gin, which I paid for, and drank with them - I did not go into the house; I am sure it did not intoxicate me - when we came to Davis-place I objected to go down; the prisoner Ann caught me by the arm and pressed me down the passage, down Davis-place, and I went into the house; I had not the slightest reason to believe them women of the town - they told me they were tradesmen's daughters, out of work, and in the greatest distress; I went down with them to their house - they opened the door with a key; it was a very mean hovel, with no fire in it, nor any light; I then turned round to go away, and Frances held me while the other got a light - when the light was got they were about to light the fire, but could not scrape up coal to light it with; there were a few sticks and ashes - they said it being very cold they would light a fire, and if I would sit down they would relate their case to me; they began to state that they were hair feeders - I asked what that was; they said they supplied the stuffers of sofa covers, as they could not go on with their work without a feeder - I saw a little bag hanging over the fire-place; they said it was full of duplicates of goods they had pawned for support - I did not look at it; I gave them money to fetch victuals and drink - Ann went for it, and brought some boiled pork, bread, and a pint of beer; they brought some gin - that was not drank for a considerable time; I think they called it a quartern and a half - I partook of what they brought, and might be there nearly two hours, but after the first hour I stopped because I could not get away, for they had locked me in; when I left some of the gin was left; (the bottle was on the table the following morning) immediately that I came out of the house Frances came out after me - I left Ann in the house.</p>

               <p>Q. While you were in the house, had you observed any thing done to your pockets? A. I found Ann several times making an attempt at my pockets - first on one side, and then the other; in consequence of that I stated to them that I had property about me, and I immediately put my hand to my fob, lifted the notes out, and saw that they were all right - before I left the house I had put them safely back again, and buttoned my coat over my pockets; Frances followed me out of the house - she said she would go a little way down Hoxton with me; I told her there was no need for that, for I wished to get from them, finding what they were - she still persisted in going with me, and about two hundred yards from the house the sister came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said,"Is he going to give us any thing to drink before he leaves us?" I consented to give them something to drink to get rid of them - I know my property was all safe at that time; I crossed the way into the Red Lion, in Hoxton - they went in, and called for a quartern of gin; they poured out a glass of gin for me to drink, but I objected to have any - I asked the landlord's son for a little water, and put about half a glass of gin into it, which I drank; they drank the rest - I paid for it, and immediately came out; they came out immediately, and at the corner of the house is Red Lion-passage, which is a thoronghfare into the Kingsland-road - they endeavoured to force me down there, but I objected; they said it was my nearest way, as I was going Hackney way - I had not got more than twenty paces down the passage before Frances took hold of me, and struck my head violently against the wall; Ann tore open my coat, and forced her hand into my fob- I said, "Don't attempt to rob me;" she got hold of the notes - I held my watch in one hand, and my hand on my purse, which I thought would keep all the money in, but I was affected with the blow; in less than a minute she said, "Come along, Fan, I have got it all"- she put a few words at the end of that, and said, "All is right."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand or fall from the blow? A. I fell on the ground; I laid there scarcely five minutes before I heard the voice of a female, but I had not power to articulate - I heard her saying, "Get up," and immediately some watchmen came and helped me up; they took me to Hoxton watch-house - I staid there all night, and next morning, a little after seven o'clock, went to the place I had seen them at the night before, in Davis-place; I found the house open, but nobody there - the window was thrown up, and the shutters put too; I called out - nobody answered - I went in at the window, and went up stairs; nobody was there: every thing appeared in the place as I had left it, except the little bag over the mantle-piece, and that was gone - I gave notice to stop the Bank notes next morning: as I had the numbers of them - they were all paid into the Bank three weeks after; they have not been stopped.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at all in liquor, or unable to take care of yourself? A. I was not; I had not the slightest improper intention in going with them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You say you were not in liquor at all? A. Not at all; I dined at home, at No. 21, Dean-street, Commercial-road - I went to Kingsland to tea; I drank nothing at dinner but a little porter - there was a pot among four of us; I drank about half a pint - I am certain I did not drink a pint; I set off to Kingsland about two o'clock - I drank nothing in the way; I went to a friend's there, not to a public-house - I am not addicted to go to public-houses: I never get tipsy- I do not know when I was in a state of intoxication; it being cold weather I took a glass or two of gin that night, as I stated - I might be at Kingsland an hour and a half; I took nothing but tea, and about half a wine-glass of gin- I called no where on the road; I was stopped by them on Kingsland-bridge - I stopped at so house on the road; I do not know the sign of the first house I went to with them; I had one glass of gin there, but did not go into the house - Ann went in and fetched it out to the door; I did not remain there three minutes - when I was at their house they fetched two pints of beer; I drank very little of the first pint, but more of the last, and that stupified me - they drank very little of the last pint; there was some stuff in it, for I observed it - I had only part of one glass of gin there; nearly all the last gin was left - I drank none of that; what I drank was before I had the beer - I smoked a pipe there; I sent for a bushel of coals for them, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not all on perfectly good terms at their house? A. Not all the time I was there - when I found them hustling about my pockets I was afraid of my mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150029"/>ney; I felt for them from the state of the weather, and was interested to hear their tale - I did go up stairs with one of them, but I was not there two minutes; I came down immediately.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go up stairs for any improper purpose? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. Will you swear you were not up stairs half an hour? A. I was not up stairs five minutes, I am certain; the stupefaction did not remain on me long- it was only when I drank the beer: I am a married man - I do not think I could be up stairs more than three minutes; I went up, because one of them asked me to go up and see their habitation up stairs, to see their furniture - the bed lay down on a low bedstead; one of them said it was a very mean one - I do not recollect making any reply.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not reply, "It is good enough for you and me?" A. No, on my oath, I did not; only one of them went up stairs with me; after I came down some gin was fetched, which I paid for - they fetched a quartern and a half twice, and two pints of beer; I think I gave them 3s. - that is 1s. 6d. each time for the liquor, 2s. to fetch meat and bread, and 1s. 6d. for coals; 1s. 6d. will buy a pint of gin, but they did not buy that quantity - it was in a small bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, will you swear you were perfectly sober when you left that house? A. Yes, I was so far sober; I do not think what I had drank had hurt me, not to make me incapable of knowing what I was about, and taking care of myself - I afterwards drank about half a glass of gin in water; I am positive I drank nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not fall from drunkenness, instead of being struck? A. No - the cause of my falling was Frances striking my head against the wall; the watchman carried me to the watch-house; I was incapable from the stun I had received, of walking - they robbed me in Red Lion-passage; it is a public thoroughfare - I was not well after I got to the watch-house, from the blow I had received, and the stuff they put into the beer; I did not see them put any thing into the beer, but from the taste it had I thought so - I remained at the watch-house a considerable time, for the blow I had received, and what little I had drunk, not being used to drink, it took an effect on me, and having laboured long under paralytic, as I do on one side, it made me feel unwell and unpleasant for nearly two hours; I have not said the liquor alone made me insensible.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to yourself in the watch-house was it then you first discovered you had lost your money? A. I knew I was at the watch-house - they let me be by the fire, and they rummaged my pockets; I was well aware I was robbed when they knocked me down, for I felt her put her hand into my pocket; I did not charge any other person.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not charge any other person at the watch-house? A. I did not - they said I did, but they misunderstood my statement; they said I had charged them, but I will state how it was - at four o'clock in the morning they brought a handkerchief to me, and said, "There is your property - you are capable now of finding your way home;" I said, "Never mind the property, let it lay till morning, but when I undid the handkerchief I found all the property I had had about me, except the five 10l. notes and a silk handkerchief; they said"Is that all your property?" I said, "No, there are five 10l. notes I have not got;" the night officer then said,"Then you charge us with felony," but I had not charged them with it - I said No, I did not, but I would not leave till morning, when I would go before a Magistrate, and have it settled - I went to Worship-street.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not state at the watch-house that these women had robbed you? A. I did not tell them there that the women had robbed me - I said I had been robbed; I told the night officer I had been robbed, and went with him next morning to the place where I had been, and showed it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. At what time in the morning was it that you said you had been robbed? A. Past seven o'clock; I became sensible about half-past two - I left the prisoners' house about a quarter or half-past ten o'clock, I think; I have had notice from the Bank of the notes having come in - I showed the officer the place I was robbed at- it is about twenty paces down the passage leading from Hoxton to Kingsland.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 26th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was passing down Thames-street with Prendergass (I had received information of this robbery about three weeks before from the Hue and Cry) - I saw Ann Matthews there; I knew her person before, and in consequence of my suspicion, I did not take her, but left Prendergass to watch her, and went to the Anchor, at St. Mary-at-hill - I saw Frances there, and told her I apprehended her on suspicion of robbing a gentleman of five 10l. notes at Hoxton; she said, "Oh, if it is for that I don't care - I thought it had been for something else."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She denied it, did she not? A. She did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have not said so? A. She said if it was for that she did not care; I do not call that a flat denial.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say she denied it, or said she had not done it? A. No.</p>

I waited in the street while Shelswell went into the public-house -the prisoner Ann went into the same house; I then told her I took her for robbing a person of five 10l. notes - she said it was not her, as she had left off going on the streets at night; she denied all knowledge of the robbery- I took her to the office - I was present when the prosecutor first saw the prisoners; he identified both of them immediately, without any hesitation whatever.</p>

            . I was serving at the Red Lion, when the prosecutor came in with two young women; I cannot swear that the prisoners are the women - I cannot recollect sufficiently to say whether they are or are not; they had a glass of gin, and a small glass to drink it with - a quartern is a quarter of a pint; Williams had water, and put a small portion of gin into it - they were in the house about three minutes; he drank nothing but the gin and water - in about five minutes after they left, a young woman came and told me a gentleman had fallen down in Red Lion-passage; it was not either of the women who had been in the house with the prosecutor - I was alone in the bar, and did not go out; I told the young woman if there was no watch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150030"/>man there to get one, but she had been for one before who was with him at the time - I heard nothing more of him that night; he would not pass our door to go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They all three came into the house to drink the gin? A. Yes, they appeared on friendly terms; they all drank together and laughed; the passage is by the side of our house - if there had been a disturbance there I should not have heard it; the tap-room is next to the passage; there was company there- we have no door opening into the passage; the wall of the house separates it from the tap-room - our bar and door are in front of the house in the road; the doors are always kept shut - our shutters were up; I was not out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether any person left the house after these persons before the young woman came? A. No, I do not think there was; I cannot recollect - I do not know whether any body was in the tap-room; my father was in the tap-room, with the door closed - the passage is about twenty-five feet from where I was.</p>

            . I was a watchman. I remember finding Mr. Williams in Red Lion-passage on the night in question; he might be a dozen yards from the Red Lion door - he was laying on his face in the snow, and his head right up against the wall; we carried him to the watch-house.</p>

No; I found him at half-past eleven o'clock - he was searched in the watch-house, and a silver watch with a chain and seals, a 10l. note, a guinea, three half-sovereigns, and I cannot exactly tell what else, were found on him.</p>

            . I was the watch-house-keeper. The Police have now taken possession; I was at the watch-house when the prosecutor was brought there - he was brought in about a quarter before twelve, in a state of insensibility, by three watchmen and two inhabitants; they were carrying him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what was the cause of his insensibility? A. I presume it was drinking a quantity of liquor - a state of intoxication; I sat him up against a chair, undid his neckcloth, and gave him air - in about an hour afterwards he was sick, and emptied his stomach; he had a bruise on his forehead - it appeared as if he had fallen against the wall, and grazed his skin; at two o'clock I got him on a chair - he was not then sensible, but about four o'clock I thought he was sensible, and asked him some questions; when I returned him the money I had taken from him, he said he missed five 10l. notes - I had entered in a book what I found on him(reads); "A pair of spectacles and case, a pin, a watch-key, two silk handkerchiefs, one ditto, a knife, a watch and chain, another pair of spectacles in a morocco case, a bunch of keys, a half-crown, 2s. 6d., one gold ring, four sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, one King William and Queen Mary guinea, which I took for a foreign coin, one 10l. note, an umbrella, and a snuff-box" - his watch was hanging out when he came in, and his money in his pockets; when I gave him this money, he said, "I shall not take them, for I miss five 10l. notes, and I must have lost them in the watch-house - I must have been robbed here."</p>

            . I was the night officer. The prosecutor was brought to the watch-house by three watchmen and three others; he was drunk, very drunk, not capable of knowing what he did; he remained there till seven o'clock in the morning - he became sensible partly about two, and about four he got sufficiently so to answer questions; when his money was returned to him, he said,"Whoever took one must have taken the other, and I am determined to take the thing before the Magistrate" - he said he had lost five 10l. Bank notes; I asked if he had been in company with any body - he said No, only with his father at Newington; I said, "Did you leave them with your father?" he said, No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A. About six o'clock in the morning; he said he had been to pay some bills.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. Did he say any thing more? A. I asked if he was positively sure he had not been in company with any body; he said he had not, only he lost the money - I said, "Why do you accuse me or my brother officer of taking these things?" he said, whoever would take one had taken the other - I went to Worship-street to clear myself from having taken his property; he made no charge against the officers at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go with him to Davis'-court? A. I did about half-past seven o'clock; he had not told me he had been there with some women - he took me to the house, and when he got there he said, "I suppose this is the place where the girls live who have robbed me;" I said, "Why you accused us of it."</p>

               <p>Q. He appeared to you quite drunk - have you ever seen a man under the influence of a blow on the head by being knocked against a wall, and having a paralytic affection as well? A. No.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker. On the 27th of February, about ten minutes or a quarter past one o'clock, I was going up Compton-passage; I heard a cry of Stop thief! I instantly saw the prisoner turn the corner, and come towards me running very fast; I said, Halloo! and instantly stopped him, and as I stopped him he fell down; the street was dirty, I let him get up, he then said "It was not me" - I took him to the top of the passage, and met the prosecutor at the end of the passage in about half a minute; he said to the prisoner,"Where is my gold you have robbed me of?" the prisoner said, he had not got any gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the passage in which you took the prisoner short or long? A. I suppose about two hundred yards long; I was ten or twelve yards from the end of the passage; I did not go back to the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am quite innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Nine witnesses gave the prisoner an unusually good character for honesty and steady conduct.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, Compton-street, Clerkenwell. I was in Clerkenwell-prison last Thursday, on suspicion of felony, and have been discharged - the prisoner came into the same yard as I was in, and sat down by me; I was at tea - it might be between three and four o'clock; he asked me how I thought he should get on -I said he knew his case better than me; I had not talked to him before, and did not know what he was there for - he told me he was charged with stealing two diamond rings, one a plain one, and the other a white one, with two rubies in it - I asked what made them accuse him more than the other servants; he said, because he went in for some hot water that afternoon - I asked whether he had them; he said Yes, he had them, but no blame was to be attached to him, for the coachman's wife had had a young woman to see her, and they had examined the rings, and also the other servants were held in 50l. bail - he said the rings were not missed that day, but he went out with the carriage, and his master told him he might go home about eight o'clock in the evening; that his master returned between twelve and one, missed them, called some of the servants up, and told them he missed them - that he went to bed, and tied them up in his shirt that evening; the next morning he was cleaning his harness in the stable, and his master sent for an officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150032"/>and while the officer was gone for he concealed the rings in one of three empty stalls, between the bricks; that he pulled up the dirt, covered them over again, and threw some loose hay-seeds over them; I went with Duke, the officer, to the stables, on Saturday, and was with him when he found the rings in one of the stalls, as described by the prisoner; he said, when he went for the hot water he opened the looking-glass drawer, and took them out - that there was a gold watch and gold snuff-box there; I asked what made him take them in particular - he said because they were the most portable, and that he intended to have pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of his telling you all this? A.

These are my rings - I gave sixty guineas for one, and fifty for the other; I was on horseback on Monday afternoon, from four to seven o'clock, and then went to a friend's in the coach at eight, but discharged it at half-past ten, with the two servants, the prisoner and another - I went to the prison two days after he had been there; he then began crying, and pretended to know nothing about it - I said, "I wish you would confess, because suspicion is greatly on you, and I think you are the person; if you will confess to me I will give you something;" he said he was as innocent as a lamb and cried - this was on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He asked if I would replace the doors; I said of course, when I left I should leave the house in the same situation as I found it. Witness. The expression was if I would let the case stand over till Monday he would have them replaced, or brought back on Monday morning: the value of all the articles removed is 52l. 13s. 6d. as fixtures - it would cost 80l. to replace them.</p>

I took this house at the halfquarter for the purpose of opening it in the blacking line, having been promised several orders; I did not succeed in doing any thing - I was in daily expectation of doing something, till within a month of Lady-day, when Mr. Collins' clerk called for the rent; I said I dare say in about six weeks I should be able to settle it - he called about a week after Lady-day; I said if he would draw a bill I should be able to honor it. and next day he served me with a copy of a writ: last Saturday the broker and Mr. Collins' clerks came to seize - I said I was not aware these things were gone, but as I had taken the house I should leave it as I had found it; he said if the things were not returned by Monday Mr. Collins would give me in charge for felony - I said I would return them, but did not say by Monday; I did not sleep in the house, but at my sister's - a man used to open and shut the shop, whether he took the things. I cannot say, but he told the officer he would appear on Monday, but did not.</p>

On Friday, the 19th of March, I suspected him, and when he was going home, about half-past six or seven o'clock. I challenged him with having taken away some brass work, and asked where he had sold the brass work which he took on the Friday before - it was merely by accident I mentioned Friday; I had no particular knowledge of Friday; he appeared at first a little confused - I said, "I desire to know to whom you sold them;" I repeated the question two or three times very rapidly, and he said to Mr. Everard, or some such name, in the New-cut: I then asked where he had sold the brass work on the Tuesday before - he said he did not take anyon the Tuesday before; I said, "I mean the Tuesday before that" - he replied, "I sold them in Whitecross-street;" he named the shop, but I do not think he named the person - I then took him up stairs to the warehouse, to a chair which had the castors taken off, and said, "Where did you sell the castors off this chair?" he said, "I sold them to Lambert, (and somebody) in the New-cut" - I then took him to another chair, a sofa, and a set of dining-tables, which had had castors fixed to them; we lost a variety of articles of the description in the indictment, worth more than 4l. or 5l.; he had a private examination before Sir John Perring next day, at Guildhall - I found some castors and brass fork-fastenings at a house in the New-cut, by means of a search-warrant, and brought them away: I fitted them on the legs of a table - they corresponded with the screws, which were left on the table.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARRSON. Q. Did it not strike you that the people who bought them were the worst of the two? A. No, it did not - our foreman, Richardson, was present at the conversation; I certainly said to the prisoner, "I know all about it - tell me where you sold them;" I did not say it was of no use to deny it - I put down what I meant to say to him before I went in; he is an orphan, and was brought to our house by his uncle; who had served us with great propriety.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Everet and Lambert, of the New-cut and Charles-street, Long-acre. -The prisoner brought some old brass to sell two or three times; he used to bring about 3lbs. at a time - we allowed 4d. a lb.; it was old brass.</p>
               <p>Q. That had been injured by wear? A. Yes, injured by wear, and broken likewise; I did not ask how he came by it, as persons frequently bring in brass. and have articles in exchange - we paid him for this; I do not think I have dealt with him more than three or four times - I never asked what he was, or were he came from - Mr. Wilkinson and an officer went into our foundry, with a search-warrant, and brought out some fork-fastenings and old castors: I told him a lad brought them - he asked if I knew the lad; I said Yes, by his coming to the shop - the brass could not be used till re-melted; I swear that - the castors were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not appear as if they had been just taken off good furniture? A. No - some of the table - fork fastenings were correct, two or three of them, but those were not brought altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed at the time that they were correct? A. No; when they were put on the desk I went to them, and was surprised to see it; they must be lacquered again before they are fit for use - I have not been in the business more than three months, not with Everet and Lambert -I have been with brass-founders; some of the castors were not broken, they were not fresh - they must be lacquered again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think I heard you drop that your master keeps a foundry? A. Yes; we melt the brass over again - we do not keep a marine-store shop, but are brass-founders; we do not buy for lacquering, but for melting.</p>
               <p>Q. From boys like the prisoner? A. Yes; I do not suppose more than three castors would go to 1 lb. - they were broken: they might be compared with the tables, by the screw holes.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Wilkinson was to tell us they were bran new, and of the best character, would that be true? A. No, they were broken - none of the articles delivered to Mr. Wilkinson were new; they were dirty - I own two or three were new, but they were brought with other old brass; the castors appear to have been worn - they are broken at the screw-hole; it did not strike me that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150035"/>had been torn from a chair - I thought they had been worn off; they could have new ones for the price it would take to do them up - we sell some new ones at 11d. a set of four, but I do not know what these claw castors are worth; I did not hear Mr. Wilkinson threaten to take me or my masters into custody as receivers.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall I went with Mr. Wilkinson to Lambert and Co.'s, Newcut, and found some articles which he claimed; I saw Clark - he said be bought them of the prisoner, who was then in custody; I found about 3lbs. - there was a great deal of old brass, which Mr. Wilkinson could not swear to, but Clark said he bought them of the prisoner; Mr. Wilkinson claimed more, but only desired me to bring these away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you left the best behind? A. No; they are bent, just as if prepared for the forge, but are quite new brass - there is no doubt some are quite new, and not bent at all; nobody could doubt about their being new brass, if he saw it by itself.</p>
               <p>MR. WILKINSON. I have no doubt of this being our brass work; we should not send fastenings of this description to be melted as old brass, but these which are bent we should; I dare say we had some bent in our possession, but that is always locked up; these have been taken off furniture in our ware-room - we lost all the fastenings from every table we have in the house; I must say that Everet and Co., as soon as I went there, said there was no need for a search-warrant, I might search every where I liked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were all the castors on your chairs quite new? A. Some chairs had been made three or four years - they had never been worn, except moving about the warehouse; the brass forks could not he bent, or they would not go into the tables - when these were bent I cannot tell: we lost some castors worth 15s. or 16s. a set, and some at about 2s. 6d. or 2s. - none of them would be worth only 4d. a pound as new, but very few except three or four sets would be of use till new lacquered.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Must not the prisoner have been many hours taking these castors off the furniture? A. He must have been several; we have a variety of rooms, where he rubbed the furniture - all the castors were taken from a room where we keep furniture which we lend for parties.</p>

Randall's wharf, with a tub on his back; I hit it with my stick, and said, "Mate, what have you got here?" he said it was all right; I asked him to show me the bill of parcels - he then put the tub off his shoulder, and said if I would go with him he would show me the person who sent him with it; I crossed the street with him, went down the same passage, and the moment he got to the archway he took to his heels and ran away - I saw plenty of officers about, and called, Stop thief! they followed him, and I went back to mind the butter - he was secured in five minutes; I have no doubt of his being the person - the tub and butter are here.</p>

            . This is the firkin; it has the ink marks W. A. the same as the others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you received many tubs from the same person? A. A great quantity at different times, but not on that day, or perhaps for a week before; we do not send them out at all - we are in the habit of shipping a number with the same mark, at different times; we received these ten from Lilwall and Co., of Lime-street - we received no others from them that day; we have at other times - I cannot swear we had received none within four days; we always ship them to Kent and Sussex - we send none by land carriage; I know this to be one of the ten sent that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you met that cask by itself, would you have known it from any others of the same firm? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any other from that firm except the ten on that day? A. No, I think not; the mark was put on it before it came to us.</p>
               <p>MR PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear positively you bad no others of the same mark in your warehouse that day? A. I know we had none of the same mark, nor any of a former stock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th of March the porter of Mr. Randall, who works in the warehouse, said he had seen me come into the warehouse to ask for work, and saw me go out without any thing; is it feasible for a moment that I should have taken the butter? if so the warehouseman or porter must have seen me; Benson says that in about ten minutes after I was taken with the butter; it being so short a time my friends are not here, and I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

            . Q. What description of butter is it? A. Limerick; the cask is No. 20, letter A., but we never take notice of the numbers.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWELL. The casks were marked W. A. in ink; we do not notice the brand marks.</p>
               <p>The prisoner then handed in a written defence as follows:"I went to Queenhithe to obtain work; a man came up and asked if I wanted a job, and said he would give me one, to take a tub of butter to the Angel, St. Martin's-le-Grand, and he would give me 1s. 6d.; I took it up, and got about one hundred yards when two men met me and asked if I had a bill of parcels; I said No, that a young man at the wharf gave me the goods to carry, and said he would follow me; I put down the tub and told him I would show him the young man; we went to the wharf, and could not find him; then the officer took me; there are two ways leading to the wharf; the officer went one way and I the other."</p>
               <p>THOMAS KELLY. I am a wine-cooper, and live at No. 46, Golden-lane, St. Luke's. I do not know the prisoner; I was coming up Thames-street on the 17th of last month- I had occasion to stop in the street for a friend who was coming after me, and saw a man ask the prisoner to carry a tub of butter; I both heard him ask him and saw him employ him - they had some altercation about the price of his wages for carrying it, but as far as I could understand they agreed for 1s. 6d.; I have not heard the prisoner's defence read - I stopped there and saw the man get the cask of butter and carry it up the street; my friend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150037"/>joined me, and I walked on - my friend's name was Casey, not Crawley; we had occasion to return in a very short time to the Custom-house, and I saw a crowd of people in the street, and found this man in custody near Queenhithe - a person there seemed to know him; I naturally inquired the cause of the crowd - a person there told me what it was, and I left my address with this man, who seemed to know him, that if any thing should occur they would know where to find me; I did not know the man I left my address with - he knew the prisoner very well; I said, "I saw that man employed not many minutes back to carry a tub of butter, and if any testimony I can give will be of use to him I will give it" - I left my address, and through that I have been led into be brought here; he was in custody of the beadle of the parish - the man I left my address with told me that he knew the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not go to the beadle and tell him? A. I could not get near him; I was a good distance from him- I suppose twenty or thirty yards; it was in Thames-street he had hold of the prisoner - I could not make my way up to him; there were a great many people round -I did not like to interfere; I gave my card to tell where I was to be found - I knew he was taken up for this tub of butter; I did not go and tell the beadle what I had seen - I have no motive in coming here.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, where did you see the tub delivered to him? A. I saw him coming up the corner of Queenhithe with it; I do not know where the man delivered it to him - I did not see him deliver it to him; I saw the man agree with him about the price; if I have said I saw it given to him it is wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any tub in the custody of the man who was talking to him about carrying it? A. No, I was not present when it was given to him, but I afterwards saw him carrying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for what you know it might have come out of this warehouse? A. It might. I lodge in Golden-lane now, and am a journeyman wine-cooper; I do not work for any body now, nor did I at the time this happened - I only work occasionally where I can get jobs; I have not been in regular employment for four years.</p>

               <p>Q. How many days have you been employed for the last four months? A. About ten days, but worked for no one in particular - I buy bottles, and sell them; I have not bottled any wine for the last four months - I buy bottles, and sell them again; I call myself a wine-cooper, because I was bred to it - I still profess to be one, but have not worked at it lately; I have not bottled wine for the last year; I sell bottles to the shops in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you to come here to give evidence? A. This man's mother - an elderly woman called on me; she found me through the address I had given the man- she could not know me through any other channel; I was not subpoenaed - I did not see his mother till to-day; she did not then see my card - I do not know where my friend Casey is - he saw this; I did not think it necessany to bring him here - I am not interested; Casey does not live in town - he is a gentleman who bottles wine and porter, and sends it to the East Indies; I do not think his name is in the Directory - he is not a resident here; I do not know where he lives - I have known him a long time; I found him in Thames-street that day - he only comes to town occasionally; I am not on terms of intimacy with him - I have often been employed by him as a porter to see wines and porter shipped, and things of that kind; I never asked where he lived - he pays me the moment I do a job; I have done nothing for him lately - I think it is more than a year or two since; I met him in the street on this day - he said if he had any thing for me to do he would employ me; I was out of employ - he had nothing for me to do; he told me to stop while he went into a gentleman's office, and I stopped - I got a few shillings from him; I believe it was 3s. 6d. - that is what he gave me, neither more nor less; he saw part of this transaction, and was with me when I saw this man in custody - he did not go up to tell the beadle; I told him I had seen a man bargaining with him to take the tub - I did not interfere more than I have stated - I never heard where Casey lives.</p>

I left this coat on the carriage-box, in the coach-house, and the door locked, at half past eleven o'clock, on the night of the 23rd of March - I returned about half-past six in the morning; the coat was gone, and a whip - the prisoner had assisted me, and, as he did not call that morning as usual, I had some suspicion, and went to a house where I saw him intoxicated; I went out, and spoke to a Policeman; the prisoner came out of the house- he looked agitated, and went in again; he then came out, walked off for some distance, and then began to run - the Policeman went and took him; he could not be examined that day, being intoxicated, but was the next day - he said he knew nothing of it; he spoke to me, and asked to give him something to eat and drink, but I said I could not, as he had robbed me.</p>

            . I was near my shop on the 24th of March - a neighbour of mine recommended the prisoner to me, who wanted to exchange a box-coat for some clothes; I looked at it, and found it had no buttons on it, but was nearly a new one - I had some suspicion, and said, "Is this your coat?" he said Yes; I said, "What has become of the buttons?" he said, "My master told me if I gave them to him I might have the coat" - I saw something in his mouth; I asked him if he had a button - he said Yes, and gave me the button out of his mouth; it had a lion on it and a fleur-de-lis in his paw - I said if he would bring me a note from his master, saying it was his own, I would buy it; he went away, and I saw him no more - he said he had worn it three years; I was certain it could not have been worn six months.</p>

The prisoner came there on Saturday night the 20th of March, with two men and a woman - one of the men bought a pair of cord trousers; as they were turning from the door, I heard the pieces of a boy's dress give way - I followed the prisoner, who had got about three doors off, and found the dress in his possession; he offered to pay me for it rather than go to the watch-house - I think I have seen him at my shop before.</p>

            . I am a private watchman in Savoy-street. On the 21st of February, about one o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another person; the prisoner had this sack under his arm - I said, "Wise, who does that belong to?" he said a person who sells coals - I said "He has no such sack;" he then said he found it at a public-house - I took him to the watch-house, and on the Monday morning I saw the name of Mr. Capper on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Where did this take place? A. At the Savoy-palace public-house. I saw him go out; I did not see the sack lying at the bar- it was under his arm; it is a house much frequented by carmen - I cannot tell whether they are in the habit of leaving sacks there; I have seen small ones, but not large ones there - he did not make any resistance, but he threatened that he would punch my head; he went quietly to the watch-house - I never swore I would do for him; I have known him three or four years - we might have had words, but no quarrel; he was a <rs id="t18300415-53-deflabel306" type="occupation">coal-porter</rs>

            . I was in the Savoy public-house.

on the sack - he took it home from the office, and said he would have an Old 
Bailey job of that.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say this openly? A. Yes - I am a coal-porter; I know a two-bushel bag from a sack; this is the bag he brought in - this was taken away about ten o'clock by a man who had been working with him, and who is here; the prisoner did not see the bag taken at ten o'clock - he was in the tap-room and this was under a seat; I cannot tell why the other man took it out - the prisoner looked under the seat at twelve o'clock and found this one.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far had he got from the shop? A. I do not know; he was brought back in four or five minutes - I did not weigh any beef for him; there were ten or twelve people in the shop, he was brought into the shop and up to the scale, which is two or three yards within the shop; I suppose Mrs. Somers must have made a mistake, when she said he came to the door - she was at the other scale two or three yards off; I do not know whether she heard what was said - he took the beef to the watch o se with him; the beef was not weighed by me, or by my orders; he did mention some weight before the Magistrae.</p>

I was on the Wednesday; I asked him at the watch-house the weight of the beef in the presence of all who were there - I asked him because he had said he had paid me 1s. 3d. for it; there might be twenty or thirty people in our shop - we had about a dozen of our people there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was asked the weight of the beef; I had paid 1s. 9d. for it - I said 1s. 3d., and then corrected myself, and said 1s. 9d.; I paid the prosecutor's son for it.</p>

            . I was in the prosecutor's shop on the night in question, and gave my address; I saw the prisoner take up the bit of beef, and saw it weighed to him; he took the money out of his pocket, and put it down - my husband is a porter; I was going to buy a bit of pork.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the person who weighed the beef? A. No, I should not know him; I did not buy any thing - I was interrupted; I spoke to the master of the shop, and asked him the price of it - and then this happened; Mrs. Somers was not at that side of the shop -I did not hear what it weighed; I went before the Magistrate on Monday, and told him what I saw - I said I saw the man weigh it, and throw it down by the side of the scale.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has he not been in the army? A.

               <p>Prisoner. It is a malicious thing altogether; she has done it to blast my character - in going to Queen-square she and her husband asked what pension I had - had 1 1s. a day? I said Yes; they then asked if I had 1s. 0 1/2d.? I said Yes - then 1s. 1d.; I said Yes - but my pension is 1s. 5d.; if they had said 2s. 6d. I should have said Yes.</p>

To the tap-room and into a side box; the bar is opposite to it - he was very much in liquor; and did not seem to know what he was doing - he went to sleep on the table; I think he was awake when she went away - he had paid for the liquor before she went; she went in about ten minutes afterwards - no other persons were in the tap-room.</p>

On the 17th of March I put down a 5l. note to pay for two glasses of grog, and this was the change of it; it was lying on a table in a public-house - the prisoner took it up; he was quite a stranger - he walked out at the door, I did not stop him; I met his wife at the door - she asked me where I was going - I said after Walker who has gone off with change for a 5l. note; she said she would take me home - I found him there, he said he had not had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What house was this? A. The George - I was not quite sober; I left my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150048"/>vessel between two and three o'clock - I went to a house as soon as I got my money and had some grog; I do not think I took any spirits neat - I had seen the prisoner on board the ship, looking after lodgers and boarders; he had gone with me to the captain for company - there was only ourselves in the room; I had no money at all when I left the ship in the morning - I had received 6l.; I do not think I could have spent the other pound in the time; but I gave the note to be changed - the change was laid on the table - the prisoner counted it, put it into his pocket, and walked off - I went home with his wife and the other lady, who said, "Do not alarm yourself; no doubt you will find him in the house, and it will all be made right" - I had no other reason for going home with them; I know Mary Long - I have never been to them and said, "One of your girls have taken my money from me; if you will give me 2l. I will say no more about it" - I have received one sovereign, but not two; I have not been to the woman who keeps the house, and said if she would give me another sovereign, or do another thing, I would say no more about it.</p>

            . I met the prisoner's wife, who was looking for her husband; we went to the house and met the prosecutor coming out - he said her husband had taken his change; she said she dare say he was gone home, and she would get him his change - we went home, and he asked him for his change; he said he had no change - he was sitting on a chair, and was in liquor; this was about five minutes after - the prosecutor said he would fetch an officer; Walker said he would give him a sovereign, and he gave him one - he said he had not the change; when the officer came the prisoner ran into the yard - they had bolted the door, and I opened it to let the officer in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. Yes, more so than the prosecutor - I saw the prosecutor come to Mr. Walker afterwards; I did not hear him say,"Some man has taken my money, but who I cannot say;" he made no offer in my presence to Mr. Walker - I had not known the prosecutor before; I did not volunteer to come against the prisoner, nor say any thing about having a quarrel, or I would serve him out; he never did me any harm - I was in a little bit of trouble once about poisoning a sailor, but it was cleared up; I was before a Magistrate once before that - I will not swear I have not been five times at a bar; I never said I would serve Walker out the first opportunity.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 13th of March the prosecutor called on me, and took me to the prisoner's house - when I knocked at the door it was locked, but Long let me in; Walker ran into the privy - I came back for a light, and took him out; I found a Mexican dollar, and some silver and copper on him; I went to the watch-house the next day, and the prisoner had a pen in his hand - he asked me to write a promissory note to pay the prosecutor; I said "It is a thing not allowed, and I will not do it" - I took the prosecutor, and had him bound over; Walker's wife kept him away, and the prisoner was remanded; the prosecutor was sober, but had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you go? A. To Walker's, within three or four minutes after the prosecutor told me of it - I had known him before; I found no sovereign on him.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of March, I was called up by a person who comes to work for me - I heard a rustling noise in the yard; I pulled my curtain aside; I saw a man get off the water-cistern, in the yard, and come in at my back door into my passage - my yard joins the prosecutor's; there is a wall between them - I told the person, who called me, and he alarmed the Police; two Policemen came almost directly, and went out of my back door to Boddington's, but could find nobody - I did not go with them, as I was not dressed; I went to the back door; a bag and several weights were found in Boddington's yard - I went to the top of my house, thinking they might have got out at my roof; I knocked at the prisoner Harper's, door, which is the top room in my house, and said,"Mrs. Harper, don't be frightened, have you any one there?" - she said, "Oh, dear, no;" she and her husband lodge with me - I went down again; we hunted in the cellar, but could find nobody, and the Police went away; a little after six o'clock, Mrs. Wood, who lodges on the same floor as Harper, came down and told me something- in five or six minutes I went up with Rose and another Policeman, and found the three male prisoner in Mrs. Harper's room; they were taken to the watch-house.</p>

Yes - it appeared to be women's footsteps; they appeared very light - I saw nobody - the two persons came up directly after each other; I immediately heard the door shut and locked - I still heard voices when they went down; it appeared men's voices, but whether it was in the house I cannot tell; I went down to Bishop a little before six o'clock - when the person asked if there was any body in the room, he said something about a robbery; I heard a noise as if the door was opening, about six o'clock, before I went to Bishop - the prosecutor's premises are separated from ours by, I think, a wooden partition; it is higher than my head - no person could see over it; they must climb over there to get from our premises to his; I do not know whether Mrs. Harper is in the family-way - I heard the voices about half-past two o'clock; the persons returned about a quarter-past three o'clock - directly the alarm was given I bolted my door.</p>

On the 22nd of February, between ten and twelve o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in the Edgware-road, with a basket on his shoulder, containing this linen - I told him he had been very fortunate that morning, and he must go with me; he immediately threw the basket right upon me - it knocked me into the road; I pursued - I dragged the basket along as well as I was able; he was knocked down by some people in Oxford-street, and secured, without my losing sight of him - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long had you known him? A. Some months; he lives within two hundred yards of me - he was in Somerset-street, coming from Portman-square.</p>

The prisoner came into my service on the 26th of January; on Sunday, the 21st of March, I went out, leaving her at home - I had seen all the property stated in the indictment safe the day before, and some that morning; I returned at eight o'clock in the evening, and knocked at the door; I received no answer, and was going for a Policeman, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150051"/>a neighbour gave me information - I got a constable and got into the house; the prisoner was gone, and I missed all these articles and money - I got information and afterwards went to No. 20, Little James-street, Manchester-square; the property had then been found - I saw it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you hire the prisoner? A. I hired her first about the end of November. I met her accidentally; I walked with her and made an appointment with her, as is usual in such cases - it was not for her to come into my service then.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear she did not live with you as a mistress? A. Certainly not - I have receipts to prove she was my servant. When I first met her I went with her to a house in the neighbourhood of Soho-square, and there found her to be a girl of the town, as I believed she was; but from the knowledge I obtained of her character afterwards, I thought she might be trusted, which induced me to take her; I never slept with her while she was in my service - I certainly did in Greek-street, Soho; I had frequent interviews with her at her lodgings, which she took me to in Meards-court; I gave her money - I gave her nothing but her wages while she was my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep her as your mistress before she came into your service? A. I never considered her so. I supported her in every way; the wages I gave her was 5s. a week, or 12l. a year, which was the agreement - I took lodgings for her before she came into my service; she lived at those lodgings about two months or longer, till the 26th of January, when she came into my service - I first saw her on a Sunday, the latter end of November or beginning of December; I walked by her side - I appointed to meet her on the Tuesday evening; I did so - I took an apartment for her at No. 21, Norton-street, Marylebone, but did not pass her off there as my wife; she was there about a month - it is not a house of ill same; the landlord is a chair-maker - she walked with me to the house; no inquiry was made whether I was married - there was a little objection made at first as to a reference; I said if there was any objection I would not take the apartment - I refused to go in doors; no question was asked as to whether we were married - I I did not go there with her as my wife; when she had been there a month I might have said the expences were too great for me - I certainly thought so, and proposed to take another lodging; she solicited me to apprentice her to learn shoe-binding - as I intended to leave my business and go abroad, I did not wish she should he unsupported; she said if I would apprentice her to the shoe-binding she should do well, but she never would return home - she is seventeen years old; I am twenty-seven - we had two other lodgings; one in Nassau-street. Middlesex Hospital, the other in Cirencester-place, Fitzroy-square, and staid a fortnight or three weeks in one, and three weeks or a month in the other - I then, in consequence of being about to dispose of my business, and my servant having burnt a sheet, I sent her out of the house, and stated to the prisoner that she should come for a short time, which would be about a month; I charge her with taking 21l. - I gave her no part of that to buy dress; I believe there is at home in my watch-case a broken brooch which she begged I would never part with for her sake.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. I went with a warrant to No. 20, James-street, and saw the prisoner; I told her I had a warrant to search for goods brought there on Sunday evening - she said, "I am the person that brought them;" I told her she had no occasion to tell me any thing to implicate herself, for I must give in evidence what she said - she went on to say, "I am the person; I am guilty, but I hope Mr. Hodges will be merciful to me, but I am too wicked to expect it" - Stride came in about twenty minutes after me; I suppose the value of the property is 70l. or 80l.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I went with the prosecutor to his residence and found the door fast; I got in at the window, and found the house in a very disordered state.</p>
               <p>C. A. C. HODGES. She lived in my house five or six weeks; the amount of property found at her lodging is above 60l. or 70l - I had seen the tea-caddy at breakfast, and some of the things that morning; I found nothing on my bed which I slept in the night before - I did not see the money that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason I left him was, he told me about a fortnight before that he had a wife living, and was going abroad, and should leave me; I became very uneasy, and determined to quit the house - the money found upon me was my own; it was given to me to buy dresses, and as I was not very extravagant I did not spend it all; not a farthing of it is his.</p>
               <p>C. A. C. HODGES. I am married, and told her so a short time before she left; it was by mere accident that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150052"/>my being married was found out - I cannot exactly tell whether I told her of it.</p>

            , of Milk-street. The prisoner was never allowed to take silk out to dispose of and afterwards account for it; no such practice is allowed - he had been with us between a month and five weeks; we had his character from Mr. Bew, of Newgate-street - he had lived with him about two years; I am quite sure this silk is ours - the lowest value is 9l. 5s. 6d., according to the present price, which is a depression; we both occupy the house - Mr. Mills does not sleep there, but occupies it, and has a right to sleep there; we pay the rent out of the profits of the trade - he has occasionally slept there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How recently? A. Within the last six months - he has a room at his service whenever he likes to sleep there: we had a very satisfactory character with the prisoner - we never allow servants to take out silk to show their friends unless by permission; if he had taken this out and brought it back, we should have objected to cut it for him, if it was taken out without permission - our private mark, in our clerk's hand-writing, is on it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he ever given you any intimation of his intention to take it out to show? A. Not the least; his wages were from 8l. to twelve guineas a year - silk is never taken out to show to friends by persons in our employ.</p>
               <p>JURY to WILLIAM HENMAN. Q. Did you know what circumstances Mary Cole was in? A. No - she had a silk gown on, but she said she knew nothing of this transaction, and never asked him to purchase a silk gown for her; I understand her to work in the brush trade - the prisoner's parents bear a good character, but appeared in indifferent circumstances.</p>

            . On the 19th of March I was on duty - the prosecutor came and said he had been robbed of 4l. 17s., or thereabouts; I took the prisoner from his description: she was knocking at a door - I took her under a lamp, and found 1l. 10s. 7d. in her hands - she said the prosecutor gave it her, and she said so before the Magistrate; I took Adams, but found nothing on her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not ordered something for dinner, and she had been longer than you thought necessary, and you ordered her out of your house, and said she should not sleep another night there? A. I inquired the cause of her absence, and she became very violent - I desired her to produce her key, which she did; I told her to pack up her things and leave the house - I did not settle her wages, as I was not certain of the extent of her misconduct; she did not say she had made use of part of the plate, and begged me, as I had money due to her, to take it out; I think I have paid her 35s. since she has been in custody; I had engaged her at eighteen guineas a year - when she came I told her to keep a book, and put down what she bought; I paid the butcher's bills myself; I believe, for the first ten days she was there I dined at home but once, and on that day I had company; I did not hear her say she had pawned part of my plate to pay for the meat - I missed the plate before she said she had pawned it; I think a porter belonging to Gray's Inn was present before the plate was missed; this altercation took place in the kitchen, which I presume was the place where the plate was kept - I gave it into her care, and had confidence that she would keep it in a proper place.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 15th of March, I took the prisoner, and said, I had a warrant to search the house for a gold watch - I asked what part of the house she lived in; she said in the kitchen; I began to search up stairs, and I saw her secrete something in her bosom; I said, "What have you got?" she said, nothing that I should see; she pulled out a small pin-cushion, and said that was it; I still had my suspicions, and forced her down into the street, and into a coach, which I had waiting - she made great resistance, and bit me; I got the watch from her bosom in the coach, and the prosecutor claimed it; she said at the examination that she had taken it a fortnight before, and it was lying on her master's drawers.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the morning of the 11th of April I apprehended the prisoner in George-street, Chelsea; I told him he was my prisoner for robbing his master - he said he was very sorry, but part of the money he had spent, and part he had lent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You did not state what money he was accused of stealing? A. No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SPRATT. I sent him to serve the clerks at the Hospital with ale and sandwiches; I meant to call him to account the next day, but he left me - none of the clerks are here; I had entrusted him to dispose of these things, and to take the money.</p>

The men came to me for their wages, and I refused to pay them till some articles were accounted for - the goods sold amounted to 28l. 2s. 6d., and I received 24l. 8s.; the prisoner and three others were employed there - I think they were there four or five days, at 4s. a day; I desired him not to pay the men, but I think it very likely he did.</p>

Miller was in my service for about three months; I missed cigars, tobacco, and various other things on the 5th of March - I went for an officer; Avis came - we brought down Miller's box; we found some tobacco - in the bottom of it - I then accused her of it, but she strongly denied of it - I asked her if she had not that morning taken a lot of cigars out of the till, and some tobacco; she then acknowledged without any promise or threat, that she had had the cigars and tobacco in her box that morning -I had missed out of one till about four dozen of the best cigars, and various kinds of tobacco; Miller then said she had given them to Swearingem - I had seen a woman about the place, but could not exactly say that she was the person; I had seen Archer at the window, but not in the shop - Miller then said the cigars had been taken to Archer's house at Lambeth; Avis and another officer went there with me - Archer was out, but his wife and Swearingem were there; the women said they had never received any thing from Miller, and Swearingem went to run up stairs. but Avis caught her and pulled her down on the stairs - I found these tumblers and wine-glasses on the mantel-piece, and said I would swear they were mine; Archer came in while we were there - he said Miller had bought the glasses in Regent-street for 7s., and brought them there as a present; about two dozen cigars and a quarter of a pound of tobacco was found up stairs - I would not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What did Miller say she had taken the tobacco and cigars for? A. For Archer to smoke - that he had been out of employ for some time; Archer and Swearingem admitted they had received cigars from her; Archer said so as soon as he came in - I pay for Miller's sleeping with Mr. Hancock's servant next door; she told me it was her box; I think it was unlocked - the shop I occupy is under the same roof, but it is partitioned off; there is no private way from my house to the public-house - there is a door which leads to the bottom of their staircase; these glasses are my own- I have a great many cigars sometimes; I had a young lad, my wife's brother, in my shop - it was not very easy to miss a few cigars, but when I went to bed I put them away, and the next morning I went to my till, and about four dozen of the best cigars, which we sell at 4d. a piece, were missing; this was before my brother-in-law was up.</p>

They were to pay 6s. a piece - I did not know the donkey-man; they bought them not half a dozen yards from my brother's door; the officer came about twelve o'clock I went before the Magistrate, but I did not speak - I had never seen the man before; it was about half-past eight in the morning when they bought them - I am usually in service, but left my place last Saturday fortnight; I lived with Mr. Avis; the donkey had two baskets - one had the nets, and the other something-else; they came to search for Pearce's nets - they were taken out to dry, I believe; I do not know whether they were opened when they were bought - the donkey-man said they belonged to some one who was dead, and he could sell them cheap.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's niece. I was in the parlour, and saw a man in the shop - I looked up, thinking it was a customer, and he ran out with two umbrellas in his hand; I ran after him - he was running as fast as be could; they cried Stop thief! and he dropped the umbrellas; a person took them up, and gave them to me - the person who dropped them ran away, and I did not see him stopped; there were several pursuing him - I took the umbrellas and went in: I think the prisoner is the man who was in the shop, but I cannot be certain - I saw him in custody five or ten minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the back parlour? A. Yes; the shop is not very large - the door from the shop to the parlour was open; I was sitting with my face to the shop, and was working.</p>

            . I live opposite the shop. On the 24th of March I saw the prisoner go into the shop - I am sure he is the man; I saw him come out with two umbrellas on his arm, and run away with them - I was running over, and saw Stoddart when I got on the curb.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How wide is the street? A. I think about twelve yards; our house is directly opposite: I swear the prisoner is the man - I do not know that I had seen him before.</p>

I was in Back-lane, near Ratcliff-highway, and saw a great number of persons mustering; I went up, and found the prisoner, who had dropped down, surrounded by the people - I took him on the place, and brought these umbrellas; I found nothing material on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He had not the umbrella in his possession? A. No; I understood he had dropped them, but I did not see that.</p>

            . I am a coach-maker in the prosecutor's employ - I left the shop on Saturday evening, the 27th of February; the cart was then on the premises -I had not seen the coach-springs for some months; on the Sunday morning, I went there about ten o'clock, and missed the cart and springs, which were fixed to it; on the 6th of March, I was in Willow-walk: and saw the cart-springs for sale - I went into the shop, and saw the coach-springs there: I thought. perhaps the cart-springs were the prosecutor's, but I was not certain, till I saw the coach-springs, which I know, though I had not seen them for three or four months - they had been in a cupboard; Layton worked for the prosecutor as a wheeler - he used to come with his work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On the 27th of February you saw the cart safe? A. Yes, the coach-springs were not missed, till I saw them in Willow-walk; the cart springs were fixed to the cart - there was one end of them broken off; I know the coach-springs by having them in my hands, not by any mark; I cannot tell exactly when I saw them - it might be a month before Christmas; I did not say at the office that I knew them by the colour.</p>

            . I am a coach-wheelwright, and worked for the prosecutor - I know nothing of the springs; but I know Layton the wheelwright, and I believe the other is a smith. On Saturday night, the 27th, the cart was there safe - we locked it up, and carried the key to Mr. White; about a quarter-past ten o'clock the next morning, I heard the cart was gone - I went up Willow-walk and saw the cart-springs, which I knew by being broken at the end, and having a hole in them -I had seen them in the same state before, and I believe these are the springs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not that a common place for a cart-spring to break? A. They break in various places; it certainly is a common place for them to break.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And he left them there openly? A. Yes, there was no concealment about them; it is common for smith's to have iron to sell - he gave me his right address; and left part of it against the gate - he said, "I will get a truck and bring the remainder;" it is old metal, and would be worth nothing without being re-forged.</p>

               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is it the custom of the Court to pay money to any body but the plaintiff? A. No; unless the plaintiff comes to sign the book it is not customary, except by order of the Commissioners, then it may be paid to any body.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it usual for collectors or agents that are known, to receive debts? A. Never, unless by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150065"/>direction of the Court while they are sitting. The consent of the Court would appear on the books; my book is not here - when we take a stamp receipt, the book is not signed; I should pay on production of a power of attorney, but not without a legal instrument - we have no jurisdiction out of the Tower-hamlet.</p>
               <p>Q. The words "Tower-hamlet" are scratched out of this receipt - who was that done by? A. I do not know - I believe they were not struck out when it was signed; I wrote it - it is customary sometimes to write it on receipts; it denotes the jurisdiction of the Court - those words were not on the receipt at the time it was signed; it was an cmission - it is not always written; it must have been put in, I think, after the receipt was signed, because it was supposed not to be so correct - I think I put the words in after it was signed; I know I did on re-consideration - I do not know exactly when I put it in; I first observed it struck out two or three days ago - it has been in the custody of Mr. Laing, the attorney; I do not know when it was delivered to him - before he had it, it was in a drawer in the office, which the clerks had access to in office hours; I keep the key - I wrote in the words "Tower-hamlet" since the prisoner has been in custody, as I conceived it was an omission on my part before; I did not do it to injure the prisoner - sometimes it is omitted and sometimes put in; I do not know who struck it out.</p>

            . I am a broker and appraiser, and live at Brentford; I have known Plummer several years. On Monday, the 15th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour of the Halfway-house between Knightsbridge and Kensington - my horse was at the door; Mrs. Brain and lvemey were also there - while I was there the prisoner Plummer came in; he said he had taken the liberty, seeing my horse at the door, to come in and inform me of some articles he knew of for sale - he said they were the property of a gentleman who had been speculation in the funds and was ruined; that an acquaintance of his, who worked for the family, had the selling of them, and they were to be sold a great bargain, and if I would give him two guineas be would take me to where they were to be sold - he did not mention what the things were; he said they asked 10l. for them - I then left my horse at the door, and went with him to the Lamb and Flag, James-street, Oxford-street; he left me in there while he went to see if the person was at home, as he told me - he returned in three or four minutes with the prisoner Oakes; I had never seen him before - he introduced him as the person who had the selling of the things; Oakes said he had the selling of the articles - that they were the property of a gentleman who had been speculating in the funds and was ruined; that he lived in a square close by - he took me to his house, in Gee's-court, and showed me two vases and a clock; the clock had been taken to pieces; two of the glass pillars were broken, and it was in such a state I could not ascertain whether it was all there - I asked where the glass shade of the clock was; Oakes said it was kept by the gentleman, to prevent his disposing of his property being noticed, and he had put a figure of Hercules under it; he said there would be a set of mahogany chairs, and two feather beds to he disposed of by the same gentleman - we returned to the public-house, and he then asked me 10l. for the two vases and clock; I told him they were not worth it, and declined buying at that price - I hid him 5l. and went away - I returned to Knightsbridge, and had got within one hundred yards of my horse when Plummer overtook me, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150066"/>said they had been to the gentleman, who was very much in want of money, and if I would give him the two guineas I was to have the articles for the 5l. - I told him I had been considering of it, but as I was not satisfied the whole of the clock was there, I would give him 10s. then and 1l. if it turned out to be all there; we then returned to the public-house in James-street - Oakes was there; he agreed to take the money, and we went to Gee's-court; Plummer stopped behind to mind my horse, which I had taken with me to the public-house; I and Oakes went into his house, in Gee's-court - he lent me a basket and some wrappers; Plummer then came and I packed them up - I told him I must have a receipt for the money - they got a stamp and Plummer wrote the receipt for Oakes, as he said he could not write; Plummer asked him if his name was not Langston; he said Yes, and Plummer wrote that name; here is the receipt - (read) "February 15, 1830.

Oakes made the cross to it; I paid the money, and took away the articles; I put the money on the table, Oakes' wife took it up, and said he had better leave it at home, as he was going to return to the public-house - Plummer went with me to Oxford-street; I changed a sovereign, gave him 10s, and went home - I applied to Trail, a watch and clockmaker, at Brentford, to repair the clock for me, and on the Saturday I pawned the clock and vases for 6l. with Mr. Butcher; I heard nothing more till a Police-officer applied to me on Wednesday, the 24th, while I was out; I went to the Castle, at Brentford, by Butcher's direction, and met the Duke of St. Alban's steward - a gentleman who had repaired the clock, and Curtis, the officer, came in; they were the persons I expected to meet - Curtis took me into custody, and made inquiry of me; I went with him to Oxford-street - I rode my horse and Curtis drove a gig; we went to Oakes' house, in Gee's-court, and the first person we met was Plummer, at the door, just going out - that was before we had got into the house - I said,"Oh, you are the man I want," he then endeavoured to escape - I seized him, and called for the officer to come up, and gave him to the officer; we then went into the house, and found Oakes laying on the floor in a blanket - there was a female there; they were playing together, and I think he was rather in liquor - I told him I wanted him; he asked what for; I said "The clock you have sold me is stolen;" he denied having sold me a clock - Curtis came up. and I gave him in charge; Plummer was in hearing at the time - Oakes said he had never sold me a clock; we took them into custody - I went before Mr. Swabey, at Union-hall; Curtis said I was still to consider myself in custody, and the Magistrate remanded the case; I was kept in custody till the Wednesday following, when the case was proceeded in - Mr. Chambers set me at liberty, and bound me over to give evidence.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it true that you took Oakes to the Police-office? A. I took Plummer; I seized him first; I might have gone away myself if I had liked, for I was in my cart, and took Plummer in it - I considered myself with the officer, and in custody certainly; he said, I must consider myself in custody - I remained in custody a week all but a day; I have been a broker all my life - I have been in business thirteen years; there were some persons in the room at the Lamb and Flag, but not that I knew - I should think they were near enough to hear our conversation; the young man at the bar saw us together - I am not aware whether he could hear our conversation; his name is Greg - he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the conversation not to ask what the things were you were to buy? A. I deal in every kind of articles; he described them as articles which he took me to see - I did not ask what they were; I bought them to sell again, and I considered I was giving the fair value for them in their then state - the clock was repaired before I pawned it; Plummer said he had not the money, or he would purchase them himself - I have not got the account from the clock-maker for the repairs; I did not tell him where I got them - he asked me no questions on the subject; Oakes was rather tipsy when he was taken, but not to be stupified; I do not know where the Duke of St. Alban's lives.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you made no inquiry of him about the clock? A. No, he wanted 15l. on it; I have known him two years, ever since he has been in that house.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square. I know this clock and vases to be the property of the Duke of St. Alban's; I had to clean the clock for the Duke, and marked my own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150067"/>name on the dial-plate - I consider the clock worth 30l.; there is a glass top goes on it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to WILLIAM KILSBY. Q. Were the glass pillars, the chrystal underwork, perfect when you bought them? A. No - two of the pillars are broken, and the clock was all to pieces; the vases were complete - I consider the value of the vases four guineas the pair new; I have seen a pair close by, much handsomer for four guineas.</p>

            . I am a clock-maker, and live at Brentford. The works of this clock have been in my care - it was then all to pieces; in the state it was I should not think any body could ascertain whether it was perfect or not - I had it on the 15th of February to put the stand together, and set the works in a going state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you the chrystal work? A. No - I afterwards fastened it on the chrystal work; I have no idea of the value, never having seen one of the description - I never asked Kilsby where he got it.</p>

            . I was in the service of Kilsby, and accompanied him to London when the prisoners were taken - I was present when Plummer was being conveyed to Union-hall, and on the road he said he did not know what he was taken for, or what he was going upon; Kilsby told him it was about the clock - he said he did not know what clock, he had had nothing to do with any clock; and afterwards, as we were going down Regent-street, he said, "I had nothing to do with it, you know, I only recommended you - I did not know it was stolen, any more than you did; you gave me 10s., and the other one gave me a crown;" I asked him if he meant the man in the other gig - he said, "No, don't swear any man's life away, I did not say he was the man;" I said, "No, you did not say so - I only asked you if he was the man" -Kilsby, Plummer, and myself were in one cart, Curtis, his man, and Oakes in the other; there was no officer in our cart - Plummer said if it was perfect when it was put together, Kilsby was to give him 1l. more.Cross-examined.

            . I am servant at the Lamb and Flag, Oxford-street. I saw Kilsby at Martin's house - there were two others with him; I know Plummer to be one, but cannot say whether Oakes is the other - I did not hear their conversation; there were other people in the tap-room, but whether in their company I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>ROBERT CURTIS. I am an officer. In consequence of information of this robbery I went to Brentford, on the 24th of February, with Mr. Harrison, the Duke's secretary, and Mr. Smart - we went to a glass-shop, and from there to Butcher's, and found the clock and vases; I went to Kilsby - he was not at home; we went to the Castle, and Kilsby came there - I told him he must consider himself in custody; he accompanied us to Gee's-court, Oxford-street - we there found the prisoners, and took them- Oakes asked what he was apprehended for; I told him for selling a stolen clock - he said he never had a clock and never sold one, and that he was not worth 18d. in the world.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he sober? A. He was the worse for liquor, he was tipsy; there is a marine-store shop at the house in Gee's-court.</p>

I am totally innocent; I never saw the things till they were in Oakes' shop, and never had them in my possession - I met Kilsby and told him I had seen such articles for sale, and 20l. was asked for them; Oakes told me it was left at his shop for sale by some people - I was not present when it was sold, nor when Kilsby bargained for it.</p>

            . I am married, and live at No. 9, Waterloo-road. I lived in New-cut, Lambeth, on the 13th of February. I was in company with Oakes on Sunday, the 14th of February, from four o'clock in the afternoon, till half-past ten a might - I was at his wife's mother's, No. 9, Prospect-place, St. George's-fields, and took tea with her; he was there the whole time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been acquainted with him? A. Twelve years - he was in my husband's employ eight years out of that time; it was not the last eight years - he was our ostler: since that I believe he has been in the bird-fancying and brokering trade; we lived at Bath, and let out carts to fetch coals and things; he carried on the bird-fancying and brokering in Westminster-road some part of the time, and I believe he was in the same capacity in Oxford-street - I have been at his shop in Gee's-court: there is no shop of his there now; he sold birds there - I have seen birds and cages; he dealt in ironmongery, I believe, there - my husband has been dead fourteen years; since that I have lived with my father in the New-cut; he was living in Waterloo-road, and is a broker - I always understood Oakes to be married.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was at his wife's mother's? A. The wife, her mother, myself, and Oakes, those were the only persons there in the course of the evening - I believe he had dined there; he usually dines there on Sundays - I was told he had dined there; his wife's mother is not here - I have not seen her this fortnight; I believe she was well when I saw her.</p>

            . I am the last witness' husband, and Plummer's brother. On Sunday, the 14th of February, he was at my house, and on Monday morning I left him in the house, about nine o'clock, when I went out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had he lived in your house any time? A. From about the middle of December; he occupied part of my house till he could get a convenient shop - he was looking out for a shop; he had quitted business, except going to different sales - I am a broker and appraiser; he carried on the business of a green-grocer and coal-dealer, at Chelsea - my name is not over my door at present, as the house has been repaired; the name never has been there - I only went there the beginning of December; I have the lease of the house - I could not begin business there till I got my premises repaired; I do no business at home, but attend sales - I opened a shop about a fortnight back; there has been a calamitous fire opposite my house, and four people burnt to death - the children lay at my house, and my time has been taken up with them, and the gentlemen of the parish, who are making a collection for the sufferers, and I have not been able to attend to business; I have sold a few articles in my shop - I expose goods outside and inside; the house has only had one coat of paint - if I had not been waiting for the decision of the fire-office, about the paint being damaged, the name would have been over the door; the fire was last Monday fortnight - my brother and I were very good friends till five or six days previous to his leaving my house, which was on the Friday after the 15th; he had then suited himself if with a house in Thomas-street, Oxford-street - I did not know of his having an acquaintance named Oakes or Langston; I never knew my brother live in Gee's-court - I know Gee's-court; it is full of old iron and broker's shops - I do not know one in particular; I did not go before the Magistrate - I heard my brother was in custody two or three days after it happened, and went to Union-hall, to state that he was at my house, but was prevented by an officer from going in - I told him I came as a witness, and Mr. Malham, a broker, at Chelsea, was there; he is an acquaintance of both of us; he went with me to prove he knew him, and Mr. Butt, a broker, was there, merely to prove he knew him - my wife did not go; we dined by ourselves on Sunday, and my brother, his wife, and children by themselves; I dined about half-past one or two o'clock, and had a loin of roast pork, and my brother had a roast or baked leg of pork; he supported himself by disposing of some of his property till he could get a shop; he had carts and two horses, and sold one horse while with me, to a butcher at Chelsea, I believe - we had quarrelled on the Friday evening, and did not dine together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose hand-writing is that (the body of the receipt)? A. I cannot say; I have seen my brother write; I will not swear it is not his hand-writing - it is something similar to his writing; he writes very bad - if I could see the name signed I could tell whether it was his;(looking at the signature) - I cannot say whether this is his writing; it is very much blotted; the J. appearslike his, but as for any other letter I cannot say; the most I have seen of his writing was signing his name - I do not believe the body of the receipt to be his writing; the name Jouathan seems like his writing, and I believe it to be his - I never heard him mention the name of Langston.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Plummer. When I was asked to write the receipt there was another person in Oakes' shop, who I considered I was writing the receipt for.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it was his bed-room? A. He was there, and his master said in his presence that it was; he did not contradict it - Lancashire slept at my place; how the property got away I cannot tell.</p>

            . I accompanied the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner in the shop - I went up to his bedroom with him; his master pointed it out - I found these things in his box; I asked whose they were - he said they were his own; that he had the gaiters from his mother.</p>
               <p>Mr. WHITTINGHAM. I am positive these articles are mine, but cannot state when they were safe; they were never sold.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How can you tell that? A. By my books. My foreman and the boy occasionally serve; if they sold them they ought to account for them - I have no private mark on this waistcoat; I missed one - I had had three or four like it, and I know these buttons which are in the pocket.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How can you undertake to identify the buttons? A. Only from having some similar. I will not swear the waistcoat has not been sold; we sometimes sell buttons - I know the gaiters, and they are wanting in the stock; they have not been worn - I can swear to my workman's work; I believe he works for no other people.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jennings, of Newgate-market, about forty yards from Hill's. On the 17th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I went to a customer's cart with a flat of poultry, and on returning saw the prisoner coming along, carrying this flat of butter before him, which is an unusual way; I watched and saw him turn up a court into the market - I followed him, and when I got to the corner of the court he was in the act of having it lifted on his head; I asked what house or where he got that flat from - he said, what business was that of mine; I pulled it off his head, opened it, found it contained butter, and saw the dairyman's note in it, which is not usual when it is sold - I saw by that who it belonged to; I said to the boy,"Keep this man till I return" - I made haste to Hill's, and on coming back the prisoner was gone: a boy directed me down St. Martin's-le-Grand; I found him up a court<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150070"/>there with the flat of butter in his possession, and gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner in charge with the butter; he asked what I thought would be done to him - whether he should be transported or not; I said it was impossible for me to tell.(Flat produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of selling sponge about; I came to Newgate-market to sell some, and met a man who said "Old man, will you earn 6d. to carry this flat as far as the New Post-office?" - I said Yes; I met this young man, who asked me what I had there - I said it was nothing to him; the man who was rather before me then went on - this young man left me for ten minutes; I went to the Post-office - the man was not there; I staid there till the young man came up- I could have run away and left it, if I had got it dishonestly - I described the man to the officer; he said he thought he had got his companion in custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went for two sheets of paper, which are kept at different sides of the shop - I had to cross the shop to fetch the writing paper, and folded the brown paper to make a sort of portfolio to put the writing paper in, and laid it on these books while I got the money out of my purse to pay; a person came in to look at some cards, which laid by the books - I drew the paper towards me, and these pampblets with it; I was in the act of putting them back when this young man seized me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SMALES. He was not putting them back - he had gone from the counter with the books, in the brown paper in his hand; he was a yard and a half from the counter, full - he did not intimate that this was the case then.</p>

Yes, and if the prisoner had sold these goods, it would have been his duty to have entered them; I have brought the books to show there is no such entry - I told the Magistrate what I have stated to day, about finding the goods, and he said there was no occasion to state more; I saw the prisoner given to the officer - he gave no account of the goods.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOHN JOHNSON. Q. Did you hear him give any account of the property? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you do with the band? A. I did not have it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (written). On the subject of the charge on which I now appear before you, I declare most solemnly that the goods had been purchased by Mr. Root's, between one and two o'clock on the day before, who begged that I would take them home for him, as he was going to Hammersmith, and did not expect to return till late - I took the goods into my bed-room, where they remained until the Friday evening; I should have gone home on the Thursday evening, as I promised Mr. Roots, but felt myself very unwell, and, therefore, remained at Knightsbridge - had those goods been taken dishonestly, it is not very probable that I should have allowed them to have remained so many hours in a place to which nearly forty persons had as free access as myself; and had Bemand suspected me, as he says he did, there is no reason on earth why he should not have searched the room, and found the goods, many hours before, in preference to waiting until I went out in the evening. Again, when he accosted me in Piccadilly, did I not voluntarily return back with him? Is it probable that I would have done so, or that I would not have made some attempt to have got away, if I had come dishonestly by the goods? Certainly not - I knew the goods had been paid for, and therefore, I had no hesitation in returning. The reason why I did not make this statement before the Magistrate, and detail to him the way in which I became possessed of the goods, and by whom, and when they had been purchased, was by the advice of my attorney, Mr. Hart; because, he found that Bemand and Chillicombe were endeavouring to get up other charges against me; and that considerable property had been taken from my wife's residence, which these persons swore to, and that, therefore, my committal for trial was a matter of certainty. I took his advice, and made no defence.</p>

            . I am a broker, and deal in silks. I went to Sewell and Cross' ten days or a fortnight before this - I saw the prisoner, and asked for a pattern of this silk; he said there were twelve or thirteen yards of it -I said, "Put it by for a day or two, I think I know a customer for it;" I called in about ten days, bought it, and also this black silk to match a band - I left the band and all these goods which I had bought for the prisoner to bring home; I took an order from a lady in Cannon-row, Westminster; I bought this satin for trimming a bonnet- these socks are for my own children; I have the bill here, which the prisoner made - it is 4l. 17s. 5d.; I paid him a 5l. Bank note; I took the number and date at the time - it is 4,220, September 17, 1829; I paid it on the 25th of March - I said I was going to the Camden Arms, and from there to the Hand and Flower; I asked him to take them home, and he said he would if he could - we do not live far off.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Of course you told him not to involve it in any secrecy? A. I said nothing about it; I did not take them, because I was going further - this article is for Mrs. Davis, and the other for Mrs. Perkins; they very commonly give me orders to buy silks for them- I have dealt in silks twenty years; they live in our house - I do not think they are here; they are both married - this is a collar for Mrs. Davis: a number of the shopmen were present when I bought these goods, and I believe Mr. Bemand was there; I do not know whether he was behind the counter or not - the prisoner took the note, and brought me the change; he was to bring them to No. 9, Sutton-street, Soho; I am not a housekeeper now - my house is pulled down; I am lodging at No. 21, High-street, Bloomsbury - I do not keep any stock of silks; ladies employ me on commission to buy silks, and I get a profit on them - I generally call on them; Mrs. Davis had seen the pattern of this silk before - this ribbon was my own choice; I had a stock of some thousands of pounds, but I have been a bankrupt unfortunately - I did not tell the prisoner to say he could not account for having the things.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You told him to take them to your house? A. It is a common every day occurrence for me to call on ladies, to ask if they want any thing, and I give them a little accommodation; this is the pattern the lady had seen - it has been in my possession; coals, wine, and silks are often sold by persons who never have a stock of them; I did not say any thing about what the prisoner was to say - the band was Mr Perkins', and I left it with the prisoner - it has not been returned to me; I went out of town on the Friday, and did not know the prisoner was in custody.</p>

I saw the two prisoners there together; Griffiths had a basket, and when they left we missed the glasses - I went out, and came up with them about two hundred yards from the place; I saw Perrara put his hand into his coat pocket, take out one glass, and put it into the basket; I brought them back, and found these two glasses in the basket - I had seen them safe five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Griffiths' Defence. He said to this young man, "You must go back to the Bazaar;" I said, "What for?" he said, "You have something in your basket;" I said, Yes, and this young man said, "They are for patterns," but I never touched them.</p>

George - these had been in the silk-warehouse, the upper shop; they were missed about five o'clock in the evening - they are brought into the shop by day, and were very near the door about three in the day, and a young man was showing them; I think it very possible the prisoner might have come in without being observed by our men, we have so many people.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking up Holborn - a gentleman stopped me, and said, "Don't I know you? did you not work for Mr. Tate?" I said Yes; he said he had a parcel to deliver if I would take it in a coach to Union-street; I took it there, and the officer stopped me - I said I did not know what I had, but if he would walk a few yards he would find; I went and asked the lady if she knew Thomas Lackey - she said, "I know Thomas Blackey," she said, "Is he a tall dark man?" I said Yes - she said "I dare say it is all right" - I left it there; the officer came to me, and said he was not altogether satisfied - I said, "You will see the person presently."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You knew the prisoner very well? A. Yes - I treated him because he said he had no money, and he asked me to treat him; I did not know where he lived; I had been at my brother's, where I had a glass of rum and peppermint - that was about four o'clock; I had not drank any porter - I had been at Westminster that morning, but I do not believe I met any female there; I never told a man named Jones that I had been robbed of 1l. 5s. by two women at Westminster, on at any other place - I do not know a man of the name of Smith; I never said that two girls had attempted to take my money, and I thought they had robbed me of 1l. 5s.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What street was it in? A. Marylebone-street, a great thorougfare - it was half-past seven o'clock in the evening; it was getting dark - I was about twenty yards from the first person I saw running the prisoner is the man I took back to the prosecutor, and he said he was the man who robbed him; the prosecutor certainly was not sober, but he could give his evidence very well before the Magistrate, and we went before him in about a quarter of an hour - he did not at first say he had lost 1l. 5s.; he said a sovereign - I said, "Search your pockets, and see if you have it," and he did; he was satis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150076"/>fied of it himself, but I made him feel for fear he should be wrong.</p>

I have known the prisoner better than two years; she had been in town before, and my mother knew her; on the 15th of February, between one and two o'clock she came and took me to Smithfield with her - she asked for two boxes; one was standing against the door, and the other on the rails; she did not pay for them - she said she would pay when she came for the others; she said they belonged to her - I took them to my mother's house in Carlisle-place; the prisoner had got a situation at No. 23, Portland-place, and I thought it was her property - she sent me to pawn the articles produced, and I gave her the money and duplicates.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not meet him in the passage? A. Yes; I attributed his appearance to his slovenly mode of dressing - I think it is possible he might have the articles stated without my seeing them; his belt I apprehend was a very useful thing to brace himself with- it would brace the great coat; I have a wife, two children, a servant, and three single-men lodgers - there is only one door; the lodgers have separate apartments, and leave to go in and out; I was within half a yard of the prisoner when he went out.</p>

I was on duty at Kilburn at half-past two o'clock in the morning, on the 6th of April; I saw a travelling waggon - the people belonging to it said they saw a man on the road with a sack: I went on towards Windmill-hill, and met the prisoner coming down the bill, towards London; he had a bag tied across his shoulders, but no sack - I asked him if he had seen two men with a waggon; he said he had - I asked if he had seen a man with a sack; he said No: I asked if he came to the top of the hill with them - he said Yes; I said a man with a sack had left them there - I thought he was the man, and I should keep him; he then said he had a sack, and he was going to take it to his brother - I said if he would show me where it was, and go to his brother, he might; he took me to the top of Windmillhill, and showed me a sack under a hedge - I was going to untie it; he said, "Don't, I will tell you the truth - it is a hive of bees I bought of a man in the country; I am going to sell them:" I asked where his brother lived - he said in the country; I said it was very strange he should bring them from the country to London, to send to his brother in the country - I detained him, and the next day I found the prosecutor; he was about thirteen miles from the prosecutor's.</p>

I lost one hive on the 6th of April, which I had seen safe about the middle of the day before; I could not swear to the hive, but I believe it was mine, and it was delivered up to me; I had no doubt they were mine - I had seen the prisoner pass my garden; he was a stranger to me - he said it was a fine morning, and I said it was - I was busy, going to load some dung.</p>

I was called to assist the prosecutor in Whitcomb-street, at half-past two o'clock in the morning; he gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him of a watch at a house about four doors off - she denied it over and over again; I took hold of her and this watch fell on the ground - I believe it fell from her, but I did not see it fall; the glass is broken - I have seen the prisoner every night I have been on duty in the Police; that is a street which gives us a great deal of trouble - the prosecutor was sober.</p>

On the 28th of March I had the tooth-ache, went to the doctor, and had it out, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning - I then went to a public-house, under an archway in Union-street, to get something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150080"/>to drink; a woman who had been to the doctor with me was in my company - we there met the prisoner, who was a stranger; I said my husband was a German, and the prisoner said her husband was a German, and worked at Roach's; we had some gin there, then went to another house, and had some more, and to another house and had another quartern of gin - I had my tooth in my pocket; the prisoner went with me to the door of my house, and then took me to another house next door but one; I went up stairs and was sick - the prisoner was very kind to me; I was very ill - I had not drank more than two glasses of gin and peppermint - I was sitting on the stairs, and the prisoner was telling me I should be better directly; she laid hold of my hand, took my ring off as far as the knuckle, and then put her teeth to it and pulled it off - I was perfectly sensible; she did not bite my finger - I said, "Do not," and I thought she put the ring back again; but she put another ring on and took mine away - when I got to my own room I thought it was very strange for her to meddle with my ring, - I looked at my finger and found it was quite a black ring that I had on - my ring has not been found, but I believe my tooth was found in her pocket.</p>

I live in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields I sell cloths in Spitalfield's-market, and I have seen the prisoner come to look at things, but she never bought any- I always noticed that she had a brass ring on, which was very black, and I made an observation that if I was forced to wear a brass ring I would keep it bright.</p>

I called at the public-house - the prosecutrix and another woman came in; my little girl had the tooth-ache, and the prosecutrix said she had just had a tooth out - she called for some liquor, and offered me some; I did not like to take it, having a fracture in my head - she made me take some, and took the skirt of my gown, took me to another house, and called for more gin; we then went to another house, and she well knows that she asked me to escort her home - we went and knocked at Mrs. Curtis' door, and I said, "Does this woman live here?" she said No - I said, "Will you allow her to sit down?" she said Yes, and she was very ill; I then took her and sat her on the stairs - I went to look for her husband, and hearing his character, I did not like to tell him at once what situation she was in; he then went and took her up to bed.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Anderson. When he came in he was very much in liquor. Witness. I was not; I had been drinking, but had my senses about me - I do not remember having conversation with any girls at the tap-room, or calling for rum and water; the persons at the same table might have it, but I did not drink any to my recollection. I did not dance with any body - I do not know whether I asked them to dance or not; I did not say Johnson had robbed me; I said Anderson was the woman, and so she is; I did not give charge of her that night, because I was not acquainted with the law in England - the Police-officer said, "Give her in charge;" I said I would next night, and the next night I dressed myself in other clothes; I found her, and said, "I hope you made good use of the money you took last night;" she said, "What money? I am not the person who robbed you."</p>

            . I am the Policeman. I went to the Bell - the prosecutor said Anderson had robbed him - he was not drunk, but had been drinking a little; I searched her, and found only a sixpence and a few halfpence on her - he wished me to search her; he did not say she had parted with the property - I did not take charge of her till the following night; she said she did not pick his pocket, but she knew the person who did - she went with me to Limehouse, and pointed out the other two prisoners, who, she said, were concerned in the robbery; she then said she took 10s. out of his pocket, which was all he had, and divided it; that Jackson said she had 2s., and so did the other, and two others, who are not apprehended; and Anderson said she had paid 2s. for rent that night.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence. I was standing outside the door - he came and asked me if I knew Jackson and Powell; I said I did - he did not tell me what he took me for; he asked if I would give him any gin - I said I had no ginmoney; Jackson had a silk handkerchief round her neck, and he asked her to leave that for half a pint of gin; I asked him for it again at the office, and he said, it was taken out of his pocket, and a muslin one put in its place.</p>

             - they had some straw on a stack of bricks on their premises at Hammersmith; at six o'clock in the evening of the 24th of March, when I left work, I looked to see that all was correct; the prisoner was about the premises, but did not work there. On the morning of the 25th, I missed a truss of straw -I tracked it by pieces in the hedge and on the ground, to the prisoner's residence, where I found it; he was standing by it - I said it was my straw; he said, if it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150083"/>was, he would take it back: he took it back to the stack of bricks, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How much of the straw had you? A. Six loads; it was rye-straw - I had counted the trusses out of the waggon, on the bricks; I saw the straw and the prisoner at the back of the premises - I went round to the front door, and he was coming out; he said, "William, if it is yours, I will take it back" - I do not know whether he remained in the officer's custody all night; I had not sold any of the straw, nor had Mr. Cubitt - he never sells any; he wants to buy one hundred loads now - it is a very scarce article; the prisoner told me at first that he did know how it came there - when I said I was led to believe it was my master's property, he took it back, and then he said, "I will tell you how I came by it; I saw a man in the lane with a truss on his shoulder - I called to him, and he laid it down" - I had been searching in other places, but had no suspicion of him; I had not been talking about it; it was six o'clock in the morning - it was in his back premises, which are railed round, and was near the pig-stye; I had tracked it by the ears of the straw being about the hedges, but there was a little opening in the hedge, and I suspected another person, and went there - I then returned, and traced it to the prisoner; I did lose the tracing for about ten yards.</p>


               <p>JAMES COOK. I am a constable. I was sent for to take the prisoner on the 25th of March, for stealing a truss of rye-straw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not set at large? A. Yes, from Thursday till the Monday, through a respectable market-gardener, saying he would be answerable for his appearance; I have known him four or five years - he has an honest character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was set at large till the Monday morning. and then I appeared again at the Bell and Anchor; and if I had stolen it I should not have thought of appearing.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable, I took the prisoner on the 18th of March, a little before one o'clock, in coming off duty; I asked what he was doing; he said he had no place to go to - I would not allow him to sit in the street, and was taking him to the watchhouse - he said he might as well be taken first as last, for he had robbed his master of a number of hats and bonnets - I think he said thirteen, and he sold one and sent a fish home; he said he had only been out of confinement five weeks for stealing a side of bacon - he told me Mr. Curran, lived at No. 5, Rupert-street, Bermondsey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The basket being about five feet long, and I being a small person, could not see both ends; I had two hats taken out, while a person was offering me 3s. 6d. for these two hats and a bonnet; I then missed them, and absconded with the rest.</p>

             were at that meeting - Mr. Riley and I have had misunderstandings on the subject of these accounts, but not on my mode of keeping them; I did not keep them, the prisoner did - he has asked me from time to time if there has been overplusses in the account, which there sometimes has, but more frequently not; I was not accustomed to go through the items of bills received by the prisoner every night, or I should have detected many other robberies - I did not state to the Magistrate, that I went through the accounts with him every night; I saw the nominal amount and took it of him - if he had given me but 49l. and put down 50l. I should have known it; he has paid more money than he has accounted for, but more frequently less - it has appeared that there has been a larger sum in the till, than has been put in the books; it may have been so twenty times; there has been trifles over; I have consulted the prisoner about them, but I put them into my pocket; he said to me, "It is not worth while to put them down, I consider you are a loser by the surplusses whatever they are;" I never had any misunderstanding with Riley on this subject.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by stating you had no difference about the accounts, when you stated you had had misunderstanding about them? A. He suggested that if there were any surplusses or minutes they should be put down, but there was more frequently a minus than surplusses - I did not suspect the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now turn to your ledger, and see if you can find the entries of these payments? A. They are entered as goods sold, but not made paid, he ought to enter all monies that are received in the cash-book - there is one book wanting; I did not hear the prisoner complain of the want of that book before the Magistrate - I do not recollect his solicitor asking for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner call for that book by his solicitor before the Magistrate, and was not your answer that it was lost? A. Really I have no recollection of it, and I do not see how it could favour his case at all; I have no doubt he took it away - if I did state it was lost, I stated the fact, but I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it an earlier book? A. Yes - it had nothing to do with these accounts.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you any thing to do with the keeping of the ledger? A. No, the prisoner has entered these accounts in the ledger, but we never take any cash accounts from there - it is put down in the ledger in red ink, "Paid, E. Townsend," which makes the robbery the greater and the more flagrant; his entering it there is no proof of his honesty - all money received ought to be accounted for in the cash-book; this does not afford a means of conviction - he did not state to me on the evening in question, that I should find them in going through this book, and explain to me the mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not explain to you that when you were in the shop, if a customer came in you would receive the money, and give him the bill to receipt? A. No, not at that time - I always handed to him every farthing I had received in the day, before we closed our accounts at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this one of the circumstances of the misunderstanding between Mr. Riley and you? A. No, it was never mentioned - I have not paid money out of my pocket without considering where it came from; I have told the prisoner to put it down, and have accounted to him for every farthing - there has been as much as 1l. surplus of a night, but we have accounted for it next day satisfactorily; it has been some bill omitted by the prisoner - that has not often happened; there have been frequent dificiencies, but I never considered he would be so base as to rob me, they were treated as mistakes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given him a moment to enter into explanation on the subject of these three bills? A. Yes, about three weeks or a month previous to his leaving my employ, my partners were dissatisfied and particularly Mr. Riley; I spoke to the prisoner, and there were a great many bills came in; I believed him honest, and I paid 6l. 10s. out of my own pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he questioned about there particular bills? A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear he was questioned about any one of them, except on the night he came to your house? A. Yes, Mr. Riley and my brother were present. I am clear I spoke to him about these three accounts before the night he came to my house; there can be no mistake about that - these accounts were included with many others; that was not because Mr. Riley laid the whole blame of keeping the accounts to me - he never blamed me; Mr. Riley and I had no misunderstanding before the Magistrate about them; Mr. Rawlinson did not remenstrate with me on the subject of my misunderstanding with Mr. Riley - he blamed me for my neglect, in trusting too much to the prisoner; he was held to bail, but did not get bail.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does that other book relate to this case? A. No; when the prisoner received money it was his duty to enter it in the cash book.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In making my defence it will be necessary for me to state the way and manner of our keeping our accounts; he commenced by giving me a certain sum of money to which at night was added all accounts of money and bills received - it has frequently<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150085"/>happened there was a surplus over, and he would say he did not recollect, but he supposed he must have gone to the place where he kept his money and mixed it; in the course of a week or a fortnight the bill has come back receipted, and he would say that must be the bill that made the surplus on such or such a night; as it respects the dates of the bills in question that was the time the fish was had, not when the money was paid; these bills were among those surplusses - he has received money, and I have receipted the bills; he has frequently told me not to mind putting down a bill or two, as it would be found on paying the next bill - the night I was taken he asked whether I would have the kindness to come down to trim his accounts; I said certainly, and on the Monday he asked if he should see me that evening - I went; I explained many things to them - they then brought many other things against me, and I rose to go home, when they told me I was in custody; Mr. Riley had a final settlement every Monday night, and if there had been an error one night he must have discovered it on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>MR. RILEY. I did compare the ledger and cash-book on Monday evening, and that was the way this was detected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there often a surplus? A. No, my Lord. We have ascertained that he has called over a name from the cash-book which was not down; he called the bills, and I compared it with the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear the sums here charged were omitted in the cash-book? A. I cannot say that; I well remember one instance in which he did.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you not two shops? A. We have a shop in Orange-street. The prisoner set up in business between that and our other shop.</p>

            . I am footman to the Earl of Chichester. On Friday, the 26th of March, I was attending the carriage in the Park, about half-past three o'clock; Lord and Lady Chichester were in the carriage - there was a gig with a gentleman in it; I did not observe any thing till we came up to the gig; the prisoner was driving master's carriage - I cannot say he was exactly drunk, but he had had something to drink; the accident happened <placeName id="t18300415-168-crimeloc937">between Grosvenor and Stanhope-gate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know how long his Lordship had had these horses? A. Only one day; they were not very spirited; I never saw the prisoner or the horses till the day before; the gig was not going very fast, nor were our horses; about seven miles an hour I should think - I was on the box with the prisoner, and do not think he saw the gig; it appeared to me a pure accident; he did not attempt to urge the horses- there was a carriage passing on the other side, which he appeared looking at - he appeared to drive with as much care as he could; if I had thought him not capable of taking care of the horses, I should have told his Lordship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say he was not looking at the gig, but appeared to have his eyes on the carriage passing on the other side; the gig was before him, was it not? A. The gig was on his left, and the carriage on the right - the gig was on the left, but we had not passed it.</p>

I was in the carriage with my lady - I saw the gig about half the length of the carriage before me; the road is about twenty yards wide - it happened immediately opposite Stafford-gate; the impression on my mind was that the <rs id="t18300415-168-deflabel938" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe the prisoner came from Lord Cardigan's service, recommended to your Lordship? A. He was a job coachman - he had driven Lord Cardigan and Lady Chichester last summer, when Lord Cardigan was in a feeble state of health; these horses had only been out two days.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Guards. I was about thirty yards from the gig; I saw the carriage coming along regularly towards me - the gig was eight or ten yards from his Lordship's carriage when I first saw it, and it was nearly in the centre of the road; I did not perceive any irregularity in the coachman, till I heard some person give a Halloo - I suppose it was the deceased; I immediately turned my eyes, and saw the carriage and gig in contact - the gentleman fell forward towards the hind-wheel of the carriage, which went over him; I assisted in taking him up and taking him to the hospital - the prisoner remained on his box, and in lifting the gentleman up I asked where he felt most hurt - he said his ribs were broken, and he felt great pain in the body; he did not speak loud enough for the coachman to hear.</p>

I saw the carriage on the other side of the road - it was as close as possible it could be to my carriage, without touching it, within two feet - and meeting mine, not passing it, the gig was on the other side within three yards of the carriage, and before it - I saw my near-horse touch the wheel of the gig, and the near trace got over the wheel; the coachman's duty was to have pulled up - he might have gone a little nearer to the carriage, but very little; he ought to have seen the gig - it was very nearly in front of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear any shout? A. I do not remember it - there was a considerable noise; as the carriage was meeting mine, it was necessary for the coachman to be on his guard.</p>

             re-examined. I do not exactly know how many parcels I received that evening: those loaded from Wood-street were put into the boot - Moss and Hewitt assisted me in loading; I locked up the boot at Wood-street; the parcels the carriage of which are not paid are generally tied together, but whether they were on that night I cannot say; it was Moss' duty to bring the Coventry parcels to me - I kept the key of the boot, and did not leave the coach between London and Coventry, except at supper time; I kept the key of the boot - we arrived about half-past six o'clock in the morning; I saw the way-bill before I set out, but we do not take much notice of the parcels - the book-keeper at Coventry compares the way-bill with the parcels; I am not aware of any Coventry parcel leaving the coach, from the time I had the key till I got to Coventry - I do not recollect opening the boot after I left the Peacock. I believe this to be the waybill by the date of it (looking at it) - here is a parcel directed to Mr. Burton; it was the duty of Astel, the bookkeeper at Coventry, to compare the parcels with the way-bill - a porter examines it with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Does the guard do it? A. Sometimes - I cannot tell whether I did it that night; I read it very seldom - I do not recollect whether this parcel was missing that night - sometimes they do not call them over; it was missing afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you hear of it being missed? A. On the Saturday night, as I came up again, Astel said a free parcel was missing, and inquiry was made about it some days after; the boot would be opened at the Three Cups, Aldersgate-street, if they had parcels - I see by the way-bill there was one; I generally stand by the boot, and take all the care I can of it; it was not opened at the Peacock that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say that nobody but yourself opened the boot at the Three Cups, and when you received the parcel you locked it? A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

I was employed with Cox at this place; I went to the shed between six and seven o'clock in the morning, just after him - there was snow on the ground, and I saw the foot marks of two men; the heel of one looked a good deal larger than the other; I traced them to the bottom of the garden, and then they got over the wall - I did not try to trace them any farther.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the marks? A.

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is your husband? A. A carpenter, and he works for Mr. Slater, in Hackney-road - he was discharged some time ago when they were slack, but he is gone back again; I am sister-in-law to Piper - I did not look at the saw myself, but I heard them say there was the name of Hill on it. I do not know Mr. Hill, of Tottenham.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. No; I did not hear that an out-house had been broken open; I heard my brother was taken up - I now live at No. 9, Queen-street, Clerkenwell; it was three years ago he broke this saw.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WALKER re-examined. Q. Did you have the accident to break this saw? A. Yes, sawing an appletree two years ago, and I kept it back some time that Mr. Hill might not see it - it is called a lock-saw.</p>

               <p>JOHN GRAVES. I live in the same house with Medcraft in Hart-street. I received a coat from a little girl, who lives with my landlady, about the 18th of February; it was a black coat, but I never opened it - it was a close body coat; the prisoner came to my room a little before one o'clock, and asked for a black coat - I said, "There is one hangs over the chair;" he said, "I left it when you were out;" Mrs. Loveday had come in, called me Johnny, asked if it would fit me, and then I saw it was a close body coat, and too small for me - I saw that it had a bit of red tape at the top, and said "Where did it come from? it must have been hung up at some shop;" the prisoner laughed, and took it away - he gave me a bit of snuff from a box, the colour of this, and it had some drawing on it. On the 25th of February he came again in a great flurry, and asked if his boots were done; he had a great coat on then.</p>

On the 25th of February, at nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner take these beans from my barn- I was in a place adjoining to watch; he was in my service - he came into the barn, took some beans from the heap, and put them into a bag; he then went to the lower part of the yard with the bag - I waited till he came back and said, "Milton, you have stolen some beans;" he said he had not - I said, "I saw you take them, and you shall go with me;" he said, "I will go and fetch them back;" but I said, "No, that won't do, you have taken so many;" he said it was the first time - I went with him across the turnpike road, and found them under a bush.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he any horses to feed? A. Yes; he had been with me about a week- my horses had split beans, but these were not split; they were to be split in the barn.</p>

            . I live in the same house. I saw the prisoner there with some things under her cloak - she was coming from the room; I asked where she got them - she said she had been to bring them down for a friend of hers to take care of, and asked if a person named Turner lived there; there was no such person there - she said she knew she was right, because she saw the corpse lying in the house; I called the prosecutrix, who said she was a very bad woman for taking her things; the prisoner said that the door was open, she came up by mistake, and was going to get a coffin of the parish, but that was for a person at another house, not at the prosecutor's - it did appear to be a mistake.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not she knock at the door on the first floor? A. Not to my knowledge - I met her there; she did not say she came to see Mrs. Turner, whose husband was lately dead, and she found those things about, and knocked at the door to mention it; a woman, named Turner, lived very near, whose husband lay dead; I have heard so since - I do not know whether the room on the second floor was left open.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 9th of April, about twenty minutes before six o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Great Queen-street, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner with something on his arm; I said to my partner,"Come here - here is something wrong;" the prisoner was then in Little Queen-street - I went and said, "What have you got here?" - he put this copper on my head and ran off; I sprung my rattle, and my partner took him - I found this linen in the copper.</p>

Yes - I took the prisoner, but I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150101"/>lost him when he went into a house; I am quite sure he is the man - I took up two persons; it was because one jumped out of bed, and I took him - I said, "You are not the man I want, I want the other person;" he said, "There is no other person here," but I pulled off the rug and saw the prisoner with his stockings on, quite out of breath - this was in about three minutes after I lost sight of him; we took them both - the prisoner wanted to change coats with the man he called his brother; I said, "No, that is not your coat here is the white pocket hanging down."(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was in bed with my brother from eleven o'clock the night before; I was alarmed that morning by some one knocking at the door - my brother opened it; the officer came in, and said, "I think you are the person;" he then turned to the bed, saw me, and accused me because I was perspiring a little, as I am in the habit of doing.</p>

            . I was in Brydges-street, and saw the prisoner walking up Catherine-street, with two others; a gentleman desired me to look sharp after them - they were following the prosecutor and his two friends; I went on the other side, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner with this handkerchief in his hand; I desired them to wait- I went and took this handkerchief from the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. What first attracted your attention to the prisoner? A. A gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150102"/>told me he thought they were very bad characters; I never saw the prisoner before - they were walking close behind the prosecutor; the prisoner said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHMOND. This is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you used it just before? Yes - I am in the habit of carrying it in my hand, and, from the state of the evening, I am confident I must have used it within two or three minutes; it was not then in my hand, and it might possibly have dropped out of my pocket - I had had it in my hand in passing from the Sun newspaper-office; I cannot say how it left my person.</p>

I was walking up Russell-street with two young men, and found the handkerchief - it was dirty; I took it up and put it into my pocket - I went down York-street, and as I returned, the officer took me and another young man; I was above two hundred yards from the place where they say this was committed, and it is not likely I should have returned.</p>

The prosecutor came there on the 5th of April with the prisoner - he asked her what she would take; she said a glass of gin - he took a glass of porter, and they talked together; the prisoner came to my house next morning; two officers went by, and said to me, "Are you aware you have a pane of glass broken?" I said to the prisoner, "You must pay for that glass;" she said she had no money, but she would leave security, and she gave me the same watch which I gave to the officer.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 7th of March, about eleven o'clock, I heard a disturbance between them; the prisoner was calling her every name he could think of - she said very little to him; I was in the same house - I heard two distinct falls on the floor, as if somebody had fallen down, or been knocked down; I heard words between him and his wife, and just after I heard the falls, she called out for Mrs. Brown, the landlady, to come up to protect her from her husband's violence - I then heard him tell her he would be her b-y butcher, and would be hung for her at the Old Bailey; I have heard him use that expression frequently before - the last time before that, was three or four weeks before; they were so addicted to quarrelling and wrangling, I took no notice of it.</p>

             re-examined. I remember being called up by the deceased on the Sunday morning Foy mentions; the prisoner was on one side of the door and she stood on the landing - she said to me "Pray, come up and take my part, for he is going to ill-use me;" I went up, and told him I must not have that noise on Sunday, and if he could not be at peace he really must go out - he made no answer; I told her if she would come down with me he might get his temper over, and she came down - he said he would serve me the same; I do not know what he had done to her - there were no marks of bleeding or any thing then, but there were after; I was in her room when two doctors were there - I think that was the day before she died; she said she could not live, and appeared to believe she was in a dying state - the prisoner was in the next room near enough to hear what she said; I am quite sure the doors between the rooms were open - they are very small rooms; the bed-curtains were drawn aside; when the doctors came in they asked how she was; she said she had been ill-treated - that Mr. Goulding had been ill-treating her and she certainly must die from it; she said he had beat her, and she could not get over it, she was so bad - the prisoner said he had not done it; he had not beat her at all - she said, "You have knocked me down like a bullock, and if I die my death will lie on your hands;" he again said he had never touched her - she did not seem at all out of temper at this time, but quiet.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Coroner she seemed in a passion when she said this? A. Yes, she was, but she was not able to be in a very high passion; she told me before this that she thought she should not recover.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She said he had knocked her down like a bullock - did you examine her corpse? A. I helped to wash and lay her out; I saw no marks.</p>

            . I am a surgeon - I reside at the General Dispensary, Aldersgate-street. I was called in to attend the deceased; she was an out patient - I was there on the 2nd of April; she had miscarried about four hours when I saw her - I called the prisoner into the room to talk to him about the dangerous situation of his wife; I had been informed that he beat her, and asked him how he could think of beating a woman, particularly in her situation; he denied having beat her at all - I then applied to the women present whether they had not just before told me he had beat her; they made no answer - the deceased after a few seconds said, "Goulding, if I was on my death-bed, you know you are the cause of my illness - you knocked me down like a bullock;" he made no direct reply to her, but denied it to me - I was afraid from his appearance he might behave violent to her in my absence, and told him she was in a very dangerous state, and perhaps his life would depend upon her life, that she must be kept quiet, and if she died he would be hung for it; he said he could not help it, he did not beat her - since her death I have opened her body, and also examined it externally; I discovered no marks of recent injury on the outside - no blackness nor any thing of the kind; on opening her, on the left side of her body I found marks of inflammation on the membrane covering the lungs, and a slight inflammation of the upper orifice of the stomach - these were not solely the cause of her death; it was the combined effects of her miscarriage and the inflammation which produced more fever than is usual in miscarriages - there was more fever attending the inflammation and miscarriage than usual; I cannot state what produced the miscarriage, not from inspection - if I had examined the body without knowing what had been told me, I should have thought it probable that the inflammation had been the cause, but should not have known it to be so; the inflammation might have proceeded from various causes - it must have been recent; I should say within a fortnight, and very probably later than that - if it had proceeded from external violence it would not necessarily produce any external appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what in your judgment was the immediate cause of her death? A. Not any one of the symptoms I have mentioned; but the combined effect of the mis-carriage and inflammation; in a healthy person I should say not any one alone would have produced death; I think if kicks or blows had been given to knock her down, would produce inflammation - that might produce miscarriage - and the combined effect, of the two, in a weakly woman might have produced death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not these appearances have presented themselves from natural causes? A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not been afflicted with siphilis? A. She had marks of having excoriation of the bone of the head, and some marks about the shoulder, but that had been years before; she was more liable to inflammation, and must necessarily have been a bad subject, therefore not able to bear the proper treatment for inflammation - it would probably have been better if I had been called in earlier after the miscarriage; but the principal symptoms she laboured under were not miscarriage, but inflammation; I would not say she had been afflicted with siphilis.</p>

            . I lodge in the room under the prisoner. On the 1st April, I heard a dreadful lumbering over my head, and heard Mrs. Goulding scream out Murder! violently - I heard the same lumbering noise again; and she screamed Murder! again - the prisoner said to her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150105"/>get out of the room - she directly ran down stairs; he followed after her and fetched her back into the yard, and struck her on the left shoulder; I was on the stairs and saw that - he pushed her violently up against the passage wainscot; she said, "Oh! you murdering villian, you shall suffer for this" - he pushed her out of the door again; and told her if she came in again he would butcher her - I heard her scream out Murder! several times, and heard the blows down in my room several times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many people lodge in the house? A. Three other people have heard his blows as well as me; I did not interfere, nor speak to any one about it then.</p>
               <p>HENRY CRUMP. I know the prisoner and deceased were always quarrelling - but never saw any blows struck; I have lived in the house as long as them, my room is on the ground floor - I could hear them in my room; nobody could get rest for them.</p>

I went to the public-house, and saw the prisoner there; I told him to bring the box to where he took it from - he went up stairs; I followed him up to the top of the stair-case - he then took the box, flung it down stairs, and told me to take it myself and be d-d; when I went in I saw him at the bar with three men - one of them had a measure of gin in his hand; I asked him where the box was which he had brought from the General 
               <persName id="t18300415-229-person2014">Townsend</persName>
             - he said it was of no consequence to me where it was; after he came down stairs he laid hold of the box and flung it into the street - he went up and down stairs without help; I took him to the General Townsend, and I was obliged to handcuff him there- I found the direction produced, in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not ask what he had done with the box he was larking with? A. No - he said he did it for a lark; the box was locked when I found it- he was drunk, but could walk well.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were the drugs? A. At the place where they load - the carts back into that place from the street; I am quite certain this was on Sunday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150107"/>night - the place was safe at ten o'clock, and at twenty minutes after I found it open.</p>

            . I am a marshal's-man. The bag and cheque were brought to me - I went to Peacock's house in Thames-street - I apprehended Peacock in Cobourg-street, Spa-fields, and said, "Peacock, how came you to send your son with this cheque?" (the boy had been brought to his house, and described himself as his son) Peacock said he found it, and did not think there was any harm in it; before that I searched Peacock's premises - his wife was at home, but he was not - I found a skeletonkey and a common key behind a picture; I asked the servant girl to turn her pockets out - she objected to it; I said if she did not I should do it myself - I then turned them out, and found twenty-seven blank keys without wards; I afterwards went to Simpson's house, Reynold's-court, White-street, Moorfields - I found him there, and in his house I found two large skeleton-keys, a common large street door key, and two large blanks - I believe Peacock deals in drugs; he is not a locksmith - Simpson told me he has been an Excise-officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever see Peacock deal in drugs? A. No; I saw a quantity of drugs at his house - I took the servant maid in charge; she has been discharged - I never said any thing to Peacock about the keys found on her; he never denied sending the boy with the cheque - his wife directed me where to find him- I had found the keys then.</p>


               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you told his wife you wanted him about this robbery? A. No; Counsel attended before the Lord Mayor, for the servant; Peacock was present at the Mansion-house when the blank keys were produced; the servant was asked to become a witness, and declined; Peacock did not urge her to become a witness.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not stated to her that her brother was implicated? A. She was asked if she knew where her brother was, and refused to say any thing about it.</p>

I saw the premises in Thames-street locked up at eight o'clock on Saturday the 6th of March; I went there again at half-past seven on the 8th, and observed marks where they had got in on the laboratory wall, the chimney and the roof; they had entered from the College-gardens at the back of the premises - the iron chest, the desks, and places were open; the keys of the iron safe were in my desk - I had left 7l. in my desk on Saturday night; that was gone - it was 10s. in copper, three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, and the rest in silver; six bottles of Port and three of Champaigne were drank on the premises, and some had been taken away - there were the remains of bread and meat; none had been left there on Saturday night, nor had any drugs been left at the gateway, which backs into the premises; the articles found there were in different parts of the premises on Saturday night, when I left - I did not leave a lamp burning; we had no picklock-keys or crow-bars - from the appearance of the premises, I think somebody must have entered them who knew them well.</p>

            . I was a packer in the employ of Mr. Metcalf, a wholesale-druggist, in Old Fish-street. I had known Peacock about three months before the 10th of March; I became acquainted with him by his putting himself in my way several times in the street, and asking me to rob my employers; this was eight or ten times perhaps - he knew who my employers were, because he met me in Old Fish-street; I went into a public-house at the corner of Sermon-lane with a friend - he followed me in, and wished to pay for the liquor; he followed me several times early of a morning - he wished me to steal saffron, scammonia, opium, cochineal, and isinglass, which are the things wholesale druggists deal in; he said he would give me 10s. a lb. for saffron and scammonia, 4s. for cochineal and isinglass, and 8s. for opium - I do not know what these things sell at regularly; I told him I would have nothing at all to do with it - he said if I would bring him a handfull of goods, he did not care what it was, so that it was drugs, he would give me 5l. for it; he said if I would not do any thing myself perhaps I could recommend him men, and he would give me a guinea a head, if I could recommend him any men or bring men into his company that were in the drug employ. On Saturday, the 6th of March, near eight o'clock, I saw him as I came into Great Knight Rider-street; he stopped me - he was alone; there were three other persons in sight, about ten yards from us; Peacock came up to me, and said in a low tone, that he had a job to do - I told him I wanted no job, I was too tired, and was going home; he said,"Down at a house," and pointed down Great Knightrider-street; he said it is a house down there - he pointed towards Ellis' premises, and then said, "If you ever divulge a word I have spoken to you I will take your life; if I am not at large there is plenty of others, for we are one hundred in a gang," he then left me; I saw him join in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150108"/>company with three others; Tanner and Simpson were two of them - I did not know the other man; I could swear to him if I saw him - Tanner is my brother-in-law; I heard Peacock mention the name of Ellis to the three others - I then saw Simpson take a parcel out of his pocket, which he gave to the unknown person; I then saw him take a parcel out of his hat and give it to the same person - the first parcel I thought was keys by the rattle of them; papers or something dropped on the ground when he gave them out - I did not observe any thing with the second parcel; I then saw the whole four go down Knight Rider-street into College-square - I was not more than fifteen yards from them all the time; when they went through College-square they went into Garden-court - I then saw all four join together at the gate which goes into Doctors' - commons garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they separated? A. They went one after the other - the gate was fastened; I saw Tanner with his head through the railing of the gate, as if giving directions which way they were to go; he was pointing to the back of Ellis' premises - the gate is solid three feet and a half high, then there are railings to the top wide enough to put an arm through; Tanner then left the other prisoners, and walked quite through the square - I then saw Peacock, Simpson, and the other pass through the gardens belonging to Doctors'-commons; I saw them get over the garden gate - Tanner turned through the archway or court to his right, as if going through College-square; I then saw Peacock, Simpson and the unknown person get on the top of the laboratory wall of the premises, and saw one of the three get from the roof of the laboratory to the roof of the warehouse; in about two minutes after I saw Peacock and another, who I could not distinguish, walk to the door going into the laboratory from the roof - the laboratory door comes on the roof; I then saw two persons enter the premises - Peacock was one; I cannot swear which of the others was with him - I saw nothing more that evening; I saw nobody engaged about it but these four - if there had been others I think I must have seen them; next day,(Sabbath evening, the 7th of March,) between seven and eight o'clock, Tanner came to my lodgings very much intoxicated - I was not at home, but found him there just at nine o'clock when I came home; he had on his working dress, and smelt very strong of wine, and there was a very strong smell of otto of roses about him - I put his head to my nose; when I saw the state of intoxication he was in I pushed him out of the house - I put several questions to him how he got so intoxicated on the Sabbath day, but could get no answer whatever; I saw a bottle on my table with a very little wine in it - I saw him pour out the last of it, which was about one-third of a glass; I had left home about half-past five o'clock that evening, and left no wine there; I turned him out about half-past nine or near ten o'clock - he had his apron on and was in his working dress; he always used to be clean on a Sunday - I gave orders to my wife before he left, to watch where he was going; I saw a glass on my table which was not mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were quite shocked at seeing him intoxicated on the Sabbath? A. Yes; the first time I ever met him was in the street, close to our warehouse; he spoke to me first; I went that day to a public-house with a friend, and he followed me and asked to pay for the liquor - I did not go with him; my friend's name is Poole - he is not here; we refused to let him pay - that was the first time I ever saw him; I had no conversation with him before that - I refused to let him join our company; I told him I knew nothing about him - we quitted the house first; I left him without further conversation - I met him next, I should think, in about a fortnight - I cannot say to a day; it was in Knight Rider-street - he followed me as I was going along, and put his hand on my shoulder; he wished me to rob my employer, and told me I could make my fortune by four or five times coming out; that was the first thing he said to me - he asked if I could get any thing; those were his words - he knew where I was employed, for he had followed me several times before he spoke to me; he followed me to the corner of the warehouse, in Old Fish-street - I was never at more than one public-house with him, nor in that except once; I have drank while he was in the room, but never with him - when he asked me to rob my employer I told him I did not know him, and did not know any thing about it - that I set too much value by my situation to do any thing of the kind; he then followed me out, saying what a foolish fellow I was - I told him I would have nothing to do with him, and if he followed and spoke to me again I would give him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in Gloucestershire? A. I have been through it - I lived there seven or eight years ago, but have been through it several times since that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet the prisoner again - you have spoken of two interviews? A. He met me the same week - he spoke first then, and communicated to me the same as before - I told him I would give him in charge; I did not - I left him; I met him again a few days after, at the top of the steps of St. Ann's, Blackfriars, in the street - he asked if I was not going to do any thing for myself; I told him I would do nothing of the kind and he left - he was not with me a moment; he put himself in my way pretty well every time coming and going, and asked me every time to rob my employers - I always refused - I never gave him in custody; I was at Tetbury, in Gloucestershire - it is a market-town; I do not think hay is sold there - I did not leave there for any thing; I left of my own free will, in 1820 - I was not there in 1823; I have been there once since 1820, to my father's funeral - there was never the least charge made against me there, nor in any part of Gloucestershire; never in my life - I never knocked a constable down there; I was never in custody till I was taken for this - I was never charged with stealing hay in Gloucestershire, nor any where; I lived at Chelsea for about a year and three-quarters, in the employ of Mr. Field, a grocer - I left him of my own accord, because he declined business; the conversation about the price Peacock said he would give me was in Knight Rider-street; he spoke very fast, as fast as he could repeat the words, but I remember the prices he said - I have been in the drug trade a long time; I am not at all mistaken in the prices - I did not tell the Magistrate the prices, nor about his having a gang of one hundred - I never mentioned it before now; I was not asked the question, nor was I to-day - I recollected it all along; I was not taken up on this charge, but on a charge of Metcalf and Co,'s,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150109"/>my employers did not take me up - the officer took me by mistake from there being two Georges; Tanner had been in Messrs. Metcalf's employ in consequence of my being ill - I was in custody for a week, but not on this charge; Metcalf and Co. were robbed the same night I believe - at least on Monday the premises were found robbed; the gentleman sitting by you attended as my attorney in Metcalf's robbery, but not for Ellis' - I swear that before his face; the officer took me by mistake on suspicion of Metcalf's robbery - there being no evidence against me I was discharged; I swear I never was charged with robbing Ellis and Co.; I did not mention about Peacock's offering me a guinea a head till now, or 5l. for a handfull of drugs; he said he would give me 5l. for any thing so that it was a drug - my wife was not before the Magistrate that I am aware of - I have not conversed with her on the evidence I was to give, or that she was to give, not in the least; I said a word or two to her on the Sunday evening when she came back; that is the only time I spoke to her on the subject - we came here together to-day, but did not say a word about what we were coming about; I have been living with her since the 7th of March, but I never spoke a word to her about it since - we both went before the Grand Jury, but I said nothing to her about it; I have been waiting here, but have said nothing to her about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Give us the name of the first public-house you were in together? A. I think it is the Fleece - it is at the bottom of Sermon-lane, and I saw him at the King's Arms, at the corner of Earl-street; he was not in company with me, nor did I speak to him there - Tanner married my sister; I was ill, and paid him to do my work at Metcalf's, and he has been there for a morning or two when I could attend to take orders - he was there working for me at the time of this robbery; Mr. Metcalf did not hire him, I did - I went to work on the Monday, and he was there; I had seen him in company with this party, but did not see him go over the wall; he was within two yards of them when the keys rattled in the parcel - I did not at that time know where the back of Ellis' premises were; I could not tell what they were going about - I heard of Ellis' robbery on the Monday morning, but did not go and inform them what I had seen, for I no sooner heard of it than I was taken into custody by Herdsfield; he had been told to take care of George - George was called, I came down, and he took me instead of Tanner; Mr. Wheatley, Mr. Ellis' clerk, had told me of the robbery not a moment before I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you heard them mention the name of Ellis, and saw them go over the roof of the laboratory, do you mean to swear you did not know they were going to commit a robbery? A. I did not know where Ellis' back premises were; I could not tell what they were going about - I did not inform a watchman; I was threatened of my life, and seeing one of the party depart from the others, as he told me there was one hundred in the gang, I did not know but what I might be packed off - that was my only reason; I could not tell what they were going about, seeing them on the roof, and going up against the chimney stacks; I knew it was not right, but could not tell what it was for - I could not tell what house they were going to; I could not tell what they were going about.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The first time he saw you was at a public-house, he found you did not sit down, but he attempted to join you? A. That is right - I think he told me the price he would give the third time I saw him- I constantly refused his proposal; I met him accident-ally on the 6th of March - he told me he had got a job to do, and pointed down the street; that is all he communicated to me; Mr. Wooller attended as my attorney before the Magistrate - I was not asked any thing before the Magistrate - I was not asked to give evidence; I was told by Mr. Wooller that I had no business to give evidence - he walked with me three times, and told me so; I was then discharged - Mr. Wooller told me I had no occasion to give evidence. I was sure to be discharged; I was going to give evidence at that time - I went immediately to Mr. Ellis, and stated what I knew; I went on the Monday - I was discharged, I think, on the Saturday; I was afterwards brought up as a witness, and my examination began with the transactions of the Sunday; nothing was asked about previous transactions, or my being desired to rob Mr. Metcalf; what I said was read over to me, and I signed it - I never agreed to rob any body, or to be privy to a robbery; I was never before any Justice on a criminal charge, or taken up on one.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS re-examined. The fair price of scammonia at that time was from 18s. to 20s. a pound, saffron about 33s., opium 20s., isinglass from 11s. 6d. to 18s., and cochineal from 10s. 3d. to 11s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would any of these drugs come to 5l. for a handfull? A. I have held 5l. worth of scammonia in my hand, but certainly not so much as I could close in my hand; there are many drugs I might take 25l. worth of in my hand - 5l. for a handfull of any drug is certainly a monstrous proposition.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Should you not think such a proposal had something else in view, than obtaining the drugs? A. Certainly I should.</p>

            . White was not before the Alderman on suspicion of robbing Mr. Ellis; I apprehended him on my own account, having heard he knew Peacock - I did not know he had any thing to do with it at all; I cannot say he was suspected - I apprehended him, thinking he knew something about the robbery, and told him so, but did not tell him what robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Had you received instructions to apprehend him? A. Not at all; there had been a robbery the same night or the next, and I thought that through White I might get information.</p>

            's wife. I have known Tanner almost five years - he is my brother-in-law; he has been out of regular employ upwards of two years - I saw him on Sunday evening, the 7th of March, a few minutes before eight o'clock; he came to our house in his working dress, very much intoxicated - (my husband was out); he smelt very beautiful of otto of roses, and he smelt of wine - his wife was in the room; I saw him with as much copper money as he could hold in his hands - he put it into different pockets; he took out a key and a small scent-box, washed inside with gilt, and told his wife it was a strayed key he had picked up in the warehouse; he took a wine-glass out of his pocket, and winked at his wife; he asked if I would take any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150110"/>thing to drink - I said No; he said would not I take any wine, as he had got a bottle in preserve - his wife said where could he have a bottle of wine in preserve; he said,"I have got a bottle in preserve at the top of a wall, I will fetch it in five minutes" - I live at No. 9, Printing-house lane, Blackfriars, which is a very little way from Doctors'-commons; he went out for the bottle - I followed him by his wife's request; I followed him to Knight Rider-street, and in the way there he took out a handfull of silver and counted it - I could tell by the jink that there was large money, like half-crowns; I judge so - I saw him go through into College-square, and into Gardencourt - I saw him turn to the right in Garden-court, and then lost sight of him; I did not go out of Knight Rider-street - I returned home, and he returned in a short time, about five minutes, with a bottle of port wine; he drew the cork, took the first glass, and said, "Well, here is to old

             and Langdon's good health" - I never before saw him in his working dress on the Sabbath-day; he was sick before he took the wine, and afterwards also - what he vomited smelt very much of wine; he nodded to his wife, winked, and said, "It will be all right, it will be all right, and there is another concern going to be done to-night, but where it is I shall not say;" my husband came home about nine o'clock - I told him what I had seen; Tanner and his wife went away - in consequence of what my husband said, I went to Knight Rider-street, where I had seen Tanner go, but observed nothing there; I went down Bennett's-hill into Thames-street, to the sugar-house at the corner of Castle-street; I stood there, and had a clear view of Mr. Ellis premises - while there I observed a man go to Mr. Ellis' cellar-door, make a chirruping noise with his mouth, and knock three times with his hand on the cellar door; the door was then opened to him, and a parcel given out - the cellar door was shut again; he took it down Thames-street - I could not distinguish his features, and do not know his dress; I then went over to the cellar door, gave the same signal, and the cellar door was opened by the prisoner Peacock inside - I said, "Won't you give me a parcel to take away?" he said, "Who is this? who is this?" I said, "It is me, won't you give me one to take away?" and he shut the door in my face; they are two folding doors, which open inwards - I had seen Peacock several times before, and am certain of him; I walked a few yards from the cellar, then saw a man closely pursue me, and run - he ran after me, but did not overtake me; I got into my own house, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you knew Peacock's person perfectly well? A. Yes, I knew his features very well; my husband has pointed him out to me in the street, and told me he was the man that wished him to rob his employers - I did not go before a Magistrate and state this; my husband was in custody one week - my husband was not at home when Tanner drank to Ellis; I have told him of it since - perhaps I have told him ten times; I cannot say how often, but I have told him of it - I may have rerepeated it to him several times; we have several times talked over the subject of this robbery - I walked with him to go before the Grand Jury, and dare say we talked of it, but I cannot say; I have frequently talked about it -I went to him in prison, but could not speak to him in private; I have spoke to him about the robbery many times since - I have not been subpoenaed here; I came of my own accord - I came with my husband, but did not mention a word about the evidence I was to give, nor as we went before the Grand Jury - I have undoubtedly mentioned it to him several times since he left prison; he said he was innocent of robbing Mr. Metcalf, and I have spoken to him about this robbery - it was by his desire I went to watch Ellis' premises; he told me to go round them, for he was afraid there was something going on - when I returned I told him I was fearful of his life, and would not let him go out; I knew his life had been threatened - I did not go to tell Mr. Ellis of this next morning; I told my husband that night that Peacock had been in Ellis' cellar giving a parcel out, and he wanted to go out - I would not let him; he went to his employ in the morning as usual - when I returned from looking at Ellis' premises Tanner and his wife were both gone; I told nobody of what I had seen except my husband - I afterwards mentioned it to others: I cannot say when - I cannot tell why I did not go to Mr. Ellis' while my husband was in custody - I knew the prisoners were in custody, but not on the same account; I knew what Peacock was taken for - I was too much agitated to go and tell Mr. Ellis; I cannot say when I mentioned it - I would not swear a lie for the world; I went and told it voluntarily at last - I do not recollect my husband asking me to go; he might - to the best of my knowledge he did; my husband desired me to say the truth - nothing else; I cannot say whether he desired me to go to tell Mr. Ellis - I let him know I was going; I did not tell Mr. Ellis of it myself, but you are enough to make one say any thing - I cannot say who I mentioned it to after my husband; it was in Blackfriars-road at a house, at the solicitor's; I was taken there by a gentleman - Tanner cannot hear well without a trumpet, unless we shout; I was very much frightened that night, but not so much when I went to the cellar door as when I returned - I was fearful something was wrong, but my husband would not tell me what; I could tell by the jingle of the money that it was large - I was a little further from him than I am now; the street was very quiet, and I could hear.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there a soul in the street besides your husband and yourself? A. No; my husband had an attorney - he did not advise me to go before the Magistrate: I employed him myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband ever tell you what you were to say, or say you must say this, or you must say so? A. Never; he never told me what to say - Mr. Ellis' clerk took me to the attorney, who took down what I stated; neither of them told me what to say - not a word; I have not the least malice towards the prisoners - nothing has been promised me for giving evidence; I was agitated when I went out and went to the cellar that night, but more so when I saw a man running after me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any other lodger? A. No -Tanner had a key of the street door, and could let himself in after we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Peacock's Defence (written). I have witnesses to prove I was not in the neighbourhood at the time, and under circumstances which render it impossible for me to be a party, as White wishes you to believe - the robbery was committed on Saturday night, between seven and eight o'clock; I can prove I was at a public-house, went home, and remained at home all night - the robbery was not discovered till Sunday night; I can prove I was at home all that evening too, and nobody pretends to have seen me about the premises on Sunday, except White, who is utterly uncorroborated - it is true I had the cheque in my possession, and gave it to my son to get paid, which was wrong; but I was in pecuniary difficulties, and had an execution in my house for King's taxes - my furniture was about to be sold; when I found the cheque by St. Bennett's church the temptation was too great to resist; I gave it to my son, which I admitted at once, and when I heard he was in custody I gave myself up without hesitation - it is not likely, if concerned in the robbery, I should have sent my son with the cheque.</p>

               <p>Simpson's Defence. I content myself with declaring my perfect innocence; as to White, I declare solemnly I never saw him till the Tuesday we were under examination, when he was one of the accused; I trust you will pause before you return a verdict to banish me from this country, and leave a wife and six children destitute.</p>

            . I am Mr. Whitehead's (the broker) assistant, and live in Philip-lane, London-wall. In March last I was in possession at Peacock's house for, I think, eighteen days - I had my meals with the family; he tead with with me on Saturday evening. the 6th of March - it was from six to eight o'clock; I will not say within half an hour - his wife was with him, and I smoked a pipe; he went out after tea - that might be about eight or nine - I will not say within an hour; he came home about ten or eleven o'clock - I saw him go to his bed-room; I sat up in a chair in the middle room, which he must go through - I saw him, I think, from six to eight in the morning; I saw him on Sunday evening about dusk, I suppose between six and seven o'clock; he went out again, and came home I suppose about eleven or twelve, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you say you drank tea from six to eight o'clock, do you mean that you were two hours at tea, or that some time between those hours you were at tea? A. We went to tea about dusk - he was at the table for a good hour; I think we had a candle when we began tea, but I will not say; we were in a first floor room in Thames-street - here is my distress-warrant: there are two warrants - I was in possession six days on the first warrant; we had a consent not to distrain from day to day - he was to pay the expenses, and let the warrant stand; he signs his name to the consent - my master has got that; there were two or three consents - I did not go out before I received the second warrant; they were both for King's taxes; here is the stamped inventory - it is not a list of goods, but it is stamped; the list of goods on the premises is with the consent - this stamped paper is the condemnation.</p>
               <p>The warrants were here read; one was for 5l. 11s. 4 1/2d. taxes, due at Michaclmas, dated the 19th of February; the other dated the 8th of March, for 2l. 15s. 8 1/4d.</p>

            . I charge 2s. 6d. a day for remaining in possession from the 19th of February to the 18th of March, when the second warrant came; I received the money by distraining - there were sufficient goods on the premises; I think it is dusk in Thames-street from six to half-past six o'clock, on the 6th of March, and for a full hour after that I am sure the prisoner was there - after that I do not know what became of him, till he came in again, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning - I saw him again on Sunday evening, about seven or eight; it might be six, I will not say: perhaps it was five - and about half-past eight, on Monday morning, he had a cup of tea with me; about seven or eight, or half-past - I did not see him send his boy to the bankers, or hear any thing of his having picked up a cheque - I saw him send his boy out to school, about half-past eight or nine o'clock; the officer brought him back about ten - I cannot recollect whether any body came to tea on Saturday; I saw no skeleton keys about the premises.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you are in possession, people seldom entertain much company? A. No; I could have taken the goods away at any time.</p>

            . I have the management of the Sun and Last public-house, Newgate-market; I have known Peacock nine years. I saw him at our house on Saturday evening the 6th of March - he came after eight o'clock; I served him with a glass of gin; I do not know when he left.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How much after eight o'clock was it? A. Not exceeding half an hour - I know it was after eight; it might be half-past eight when I served him- I remember it, because the book binders always come in every Saturday; I have no particular reason for saying it was on the 6th of March, further than applying to Mr. Harmer to know what I was subpoenaed for; I know it was the 6th of March from my subpoenae - the person, who subpoenaed me, mentioned the 6th of March, and I know it by going to the Times newspaper, which I had.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The Times did not tell you when you served a man with gin? A. I looked about to see when he was taken before the Lord Mayor - I cannot recollect when he was before the Lord Mayor, but I served him with a glass of gin on the 6th of March, and served him another on Sunday morning, between eight and nine o'clock - I am quite positive I served him between eight and nine on Sunday morning, with a glass of gin: and, between seven and eight on the Monday morning, I served him with a glass of beer; he said nothing of having found a cheque - his little boy was not with him; I can run from my house to Doctors' - commons in three minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On the Saturday night did he appear to have been running? A. No; it might be more or less than half-past eight o'clock that night when I served him - he lives about a quarter of a mile from me; Jones was in my tap-room.</p>

            . I generally attend at Ower's to serve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150112"/>the customers in the tap-room - I saw Peacock there on Saturday, the 6th of March, from eight till ten, very near; my master or mistress served him with the gin - my business is in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Will you swear he was at your house as early as eight o'clock? A. Yes - I cannot exactly say, because we have no clock in the house; I will swear he was there at half-past eight - I go from eight to ten o'clock; I will swear he was there earlier than half-past eight - a few minutes before I am certain; I will swear to five minutes - I heard the quarters of the clock in Newgate-market strike; I swear that before the clock climed a quarter-past eight he was in the house.</p>


               <p>Q. Why then did you say you would not swear he was there more than five minutes before the half-hour? A. I am certain he was in the house smoking his pipe before the chimes went a quarter-past eight o'clock, but you bother me so - I was a good deal engaged; the house was pretty full; I cannot tell at what time other customers came, but he was in the habit of using the house - the book binders come about half-past seven and stop till near twelve o'clock; the prisoner dropped in at all times - I remember it was the 6th of March, as I had made an appointment with three or four friends to go and hear Crawley preach in Newgate-market on the Sunday morning, that makes me recollect it so well; I left about half-past six o'clock in the morning, to hear Crawley hold forth, and when I came back about half-past eight, I saw Peacock, and I saw him on Monday morning at eight exactly, taking a glass of porter - I did not see his son; he said nothing about finding a cheque.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did he leave your house on Saturday night? A. Just before the hour of ten, for I heard the chimes go - I swear that a few minutes before ten he left the house, because I heard the chimes so plain; the clock is very near.</p>
               <p>Q. The chimes go every quarter, what enabled you to mark the time he left? A. He is a person I am particularly acquainted with, and he wishes me good evening when he goes, and he never stays out late - I heard the chimes strike some few minutes before ten; I heard the chimes first, and then the clock struck ten - he left a few minutes before ten; I cannot say whether I heard it strike nine - there was a good deal of company from seven to twelve o'clock; I was serving them - I was standing against the front window when I heard the clock - I was taking some porter to the bookbinders at the window; the later it gets I am the more bothered with customers, because they want more drink, but I am convinced I saw him there just before ten o'clock, smoking his pipe in the bar, about half-past nine or thereabout, when I went backwards and forwards to the bar - a great many people stand in front of the bar; you are obliged to pass through them; the clock is about forty yards from the house.</p>

            . I am an officer. These two women were quarrelling, and the prisoner gave the witness into custody; I examined them, and took them into the office - the witness stated what she has now; I asked the prisoner where she lived - she said no where, and would not tell us any thing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had come to London with the prosecutrix, who had been assisted by the different parishes on the road, and denied that they had any bundles with them to lose.</p>

            . I heard an alarm and went up - the prosecutor said he had been robbed, and would not leave the house till he got his watch; I went in - Clarkson was not to be found, but the landlord said he would send his daughter to a house where she could most likely be found; I went backwards - Clarkson was going up stairs, and I took her; she denied having it at all - I was going to search her; she produced it from her shawl, with this diamond.</p>

            . I was on duty near the Yorkshire Stingo; I heard the rattle and sprang across the road - I caught the prisoner running from the prosecutor, and about eight yards in front of him; the prosecutor accused him of robbing him of his purse, but did not say what the contents of it were - he said, "I think he has flung it away," and pointed about eight yards from the place; I went there, looked, and picked up this purse - the prisoner said, "What do you catch hold of me for? I have done nothing;" I said, "What did you run for?" this is the purse.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I beg to state that I had been to look at some goods at Mr. Flint's, being a broker and appraiser - on my return down the New-road I met a female and stood talking with her; I heard a cry of Stop him! but before that the female had told me she was the wife of a soldier, and seeing a soldier running I thought she was his wife - I ran down Chapel-street, and the Policeman crossed and took me into custody, but he never saw the soldier till he took me down Lisson-street; the soldier said, "Is that him?" - Yes, said the Policeman; the soldier was groping about and said,"Here is a purse he robbed me of" - I believe it never was out of his possession; I did not know where the Stingo was, and have not been near it - I was taken to the watch-house; the soldier was reeling about - I said,"That soldier is quite drunk, he can't charge me with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150116"/>robbing him;" he said he had only had a little drop - before the Magistrate he said I had been at the Stingo and had taken him home; I should not have had a witness on my behalf had not the Magistrate issued a warrant.</p>
               <p>COURT to HAINSWORTH. Q. Did you see any other person running? A. No, only the soldier and the prisoner; the soldier could not run as well as I could, but he dropped his cap in Lisson-street.</p>

I was in the parlour, smoking a pipe with two or three coachmen, when the corporal came in with two soldiers of another regiment; it was near eleven o'clock at night - the parlour door was pushed open, and they came in and had two pots of ale; they had something at the bar, but I do not know what - I heard them say so; the corporal was very much intoxicated, and one of the other soldiers was drunk - the other was sober; the corporal had his purse out throwing about the table - the landlord advised him to put it into his pocket; he threw it about and wanted change for a 10l. note - the landlord said he had better not have change; I took up his cap which was on the table, and put it on - one of the soldiers said that was a fine of half a gallon of ale; I said I would stand a quartern of gin - the corporal then said he had lost a handkerchief; the landlord said, "How can that be when you have it in your hand?" - the prisoner was not there at all; the landlord advised the corporal not to have any more - there was a stranger there, taller than the prisoner.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The stranger had seen the bulky purse as well as you? A. Yes: the prosecutor was very drunk; he had very near knocked a person down - he might make a stumbling run; from the careless manner in which he acted in my parlour I do not think he knew what he was about: the last I saw of his purse was in his hand - he pulled it out of one of his pockets at the bar, but I cannot say what pocket; the bar is narrow: I and the soldiers persuaded him to put it away, but he knocked the soldiers about; I believe they were glad to get away: I had never seen the stranger before; there were four persons besides the soldiers.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and was in the Yorkshire Stingo on the night in question; I saw the prosecutor and two other soldiers, but I suppose by their dress they were not of the same regiment: a friend and I were sitting smoking; the door burst open, and they all came in - nothing but the table prevented them all going down; the corporal was drunk - he sat down on the table, and took off his cap; Davey put it on, and one of the soldiers said, "It is a rule among us soldiers, that that is a fine of half a gallon of ale;" he said, "I can't stand half a gallon of ale, I will give a quartern of gin;" he gave the cap back, and then the corporal said he had lost his handkerchief out of it; the landlord said, "You have it in your hand;" the other soldier then said he should fine him a quartern of gin for accusing him of it: the prosecutor had his purse in his hand, got a fork, and opened it, and wanted change for a 10l. note, which the landlord would not give him; there was a person came in, and called for a glass of gin and water, who sat at the next table to them - he drank part of it, went out, and did not return; I did not see the prisoner in the house at all- there was but one person besides the soldiers, who were strangers to me.</p>

I did not hear of this till the next day.</p>

In Lisson-street; the man who was talking to the woman was on the right-hand side - he left the woman and ran; the soldier was shuffling, I could not call it a run - the man who was with the woman ran; he ran from the soldier - I could not give any reason for that; I do not know who the man with the woman was - I heard the soldier say Stop him! and I could have stopped the man who ran past me, but I thought it was a drunken frolic, and I went home; the man who ran past me was a tall man I should say - the soldier was pursuing him, then he crossed the road, and pursued the other; I did not see any Policeman.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and live at Paddington. On Thursday last I saw the prosecutor, as I was standing against the door of the Stingo, smoking a pipe; he accused me of being one of the prisoner's accomplices in the theft - I was at the Yorkshire Stingo on the night in question; I am well known there - it was between seven and eight o'clock last Thursday evening when the prosecutor came to me with the Policeman; the prosecutor appeared to me as drunk as any person could be, and so was the Policeman - they were not fit to walk; the Policeman had a sealing-wax pipe in his mouth, and I said it was fine times for a Policeman to have a sealingwax pipe - I said if he was not quiet I would give charge of him to another officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What coach do you drive? A. I was driving a coach, but am out of work - I now wash coaches for a gentleman who has an omnibus; it is six or seven months since I drove a coach - I was in service seven years ago, but my master is in France; I did drive for a Mr. Trivett six or seven months ago - I used to drive odd journies: coachmen would not get so drunk as the prosecutor and the Policeman were - I was at the Stingo that very night; the prosecutor was very drunk - I did not help him home: it is the worst thing in the world to help people home who are in liquor - he could not run; he could shuffle along.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Policeman who took me to the soldier was full fifty yards off me.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HAINSWORTH. The prosecutor was about eight yards behind him. GUILTY.</p>
               <p>The indictment further stated that the prisoner had previously been convicted of felony.</p>

            . I am one of the City night-patrol. I produce the copy of the conviction of the prisoner - I was a witness on the trial and know he is the man - (read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Since I have been convicted has it not been clearly understood who the persons were who committed the robbery? A. No, not by me, I certainly never had an idea that you were not the person, and never said any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have been unjustly convicted in one instance and am sacrificed in another - he has been with the people every day. Witness. I merely waited expecting the cause to be called.</p>

On the 13th of February I went to West-ham, when the two prisoners went with the carts - the horses had nose-bags on their heads at Old Ford; that was the last I saw of them; they were then taken off, and tied on the shafts - the corn was very nearly all consumed then; there were three nosebags then - I afterwards missed two bags, and when I got to Dalston-lane I missed Bishop; I stopped the team, and rode back, but could see nothing of him - I went home, and heard that the prisoners were at the watch-house; these are the bags.</p>

            . I am a solicitor and vestry clerk, of Hackney. On the 13th of February I was returning home, down Dalston-lane - I had passed Ambrose's house about thirty yards, when I saw Bishop adjusting his nose-bag full of turnips at the back of his cart- my suspicions were excited, and I walked to within ten yards of Ambrose's house, where there is a sharp angle; I saw Wood carrying into Ambrose's house another nose-bag of turnips; I walked in through the house, into the bake-house, and saw both the prisoners there - Bishop had shot his bag of turnips, and Wood shot his; I said they must put them into the bags again, and go to the watch-house, which they did, after some hesitation - I saw a large quantity of turnips under a dresser there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did they say any thing to you? A. They said they had gleaned them off the land, but did not say where.</p>
               <p>MR. LAYCOCK. I believe them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they not really quite a different kind of turnip to yours? A. They really are not; there might be two days difference in the sowing of them - I had a very high opinion of these men, till I had reason to believe to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Bishop's Defence. There were some scattered about the ground, which were not my master's; the ground was ploughed where they had been sown, and I took them up.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 23rd of March I was on duty, and saw the prisoner coming with this truck in a direction from Kingsland-road to Shoreditch; I asked where he was going to take it - he said it belonged to a man named Brown, in Tower-street, and he was sent down to a person named Francis at Edmonton, with fourteen pieces of wood - I did not think it was a correct story, and I took him into custody: in the course of a week I found the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Mr. PLANT. I believe this waistcoat to be mine, and these braces he says he paid the apprentice for, who says he did not receive it; I have no such black stockings as these now, but I had such, and this handkerchief and drawers.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of April, I went to see if the workmen had come - I met the prisoner coming from my premises with some beads and timber - I asked him why he did not go on with his work; he said, "I do not mean to take these things, Mr. Emsley;" I said, "It looks very much like it"- he then said, "I did take them," and he went back and threw them down; I then went to another place, where he had a contract and was to find the materials - I there found two doors, which I knew belonged to me - he followed me- I said I should not leave him till I had given him in charge; he went with me to Bethnal-green, and I gave him in charge for stealing two doors, which he denied, and said he had them by him for twelve months - but at Worship-street he acknowledged he had taken them; I do not recollect the words he first used, but he said be bought them of Pain, my foreman - I knew the doors, and on the Tuesday following I found a partition that he was painting- I ordered him to desist, as it was mine; he said it was not, but he afterwards, before the Magistrate, said he bought them of my foreman.</p>

On the 10th of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I missed six half-crowns from my till - I could not imagine which way they went, as I could find no vacancy; the prisoner and two or three lads came in repeatedly, and that afternoon I marked some shillings; the prisoner took two of them from the till - my son told me he saw his hand go into the till, and gave me a hint about the prisoner, who ran out - I pursued; he ran, and threw the two shillings over his hand at me - I ran, and stopped him; a young man took up the two shillings, and gave them to me - they were two of my marked shillings; I do not know who took them up - he had not run above forty or fifty yards when he threw down the two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You say the young man picked up the money? A. Yes - I did not see him pick it up; the prisoner's father states that he is between nine and ten years old - there was a little boy he brought with him; I did not see him take them - no one was near the till but him - on the Saturday night he came for a halfpenny pencil; he brought a lad to ask for the pencil, while he put his hand under the counter into the till - I believe the prisoner had 3d. to buy a pound of flour at the next door; he had no flour-bag with him, but little bag with 3d. in it.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. What side of the counter is your till? A. It is next the window near the door - there is an opening at the end of the counter under it; there was a vacancy into which a lad could put his hand - he got into the dark corner; my counter is about ten feet long - this crevice is under the end of the counter; it was a long time before I couldfind it out - I lighted a candle three times, and was obliged to put it out again; I could not find it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was in the shop about ten o'clock in the morning of the 10th of April; I saw the prisoner go up towards the till, press against the counter, and feel as if feeling for the till - I suspected he had put his hand into the till, and told my father to take him; he ran off - my father ran and took him; I had discovered the crevice on the Saturday evening, which was so small that no man's hand could go into it - we did not miss money till that Saturday.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is the till at the top or the bottom of the counter? A. At the top - there has been a piece of board pulled away from the end of the counter, that confined the till.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you try whether you could get any thing into the till? A. Not without stooping - it is under the counter; it is possible for a boy to get his hand in - the till is very long and comes up to the back of the counter; I saw the money was gone from the till - my father marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the depth of your till? A. Eight inches, and the opening about two inches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And do you mean to say the boy could put his hand to the bottom of that till? A. I could nearly get my own hand in.</p>

I was in my kitchen in the afternoon, on the 2nd of April - I went into my shop, and saw the prisoner at the counter; he asked for a halfpenny worth of sugar - I asked if he had no more money, he said No; I said I would make him a half-penny worth; I took some paper to put it in, and missed my weights; I said."Where are my weights?" he said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and get more money" - he ran out, I pursued him; he was stopped and brought back in ten minutes; the weights were found in the middle of the road; three were found exactly corresponding with those I lost.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What intercourse with me had you, that you knew the hat was mine? A. Because you wore it on the watch with me, and you had it on that morning - I took particular notice of it; I could swear to it from all the hats I ever saw in my life - it was at nine o'clock when you were first in company with me that morning; afterwards two other men came in, and Johnson and they went to get their breakfasts, I believe.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not that the time you ought to have stopped such a man? Witness. I ought to have done it, and you are the man.</p>

I met to-day Johnson, and he told me that I have done something wrong in your place, which if I have I am not conscious of so doing; however, he advised me to come to you, as he was going out of town for a few days, but you may depend on it you shall be satisfied, if I have done any mischief, before three o'clock on Monday next, and I have requested of Johnson to call on you when he comes to town, hoping this will satisfy you till then; I am living here in Camberwell with a pensioner of my own regiment, as I expect to receive prizemoney every day, and should I be so fortunate as to get it before Monday you shall hear from me, as I gave Johnson up my prizeticket this morning when I met him in St. Martin's-lane - he desired me to tell you of it, and to write this letter to you; I hope you will make yourself easy till you see him or me, between this and Monday. No more at present.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking with Collins on account of the watch being broken up at the time; three or four more were in company with us; some time in the day he got tipsy, and left the company - I went to my own quarters in Westminster, and next day I went down to Chatham to draw some prize-money; in going I met Johnson, who told me Collins had been robbed, and had a suspicion I had done it; I wrote the letter, and stated as you have heard.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he might have ran away? A. No; the officer was close behind him - I was not present at the first bargain about them; I had not made a new bargain with the other man to let him have them for 25s., nor consented that the prisoner should have one of the articles for the 5s.; he was taken to the office - he was not allowed to offer the 25s. to me.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in Charles-street between twelve and one o'clock; I heard a noise in Fludyer-street, and proceeded to the spot; I found Crane tussling with Graves - Crane said he had come out of the area, and that there was another man in the area; I got a light, went down into the area, and found Bennett in the coal-hole - I asked him what he did there; he said some one had thrown his hat over - I found a skeleton-key on his person; in the corner where he was concealed there were several other keys, a chisel, a small crow-bar, the handle of a centre-bit, and several other skeleton-keys, which I gave up to Prior.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. HEATON. Q. He made no resistance? A. No, he seemed very much dejected.</p>

            . On Thursday night I went to Fludyer-street and found Bennett in custody; I went down the area - the kitchen window was lifted up, the pannel of the inside shutter bored throught with a centre-bit, and this piece and this small piece of the pannel were lying in the area; I fitted them into the pannel - I afterwards got the centre-bit and fitted it to some of the holes which had been bored; they agreed with it - after going inside the kitchen this blade of a knife was picked up, in my presence, by an officer, who is not here; I have compared it with the handle found upon Graves - they correspond exactly; the blade had been put through the hole, and I suppose snapped off, and fell inside - the impression on the shutter exactly corresponded with the crow-bar; the space between the inside of the window and the shutter I should suppose is not above two or three inches.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the kitchen under the house? A. Yes; the coal-hole is under the street - I did not find the centre-bit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Graves. Q. Where was the blade of the knife found? A. On the ledge under the window; I never said it was found on the table - I said I was near the table when it was picked up.</p>
               <p>MR. HYNDMAN. I was in bed, and was alarmed by the Police knocking at my door; I believe I went to bed last- I make a practice of going round my house before I go to bed; the shutters were fastened with a bar - the window sash, I believe was not fastened; there is a catch to it, but it is so stiff it is useless - I have no doubt the sash was down that night, but I did not examine that; it is the cook's business to fasten the window - she is not here; it might have been partly up for what I know.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATON. Q. At what hour did you go round the house? A. I think about half-past eleven o'clock - I had a light in my hand, and can say the shutters were whole; I distinctly remember there was no appearance of violence on the shutter.</p>

On the 28th of March I saw this box of old iron in my cellar - the cellar is divided into two parts; I have the back part, the other is not used - my part was locked, but there is a hole from the front cellar which a boy could creep through from the yard; he could then open a door in my cellar, which is neither locked nor bolted; it is merely boards which form part of the partition.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ALLCOCK. I was an officer when this occurred. I now live at Bethnal-green. On the 31st of March I was in Half Nichol-street about half-past eight o'clock, and saw a boy coming along with something under his arm; I went over and found it was this box covered over - in consequence of what he told me, I went to the next house to the prosecutrix, where the prisoner's mother lives, and found the prisoner there; I asked if he gave his brother that box to sell - he voluntarily said that he did; I asked where he got it - he said out of the prosecutrix's house; he is older than his brother who I had met with the box; it contains old iron, and is worth 5d.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you had not looked at the book, would you have remembered any thing about it? A. I distinctly remember the payment, but not the person; I looked at the back to see if it was entered - Mr. Gillespie asked me the question, and mentioned the name of Dowson; I cannot say whether it was a man or woman received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you be sure whether the person who complained that the money had not been paid, was the person who presented it? A. My impression is that it was not, but I cannot be positive - it was paid in five sovereigns, but whether the silver was in shillings or halfcrowns I do not know; we keep sovereigns exclusively for the purpose of paying these orders, and never pay notes.</p>
               <p>Q. But if I wanted a 5l. note to send in a letter, you would accommodate me with it? A. It is a very unusual thing; I never knew it done.</p>

The prosecutor accused this woman of robbing him of three sovereigns and a half - he was not sober, but appeared to know what he was about; I pursued the prisoner - she had just turned round Cannon-street; I called her, and she turned back - I took her in front of the prosecutor, and found on her 1s. 6 1/2d.; there was another woman with the prosecutor- I saw them all three standing together near the watering-house; I went up to Bluegate-fields, dispersed some girls, and when I returned the prosecutor stated the case to me - I took the prisoner; the prosecutor was reeling about, but was able to answer questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the man with a woman holding his arm - the woman said, "Come," and I went with them to the night-house; he called for a quartern of gin; he said, "I will go inside" - I bade him good night, crossed the road, and went down Cannon-street, when the officer took me.</p>

Yes; I did not take it out of his hand - I went before the Magistrate; I heard what the prisoner said - I think it was taken down in writing; I did not say I would save his neck, but would transport him for life - I might say he deserved transporation.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I put eleven sovereigns into a silk purse, tied that in a brown paper, and sent the prisoner to William Meredith - I told him to say I was very unwell, or I would have brought it myself; I never saw him again till I saw him in a green-grocer's shop, in East-street, on the 26th of March, and had him taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his mother's? A. Yes; he had been there, but was out - I have never seen the money.</p>

About Christmas my cellar was under repair; I employed Godfrey, and he employed the prisoner, who I believe is his son-in-law - the door was taken off and repaired by the prisoner; in that cellar there was wine to a considerable amount - it is the inner cellar; it opens into the spirit cellar - I have examined the partition between the two cellars, and find a hole cut on one side of the post, for a bottle to pass and re-pass, and a mark where some one's finger had been cut and bled; I never allowed the prisoner to go to my cellar after the job was over - he never asked; on Saturday night, the 27th of February, my servant gave me information, and I had the prisoner taken on the 1st of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you find the blood? A.

            . I am a porter and chairman. On the 27th of February I was with the prisoner at the prosecutor's house, waiting to be paid; my father and other persons were there - the prisoner beckoned me out, I went out of the room: he said, "Don't take any notice, but it is my birth-day; and if you will go with me I will give you a glass of wine;" I said, "We had better go back, and pay that one pot between us;" he said we should not be five minutes: I went with him up to a house, in Castle-court, where Lousia Lawrence lodges - when we got there, he took a bottle of wine out of his pocket, and we drank it; I think I had two glasses: he then pulled out a bottle of rum - Lousia's mother said, "This won't do:" the prisoner and I had a glass a piece; I do not think there was much drank - the bottle and the rest of it was left there: we then went to Mr. Brown's, and paid a pint a piece towards the pot we had - I thought I had been treated enough and did not expect to have a second edition of it; but when we were coming out: he said, "I have another bottle of wine at home, suppose we drink it at your lodging" - we went to his father-in-law's to get it: I did not go in, but he did - we went to Mr. Brown's to get a light: he then went to a fishmonger's-shop, and he served out the wine among a number of people there; we then went home and drank the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him take any wine from Mr. Brown's? A. No; Godfrey is a carpenter - he bore a fair honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you known him? A. I suppose nine or ten years; he has borne a good character as a tradesman, as far as I know - there was one time I heard he had been here, but I was not in Court, and did not know much of him then: I have only heard of it since this business.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, and found the duplicates on her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that the prosecutor engaged her as housekeeper, to take the charge of four children, but was too poor to supply them with the common necessaries or pay her wages; that she had pledged the articles to procure his children food.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA FLIGHT re-examined. Q. Have you been in such a state of indigence that you have employed her to pawn your property, or allowed her to do it? A. No - I allowed her money as a housekeeper; she has pawned her own property - I do not owe her any thing; I passed my word at a tally-shop, and a man has come to me for it.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On Saturday evening,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150134"/>the 10th of April, I saw the trees in her garden all safe, between six, and seven o'clock, and the next morning, between five and six, I found four plum-trees and four cherry-trees had been broken down and destroyed; one pulled up, and the others destroyed - the branches were all off; they had been against a wall; I afterwards found two apple-trees were destroyed, which had been full of bloom - they had been all alive, and were worth more than 10l. - I saw some footmarks, and had suspicion of the prisoner, from some language which he had used to me on the Saturday night; Mrs. Flint had warned the prisoner off her ground, and I had told the foreman to warn him off - I keep the Phoenix public-house, and on the Saturday night the prisoner was there; he wanted to kick up a row with six or seven others, and I told him to go along; he came, put his fist in my face, and said,"D-n your eyes, you bl-y b-r, I will go down the garden, and destroy every bl-y tree you have got"- I therefore thought he was the person, I fetched the constable to the garden, and sent him to take him on suspicion; his right shoe was taken off, and fitted to the marks in the ground; they matched exactly - he was sent to the cage; we went on board the prisoner's barge, and found some brocoli, which fitted to the stumps left in the ground - they had tried to break into the house, and if they had they would have done much more mischief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were there not two persons taken? A. Yes; one is here as a witness - the nails fitted exactly in the footmarks; it was the right shoe - I do not know how many nails there were; there might be twenty-four - there were six nail marks in the ground; the prisoner had been drinking, but he was not so drunk but he knew what he was going to do - he was not sober.</p>

I went on board a barge, and found the prisoner, on Easter Sunday morning, about seven o'clock, with his companion, who is here; I took the prisoner into custody, he took off his shoe at the garden, and gave it me to fit to the impression on the ground - it fitted in the nail marks, and in the impression where there were no nails; it was fitted in the presence of half a dozen people - I found as much brocoli on board the barge as would tie up in a common sized handkerchief; I saw two of the heads fitted to the stumps, and they matched exactly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I hope you were sober?" A. Yes - he was a little the worse for liquor; he did all the mischief, except taking up the brocoli - he made me go against my will to the garden, take up the brocoli, and take it on board the barge.</p>

I said, "Yes, how came you to know it?" he said, "Two women have been here drunk, and wanted to sell it;" I then went down a court and saw Carpenter looking out at a window - I said to her, "Have you seen my little girl?" she said Yes - I said"Have you taken any thing out of her basket?" she said, No - she came down, and I walked with her some time; at last she said she had had the sheet of Dillon; we went to Dillon, who said she had not had a sheet for months - I said if she would give it up, I would say no more about it.</p>

In the afternoon of the 16th of April, the two prisoners came into the shop together and had something, but I do not remember what - there was 5s. worth of penny-pieces tied up in a brown paper on the counter; both the prisoners went near to it, and Jones took it up and moved it towards Trott, who took it and put it into his pocket; they paid me a shilling - I then walked round and took Trott, who took the paper out of his pocket and threw it behind a tub of butter; I left him in the counting-house and ran and took the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>- I saw Jones come out with a piece of cheese in his hand; I then saw him with Hornsby, and took charge of him - these are the pennypieces; I marked them.</p>

I went to the Crooked Billet, at the corner of King David-lane; I asked Philip Phillips whether the sashes he had there were his own - he said Yes; that he had received them from his master, pointto his brother William: I asked William where he got them - he said from his master in Fore-street, Limehouse; I said I should wish to see his master, and we went out to go there - in going along, I asked Philip Phillips if William had given them to him to carry; William said,"Carry be d-d, one is as bad as the other:" I took them to the station-house, and next day found a house with three pair of sashes gone - this pair fitted exactly.</p>

On the 13th of April I was drinking at the Maidenhead public-house - I came out for a short time, and was sick; I sat down, and saw the prisoner there - he offered me help, and advised me to give him my watch to take into the bar, or perhaps I should be robbed of it; I did not give it him - he unbuttoned my waistcoat, and said by getting the air I should be relieved: he then unbuttoned the band of my trousers: I looked down, and saw my watch hanging, (I believe.) by a button; I grasped at it, but he was too active - he got it, and handed it to another person, who got off; I seized the prisoner, took him into the house, and charged him with stealing it - he opened his waistcoat, and pleaded innocence; he said he was not the man - he then attempted to run away, but he did not escape my notice; I saw an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. When was this? A. On Tuesday afternoon - I am sure it was not Monday; I believe I had drank a small glass of gin at another public-house in the morning - I might have some porter at eleven o'clock; we had some ale at the Maidenhead - this happened between four and five o'clock; the ale had not impaired my intellects - I went into a corner which was parted off; I did not sit down in the fifth, there is a stone on which I sat - I was almost asleep when he aroused me; I looked at my watch after he came up - I was not in such a state that I did not know whether I had my watch; he came to me two or three times - I was not asleep, I was heavy.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 17th of March, the prosecutor informed me of this robbery, and about four o'clock that afternoon I was going to a house on Bow-common, and met the prisoner with two men named Wilson and McEwen on the side of the Regent's-canal, about half a mile from the prosecutor's; one of the men, not in custody, was carrying a bag across his shoulder: I stopped him, and asked him what he had got - he said he did not know; at that time the prisoner and Wilson walked on - I asked the man how he got it: he said he was employed by one of those men who had walked on; I told Mr. Prendergast to go after them - he went, and hearing somebody behind, they immediately took to their heels and ran - I caught hold of the man who had the bag; we struggled; he knocked me down and got away - I took the bag, opened it, and in it were seven hens, a cock just killed (it was quite warm), a duck, and two live geese: I proceeded on to the house on Bowcommon, having been informed that Wilson lived there - I found a great quantity of property there; I had been there about fifteen minutes, and while I was in the kitchen the prisoner and Wilson came in, and opened the door; seeing me in the kitchen, they immediately ran out of the house - I pursued them over a bridge, and they got away; in the house I found two of the prosecutor's hens, sitting on twenty-four eggs, which he identified - they were marked with a cross; next morning about six o'clock I apprehended the prisoner in bed, at a lodging-house at Stratford, and asked how he came to run away with Wilson the day before - he denied it, and said he had not seen Wilson for a month; he was taken to the office, and stated to the Magistrate that he had seen Wilson.</p>
               <p>GRIFFIN. I work at the East India-dock warehouse, and live next door to the prosecutor. About two o'clock in the morning I heard a noise like fowls and geese going in; I had heard some persons go out, but could not see them - I heard a noise two nights.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a constable of Chelsea.

Mr. Hughes has got the fiddle;" we then went into the room - Lasham was sitting there naked; I said, "Mr. Hughes is come. Mr. Lasham; do you know any thing about the fiddle I got here to-day?" I then asked if he knew any thing about the shoes - he said No; I asked for his clothes, and found 3s. in his pocket, and 2s. 6d. on his wife - I took Morgan, (who was in custody.) to him at the watch-house, and said to him, "I have been told that you said this morning that Morgan brought the shoes to your house" - he said, "Yes, Morgan brought them;" I took young Lasham into custody first - he denied the charge; he said he had been at the coffee-shop at Knightsbridge on Sunday night with Morgan Sage and young Lee; I asked what time they came back - he said about twelve o'clock; that they had some coffee of Brown, the watchman, and afterwards spent the night under a butcher's pent-house till another watchman drove them away - Morgan was brought to me in custody; I said, "Where did you spend your pay last night?" he said he had been to Knightsbridge; I asked who with - he said nobody; that he came back at half-past ten o'clock, and slept on Mr. Leach's stones all night - they are in Manor-street, near old Lasham's house; I said that was a lie, and told him he had been with the others - he denied it; I found Sage at a house of ill-fame, in Westminster, on Friday.</p>

            . On the Sunday in question between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw some men come up Old'Change, arm-in-arm one was dressed in a light drab coat, he was a stiff upright man: the other was dressed in a blue coat - I saw the one in a light drab coat take a key out of his right hand pocket, and saw them open the door of No. 49, Old 'Change; they both walked in together into the house - I was called by the servant at a stationer's shop opposite, and might be there twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour; and when I came out, I saw a backney-coach standing at the door of No. 49, the coach was No. 44; I cannot read, but know figures very well - there were two 4's on the coach, the coachman held the door open; I saw the man in a blue coat that went in come out, and jump into the coach - then the man in the light coat, brought out a large blue bag as full as it could hold, it was more than he could lift; they put it into the coach; the coachman was at the door all the time - the man who brought out the bag locked the door; put the key into the same pocket as he took it out of, and then got into the coach, the coachman shut the door; they came right up Old 'Change, and turned round by St. Paul's; I saw the coachman as plain as possible - and swear positively that the prisoner is that man - he drove towards me, and no other coaches were coming by; the place was quite clear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A poor woman - I sweep the street; I mentioned this the day after the robbery, and gave the number of the coach; I do not make a practice of looking at the numbers of coaches - it was a wet day; I do not remember the number of any other coach I saw that day - I was standing on the opposite side - the coach came right facing me and turned round; I saw the prisoner holding the coach door - I saw the number when the coach turned round; it did not go very quick till it turned the corner - the middle part of the number shone like glass - it was a coach; (looking at two figures) that was not the number - that is 27; it did not rain very hard - I saw nobody else near the coach.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. There are not many coaches about on Sundays in that part of the town? A. The stand is just by - there is hardly any traffic on Sundays.</p>

            . I was horse-keeper to Mr. Welch, a hackney-coach master in Horseferry-road - he has seven pairs of plates; No. 44 is one pair. On Sunday, the 21st of February, the prisoner drove No. 44 - I remember his going out about half-past seven o'clock in the morning with the coach, but I cannot say whether he drove it; he took it out, and had driven it for three or four days - he ought to have returned at five o'clock in the morning with the coach, but I cannot say whether he drove it; he took it out, and had driven it for three or four days - he ought to have returned at five o'clock in the evening; I cannot say at what time he came, as I was not in the yard.</p>

            . I was in the shop; the prisoner came in, and said he wanted to purchase a gun for a gentleman; my brother looked out two - he said if I would go with him to the gentleman in Drury-lane, he would choose one, and send back the money by me; I went with him, and in Fenchurch-street he said; very likely the gentleman might he at his father's livery stables; he took me to Underwood's stables, in Duke's-place - he took one gun off my shoulder, and went in with it, saying, if the gentlemen liked it he would bring me out the money - I waited ten minutes, and then found he had gone through the stable, and out of another door in Mitre-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not that gun fairly bought? A. No - he was a stranger to me; he came to the shop alone- he was not trusted with it, but was to bring me back the money or this gun.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I considered it was fairly bought- it was to be paid for by concussion caps; I returned to the gate in ten minutes, and he was gone - I had only been to Mitre-street, where my mother lives; the officer said I should not be prosecuted if I told where the gun was; and the father said he would forego proceedings if I got it back.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs were attending a charity sermon at Christchurch; the congregation were coming out - I heard some complaint in the church; the prisoner was in the porch, coming out - I looked over, and saw him stooping his head down, and walking softly; he had a leather cap on - I could not see his hands; his cap was moving - I could not account for it; I took hold of both his arms, and said, "How did you come to church?" he said, "Because I heard the Lord Mayor was coming;" I said, "Where do you live?" he said over the water - I took him to the lodge of Christ's-hospital, searched him, and found two handkerchiefs on him; while I was questioning him the prosecutor came up, and claimed one.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I went to Christ's-hospital to hear Divine service; when the service was over, they came out in a great confusion - coming along the church-way out I saw a handkerchief lay under my feet; I of couse picked it up, and put it into my pocket, with a full view, after I got out of the church, to make it known to some person, for advice what to do with it, but some person who saw me pick up the said handkerchief, no doubt, gave information to the beadle.</p>
               <p>MR. DAVIE. My handkerchief was in my right-hand pocket; it could not have dropped out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Amidst the greatest difficulties to encounter, I now enter on my defence - I do not mean to attribute perjury to the witnesses, but alledge they are under a mistaken idea of the identity of the person; here I am charged with a crime I am innocent of - look at the evidence of Taylor; he says, after he found out the fraud he went round to the tradesmen, and among others to my late master, Mr. Bunnell, who, in giving a description of my person, said he thought that he had such a person in his employ, and gave my name and address; Taylor came to the house, saw me outside, and immediately said I was the person - he, of course, anxious to bring the real perpetrator to justice, has unfortunately fixed on the innocent person; if I had obtained the goods should I have gone to Mr. Dosseter, where I am well known; for I should have been sure to be identified - with a full opinion that if you have a doubt of my guilt you will give me the benefit of it, knowing that it is better that ninety-nine guilty persons should escape than one innocent man be convicted.</p>

In consequence of the death of Mr. Blades, a gentleman was looking into the accounts, and found that 15l., which had been applied for to the Ironmongers' Company, had not been entered; I know from the prisoner himself that it had been applied for, for the use of the school - I inquired of the prisoner about it, and asked if he had discovered any thing further respecting it; he said he had not, but that he had received an order from Mr. Blades, who was the treasurer, to obtain the money from the Ironmongers' Company - he said the order was in writing, and he went and received the cheques from Mr. Pellatt, the clerk, on Messrs. Hankey's; that he brought it to the school in Dorset-street, and locked it in his desk on the Saturday till the Monday morning, and then went and received the money, which he took with him to Peckham, where he resided, brought it back on the Tuesday, put it in an an envelope, and delivered it at Mr. Blades' house, to Mr. Crook, his cashier, in the presence of Mr. Jones; I inquired of the prisoner two days afterwards whether he had been to Mr. Blades' to inquire about it, and he said he had not, at which I expressed my surprise - I think the day after he said Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones recollected that he had been there, but he did not say they recollected his giving the money; I afterwards found the number of the notes, and made inquiries - in consequence of what I heard I sent for the prisoner, and gave him in charge; I told him what I had discovered, but said I did not wish him to say any thing to me about it - as he was going out he stepped back, and asked if it could not some how be settled; I told him to say nothing more - I did not at all agree to settle the matter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. The prisoner was parish-schoolmaster? A. Yes, and as such his duty was merely to instruct the boys - there is a collector of the subscriptions to the school; Mr. Blades was treasurer, and used to pay the bills for the school, by order from the committee of superintendence - this gift was called Betton's gift; I believe it could not have been got without the intervention of Mr. Blades - I believe the prisoner had been schoolmaster a year and a half, or two years; I believe Mr. Blades himself received it the year before; Mr. Blades was at this time afflicted with paralysis, and I have heard was afflicted so as to be deprived of the power of speech; there is a collector, but if I had been treasurer I would not have sent him, because he has a per centage, and the schoolmaster has not - I have never received it myself: the prisoner was merely sent to receive it on account of the illness of Mr. Blades; the schoolmaster has a regular salary - there had been a gratuity made to the former schoolmaster by the committee of superintendence, but not to the prisoner; the former schoolmaster must have had an order to go to Mr. Blades for it - he had been in the situation a number of years, and had only had it at particular times; by no means every year - the prisoner had not the least right to expect it; he had not conducted himself well - the notes the prisoner received have been traced, and are here; I supposed the prisoner had made inquiry between the first time of my asking him and the second, and upon the second occasion he stated that Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones had recollected his being there - the prisoner said he had directed the letter as he was accustomed to direct them, for "
               <persName id="t18300415-350-person2885">J. </persName>
            Blades, Esq., Treasurer;" he said the money was inclosed in it, and it was left with Mr. Crook - he said he had left the money, but did not say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150147"/>it was the identical notes he had received from Hankeys - I understood they were the same notes, but I might be wrong; he might have other notes and have left them -Mr. Brooks, of New-street-square has succeeded Mr. Blades, as Treasurer; this circumstance happened in July, and Mr. Blades died quite at the end of the year.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the person whom he succeeded always rewarded with a gratuity to the same amount? A. No, my Lord, he had it but once to my remembrance, and I think it was 10l.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Blades; I know the prisoner perfectly well - I certainly never received any money from him, or any thing stated by him to contain money from the Ironmongers' Company; he was not at all employed by Mr. Blades in his general service - I never had any conversation with him respecting any money received from the Ironmongers' Company till before his examination had taken place; he came down to ask if I did not recollect receiving the money - I said I did not; there was a Mr. Jones in Mr. Blades' service - I think the prisoner said he paid it about July; I can say with perfect recollection, and with perfect truth, that he never paid any money over to me - I was in the habit of opening all notes at that time, both private and public; I had a special power of attorney to transact any business on Mr. Blades' account, and in his name; if any money had come I ought to have known it, but Mr. Jones sometimes opened letters; I know Mr. Blades' gave the prisoner authority to go and receive the money at the proper time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say of your own knowledge that Mr. Jones opened all notes and letters which you did not? A. That I cannot say; Mr. Blades was in such a state that no notes relative to business certainly, and I believe no private notes were delivered to him; when Mr. Blades received money it first passed through the cashier's books, but this money never did in the business accounts - I had a good deal to do with his private accounts while he was indisposed; if I had received this money I should have entered it in the public books; the year before they did not usually come into my hands - the prisoner was not in the habit of calling on Mr. Blades; I should think he did not call for six month's together - he never left letters to my knowledge since I had authority to open them, and I should think not previous to that, because Mr. Blades was much out of town; I had many letters that he never saw.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Mr. Blades in a state in which letters would not have been received by him at this time? A. Yes, certainly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not open all letters? A. I did not; but, generally speaking, I knew the contents of all letters, at least ninety-nine out of a hundred. I am in the shop from eight o'clock till eight - there are eight or ten persons in the shop, and sixteen or eighteen persons altogether; the prisoner might have come in during my absence, and have left a letter, without its coming to my hands.</p>

            . ESQ. I am the present treasurer of the school. I have seen the prisoner write frequently - this is his writing on the note, I am satisfied.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You, I believe, charged the prisoner with this offence? A. Yes, and I wrote him a note, to state in writing what he knew of this transaction; I am not certain whether he answered the first note, or whether I wrote a second; I have not his answer, but the tenor of it was that he had received the cheque from the clerk of the Ironmongers' Company, got it cashed at Hankeys, and took the notes home with him, brought them to town the next day, and enclosed them in an envelope, took it to Mr. Blades, and left it with Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones, who were sitting at the desk together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I should have had some friends in the evening, but they were not aware of the trial; they could have witnessed my having received the order of Mr. Blades - I have been at the school since June, 1828, I was sent for by Mr. Blades, in June, 1829, and had not been twelve months at the school, and had received no money - he gave me an order to receive this money from Mr. Pellatt, and hold it till he saw me again; I presented the order at the Hall, and was told it was not in a course of payment; and before it could be paid, I must have a list of the subscribers to the school, and the number of children; I applied at Mr. Blades' for them - Mr. Crook told me he would speak to Mr. Brooks, and send them to me; I waited several days and called several times; Mr. Crook and Mr. Jones know that I have called, and left several letters there, the contents of which they did not know; I have no one to prove that I paid the money - I was engaged by Mr. Brook's as schoolmaster, and by no other person.</p>

               <p>MR. BROOKS. I sent the prisoner to the school; he came from a public establishment; and I had confidence in him.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. DEVEY. Q. Who paid the prisoner? A. He was paid by an order from the committee of superintendence on the treasurer.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 40.</p>
               <p>Recommended to Mercy by Mr. Devey, having a wife and six children.</p>

quarter of an hour.</p>


               <p> - I am an Excise-officer. I saw the bags of tea; in consequence of what we heard, it was permitted to be returned into stock - the whole weighed 484 lbs.; the bags weighed 14lbs.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Garden-row, Brick-lane, Old-street, and am a chair-maker. The prisoner is a carman, and removes goods; I have seen his cart- it has his name and address on it. On Sunday evening, the 21st of February, I was at the Jolly Weavers, in John's-row, St. Luke's, and saw the prisoner there; I was drinking a pint of beer with a friend, named William, and smoking a pipe - it was between seven and eight o'clock; a man came and asked if a person named Horne was there - the prisoner said, "My name is Horne;" he was a genteel dressed man, and said, "I understand you remove goods?" Horne replied, "I do;" he asked if his cart was engaged for the morning - Horne replied No: I heard no more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was Horne at that time, in the same box with you? A. No; he was not in our company at all- I have known him about eighteen months to the best of my knowledge; only one person made this enquiry - I dare say I should know the person again, but I had not seen him before nor since; I was not in Court when the prisoner made his defence.</p>

I am a watchmaker, in business for myself, and live in John's-row; I have known the prisoner twelve or thirteen years, living in the neighbourhood - I was at the public-house on that Sunday evening with Pargiter; no one else was in our company - I remember Horne being there; Pargiter had had a pipe, and I was smoking - a man came in and asked for the name of Horne; the prisoner said, "My name is Horne," and he asked if his horse and cart were disengaged for the morning - he said they were; he was a young man of respectable appearance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any thing more? A. No, nor any particulars of where the things were to be taken from, or to; I did not go before the Magistrate - I said I would come if it was requested, and they said they did not think it would be necessary; I said so to his wife and family.</p>

The prisoner lived at my house at the time this happened, and was there at six o'clock in the morning, on the day he was taken up; he keeps a horse and cart - I heard a man calling for him, but I did not see him; I did not hear the knock at the door - I heard the prisoner come down; he kept his horse and cart in my yard, and I heard it go out through the passage.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. HANCOCK. Q. Was it a glazed window? A. No, two doors, which open outwards, and are secured inside.</p>
