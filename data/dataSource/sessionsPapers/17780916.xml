On the 18th, I lost a black gelding, out of the same field, on the Friday following, I was at Smithfield to buy a horse: when I was paying for it, one Saunders told me, that a black horse had been sold to Mr. Hopkins<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160003"/> in the Borough; we went and found the black horse; Saunders said, that one Allen had bought a brown horse; that he was sure was mine. We went the next morning to Allen at Rotherithe, and found it there; when we were at Hopkins's, he said they were sold at Tattersell's, and he believed the man was not paid; we went up to Tattersell's at eleven at night; they told us there, that he had not received the money, and they expected him to come in the morning which he did, and was taken by Wildman, Mr. Tattersell's servant.</p>
               <p>- WILDMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought a brown gelding to Mr. Tattersell's to sell on the 10th of June, and a black gelding on the 18th; one Mr. Dixon bought the brown one, and Hopkins in Mint-street in the Borough bought the other.</p>
               <p>Did you stop the man? - Yes; on the Saturday morning the 20th of June, when he came to receive the money for the second; he had received the money for the first before we knew of it; he did not seem to say much when he was stopped. The constable took him to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Is neither Allen nor Hopkins here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wildman. What were the marks of the horse sold at Tattersell's? - A black horse with part of one of his ears cut off; it was booked in the name of Edmonds; he said his name was

               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Zenogle. I was in the compting-house when the linens were taken away; they were taken off a pile of printed linens which I had laid not above an hour before near the door; they were taken away at about four in the afternoon; I heard somebody go from the door; as there was no one in the shop it raised my suspicion; I went to the door and saw a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160004"/> person with some linens on his moulder turning the corner.</p>
               <p>Was that person the prisoner? - I believe it was; I cannot swear to him; I only saw his back; I missed the linen-immediately as I came to the door; as soon as I had called the maid to take care of the warehouse, I pursued the man but went a wrong way, so I was not present when he was taken; I saw him in custody of some gentlemen who were taking him to Guildhall. The person I saw with the linen had a dark grey coat on.</p>
               <p>Mr. DEPUTY JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 4th of August in the afternoon, as I was going to Guildhall, I saw the prisoner at the end of Basinghall-street in Fore-street, with some pieces of linen on his shoulder; I said to Mr. Wyat and Mr. Hall, who were in company, that I thought by the manner of his carrying the linen that he had stole it; Mr. Hall and I followed him; seeing himself observed, he stopped to make water; we went up to him and asked what he had got there; he said some lines which he was carrying to Mr. Jones's in Moor-lane. He had passed through Moor-lane. We met Mr. Jones, the beadle, by the way. When I found the prisoner's account so trifling I gave the constable charge of him.</p>

               <p>Upon the 4th of August, between sour and five, going along Fore-street with Mr. Jones and Mr. Wyatt, Mr. Jones said to me, Take notice of that man, I think he has stole that linen. We followed the man down Moor-lane. He was asked how he came by the pieces of linen, he said, he had them at a house in Coleman-street, and was to carry them to Moor-lane. We asked him to go back to the place where he had them from; he said, he could not do that for he had them of a man who gave him sixpence to carry them. Mr. Deputy Jones gave the beadle (who we had picked up by the way) charge of the prisoner. We took him to Guildhall, and while we were there a young man came in and said he was servant to Mr. Zenogle, and that they had lost the four pieces of printed linen.</p>

I was at Mr. Smith's house on Thursday afternoon the 20th of August, between three and six, drinking part of a tankard of beer with two other clerks in the Commons; the prisoner I understood had been there from eight in the morning; I saw him sitting in the box; I thought he took notice of us as we drank out of the tankard; a person came into the same box the prisoner had been sitting in; he was then gone out; I did not observe him go out. I turned my back to the tankard to speak to the witness that is here; the prisoner paid for the beer he had been drinking, and came and sat down behind us. In about ten minutes I turned about and the prisoner and the tankard were gone. The person that delivered me the tankard came and demanded it; I went out and saw the prisoner about thirty yards from the door; I pursued him, and took the tankard from under his arm; it was under his great coat.</p>

Except my own people, there was no one in the shop when I went out, and left the prisoner there; I believe I was not gone out of the shop half a minute when I was called by my maid.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On one Sunday, as Mrs. Cox has said, my master ordered me to make his baggage ready and to go to the country. I went up into my master's dressing-room, and not finding my powder sack and comb as customary, I then went to my master's bed-chamber, and found the sack of powder and the combs in a table-cloth wrapped up together: I wrapped up the sack of powder and the combs in that table-cloth that was upon the table; after that, I took down that table-cloth to wrapped up and put it into the baggage that belonged to my master's I had the key of the trunk that was shut up, and I put the trunk behind the carriage; this happened in the day-time. When I attended my master at night to put him to bed as customary, I found that I had put up these things by mistake; finding these things put there by mistake which I knew nothing of before, and knowing them to belong to the lady, thinking that the lady was to go upon the journey with us; but I did not find an opportunity of delivering them again which I intended. The portmantua was put behind the carriage as usual. The lady next morning took a post chaise to return to London. When the lady came to London, she found, as really it was, that the jewels were missing; she wrote a letter to Mr. Nevill, who wrote one to me, to inquire whether I had seen the effects belonging to the lady, and to examine my portmantua. As I found my master wanted to examine into my things, I thought the best way would be to put them apart, and give them myself to the lady on my return to London, but had no opportunity of coming as I staid upwards of six weeks in the country. I was threatened to be carried to Mr. Wilkinson's. I had them about me in my pocket, intending to put them in the same room where I had taken them from by mistake; but I had not time on my arrival at London. I was conducted immediately to Mr. Wilkinson's; at Mr. Wilkinson's, a gentleman interrogated me several times; as that gentleman did not understand French, he thought proper to have me conducted to justice Fielding's; when I understood I was going there, I put the jewels into my hat, intending on my return, to put them in the place I had taken them from.</p>

I went to my child; I found her private parts swelled and inflamed very bad; she told me that the prisoner's wife got up and went out one Sunday morning between five and six o'clock, that while she was gone, the prisoner took her from the feet of the bed, and laid her at the head of the bed in his wife's place, and got upon her, that she cried out; upon which he got out of bed, and fastened the door, and said, if she cried, or if she told her mammy or his wife he would beat her unmercifully.

               <p>How far did he put any thing into you? - I cannot tell how far; I felt something wet come from him. The Sunday before this happened, I went to the necessary in the yard; he came to the vault, and pulled the door open, and would have done it then, only the mistress of the house was in the necessary with me, and saw him.</p>

             that it might be done by digitation, or some other cause; I examined the hymen, and found it quite perfect; there was no sort of laceration.</p>

               <p>How far in this child do you suppose the hymen to be up the vagina, because I have understood upon former occasions, that it is various in different subjects? - It sometimes happens so, but in the common course of things there is little deviation.</p>
               <p>How high do you suppose the hymen to lye up the vagina in this child? - Not high; I suppose about half an inch.</p>
               <p>Whatever then was the cause of this injury, you think from appearances it was impossible that she should have been entered by a man? - I should suppose so. It is necessary to observe, that previous to this complaint that was made, the child had a relaxation of the bladder; her urine came away involuntary, which would cause an inflamation of the parts.</p>
               <p>How long had she been troubled with this complaint? - I cannot justly tell. I am pretty confident she must have had it some time.</p>

               <p>Whether in your knowledge and experience that disorder, occasioning a discharge from young girls, which produces a degree of inflammation, is not extremely common? - It is very common.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I examined this girl a few hours after the prisoner was committed, and seeing that there was a good deal of rancour and violence in the women and friends about the girl, I inspected her with the greatest care and accuracy possible; I found there was neither laceration, ulceration, or excoriation; I could not for my part observe the least swelling of the labia or the lips. The hymen was as perfectly complete as any I ever saw; I observed a small discharge, I must own, upon the shift; the mucous was not more upon the part than what we commonly observe. There was a very slight degree of inflammation, about the urethra, which is a little distance from the vagina, where the urine passes out, there I did observe just round the passage a very slight degree of inflammation. In short, from the appearance all together, there was not the least reason to suspect that any violence had lately been done to the parts.</p>
               <p>Are you clear from these circumstances, that she never could have been entered by a man? - It was impossible; the orifice was not larger than the size of a large quill.</p>
               <p>How high up in the vagina do you imagine the hymen to have laid? - The hymen, in all that I have examined, lies at the very enterance of the vagina, not within the vagina; it is not called the vagina till you pass the hymen.</p>
               <p>What do you call it till you arrive at the hymen? - There are the external labia and the little labia, which we name nymphae; they belong to the external parts.</p>
               <p>If there had been any force or violence used to her so recently as a week; do you think that you should have discovered it? - If there had been much violence used, I think she could not have recovered it in that short space of time; there must have been some more marks.</p>
               <p>With respect to the discharge, whether it is not a complaint to which children are very subject? - Exceedingly common; we see it every day in the female sex of all ages; it may arise from a variety of causes, and when this happened it was exceeding hot weather.</p>
               <p>And when that acrid discharge is produced; it is always attended with a degree of inflammation? - Less or more.</p>
               <p>Jury. I believe, Sir, you heard the evidence of the child? - I did.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose that if the violence had been used which the child mentioned, that it was not possible to have seen more appearances of it? - There must have been some different appearances, I think, to what there was; it is impossible to say what six or seven days may do in case of little violence done, but if great violence had been used, I think it impossible; if there had been an introduction, there must have been other appearances of it.</p>
               <p>Dr. COOPER sworn.</p>
               <p>I examined the child very attentively; there was a little redness upon the external parts; in other respects the appearances were quite natural. There was no swelling at all, no excoriation, and much left any laceration<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160011"/> at all; there was not the least. The hymen was quite complete, as perfect as possible, and much more so than it usually is in children. There was a little redness upon the passage to the bladder, but the child had a weakness in the bladder; redness is universal where there is that weakness, if the hymen hath once been penetrated it never unites afresh; the remains of it forms the caruncula myrtiformes. So it is absolutely impossible that there could have been the least penetration, nor were there any marks of violence whatsoever upon the parts.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the prosecutor, who is employed in selling salop in Moorfields; I went out according to my usual custom in company with my husband and daughter, who assisted me in carrying my table and salop into Moorfields, at four o'clock in the morning; at about nine my daughter returned and perceived that the box in which this money was kept was broke open, and the money gone; my bureau and the place where I kept my clothes and other effects were all opened, and the things contained in them were thrown about the floor, and there were two of my gowns wrapped up to all appearance, with an intent to carry them away; this bag lay near them, I apprehend it was meant to put these clothes and gowns into the bag and carry them away; but the person, I suppose, was disturbed, and therefore left the bag behind him. I am sure that this bag which has been produced, was the bag that belonged to the prisoner, for the prisoner had applied to me before for a bag; I had offered him one, which was worth very little; he refused to accept of it, in a short time after that I saw he had a bag, which I made particular observations upon; it had more holes in it than that I offered him, and was like a dirty-pillow case. I said so to him at the time he showed it me; I made such observation upon it, that I can swear to it. When the prisoner was taken up, the sum of one pound seventeen shillings and six-pence was found in his breeches pocket, one six-pence which was a part of that money that was in my box, at the time that this money was stole; the forty-four pounds was not made up when I removed, but put up into the box afterwards.</p>

I came home at nine in the morning, the prisoner's bag was found there, this is the bag: I was present when the bag was produced by the prisoner to my mother. I made the same observation upon it at the time the prisoner produced it, and said, it was not much better than that my mother had offered him; and it was like a dirty pillow case. I am sure it was the same identical bag which the prisoner before had produced, and the sixpence that was found in his pocket, I take upon me to swear is the identical sixpence that was in the box at the time we went out in the morning. I am sure it was in the box when it was broke open; another reason for suspecting the prisoner, was, he assisted in placing the box where it stood.</p>

I discharged her upon a regular warning; I had no intelligence of any of these things till the 31st of August. On the day after the prisoner quitted my service, I gave her a good character upon an application to another place, but did not know to what place she was then going. Two or three weeks after she had quitted my service, having occasion to use some of these particulars, I then discovered they had been taken away; I suspected the prisoner, but did not know where to find her; part of the things were found on the 31st of August by an extraordinary accident. Mr. Seddon, a jeweller, in Salisbury-court, Fleet street, is employed as a workman for my brother; my brother went to Mr. Seddon's, he was let into the house by the prisoner, who had my gown upon her; he gave me information of this, I went to Mr. Seddon's, I saw the prisoner with my gown and petticoat on her; upon searching, some of the things were found in her box, and others of them in the kitchen, in her possession; some of the things were afterwards found in the possession of the prisoner's sister: the prisoner's sister was three times at my house, in order to see the prisoner.</p>

I went into the prisoner's room on the 4th of August, and missed the goods mentioned in the indictment; she would not give any account what she had done with them.

I went up and found the dining room door open. A basket which contained the foul clothes was emptied: I came down and pursued the prisoner across the fields adjoining to the house and took her; I found a bundle upon her; I said I insisted upon seeing what was in her bundle; upon this she let loose her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160018"/> right hand and dropped them in the field.

            . I found my shift on the prisoner's back at her lodgings. I had a gown to wash; it was taken with the shift. I charged her with the gown; she owned she had taken it, and told me it was at Mrs. Ferry's, a pawnbroker: the justice sent a man with her to the pawnbroker's.</p>

The prisoner was my servant; she had been with me ever since October was twelvemonths; I opened the chest and missed the things; I charged her with taking them; she immediately confessed, she had pawned them with one Burrows in Barbican, and produced the duplicates.

               <p>Ashburn. When the prisoner was taken up, I went to Mr. Burrows, and told him the alderman desired him to attend at Guildhall; he asked on what account; I told him he had taken in some stolen goods; I described the goods and the prisoner, and told him where I lived; he denied that he had any such articles. I desired he would go to the alderman, but he would not; but desired. I would go to some other pawnbrokers, for he knew nothing of any such woman in the court that I lived in. I thought he dealt so unfairly as a tradesman, I did not choose to let him see any of the tickets.</p>

               <p>Can you tell when this happened to you? - Of a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - About two months ago, I was up at four o'clock in the morning; they all went to dinner at one o'clock; the prisoner was not long gone to his dinner, not a quarter of an hour, as I could guess, they left their dinner and the men went to sleep upon the kilns where they burn the bricks; I eat my own dinner, and was going to lie down in the straw to sleep; the prisoner came, and hit me over the shoulder with a piece of cord; he bid me get up to pull down the barrow, for he was going to work; before I could get hold of the barrow, he dragged me by my arm into the stable.</p>
               <p>How many yards might that be distant? - The stable is about as far as from here to the door; he shut the door, and then put his hands up my petticoats; I was going to cry out; he stopped my mouth by putting his hand over it; he took and laid me upon the stones upon the ground; then he pulled up my petticoats, and got a top of me, and put something into me; he said, if I stirred he would have my life; he got off me, and buttoned up his breeches.</p>
               <p>What situation were his breeches in when he got upon you? - He unbuttoned them.</p>
               <p>What was it that he put into you? - His private parts.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any thing come from him? - Yes, something wet; after he had done this, he gave me a halfpenny, and bid me say, if my mother found it out, that it was the Bearer off did it, that is the man that wheels off the barrow when it is full of bricks; he said that to me when he had done with me, when I was going to get up; then he went out; he said, do you stay here till I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160026"/> come, and he bid me bring another girl down that was playing with me, for he wanted to serve her the same.</p>
               <p>Did he say what girl; did he mention any one in particular? - Yes, a girl whose hair curled, and who wore a short eared cap; she played with me every day. I came out about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>How many minutes do you suppose after he left you? - He went out, and then I came out in two or three minutes after him.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - I went and sat down in the straw, and he went some where across the fields in his shirt sleeves. Before he went across the fields, he saw my shoes were all over bloody; he threw some ashes upon them to hide the blood. I lay in the straw from that time, which was about one o'clock till four; the prisoner crossed the fields, and I went to sleep in that condition in the straw; some of the men came down and waked me, and told me to go for the four o'clock beer; instead of going for the beer, I made the best of my way home to my mammy. The first woman that saw me was one Mrs. May; I told her how I was used; then I called my daddy down, and told him of it; the neighbours came together, and they went and fetched a constable, and a gentleman that is in court; and they set me upon a chair in Mrs. May's room. The constable and the other gentleman went with me back to the brick field; the constable told me to go first, and see if the man was there; they followed me; when I went back the men were just beginning to work, and my mammy was there; she did not know where I was; I showed the constable the man that had used me so, which was the prisoner, and they took him, and carried him directly before Justice Blackborough.</p>
               <p>Jury. You are sure the prisoner is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you known him very well before? - Yes; I had worked with him a fortnight and two days.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mrs. May the name of the man that had used you so ill? - Yes,

               <p>I am a constable of the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, on Tuesday the 14th of July last, between six and seven in the afternoon as near as I can guess, I was at Sadler's Wells; I attend there to keep peace. This girl's father and a woman came to me, and desired I would go along with them immediately, for there was a Moulder, (they did not mention his name) that had committed a rape upon the body of his daughter, and he could not get any other officer to go with him; he had been to several. I went to Mr. Charlton's room; there was the girl; she was very bad; there were two or three women about her; they pulled up her clothes, that I should see the condition she was in; her thighs and legs were all over blood. From thence I went along with the girl to find out the prisoner; we went into a brick field, at the back of the <placeName id="t17780916-47-crimeloc230">Lower-street, Islington</placeName>

As soon as we came within sight of him, the girl pointed at him, and said that is the man. I went immediately and apprehended him, and had him before justice Blackborough.</p>

               <p>Were there any other persons in the field besides the prisoner at that time? - Yes; there were two women there; the girl's mother was there.</p>
               <p>Was there any other man besides the prisoner? - I did not observe; I did not look; my eyes were upon the prisoner; I got another constable to assist me in taking him to prison, after he was committed by the justice, for fear he might get away from me. The other constable asked him how he came to serve the girl so; his answer was that, she said, if he did not - her, somebody else should.</p>

               <p>Do you remember this girl being brought into the hospital? - Yes, on Tuesday the 14th of July in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did you in the course of that evening, or how soon after examine her? - I examined her about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mention the condition in which you found her? - I found she had been considerably abused; and likewise there was a laceration of a quarter of an inch in her private parts: the laceration was on the lower part of her private parts; I found on examination some coagulated blood that came out of her private parts.</p>
               <p>Can you say from the appearances that you observed, what had occasioned that injury? - I cannot pretend to say what had occasioned it: force had been applied, and she appeared to have been injured.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went home at dinner at the usual time, I believe it was twelve o'clock, and my wife and my mother were both a getting dinner ready, hashing a piece of shoulder of mutton; I waited till it was done, after it was done I went to a public house which is hard by; (I thought the young woman would have been here as a witness, but thinking the trial would not come on, I did not send for her.) I had two pints of beer, I went down to work, after I had been down to work, the people were not there, it was very hot weather. I said to an old man who was there, (who would have been here if he had known it). I said it is very hot weather, he said he had been looking for me, he would go and get a pint of beer, and work later in the evening, I did not stay ten minutes, we went up to the Crown and had two quarts of beer, and then another; it drew on to about six o'clock; as this man and I were going down to the field, we met the people coming up that work with me. I said where are you going to? They said they were going to see for me; they said they had sent the girl for some beer, the mother of the girl was with me at the same time, coming up with these people; I asked how long she had been gone; they said an hour and an half. I said, Peter, if they want any beer, do not let us go away to lose all the day, let us go to work, do you go and fetch five pints of beer, the usual allowance; he went: while he was gone, the mother of this girl said, Mr. Jones, I will put some bricks into the barrow, I dare say my girl will be here presently, she is playing about I suppose; the constable and the girl came in before I had made a barrow full of bricks, they took me before the justice, I had no money to get witnesses, and since I have been committed my wife has laid-in; the parents of the girl have been to my wife and extorted money from her; they said they must have half a crown to throw the clause out; they said they must have some money, they could not make it up for less than twenty pounds; her father said it lay in his power to hang me or set me at liberty. A friend of mine gave him a guinea to see if that would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160028"/> pacify him; he took that and got drunk, then he pretended he would come down and release me; here is a witness who heard the mother say, that she could tell the girl to say any thing, and make her swear any thing, they wanted five or six shillings a week of me till twenty pounds were paid.</p>

               <p>This prosecution is carried on by the governors and guardians of the poor of the parish of Clerkenwell; they have kept the girl in the work-house, without the parents having access to her ever since this affair, for the parents, the father particularly, would no doubt have taken a sum of money.</p>
               <p>Nichols, She said she could make the girl swear any thing, or could make her swear that she was asleep, and knew nothing about it; she said she could make the girl swear, that it being nine weeks ago, that she had forgot what she said, and she said the girl could give change for a guinea as well as she; and that was the reason she could make her swear any thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Jones the surgeon, has disclosed to me a circumstance, that as it makes for the prisoner, I think it equally my duty that it should be laid before the court.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Mr. Jones, you will please to state to the court what answer the girl gave to you upon a question you put to her? - I asked her what occasioned the appearance, she said she had been ravished; I then asked her whether she perceived an emission; indeed, I asked her whether she perceived any wetness coming from the man; she told me she did not.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you ask her the question? - At the hospital, I asked her the question two or three different times; I believe the sister of the ward was present; I am not positive; she always said she did not, till two or three days afterwards; then she said that the blood coming from her; probably, she did not perceive it; but it was three days after, that she said that.</p>
               <p>I believe no one could have access to her there but the sister of the ward and the people there? - Her mother, I saw with her there.</p>

               <p>No one has had access to her during the last fortnight? - No, only her father and mother, and I always stood by while they were there: the father and mother are I believe abandoned people, but the girl seems a sober, pretty behaved girl as ever was.</p>
               <p>I believe the father wanted to make it up? - The father said the life of the man was of no service to him; he thought there was to be recompense made the parish if he was to be cast; and he thought he should get it; he said he thought if he could get fourteen or fifteen guineas, it would be of more service to them than the man's life.</p>

I broke open her chamber-door and she was gone: my wife missed the things. I printed some hand-bills, and the watch was found. She went away without the least notice; she was taken at the Dog and Duck, with part of my wife's things upon her, One of my spoons was in her pocket; we put her in a boat to bring her to town; when she was in the boat, we asked her what she had done with the rest of the things; she said she had left them at a public-house at the Dog and Duck. I staid in the boat with her, and the two officers went on shore and fetched the bundle from Deptford; coming up the river, she said she could not tell where she had pawned the spoons, but she would show us; we went with her to Mr. Smith's in East-Smithfield; there we found four teaspoons and a large spoon; she then took us to Mr. Morgan's. We took her before the justice, who committed her.</p>

On the 11th of August the prisoner and another man came to my master's shop, and asked to look at some handkerchiefs; they looked at several; while the shopman was serving them, as I was going into the back parlour, I looked over my shoulder and saw the prisoner putting these handkerchiefs in his left-hand-pocket; I came back into the shop; the shopman desired me to cut off a handkerchief for the prisoner; while he went to the door, the prisoner, suspecting as I imagine that he was discovered, took an opportunity to draw the handkerchiefs out of his pocket. I said I thought he was come on such an errand as that; he then ran away as fast as he could; I cried, stop thief! and he was pursued and taken. When he was brought back, and was in the back parlour, I heard the prisoner desire the other man to put some books which he had into his inside pocket, where I said he put the handkerchiefs, that it might appear there was not room for the handkerchiefs.</p>

On the 11th of September last I had been making the fire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160031"/> for my father and mother; as I passed by the prisoner's apartment, the prisoner called to me, and desired me to fetch him sixpence-worth of halfpence; I fetched it, and laid the change down upon the table which was near the bed side; this was between seven and eight in the morning; the prisoner was then in bed. The deceased was in a chair sitting in the same room; and which chair was about a yard and half from the bed. I was going away after I had laid down the change; the prisoner bid me stop and sit down; I sat down at the feet of the bed; I had not sat down there above the space of a minute, when the deceased made use of some expressions or other, but what the particulars were I do not know; I cannot say whether they were words of passion or heat, or words of contempt; but some expressions fell from the deceased, which were addressed to the prisoner. The prisoner immediately after the words were spoken, snatched up a pair of scissars from a table that was near the bed side; and sitting up in bed, he threw these scissars at the deceased. I cannot tell how they were thrown; whether they were taken up by the point, or whether they were taken up by the handles; whether they were closed or open, but I saw the scissars hit the deceased; she immediately clapped her hand to her neck; and I, seeing the blood run down her arm, ran out and called for assistance. The poor woman died in five or six minutes afterwards; I did not see her again till after she was dead. The deceased had lain up in the garret all the preceding night.

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner. About eight in the morning, on the 11th of September, Mrs. Fleming came to my house, and said she believed there was murther committed between Monday and Robinson; she was generally known by the name of Monday, I ran then directly and met the deceased a few yards from the door; she was then upright coming towards me; there appeared to be a quantity of blood running from her neck; I put my hand to the wound; but when I removed my hand from the wound, the deceased herself put her own hand there. The deceased never spoke a single word to me during the whole time I was with her; she was then about six yards from her own room; she dropped down in three or four minutes, and died very soon after. I was in company with the prisoner and the deceased over night; some words passed between them in my presence. The deceased had told me that morning, that they had had words that very morning.</p>

               <p>I live within thirty yards of the prisoner. I came up about five minutes after the deceased had fallen down; I saw her shrink up her shoulders in the act of dying, and she died immediately after. Myself and another person attempted to break open the prisoner's door to apprehend him: he had made the door very fast. I got an old pistol in order to intimidate him, and went round to his apartment; there I saw the window broke, and some mats put up to the window in order to keep out the cold; I removed some of those mats; there I saw the prisoner still in bed; I forced myself through the window and went up to him and seized him. He said, is she dead? I told him she was dead enough; and I said you have done a very rash action. The reply he made to it was, I know I have, good Lord pray for me: I have done it with the scissars! I saw the scissars lie upon the floor, and there was a stream of blood which followed the deceased's body, and a quantity of blood where the deceased dropped. I took the prisoner before the magistrate and he was committed; as he was going before the magistrate, he was forced to step over the body of the deceased; he looked at the body as he was going over it, and said, he hoped the mob would pray for him.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the deceased; I found the carotid artery was wounded, by which means the whole blood was exhausted. This was undoubtedly the immediate cause of her death. The wound appeared to have been made by a pointed instrument with an edge to it.</p>
               <p>Could it have been caused if the scissars had been closed at the time? - No; they must have been expanded before the neck<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160032"/> was struck; if they had been thrown close, they must have expanded of course. The instrument is very loose in the river; I apprehend they must have expanded in less than two feet.</p>

               <p>I went out with some goods last Thursday; I came home about twelve in the day; she was not in the way. I boiled some potatoes; this woman's sister-in-law, an Irishwoman that lives up stairs, received her monthly money; this Irishwoman came, and met this woman in the passage; she said, Dolly, will you have a dram of your brother's money; no, says this woman that stands here, I will give a dram to Robinson, because he is good to the children. I was coming home, the deceased met us; she was very angry; she was always jealous of my spending my money with people; she made a noise; I shut the door and went up stairs; she went up and laid in the Irishwoman's room all night. She came in between seven and eight; there were no words between us. I gave her two-pence for a dram; she brought it, and we drank together; she was saying that I was giving my liquor away to those that would not serve me; I was going to treat this woman; the deceased gave me ill language; I threw the scissars at her; but God knows! not with an intention to hurt her.</p>

I had not seen him before; Boyle knocked me down against the wall with his fist; I then saw another man come over the way; I rose, and this man followed me round to the workhouse where there is a dead wall, and there knocked me down a second time; then there were three of them: I laid myself upon my belly to prevent their getting at my pockets; one took me by my throat and turned me upon my back, and took my watch and three guineas, and six-pence worth of halfpence out of my pocket; and they likewise took a coat, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a black silk neckcloth out of my bag; for I buy and sell old clothes. I cannot be positive as to M'Carty; the other man that struck me with the stick is not taken. On the Friday following, when I was in New Gravel-lane, I saw Boyle with two women; they were dragging him along by his hands; I passed him, and then I turned back and looked in his face; Boyle said, d - n you! why do you look so hard in my face? I said how did you come by that neckcloth; he said, he bought it on board a ship half a year ago for nine-pence. I claimed this neckloth, and charged him with knocking me down; he then took off the neckcloth and held it in his right hand; I said he should go to the Barley-Mow. I was assisted by one Evans and another man to take him there; then we took him to the Black Horse; there the prisoner refusing to let go the neckcloth, we handcuffed him, and then it was taken from him; at the same time, I found my watch at the house the two prisoners lodged at.</p>

               <p>I attend at Justice Campher's office. On the 10th of August I was sent for to the Barley-Mow; there I saw Boyle, Johnson, and one Evans; the prosecutor charged Boyle with having knocked him down, and that he and two others had robbed him; Boyle had at this time a black silk neckcloth in both his hands; the prosecutor said it was his. I seized Boyle, and desired he would let go the neckcloth; he was very unwilling to do it; at length I got it from him by force; I took him to the Black Horse, and then went to his lodgings. I found a watch in a chest there; the prosecutor said before he saw it, that if it was his watch, it had a single case, and the glass was broke; I found it to answer that description; I sealed up the watch together with the neckcloth under my own seal, and left it at the Black Horse; I had it from thence last Tuesday, sealed up in the same manner I left it.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was that time? - Because the dial was just by me where I sat at the public-house; it was about ten minutes after nine o'clock. I heard of the robbery next day when they were taken up.</p>

I was going down Ludgate-hill with two parcels, one contained buckles; I do not know what was in the other; I was going with one to Salisbury-court, and the other to the Strand; the prisoner Elburn came behind me, and asked me the way to the Strand; I told him, if he would go with me I would show him, but that I was going first to Salisbury-court; he took me up an alley that goes to <placeName id="t17780916-54-crimeloc271">Salisbury-court</placeName>

Goodburn took the parcel from under my arm, and said he would hold it while he sent me to the Temple to find a gentleman; he went part of the way with me; I could not find the gentleman; when I came back they were both gone; I received the parcels from my master Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards. On the 15th of August I delivered a parcel of buckles, containing thirty-three pair, and a parcel of sword hilts to my boy the last witness; the one he was to take to Salisbbury-court, the other to the Strand; the prisoners were taken, and acknowledged to me before several witnesses, that they took them from my boy; there was a pair found in Elburn's shoes; the rest were found at Mr. Price's, the corner of Drury-lane, Holborn.</p>

In the beginning of March, the prisoner took a lodging in a house of mine that I let out in lodgings; she was to pay three shillings a week; she continued in the lodging about four months; she paid but about twelve shillings in the four months; I was informed she had left the lodging. I thought I was not justified to break open the door. I met the prisoner, and talked to her about paying for the lodging; she then confessed she had taken the things, and that they were pawned at a Mr. Warham's, and a Mr. Lightfoot's.</p>

My husband was so bad, he was obliged to go to the hospital; and as I was coming from the hospital, the prosecutor took me up.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. The deceased was brought to me on Saturday morning the 18th of April, the day after Good Friday; I examined the head and found it exceedingly soft all round; the skin was slightly discoloured: the contents I thought necessary to discharge. I should suppose it was occasioned by a fall, or a blow from some blunt instrument; all the upper part of the skull was entirely hollow; it was impossible to tell whether it was done by one or more blows; I took upwards of four ounces of blood out of it; I dressed it, and the child went home. There must have been a considerable deal of violence: he was brought to me again the next morning; I dressed him again, and ordered his head to be fomented; he was brought on Monday and I dressed him again; I did not see him again till Tuesday night; he was something worse then; and on Wednesday he was sent to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Mr. VALENTINE JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at St. Bartholomew's. The deceased was brought to the hospital on Wednesday the 22d of April; I saw him the next day, and perceiving the wound on his head, I asked him the cause of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he apprised that his case was very dangerous? - I apprehend not; he was not from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you must not mention any thing he said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones. I observed a wound and a discharge from it; it was an external wound; it did not appear to me to be a dangerous one; he had been brought on the Saturday preceeding to have the advice of the surgeons; I was present. Mr. Crane ordered the woman that brought him to get his head shaved, and put a spirituous application to it; and thought it would have subsided, and in all probability it would, if they had taken his advice. I have seen many cases of greater contusions that have subsided; but it was not done. I paid particular attention to him when he was in the house; there was but one or two days that I did not see him; he had a great degree of sever on him; the wound got worse; a large quantity of matter gathered, which induced me to make an opening to let it out; I was then in hopes it would have healed; but his sever continuing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160040"/> very bad: there was no disposition to heal; I believe he was in the hospital eighteen days. I went into the country, on my return, I understood he was dead; it is difficult for me to say what was the cause of his death, but I believe it was owing to his bad state of health; I did not know his history before he received the wound; but I should think, abstractedly from the blow, that he must have had a fever on him; when I saw him I opened his head; there was nothing preternatural to be seen; there was no kind of fracture or any injury to the brain; I found every thing in its natural state, as a person would be in his perfect health; I think his death might have happened abstracted from this wound.</p>

I was coming down Gloucester-street and I saw two men at the top of it, that alarmed me a good deal; one stood under a balcony on the left-hand as you go down the street into the square; the other stood on the opposite side. When I came down farther in the street the coach stopped; I was so prepossessed that the coach was stopped by those men I had seen, that I called out instantly. As the coach stopped I heard two men's voices speaking to the coachman. I was so much alarmed that I called for help. One man opened the coach door and came into the coach, and I think shut the door on me; I still called for help; the man held a flat piece of wood at me in his left hand, and bid me look at that, and make baste, on which I put my hand in my pocket and gave him seven guineas and a half, as I found by counting my money afterwards. It was neither a knife nor a pistol that he held to me; it seemed to me to be a piece of flat wood.</p>
               <p>Had he demanded your money before? - No, only said make baste; I understood that to be to deliver my money.</p>
               <p>I suppose you was much frightened upon this occasion? - The man used no ill language; and I was in a public street, where I did not suppose that I could be attacked without immediate assistance. When the man was gone out of the coach, I called out stop thief! and some gentlemen came instantly to my assistance; the men were pursued; and I was taken home, and I saw nothing further of him till next morning. I believe the prisoner is the man, but I cannot swear to him, for I did not make much observation of his person I was so considerably alarmed, not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160041"/> finding any body come to my assistance; by his being immediately taken, I should suppose him to be the person. I went home immediately; I live in Queen's-square, Bloomsbury. I was informed that night, that the man was taken it was a little man that got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether you had ever seen me before I was brought to the office? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What sort of a night was it? - A very fine night; I know it was not rainy; I believe it was star light, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Jury. You said the person was a little man; the prisoner does not appear to be a little man? - I should call him a little man; it was a man of the size of the prisoner, as near as my fears would give me an opportunity to judge; there were two men, one in the coach, the other at the head of the horses; I heard the men talking with the coachman as the coach stopped, which alarmed me a great deal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady said before the justice it was dark, and she believed me not to be one of the persons. - I said at the justice's, that I believed him to be the man, but did not give it upon my oath.</p>

               <p>I am a hackney coachman. I took up Mrs. Este at Craven-street in the Strand; I was to carry her to Queen's-square, Bloomsbury. When I was in Gloucester-street, two men came up, one stopped me and stood at the head of the horses, the other got into my coach; the man that stopped me, ran by the side of the horses ched hold of my near side horse, turned about to me, and told me he would blow my brains out, if I did not stop; before I could stop my horses, the other man got into my coach; I am positive the prisoner is the man that got into the coach and robbed the lady; I am positive to his person. When I was coming down Great Queen-street, Lincoln-inn Fields; as I turned in to Little Queen-street, I observed a man to stagger as if he was in liquor; he staggered up to the coach door, and seemed to look into the coach; and that man to the best of my knowledge, was the man that stopped the coach in Gloucester-street; I did not then observe any body else with him; I did not observe any thing further till I was stopped; I saw the prisoner get into the coach and get out again; he had a light drab coat on; I believe he was in the coach two or three minutes; the other man turned first on one side of the coach, then on the other, and said d - n her a bitch, kill her! When the prisoner came out of the coach I kept my eye upon him, and drove after him as far as I could drive, with the lady in the coach; there was a cry of stop thief! he that stopped the horses ran first, the other ran after him; they went towards Queen's-square; within six or seven minutes the prisoner was taken; the other escaped: I lost sight of him before he was taken. I could not leave my coach; he was taken to the watch-house; I went and saw him there immediately; when I came to the watch-house, the constable of the night called me in and asked me if I should know the man; the man had his hat taken off, and all the rest of the people; there were I suppose between twenty and. thirty people there; I picked him out from amongst them; it was a dollish evening: it was not moon-light.</p>
               <p>What leads you to be so positive that the prisoner is the person that got into the coach? - It was right opposite a lamp.</p>
               <p>I should think your attention would be more engaged by the man at the horses than the other? - When he stopped me I did not think there was any body else with him; I heard the coach door open; I turned my head and saw him get into the coach, and my eye was full upon him when he got out of the coach and ran away.</p>
               <p>The lady said she entertained a suspicion of two people that she saw at the top of the street, and when she saw the coach stop, she cried out stop thief! did the people get about then? - By the lady's screaming, the horses, being stallions, fell a fighting; as they were frightened they broke the harness all to pieces; I stopped them; that alarmed the neighbourhood, and several people came.</p>
               <p>Consider the prisoner's life depends upon your testimony; now can you positively swear that the prisoner is the man that got into the coach and robbed the lady? - I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160042"/>(On his cross examination, he said his horses became unruly through the lady's screaming out, while the prisoner was in the coach robbing the lady, and continued unruly till after he was gone; and the lady was taken out by two gentlemen and carried to her habitation; he said he should be sorry to take a man's life away, if he was not sure; but that he knew him well, that he would sooner have taken up the other man, because of the imprecations he used to the lady; he said he swore to the prisoner by his dress; that when he singled him out at the watch-house, he was among the rest of the people, and that no one had hold of him, nor was he handcuffed, nor any thing of that sort to point him out; and that there was nobody dressed like him.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The constable of the night took hold of me by the arm, and asked him if I was not the man that robbed the coach? - No such thing was said.</p>

I ran after the man and called out stop thief! at the same time; he turned up a little street that leads to Devonshire-street; I ran after him, and continued to call stop thief! A man came from the Brown Bear, in Devonshire-street to Boswell-court, and said he was gone; then we perceived something of a man running in Boswell-court; I ran there again, and cried stop thief! At the corner of Boswell-court, I lost sight of him again; I looked down East-street, and saw a man running or walking; I believe he was running down East-street; I pursued again, and cried stop thief! I saw him cross over the street to the left hand side of the way, and he went up between number 31 and 32, and stood with his back between the two doors; the watchman came out from the corner of Harper-street, just going to cry the half hour; I went over to him, and he took hold of him on one side, and I took hold of him on the other side; the people following after came up, and I left him in the hands of the watchman, and the other people, and went home to my master's house, as it was about supper time; they carried him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was the person that was taken in custody the prisoner? - I cannot say that he is.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was he dressed? - In a light coloured surtout coat; and he was a thinish man.</p>
               <p>Jury. Before you lost sight of him the first time was you near enough to observe his dress or make? - No; he appeared to be a littleish man.</p>
               <p>Did not you distinguish what colour clothes he had when you saw him get out of the coach? - I did not see him get out of the coach, I only saw him run from the coach, but did not take notice of his dress.</p>
               <p>How long do you think the period was till he was taken? - I do not suppose it could be above ten minutes at the most.</p>

I joined the pursuit, and rung my rattle directly. When I first came up, the coach stood still. I saw a man running in a light-coloured coat; I pursued that man; he run down a passage into Devonshire-street, and cross Devonshire-street into Boswell court; I lost sight of him just by the court; I turned the corner, and again saw him running; I kept turning my rattle; one of our watchmen came up and laid hold of him almost facing the Turk's Head in East-street; I am sure he was the same person that we had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160043"/> been pursuing; the prisoner is the man we took up; we took him away to the watch-house; he had on a light-coloured great coat.</p>

Soon after I had taken him to the watch-house, the man that drove the hackney-coach came up; they asked him which was the man; there was, I suppose, twenty or thirty people in the watch-house; they all pulled off their hats; the prisoner stood with his back to the fire-place; the coachman directly pointed and said, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Were there any other persons in light clothes besides the prisoner? - I cannot say; there might be a good many, but I did not in my fright take notice of any other people. I left him there, and went back again. When I took him he seemed much out of wind, and in a sweat.</p>

They said there was a thief; then I cried stop thief! the watchman laid hold of me, and said may be you are the thief; they dragged me from one to another; my breast was open; when the coachman came in, he asked to see the prisoner; I asked him if he ever saw me before; he said he did not know me; but before he left the watch-house, he said he believed I was one of the men; the next morning he said he was positive that I was one. The justice asked him about the other man that had the pistol; he said he was frightened. He was asked how he could know the man that was in the carriage, as the carriage door was behind him; he said he knew him by his coat. When I had done work at the Six Clerk's Office, Chancery-lane, two or three of us went to a publick house in Bloomsbury; I was returning from thence to my lodgings when I was taken hold of.</p>

I apprehended one Mason for robbing one Mr. Price's warehouses in the Borough, and he confessed being concerned with Farmer in this robbery, and told me where the bowls were. Mason was an evidence against Farmer at Guildford; I lodged a detainer against him, but he was discharged. I found the bowls, by the direction of Mason, at one Millan's, who is convicted, and on board the lighters. The prisoner said before the justice, that Mason and he broke the prosecutor's house open, and the prisoner wanted to be admitted an evidence. They both of them confessed it; they said it was done at one o'clock, and that there was 2 dog in the yard.</p>

Farmer let us in; I found nothing there but a few of their own things. When they were before the justice they began quarrelling which should be admitted an evidence, and both confessed the robbery.

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Dobey, a pawnbroker in Holbourn; I took in this coat of the prisoner on the night of the 24th of July; I lent him sixteen shillings on it; he said he made it for his own wear; it was about his size.</p>

               <p>I worked for the prosecutor. Work being slack I took a coat of my own to alter; I went out and got a little in liquor; not being fit to work, I tied up the coat; I thought it was my own, and went and pledged it.</p>
               <p>Jury to the prosecutor. Did he leave his own coat when he took away your's? - I did not see any other; he frequently brought small parcels; I did not know what they were; he said he had a coat to alter; mine was a new coat.</p>

On the 24th of August, while I was up stairs, I heard my wife cry out murther; I ran down and saw all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them,) lie on the floor in the shop; my wife informed me that a man who was running away without a hat had robbed her; for he had left his hat in the shop; I pursued him as far as Beech lane; he turned and looked at me; I knew his face; I had seen him before; when he came to Beech-lane I lost sight of him; I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

I was about ten minutes with this carriage; then I returned into the shop. In three or four minutes afterwards the prisoner went away.

When I returned into the shop from the carriage the drawer was out; it had been taken out by my husband; the prisoner went away in about the space of three or four minutes after I came in; I know there were two such feals in the drawer; these seals were found about a month or six weeks afterwards, exposed to sale, at one Mr. Dartnall's shop, a silversmith in Oxford-street; they were worth fifty shillings.</p>

               <p>I am a silversmith in Oxford-road. Sometime in November last the prisoner came to my shop, and offered me a gold seal upon his watch chain to sale, and a cornelian stone seal, set in gold; he asked a guinea for it; I gave him sixteen shillings, and thought it a fair price to a gentleman for a second hand seal; two or three days afterwards the prisoner came again to my shop, and offered another cornelian seal, set in gold; this second seal I did not think so strongly mounted as the former, therefore I thought it not of so much value, and offered only fourteen shillings; the prisoner said, he thought it of as much value as the other, however he accepted the fourteen shillings. In about three weeks or a month after this Mr. Cartwright came into my shop, saying, he saw two seals exposed in my window that were his property, and desired me, if I could recollect the person of whom I bought them to stop him; after this, I do not know but it might be the end of the month of November, but it was a considerable time before Christmas that the prisoner called again at my shop, and offered another seal to sell which was made of a composition. Thought I had been desired by Mr. Cartwright to stop the man of whom I bought the seals, the prisoner had so much the appearance of a gentleman, that I could not prevail upon myself to stop him, but I acquainted Mr. Cartwright with it, and in few days after I was summoned before the justice's in Litchfield-street; they said it concerned myself and my character to stop the person of whom I bought these seals. In a few days after the prisoner came in order to sell a locket to me; then I stopped him, and he freely went with me before a justice.</p>
               <p>[The seals were produced in court, and deposed to by Mrs. Cartwright.]</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I received these seals. After I had been in Spring-garden Coffee-house with two officers, one Mr. Johnson, an English officer, and one Mr. Miller, a German officer; they asked me several times to lend them some money; I had lent them three guineas; Mr. Miller came and asked me for two guineas more to save him from being arrested. I lent him twenty-seven shillings, and took these seals of him; he said he would give it me in six or eight days in that coffee-house; he used to come there almost every morning to take his soup. I asked for them; they did not come there for three weeks after. I was informed of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160051"/> other officer there, that he had set out for France. I walked from the silversmith's shop; I had been several times there; he cannot say I have not behaved like a gentleman. I asked him to buy these seals; he asked me what value I set upon them; I said they had been offered me for money, I do not know the value of them; he gave me sixteen shillings; after three days I went to the same shop, taking this other seal from my watch chain; he paid me fourteen shillings for it; he saw me behave like a gentleman; I afterwards walked in Oxford-road by his door; he said, will you walk in; I said, yes; what is the matter? he said the two seals he had bought of me had been missed out of a shop in Bond-street; I said, Sir, I hope you will not think I am capable of such low things, as to take them; I would tell him in what manner I had come by them; he said he could do no other then stop me, and I must go before the justice; I said I was ready to go, for I was innocent: a coach was called; I was taken to the justice; I told him by what means I came by the seals; the justice said I was intirely innocent, but he said, that by the laws of this, country, if I could not find this gentleman out that I had the things of, I must be put in the same shoes, which alarmed me very much; I was bailed by that gentleman near my counsel; I should never let these things lie on my honour. I have been known by gentlemen of honour, character, and property. I said I would go and find the man that gave me this seal; I went and enquired for the two officers; I was informed they were gone to Paris; I set out after this German officer; I had seen him before in Holland; I went through all Flanders, but could not find him; I went all over Holland; nobody could give me intelligence of him; I left my family here; I am married to a respectable family in England; I was sure, if I could not clear my character I should be lost; I went to the Prussian Ambassador, and told him what had passed. I served the King of Prussia seven years as first surgeon of a regiment; the Ambassador said, I could have a regiment of the King of Prussia's when I got back, if I would leave my wife and family; I said, no, I could not leave my wife and children; I came back, and told my friends that had bailed me, in what manner I had done every thing that a gentleman could do for his honour and character, but could not find him; they were all very sorry till I appeared; I cannot say that this lady ever left me alone in the shop.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>This drawer from which these seals were lost; was it kept within your shop, or exposed in the window? - Within the shop. It is a drawer that is in a glass case, that is fixed on the counter.</p>

               <p>I am a watchmaker. Dr. Gabelhousan came to lodge with me in 1775; he lodged with me about a year and three-quarters; no man could behave better; he always paid me regularly every week; he gave me a guinea a week for the first thirty weeks. After that he said, Mr. Perwin, I shall be in town in England about a year longer; I hope you will make it easy as I stay so long. So as he staid a year longer, I let him have it at sixteen shillings a week; he always behaved like a gentleman, and kept good hours; he never wanted to be denied to any body. He married a Mr. Pitt's sister of Monmouthshire; he had a good deal of company sometimes, and plate and other silver things were about. I never lost any thing, nor had any suspicion of him.</p>

The prisoner was at my shop on Monday the 17th or 18th of August; he asked me to let him look at some dozens of buckles; I had never seen him before to my knowledge; before I showed him any, I looked at his person a good deal, because he asked for dozens; it is unusual to sell plate by dozens. I asked if he wanted plated buckles; he said, no; for the term of plate in the trade is so much per ounce, and so much for fashion; he said he was a tradesman, and was going to Hamburgh. I looked at him very much; it appeared odd to me that he should ask me such a question, but seeing the man creditably dressed, I did not suspect him; I thought he might, being a stranger, make a mistake in the language. I took out a drawer and showed him some silver buckles; he looked out two or three pair; then he asked to see some more; I was rather loth to show him any more; but my wife being behind the counter, I gave her a wink; there was besides a sailor and a captain in the shop, and another gentleman, who is now in court; when the prisoner had looked out three or four pair, I told Mrs. Bendix, in Hebrew, that she should take care; I put the drawer in, and then took out another drawer; he picked out two or three pair from the drawer, and laid them down on the counter himself; he looked two or three pair out of the other drawer; he asked for more; I put that drawer away and showed him another; while he was looking at that, which was the third drawer, I suspected that he had some scheme or another, and that he did not mean to buy, for he chose a broken buckle of one pattern along with another odd buckle; from that circumstance I saw that he was not a buyer nor a trader, yet I thought I would give him his way, and see what he was about. His appearance deceived me; I gave as much attention as I could to his hands; he took out a purse; seeing It was pretty well loaded, I did not suspect him; it was a close worked purse, so I did not see what was in it; but it appeared before the justice that it was filled with foreign farthings. He asked for the first drawer again; I dare say in all he looked over ten or a dozen drawers, containing to the amount of three or four hundred pair of buckles; among all the drawers he chose thirteen pair of silver steel chaped buckles; I told him, you had better make it even, there is thirteen; O, said he, it does not signify; let me look at some knee-buckles; he behaved very genteel and polite, and made use of a great many compliments. Mrs. Bendix took out a drawer with knee-buckles; there were then upon the counter three or four drawers of knee buckles and shoe buckles; he had his handkerchief almost in constant motion, in this form, (describing it) rubbing his hands with it, and so on; then he pulled off his gloves and put them on again; then he took out the buckles; I could not see whether he took any thing or no, for his hands were very quick with his handkerchief and gloves; there was a pair of knee-buckles handed over to him by my wife; a knee-buckle fell down, but whether she dropped it, or the prisoner, I will not take upon me to say; however it dropped; I stooped, and Mrs. Bendix stooped, and I believe the gentlemen in the shop stooped likewise; whether he took that opportunity to take the buckles, or put them in the gloves or handkerchief, I cannot say; but he took a pair of silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner stoop also as well as you? - No; he stood up. He chose thirteen pair of knee-buckles out of the different drawers; we laid them by with the others. He then asked for some silver buckles that the chapes and tongues were all silver; he looked out six pair of them; I asked him whether he wanted any all silver knee-buckles; he said, no; but he should want some second-hand watches; but I showed him none; I was lifting up the flap of the counter to go and weigh these buckles in the scales. I heard somebody say I will be here at five o'clock, after 'Change, and he was gone all at once. He never asked the price per ounce, or for fashion, or any thing whatsoever. I was startled at his going away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160053"/> in that manner; I said to my wife, this man has robbed me. I put the goods in a paper which I was going to weigh in the scales, and threw them behind the counter upon a board, and desired my wife to put all the drawers in; the gentleman remained in the shop, and I went after the prisoner in my morning gown and my night cap; I followed him up Tower-Hill; I was not positive he had taken any thing, but I intended to follow him, to see whether he would go into any other silversmith's shop, so that I might enquire what his business was there, or tell the shop-keeper how I had been served. I saw him turn round very short sometimes, and look back; whether he did not know me, or did not see me, I cannot say. When he came upon the hill, he turned very short into an alley; I followed him as close as I could, and saw him just get into a pawnbroker's shop, the corner of Catherine's lane, where I since understand he offered my buckles for sale. His dress, person, and appearance were so good, that I was afraid to challenge him. I stood at the corner of the lane, so that I could see him come out. I called a fruit woman, and bid her go in to the master of the shop, and tell him a gentleman wanted to speak to him; the prisoner instantly came out; as soon as he saw me he was startled; I said, Sir, you must go home along with me; he made me no answer but I be a gentleman, O Sir, I be a gentleman, and he came and squeezed my hand; I held him by the coat; I said he should come along with me; he said, he would go and treat me with some liquor in a house; I could get no English out of him then, whereas before he spoke very good English. I took him to my house; he wanted me to go to a publick house, the sign of the Hamburgh Arms, where the Bremen captains use; I sent for the person who keeps the house; he said he did not know the prisoner. I told the prisoner he had certainly robbed me; I asked him, what he did do at the pawnbroker's: a mob came and said I should secure him; I asked for a peace officer, I could not get one; I asked him what he had got belonging to me, he would not say any thing for a long time but I be a gentleman, I married to such a great lady; and he mentioned the Earl of Denbigh, and Mr. Pitt, and Dr. Franklin; at last he asked to speak with me alone, I said I would not speak with him alone; I asked him what he had robbed me of; at last he said I have got no more than one pair; and he took a pair of buckles out of his pocket; he took hold of my hand and kissed it, and begged for God sake I would let him go, for he was a gentleman, and it would spoil his character for ever; I told him that as he was a gentleman and behaved in that manner, that I would be as severe upon him as the law would allow; he then offered me two half guineas and a watch which he took out of his pocket with some silver, which he offered me to let him go. I sent to the pawnbroker's, and was informed that he had offered to sell the buckles; I took him before Justice Clarke and he was committed; the buckles he produced to me had no other mark than the hall stamp and the maker's name; I knew I had two pair of the same pattern. I examined my buckles and found one pair missing; nobody had been in my shop after the prisoner. (On his cross examination he said that he had seen the buckles in the drawer a day or two before, that they had never been sold, that he could swear to them; that when the prisoner gave them to him, he said he took but one pair, and there they are, and gave them to him.)</p>

               <p>I was present in Mr. Bendix's shop when the prisoner came back again; I saw him deliver the buckles to Mr. Bendix; he said don't make a noise, I will give you a guinea and my watch to let me go; afterwards he said I took the buckles because I had not money enough to go home; these are the buckles (producing them.)</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said that when the prisoner was brought back, the prosecutor said you certainly have taken something of mine; and said he would send for a peace officer; that the prisoner then said, don't make a noise here are the buckles, and I will give you a guinea and my watch; don't say any thing.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I live in Manor-row, the top of St. Catherine's lane. On Monday the 17th of August the prisoner came to my shop and offered to sell this pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160054"/> silver buckles; I asked him if he wanted to pledge them; he said no to sell them. I said I did not choose to buy them, and I gave them to him again; he was met at the door by Mr. Bendix, I am certain the prisoner is the person; I perceived the buckles were new and therefore I did not choose to buy them. I weighed them, they weighed an ounce and three quarters.</p>

               <p>Gentleman, you will remember I told you I had been in Holland; I bought these buckles in a shop in Rotterdam; several gentlemen there desired me to bring some new fashioned buckles; I put these buckles into my pocket with intention to buy fashionable buckles; I was to send some beer and cheese aboard for the Prussian ambassador; I went to enquire for Captain Wilcox at a publick-house in St. Catherine's, I went there to him; they said I should see him upon 'Change; I went into this shop, not knowing that I came among a set of Jews; I said I saw some buckles in his windows which would do for foreign countries; I asked what he asked an ounce for the buckles, he said he did not sell them by the ounce but by the pair; I saw a great many buckles in different drawers; a captain came in at the moment I was to talk with him over the buckles with a watch to mend; he catched the watch from the captain and looked over it, the time was long for me; I said Mr. Bendix, let these buckles be together; I shall certainly be here at five o'clock; I am going to 'Change; because I thought to embark this beer and cheese at five o'clock; this man who is in his heart a Jew; his own heart being not clear, he thought I must be a thief. I intended when I bought some buckles to change my buckles; so soon as I walked out of the shop, not thinking that any body watched me, and not knowing that it was a pawnbroker's shop I went into it; I said, Sir, what are these buckles worth? He said will you pawn them, I said no, then Bendix came after me, and said you have been in my shop; have you not seen some buckles; not knowing what to say, I was in such a part of the town, I did not see a gentleman there; I said come with me to the publick-house I came from; I was afraid these blackguards would murther me. So soon as I came into the shop he locked the door; he asked me what had I been in that shop about; I said I went to see what was the worth of these buckles; in this moment he thought that the buckles must be his property. This gentleman and another tore my shirt; they beat me in the eyes that I thought I should be murthered; the door was shut, and three or four Jews about me beating me; they tore me by my coat before the justice; I asked for a coach, not to go among a thousand blackguards: no I should not have a coach. As soon as I came before the justice I was kept in a publick-house, at the same time my prosecutor was going to the justice's; I went before a justice

Barnard came and pulled a parcel of papers out of a bag and wrote what they liked: Barnard said to Bristowe, we must swear one has been at such a place, and the other has been at such a place; Bristowe said that would do very well; he wrote something and hurled it over the table for us to sign.</p>
               <p>What place did he say they must say you had been at? - He said one at Calais, the other place I cannot remember; he then ordered us to set our hands to that writing; then Bristowe told Norton he must pay Barnard five guineas; Norton scrupled it and wanted a receipt; Barnard asked him if he disputed his being a gentleman; Norton then paid the five guineas; then Bristowe said I must pay Barnard five guineas; there was nothing said what Barnard was, we did not know we were to have any thing to do with any body but Bristowe; we asked what Barnard was; Bristowe said it cost him three or four hundred pounds to learn the business, and would we take the business out of his hands. I paid him five guineas.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about crossing the salt water? - That gentleman said something about crossing the salt water over a piss-pot, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>What good were you to receive for the five guineas? - We were to be discharged in two or three days by his order; he said something about the insolvent act; we did not know the meaning of it. Norton and I went up to Bristowe the next day; he was in bed; he got up to let us in, and we asked what Barnard's name was; he would not tell us, but began to d - n and sink, and said it cost him four or five hundred pounds to learn this business, and what the devil do you think (says he) I will tell you his name, if you get your business done that is enough for you. I afterwards spoke to a Mr. Williams, and we apprehended them.</p>

That they said, they must make them fugitives, and talked about the Insolvent Act, but he did not know what it meant; that he was quite a stranger to an Insolvent Act, and did not know what it was; that Barnard never told him he was to surrender to a prison; that they told him he should go home in two or three days; that when he saw Bristowe sit drinking all day Sunday and Monday, he was uneasy and wanted to go home; that he never told Barnard he had no effects, but he had assigned them over months before. Being asked if he was to surrender to a prison why he signed the schedule? he said he signed the paper without reading it; that they did never tell him what it was, nor did they say that they were to swear at all.)</p>

               <p>I am a gardener in Leicestershire. I came to town with Bristow and the last witness; we were to be discharged from the incumbrances we were in, but I did not know by what means. We met with Barnard at the Swan with Two Necks in Lad-lane on Sunday; Barnard and Bristowe asked for a private room, when we came into the private room Barnard pulled out a bag of writings and asked me if I intended to be discharged; I said, what do you think I came here for? he said very well, I need say no more to you; and he said to Bristowe we must fix them as fugitives; Bristowe agreed to it, and he began filling these papers up. Bristowe said Barnard was an attorney, that he was the man that was to do the business for us; I asked Bristowe more than once how this was to be done; Bristowe swore it cost him five or six hundred pounds to learn this; and if I tell you or any body, you will take the business out of my hands. I saw Orme pay Barnard five guineas. (A paper shown to Orme.)</p>
               <p>Orme. That is the paper I signed; that is all that was done for the five guineas.</p>
               <p>(Norton on his cross examination said that Bristowe never demanded any money on his own account; that Bristowe had cleared several people in the same manner; that Barnard said we must go over the piss pot and then they could get some Abrahams and Moses's, or somebody, for five shillings and threepence to swear they saw us go over the salt water; that he never said in conversation with a Mr. Fletcher; that he did not want to hurt Bristowe, but only wanted to get a little money to pay his debts; that he never said any thing about this matter to any body, except his wife; that he told Barnard he had assigned his effects over five years before, and had nothing he could call his own but a turnip-hoe, or something he worked with, and that Barnard said he belonged to some prison, but the witness said he did not know any thing was said about surrendering to a prison.</p>

               <p>Barnard said in his defence, that his business was only with Bristowe; that he had nothing to do with the men, that Bristowe was to be his paymaster; that Bristowe told him they were to take the benefit of the act as fugitives; that he asked them if they had been abroad; they said yes, one said at Calais; that he showed them the act, and told them they must make a schedule of their effects, and that they must surrender to a prison, and could be cleared no other way; that he waited at home on the Monday, expecting that they would come and surrender, but saw nothing of them; that on the Wednesday Bristowe told him they were gaping about the town, and he could not find them; that he did not see them again till they came with an officer, and gave charge of them.</p>
