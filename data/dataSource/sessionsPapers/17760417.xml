               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor: upon the 15th of February the prisoner came to my master's shop in order to see some cornelian stones unset; I shewed him some, he tumbled them over; he asked me the price of them; I being but a young lad could not fix the price; I told him to call again in the afternoon, when my master would be at home: he said it would do no good to call again; he went away without purchasing any thing: about a week or nine days after that my master missed the seals.</p>
               <p>JENKIN JONES. A week or ten days after this fifteenth of February I was putting the things to rights, and missed two seals, one a sardonyx with the figure of a woman upon it, another a white cornelian; I advertized these two rings; hearing the account my lad gave of the prisoner having been there, I described the prisoner; I had no effect from that advertisement: upon the Monday my lad and I set out to search the toyshops about; going through Russell-court I obseryed in the window of Mr. Spicer, who is a seal engraver, the sardonyx and the other; I went in and immediately charged these seals as being my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170006"/> property; Mr. Spicer's lad the same day took the prisoner into custody; the other seal the prisoner's father gave me as he was going to justice Welch's; but the father is not here.</p>
               <p>NEHEMIAH SPICER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a seal engraver in Russell-court: upon the fifteenth of February the prisoner came to me and offered two seals to sale, the one a white cornelian and a double seal, the other a sardonyx, and a small little onyx that was unset; I bought only the sardonyx and the onyx of him. (They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor). He asked me twenty shillings for the sardonyx, four shillings for the onyx; he took half a crown; I don't think that is much under the mark; the sardonyx might be worth forty shillings; the onyx is not worth above two.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave two guineas and a half for the sardonyx as set.</p>
               <p>Mr. SPICER. I am positive as to the prisoner; these things lay in my window ten days, when the prosecutor came by and challenged them as his property: my lad as he was going to Bond-street upon some other affair, saw the prisoner that very day, and immediately apprehended him.</p>

               <p>I saw Reynolds running after the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner drop a bundle; we secured the prisoner; then I went and took up the bundle and the leg of pork, we brought the bundle into the house; we took it in to take an inventory of the things.</p>
               <p>The bundle was taken the next day to the justice's; we staid there some time, then it was delivered back to Reynolds.</p>
               <p>The witness read the inventory, containing all the wearing apparel and linen mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>REYNOLDS. This is the bundle (producing it) I looked it over when I brought it from the justice's, and am satisfied it contains the same things now as when it was first brought into the house.</p>

               <p>I am wife to the prosecutor: I can swear to all the things; they were all missing out of the drawers that night; I locked my drawers at two in the afternoon when I went out; they were then safe; they were gone when I came home.</p>

               <p>When they took me I was about fifty yards from the house; Mr. Reynolds is mistaken in saying I was the man that was in the house, for I never was in the house.</p>

               <p>Was there any candle in the shop? - No, it was not dark; it was about half after four o'clock.</p>

               <p>Did you take notice enough of him while he was taking the bundle to know him again? - Yes, while he was taking the bundle down I looked at him, and called stop thief; he ran out of the shop, I am sure he is the person; we got the stockings again; we never took the boy that ran away with them.</p>

There were no more but these people in the back room that day; there were some company in the front room: the chest stood in a corner of my room. When I talked with the prisoner about the particulars, he told me the exact quantity of money that was in this chest, how it was hid in a glove, and the manner in which it was broke open, and every other particular relating to it.</p>

He wanted to see the prosecutor, but I did not take him to him; he hesitated some time, and then declared he opened the man's box on Sunday, and took out a pair of silver buckles, and eleven half guineas, four shillings, and two sixpences; I asked him what he had done with the money; he said the two half-crowns and the four shillings were part of it; that he had laid out some, and had hid nine half guineas in the ground in Paddington fields, but that it was impossible for me to find it unless he went with me, and he would carry me to the place; this was about two o'clock in the morning: I handcuffed him, and with assistance took him near to George's burying ground at Paddington; he shewed me the spot where it was buried; he took up a dirty paper in which was nine half guineas and one guinea; he said he had sold the buckles to a pawnbroker the same evening; I went to the pawnbroker's, but the pawnbroker said he had sold them.</p>
               <p>- FITZGERALD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Murthwaite, a pawnbroker: the prisoner sold the buckles to me that evening; they were sent with some other old silver to the refiner's next morning before I heard from the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>I am constable for Covent Garden theatre: upon Saturday the 13th of April several gentlemen said they had had their pockets picked at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170028"/> the pit door; I went there and took the prisoner upon suspicion, at the pit door towards Bow-street.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Which door did you go in at? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>SMALLWOOD. The prisoner had a purse in his hand; he held it very fast and struggled a long time before I could get it from him: the purse was torn in two in the struggle; I have the part that had the money in it; there were twelve guineas and three half guineas; I secured the prisoner and took him to the office, then I went into the pit and asked if any body had been robbed; the prosecutor came out and said he had lost a purse, and described its contents.</p>

               <p>FARNHAM. One of the half guineas is light; I know it by its being turned up at one edge, and a little defaced. This appears to be part of my purse.</p>

               <p>SMALLWOOD. I had a great struggle with him when I perceived it in his hand; I could not for some time get it out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you pull it in two? - I believe I did; I held him by the collar; he had the purse in his right hand; I said you have got something there, I will have it; he would not give it me; with some other people that came to my assistance I got the purse.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you lay hold of the purse he having hold of the other end? - Yes; and by degrees got his fingers open: I got hold of one end of the purse, he of the other, and we pulled till I got that part of it away. I did not look for the other part.</p>

            ; I asked her whether the occasion of her being so ill was by eating the cake, as was reported; she said, she believed it was, but that the woman that gave it her, she believed, gave it her innocently and not with a design to poison her. I took her to the Rotation Office before Justice Welch, and there, for want of sufficient evidence, she was discharged; on Wednesday the girl died of eating this cake, and upon the Thursday I took the prisoner up again, and then there was a witness that said, she saw the cake making at Flannagan's house: there was a doubt whether she knew Flannagan's house; the justice desired she might go to Flannagan's and somebody should follow her, to see if she knew the house; she went directly to Flannagan's; I followed her.</p>

             after his death; I did not see him while he was ill; the first view of the stomach and bowels upon opening him, was that of proud flesh, which is generally left after an inflammation of those parts; I made an incision into the stomach, and it was corroded and gangrened in several places, evidently arising from some corrosive matter taken into the stomach and endangering the life: I found no particles of any poison in the stomach.</p>
               <p>Do you know what might be the corrosive matter that had been taken into the stomach? - Mineral poisons; there are different qualities of them.</p>
               <p>What are the mineral poisons? - Arsenick, corrosive sublimate, the oil of vitriol, preparations of lead; the preparations of lead do not act as corrosives upon the stomach. I saw him on the 22d of March, three days after he was dead; I was desired by the church wardens of the parish to attend; I opened him the day after.</p>
               <p>Would not some of the arsenick remain if it had been taken? - I apprehend very little, for nature makes an exertion to get rid of the poison by violent vomitings and purgings.</p>
               <p>What is the colour of arsenick? - White, red, and yellow.</p>

               <p>Was there any quarrel between the prisoner and the other woman that is dead? - No; I heard the woman say as she lay bad, she believed she gave it her very innocently.

               <p>I am a surgeon at St. George's hospital: the deceased was brought there under my care; I was called up on Monday morning at two o'clock; I saw a patrol lying on a table senseless; I found two large cuts on one side of his head; and a bruise; on the first cut I perceived a fracture, with the other wound the skull was made bare; I did nothing to him that night, the surgeons were not there; in the morning finding the fracture he was trepann'd; the cuts appeared to have been given by a sharp instrument; they might be naturally made by such an instrument as the ax produced: he lived about ten days and then died; I apprehend the wound which he had received was the cause of his death; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177604170043"/> opened his head after his death, and it corroborated that opinion.</p>
               <p>To BAINE. When you came first into the room, which man had the ax? - Dempsey; I took it from Dempsey myself; I cannot tell who took it from me; I held it out for the watchman to take it out of my hand, but could not speak to him.</p>

               <p>As I am not provided with counsel, I beg, my lord, you will take my cause in hand; I am a surgeon: on the 10th of March I went to Mr. Milward's to attend Welch, who was not well; I asked whether he was at home; I was introduced into the back room where he and several of his shopmates were sitting; they knew me, and asked me to sit down and partake of the liquor they were drinking; I was in the room about an hour and a quarter; Welch withdrew from the room and went into the tap-room, and met with a soldier, with whom he tossed up for a shilling's worth of liquor; a quarrel ensued and the soldier had one of his eyes cut; I came into the tap-room to see what was the matter; I saw the soldier; there was nothing in the house to apply to his eye but a little brandy and water; I asked Mrs. Milward to let me have a little brandy and water in a saucer, and I went and bathed his eye; I then asked for something to bind his eye; she said she had nothing but a handkerchief, which he should have if he would leave the value of it; I bound his eye with the handkerchief; the liquor was then brought that they were tossing up for; they begged I would have a glass of that liquor; while I was drinking it the two coachmen came in and the quarrel began before I could wash my hands; if I had any blood on my stock it must come through dressing his eye; on seeing the quarrel begin, I immediately withdrew into the garret, and staid there till the quarrel was over, left I should be counted a quarrelsome man; and when the watchmen came I submitted without making any resistance.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called twelve witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Shoemaker-row, Blackfriars; I saw two men struggling, the man got away, and the prosecutor laid hold of me, and said I was one of the men that had been in his house; this was in the street.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When the prisoner presented the pistol to my wife, I laid hold of him, and had a scuffle with him in the parlor; he hit me a blow on the forehead with his pistol, which made it swell very much, but I never let him go; there was another man in the passage with a pistol, scuffling with my son.</p>

               <p>I met with the prosecutrix; she seemed in a deal of trouble, and asked me to go with her to Dennison's office to know what time they set the child down; I went with her; there were two men in the house, and another man and the son came in; the son said to Mrs. Brickleband, you old</p>
               <p>"Cadetameran,</p>
               <p>"what do you do here again about</p>
               <p>"your whore of a daughter? I debauched her</p>
               <p>"at school; and I took her on board the</p>
               <p>"ship, and there I debauched her again, and</p>
               <p>"gave her a flogging." I went with her before the Lord Mayor, and there the father and mother were; the father denied seeing her, but the mother owned she saw her; Quirforth came before the Lord Mayor the second time; they were examined and produced a roll, and said, he was both captain and agent of the ship; the boy said before the Lord Mayor that he took her on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. MARTHEW sworn.</p>
               <p>Dennison and his wife keep a lock-up house in the court where I live: I have seen Quirforth continually at Dennison's house; hearing they were in prisoner I was glad of an opportunity of appearing against them, and went before the Lord Mayor; Quirforth came there to justify the conduct of the Dennisons, and to give bail for them; the Lord Mayor seemed to think him a confederate; he produced a list of about an hundred persons he had indentured; the Lord Mayor asked him of the character in which he acted in this business; he first called himself a clerk, then he called himself an agent; the Lord Mayor asked him how he was to be paid; he said he was to have 9 l. 7 s. 6 d. the Lord Mayor said it was a fine thing for a man to have near an hundred servants for 9 l. 7 s. 6 d. there was some dispute about receiving the premium for entering this girl; she was entered upon his list, that was all the indenturing: I saw Quirforth make proposals about getting her back again; and the Lord Mayor fixed the first of January for the time of bringing her back.</p>
