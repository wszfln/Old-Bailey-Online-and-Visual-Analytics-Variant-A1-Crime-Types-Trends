               <p>fund—the proposal to leave came from them—I had been ill thirteen weeks, and I suppose they thought I was not active enough—I an still with Mr. Lewis at Blackfriars-road—he has left Eaton-street, and the boards and blinds are taken down, and taken to Blackfriar-road where they came from—Eaton-street never got too hot for me—at the time the boards were there the business at Blackfriars-road was going on just the same—while I was at Eaton-street I went to Blackfriars-road for books—the boards were never up there, but the name was up—they are not up now that I know of but on the side of the door there is, "Mr. Hill's office"—I do not know who he is—I am there doing Mr. Lewis's business; he lives there—I do not recollect whether is name is up—I have seen it up—I do not know where the board is or the blind; I presume they are up stairs, but I do not go up stairs—Mr. Lewis pays me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I go on messages and so on—I have received money, but not installments of loans.</p>

I am the defendant's brother, and am clerk to Mr. Hill, an attorney, of 10, Basinghall-street, who has an office at 145, Blackfriars-road—I was at Eaton-street while Davis was there—books were kept in the loan-office, and also in Mr. Hill's business—Mr. Hill had an office in Eaton-street as well—I know of loans being advanced by my brother on my own introduction—as far as I can say ten or twelve loans were advanced during the period he was there—here are entries in these books showing the transactions—the two first are my introductions, October 16th and 17th, and the money was advanced, and the entries made in my presence—the next is "Simeon Jones, October 18th," the next "October 27th, Harriss, 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," a lady whom I introduced—those entries are in my brother's writing—we did business together—I advanced a portion of the money, and he advanced the remainder—here is another entry, "22d November, Mr. Blumenthal, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there is one on a bill of sale to Miss Wilmot, of Montpellier-square, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had a distinct book for matters in which I advanced part of the money—before my brother went to 25, Eaton-street, he carried on business at 16, Fetter-lane, Fleet-street, also at the Wagon and Horses, Newington-causeway, near the Sessions-house, and at 145, Blackfriars-road, previously to going to Eaton-street—he has carried on business in Fetter-lane ten years, as part pro<lb/>prietor with my sister in the loan-office—my father died, and my sister ad<lb/>vanced some money for him to carry on the business—I think this large book represents those transactions—I have sued from Fetter-lane, and also from Blackfriars-road, and have done business to the extent of about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to the present time; not all in Fetter-lane—my brother carried on business in Fetter-lane between five and six years—the board and the blinds have been taken from Eaton-street to Blackfriars-road, and also the inner fittings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the boards put up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know why not—my brother is doing discounting business; he has given up the small loans, nothing under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was at my suggestion that books were purchased for Eaton-street; we did not use the old ones because he was partner with my sister, and I did not want transactions with me, mixed up with transactions with my sister—he was not a bankrupt; he had a trust deed under this new act—he paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—he owed 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. except to his family, I think he owed her attorney something—I am one of the trustees, and my brother-in-law, Mr. Cohen, a bottle merchant, of Newing<lb/>ton, is another—this shilling in the pound is not due yet—the first deed we found to be bad, and to save litigation we asked the creditors to sign again—I do not think he signed a few days before he saw unfortunate Mr. Davis—he was not described as in partnership with his sister, but as mana<lb/>ger to a loan-office—not a word was said about partnership—I know that he was in partnership with my sister—the money was left to my mother, and she being old, allowed my brother to use it to get his own living; he was to allow my mother a commission—I should imagine that he shared in the profits—he was manager and not proprietor of the loan-office at the time the deed was signed—I used to go to him and say, "If you have anything you cannot manage, do not send it away, send it to me, and I will do it"—I cannot recollect how many creditors signed, you have the deed there—my own family signed—I cannot say how many of them, or for what amount—I law Davis after he went into my brother's employment not before—my brother told me that he had secured 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had told Davis that he was carrying on an extensive business, lending large sums of money, but had only been there a few weeks—he did not say that he had told Davis he was bankrupt—he was not bankrupt, he had only compounded with his creditors—the entries I have spoken of were made by my brother in my presence, at Upper Eaton-street; if you look through the books you will see them in his writing—he did not begin at the beginning of this book, because I told him to leave sufficient for me to index it—this money was actually given to the person less interest; I gave some of it myself—Mr. Harbury, an attorney, had the loan of 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—he has not paid the whole of it—he is paying now—I have not sued him—he gave me a promissory note—his first instalment was on October 20th, and was paid to me on the Saturday at his office—my brother made the entry—my brother did not tell me that part of Mr. Davis's business was to secure instalments; he said he was to be inquirer—I have been in Court, because there was nobody to instruct Counsel but me, or to take charge of my papers and books—I am acting for Mr. Hill, of 10, Basinghall-street, and 145, Blackfriars-road—he attends to bankruptcy business—I have never been tried for anything—Simeon Jones, the painter, is down for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sued him; I do the sneing business—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to him as a loan, and not for painting the house—I believe it was lent at Blackfriars-road; it was entered at Eaton-street because my brother has the money there—I do not know that my brother owed him for painting—40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of this 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. lent to Mrs. Harriss, of Jermyn-street, was mine, and the remainder my brother's; where he got it from I cannot say—that was a month before he signed this composition—I cannot say what his finances were in September, 1862—we have some very rich relations, and he might be bankrupt one day and not the next—I know my sister has been very kind, and my niece also, but to what extent I cannot say, and I gave him money to start him—the book was between him and me—Davis ruled it, but I had nothing to do with him.</p>

On Tuesday, 31 at March last, between 11 and half-past in the morning, I went to Conway Mews with a cabman, and two women I happened to meet, and we had a pot of beer and a quartern of gin among the four of us. I went outside for a necessary pur<lb/>pose, and saw Mr. Clayard there in a stooping position, either tacking the lining or the fall of a cab, just done up, with a hammer. I was buttoning up my trousers; my back was towards him; I said, "Can you give me a job, master," joking with him. He said, "No." I said I could do without his job, and he came behind me with the hammer, and said he would knock my b—brains out, and he struck me with the hammer. I fell down. The prisoner is the man that struck me; he is a bad man. He only struck me once. I got up again immediately, and saw him going into the stable with the hammer, but the policeman was not quick enough to detect him with the hammer. He had loads of time to make away with the article. The policeman came up. There was a woman there that saw him strike me; I think her name was Nolan; she was a young woman, and had a dark cloak on. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him go into the stable with the hammer after he struck me. I stood in the mews bleeding till the policeman came, while he had gone into the stable. I never went out of the mews. I was in the mews till the policeman came I sat on the shaft of the cab a little while while I was bleeding, and I stood up till the policeman brought me here. I do not recollect going into the public-house after he took me; I am almost confident I did not I walked from the mews to the hospital, bleeding all the way. I was rather insensible after I was struck with the hammer. I do not recollect if I walked up the mews. I had not made water at the corner of the mews a quarter of ah hour before this happened. A man did not lead me up the mews to my knowledge. When he said, "No," I said I could do without him. The last time I drove for him I owed him a few shillings, and I expect that is the envious feeling he has against me. He was behind me when he struck the blow. <hi rend="italic">By the Magistrate.</hi> It was instan<lb/>taneous upon my reply that he struck me."</p>

It was a young chap who lives at No. 4, Old Pye-street, Westmin<lb/>ster; he is about seventeen or eighteen years old, 5 feet 1 high, wears a pilot jacket with a velvet collar, a black cloth waistcoat with lappets on the pockets, cord trousers, a blue cap, and silk neck-tie, and Joe Frits"—I took it down Friz—"he is about twenty-four years old, with a white slop, cord jacket, and velvet sleeves outside. He has been a soldier, and lives in Ann-street, and is known to Sheen, of Westminster"—I understood by that, Sheen the constable—"we were in Downey's public-house, opposite the bar<lb/>racks, and they <hi rend="italic">kidded</hi> me on to come up and beat the glass, and said if I was caught they would send me grub to-day and find me a <hi rend="italic">mouthpiece</hi>, and as they have not sent me any grub it is nothing but right I should <hi rend="italic">round</hi> upon them. Downey gave them half-a-crown before we started, and the stuff we got off was to be taken to him. I broke the window, the little chap whose name I don't know made a grab at the rings. He ran one way and I another, and Joe Fritz stood behind a lamp-poet when it was done. I was about half drunk when I done it. I get my living by selling papers, and can earn four <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a day at that <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> and the little one got a diamond ring last night-week from a pawnbroker's in the Westminster-road; it was worth 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Downey gave them 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for that—the little one said, 'If this job comes off all right, we shall get some new <hi rend="italic">togs</hi>, that is all'")—in consequence of that state<lb/>ment, I went to Westmimster, and saw Sheen, of the <hi rend="largeCaps">B</hi> division, and about 2 o'clock in the morning he handed Lane into my custody, in the Broadway—on our way to the station, Lane said, "I did not break the glass"—when I got to the station I found that his waistcoat answered the description that King had given, and the remainder of his clothing was new, the same as he has on now.</p>

I am manager of the Bank of London, in Threadneedle-street—on 7th April, in consequence of a communication made to me by the last witness, I went to the front of the counter and spoke to Major, and beckoned him into my private room—I then said, "Where did you get the cheque?"—he said he had been requested to present it by a friend of his, of the name of Godfrey—I said, "Who and what is Mr. Godfrey?"—he said, "He is a ganger on the railway"—I said, "Why did not Mr. Godfrey pre<lb/>sent it himself?"—he said that he had been drinking, and did not like to come into the bank—I said, "There is considerable difference between the writing on this cheque and our customer's signature," and there was evi<lb/>dently some irregularity about the affair, and if Mr. Godfrey would not</p>

               <p>come in we had better go out and see him in the street, and hear what he had to say—I also asked him to describe Mr. Godfrey's appearance, which he did very accurately—I then accompanied Major to the door of the bank, and I saw the other prisoner on the opposite side of the way, and observed that they recognized each other—Hawkins appeared to be about to walk off, but I went with Major across the road quickly, and said to him, "I want to speak to you about the cheque on the bank, which you have asked your friend to cash for you?"—he said he knew nothing about the bank, or about any cheque—I said, "Nonsense, you do, a cheque on the Bank of London"—he said no, he did not know anything about any cheque, and had never been in the bank in his life—I then said to Major, "This is Mr. Godfrey," and Major said, "Yes, it is"—we were all standing close together—Hawkins said, "My name is not Godfrey, and I know nothing about the man"—while I was hesitating what to do, and trying to catch the eye of a porter on the back steps, I heard Hawkins say to Major, "You managed that job very badly"—it was said in an undertone, but I heard it very distinctly—while they were denying knowledge of each other, I said to Hawkins, "You have seen the man Major, where did you see him?" and he said, "I saw him at Caunt's public-house this morning, and that is all I know of him"—I insisted upon their going into the bank, which they were not willing to do at first, and I sent for officers, and they were taken into custody.</p>

Gilson's place is at the corner of William-street—there is an entrance from Bridge-street, and a side-entrance from William-street—Ramsey came out at the side in William-street—he then went into Tudor-street, which is the next street, and I followed him—when he saw Holden he held up his finger, and both went off the pavement into the centre of the street—they were in conversation a short time, and I then saw Holden put his right hand into his waistcoat pocket, and pass something over to Ramsey, who went back into his masters premises in Bridge-street—Holden stood opposite the gas-works, at the corner of Dorset-street—I followed Ramsey to his master's premises; he went in, and remained about four or five minutes,</p>

I asked him if he was going to pay; he said, 'Oh yes, by all means.' I said it would come to 22. He said he had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and would get it changed, and believing him to be an honourable man, I cut the glass and put it in a paper parcel, and delivered it to him with a promise that he would be in in half an hour, and pay for them.

I live at 37, Culford-road North, Kingsland, and am a commission agent—I was engaged by Brandice in January, 1862; he had an office in Earl-street, but we moved to Bread-street, in April or May, 1862—Brandice entered into partnership about the end of February, I think—goods arrived from Paris in September, October, and November, in that year—the first entry in this delivery-book is in my writing—this entry is in the writing of a clerk named Guttman—I know his writing perfectly—I only signed for goods which corresponded in the mark, the number, and the quantity—I saw the invoice prices of some of the goods, and some I did not—none of the goods so received were ever shipped—the invoices came by poet, and we have got invoices giving us an account of the prices—some<lb/>where about 20th September, I deposited nearly fifty pieces of handkerchief for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with Mr. Attenborough, of 11, Greek street, Soho, and on 20th October, 308 scarf-shawls, for 133<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I made those pawnings by order of the principal partner, Brandice, and paid the money raised to whoever was present, but mostly to Brandice—he was in Paris, but I used to pay it into the bank sometimes—I received no tickets—I remember a warrant for ninety dozen of champagne, which I got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for, and on 28th November ten pieces of silk for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—all the articles which came from Paris were deposited at Attenborough's—I know a person named Benedict Goodman—he was a commission-agent when I first knew him—he afterwards took a place of business in Budge-row—I sold him some goods by Brandice's desire in October and November, and when Brandice was not present, he wrote to me—the prisoner afterwards knew what I had done—I was obliged to tell him that I had received orders from Brandice to sell goods, and he said, "I shall write to Paris and ask Brandice at what price to sell them"—the goods were sometimes sold a few days after they arrived—the sales to Goodman were, I think, entered in the books—I don't know whether the sales to Attenborough were, because I was not book-keeper—I do not think the prisoner ever looked at the books—here are three receipts in my writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and three in the prisoner's—during September, October, and November, the firm was in difficulties every pay-day—I pawned goods for Brandice before he was in partnership, and I began pawning for the firm as early as March, but the goods were redeemed—I pawned for them at Attenborough's in March, 1862—I pawned these articles (<hi rend="italic">Looking a ticket for silk for</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) with a man named Harrison—this represents goods which came from France—there are other people to whom goods were sold—I never obtained the invoice price in any one of these transactions—I pledged silk and French merino below cost price—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Raudnitz's writing—this day<lb/>book contains an entry of the invoices—there was no separate invoice-book, but the invoices were entered in the day-book—a clerk kept it—it was kept in the office open on the counter—I do not see any of Raudnitz's writing in it—this item of "Savoy" is Joe Guttman's writing—I did not file the invoices, but they were put together in a pigeon-hole—two clerks made these entries, and I understand they are gone abroad—some of the writing in the bill-book is the prisoner's, and some mine.</p>

This boos was kept on a shelf in the office in Bread-street, open for anybody connected with the business to look at—Brandice used sometimes to write in it, and so did the prisoner at times, and I sometimes wrote in it—there were several books at Bread-street, but it was not my business to keep them—there were so many I cannot describe them—I know some are missing—there were others besides those produced in Court—I think there was a cash-book, a ledger, and a copy-book.</p>

               <p>The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows:—"on 31st of March, I went to 31, Newland-street, Pimlico, to sweep the chimneys in the front rooms; there was no furniture there; on taking down the register, I found a piece of paper; I swept it down and took it home in the soot; in the afternoon I sifted the soot for the cinders. I picked up soon paper and opened it, it contained five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes and some papers. I said to my wife, 'Good God! here is a prize.' The next day I told my child to write 'John Groves' on each of the notes; my children had scarcely any shoes to their feet. Then I changed one of the notes. Then I well to Mr. Barton the next day; I did not say anything about the notes; he said the papers were valueless and I could light my pipe with them. I told Sergeant Ambler who asked roe, that I changed one of the notes at the Clarence, and burned the papers."</p>

Laurie and Lee's, Doctor's Commons, and our intimacy lasted about twelvemonths—he then went by the name of Henry Bedford—I lost sight of him three years—he then called upon me in Ebor-terrace—he said he had a considerable amount of property through the the death of his uncle, Admiral Harcourt, of Swinton Castle, Yorkshire, and that he had changed his name in consequence from Bedford to Harcourt—he did not give me any card, but he left some about—he said he was about furnishing a house in Belgrave-square, and that until it was ready he should like to reside with me—he said he had been staying at Long's Hotel—I consented to take him in, and he shared my bed—on the night of the 23d February I lent him a coat, which I have never seen again—we went to bed that night about 12 o'clock—I had a watch and gold chain, which I put under my pillow; I had also a purse with about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the purse was in my trousers-pocket, the silver in my waistcoat-pocket—I had also three pistols, one was a breach-loader, the others were small—they disappeared some days before—I missed them in the course of the week before the 23d—the prisoner came about a week before that day—on the morning of the 24th I was awoke by my landlord—I looked for my watch, chain, and money, and missed them—the prisoner bad gone without my knowing it—the coats were taken out of the hall—I communicated with the police—I went to Luxmore's, the pawnbrokers, with Sergeant Smith, and saw my watch and chain—those (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine; so are the pistols, and one of the great coats—I never gave the prisoner any authority to take any of those things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographic artist and an actor, living at 32, Chapel-place, Grovsenor-place—I have known Mason for some years, and have acted with him once or twice—in November last I became acquainted with Hooper—I knew him by the name of Stuart—I became acquainted with Bradshaw, I think, in the beginning of this year; I knew him by the name of "Hamilton"—I became acquainted with Hooper by seeing him in a cafe' in Pimlico; Mason and I were there—during the present year the three prisoners and myself have been together once or twice—once at the Trevor-Music Hall, Knightsbridge, and once at the "Windsor Castle "Tavern, near the Victoria Station—we were there on Thursday, 26th or 27th March—Mason and myself were there, and I think the other two came in afterwards—Mason was playing at billiards, and I was scoring—while I was so doing both Bradshaw and Hooper came up to me—one of them spoke; I do not remember which it was, and mentioned that Mason had asked them to present a cheque for payment, at the Union Bank I think it was—I told them they had better not have anything to do with it—something to that effect; nothing else was said then—when Mason had finished playing at billiards they went out, and I followed them, and they went up Shaftesbury crescent—at that time I was walking with one of them, I do not know which, and Mason was walking with the other in advance—the three of them had some conversation about some cheques, and Mason produced some—I heard the conversation, but what it was I do not re<lb/>member—I won't be certain as to the number of cheques, but they were in blank, with the names signed—Mason said, but I am not certain whether it was then, or at a later time, that he had gone round to the Directors to get their signatures, as they hardly ever knew what the cheques were for; and then there was some conversation about their being filled in, and it was arranged that Hooper should fill it in—lie was asked, I believe, by one of them, and he consented—I do not remember what was said, or who said it—at that time the other cheques were burnt; they were passed round to see whose signature they thought the best—this was in the street, about the corner of Tothill-fields Prison, I should think it about half-past seven; there was a gas-lamp there—two, I think, of the cheques were burned at the gas-lamp—Mason climbed up the lamp—there was one or two left, I won't be certain—after this conversation we all four went to the door of 23, Gloucester-terrace, Vauxhall-road, which is a coffee-house—Hooper and Mason went in, and Bradshaw and I remained outside a few minutes, and Mason came out, and called us—we then went into the coffee-house, and joined Hooper—we all four had some coffee—Mason said Hooper was frightened to fill it in—I was asked to fill it in, and I refused; I am not certain which it was who asked me; it was Hooper or Mason, I am not certain—then Bradshaw sat down to the table, and had some coffee—there was a pen and ink there; so there was when I went in—I did not see Bradshaw writing, because I had my back to him most of the time—I saw a pen in his hand—I am not certain whether after that I saw the cheque or not; I might have seen it, but I do not think I did—Bradshaw said that as he had filled it in, be should not cash it—it had been arranged before that he should cash it—that was said before we went into the coffee-shop</p>

               <p>—after that we all four left together, and went to Lower Belgrave-street, near the Victoria Hotel—it was between there and the coffee-shop that Bradshaw said he would not present it as he had filled it in—I think Mason said, when we were standing at the corner opposite Victoria-station, that he had written the signatures himself—Hooper then said it was cold and be left, and we three remained behind—before Hooper left it was arranged how the proceeds of the cheque should be divided—I am hardly certain whether it was before he went away, but it must have been, I should think—it was arranged that Mason should have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Hooper 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Bradshaw, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I was to have the rest, the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the odd shillings—Hooper said he ought to have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Bradshaw 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but Bradshaw would not consent to that, and it was arranged as before—I saw Mason on the following morning—he handed me over 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he used the expression, "The job is done," or something to that effect.</p>

               <p>expressly to devote his time to the interests of our firm—that was a matter distinctly arranged between us, and it was distinctly arranged that he was not to carry on any business on hw own account—there was an arrangement at that time with respect to salary, nothing else; it is not in existence now—when the time expired it was destroyed I suppose—I don't know—when one agreement expired another was made—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement made in 1859 with regard to the salary—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "39, Mincing-lane, Oct. 21st, 1859.

               <p>our book-keeper, with a view of seeing that all the different balances were properly covered; Goodburn was present—among other accounts we referred to that of Mr. Barber—I asked Goodburn whether the balance of that ac<lb/>count was properly covered by securities, and he told me it was—when Mr. Campbell left I paid him 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than be ought to have had; I paid him in cash and bills—on the 1st January, 1860, Mr. Merridew's partner<lb/>ship began, and just before that I had a conversation with Goodburn, in the presence of Mr. Merridew, with regard to the state of the balance—Mr. Merridew had been a clerk in my house—I said to Goodburn, "Mr. Merri<lb/>dew is coming in here as a partner, and it is very desirable that be should know the true state of all the accounts in the ledger"—Goodburn then assured us both that all the balances were properly covered, and that there was not a bad debt in the ledger; "a bad or doubtful debt, " I believe he said—on the 18th March, 1862, Mr. Merridew made a communication to me with regard to some purchases of Barber's, and I told Goodburn later in the day to make up Barber's account, and have it closed—on the following morning I came to my counting-house about half-past 9; Goodburn had been there, and left before I came—Mr. Merridew and I were sitting in our private room, reading our letters, when Crowther came in, and shut the door—he said he was very sorry to tell us that Mr. Goodburn had gone away unwell—I said I was very sorry to hear it—"in fact," he said, "I have a very unpleasant communication to make, which is that Mr. Barber's ac<lb/>count is considerably overdrawn"—I said, "Overdrawn! how can that be? how much is it overdrawn?"—he said he did not know; he knew no<lb/>thing about it—I said, "Why you must know all about it"—he said he did not; he did not keep the ledger—he said, "I am not your book-keeper; how can I tell and the ledger is kept locked"—I asked him how the ac<lb/>count stood—Mr. Campbell left at the end of 1859; he told me it was all right then, be knew—the balance was covered by securities—I think that was all—he also said that in consequence of a letter that my partner had sent to Barber the previous day, Goodburn was quite alarmed about the account, and was afraid to face us—after that Mr. Merridew, and I went to Goodburn's private house; he was not at home—we then went to Barber's, and had some conversation with him, and he delivered to me a quantity of papers and letters, which I took to the counting-house—Goodburn did not return to the counting-house for two or three days—when he came, I called him into the private counting-house, shut the door, made him sit down at the opposite desk to where I was, and I charged him to tell me the whole truth, and everything connected with this account of Barber's—I said to him, "Now, Goodburn, tell me everything connected with this affair, and if I find you telling me another falsehood, you may depend upon it you will be answerable for it"—he said he had nothing to tell me; he was extremely sorry, and had no excuse whatever to make—I referred to Mr. Campbell's account at well, and said, "How is it, Goodburn, after the liberal treatment you have received from me, that you allowed me to pay Mr. Campbell such a large sum of money more than he was entitled to?"—he said he had no excuse whatever for it—I said, "Mr. Crowther tells me that he knows no<lb/>thing about this account"—he said, "Nonsense! he knows all about it from beginning to end"—he said the account got gradually worse and worse; he had repeatedly called Crowther's attention to it, and he was assured by Crowther that it would be all right, and was persuaded by him to conceal the state of the account from myself and my partner, until it got so large that he was afraid to mention it—that was all at that time—on the follow<lb/>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186305110119"/>
               <p>morning I called Crowther into my private room, and spoke about this matter—I said, "Well, Crowther, I find you have been telling me a false<lb/>hood; Goodburn tells me that yon know all about that account from begin<lb/>ning to end; and more, I find that when you introduced Barber to my firm, he was indebted to you upwards of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that you have recouped yourself the money"—he said that that was quite true—I told him it was a very disgraceful and dishonourable act, for he must have known that the money he obtained from Barber came directly out of our pockets—he said he considered himself quite justified in doing as he did, in paying himself—I said I considered his conduct throughout most disgraceful, and he could not longer remain in our service, and I ordered him out—he then left—I have had no communication with him personally since—he sent to me some months afterwards—Goodburn remained at my counting-house for some time, making up the accounts, perhaps two months, from March to May, or some where about that time—he made up Barber's account—this account (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is made up by Goodburn.</p>

               <p>tartar and tartaric acid—they were limited to that—it was when he was introduced to us that I said there was not to be a credit of above 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was Crowther who mentioned to me that he wished to extend the business, and that it should be extended to the saltpetre business—I naturally concluded that his dealings would be larger than they had been—there was nothing said about the extent at all—I inferred they would be larger than they had been—I knew that the purchases of saltpetre for him were very large indeed—the mode of payment was, that if he required saltpetre he must pay for it one way or the other, either by cash or by the manufactured article—the value that he took in raw saltpetre he was to return in manufactured saltpetre—the plan of business was for me or Crowther, or one of the partners, to go into the market and bargain for saltpetre which was to arrive, or which had arrived—we bought it in Barber's name, as his brokers—Mr. Merridew bought the saltpetre—I did not attend much to it—he was then my clerk—the broker's note would not be sent to Mr. Barber till he paid his deposit—after the petre arrived and was landed, a weight note was made out—we made out a bought note to Mr. Barber, so that he knew we had made the" con tract—that would earn us our 1 per cent, when the saltpetre arrived, not before—the moment it arrived our 1 per cent. would be due—I do not know whether Barber returned the same saltpetre to us in a manufactured state, but he returned refined petre, then we told that for him, and they handed us our other 1 per cent—our bargain was that he was not to sell any of the saltpetre that we had bought for him to anybody else—we expected him to return it in the manufactured state—I found out that he was buying saltpetre through a third party—we expected that he would return the saltpetre that we had bought for him in the raw state in the manufactured state, so that we might have the re-sale of it, and earn our 1 per cent.—we charged 5 per cent on the balance; it depended upon the market—sometimes we charged as much as 8 per cent when the bank-rent was 10—we never charged more than 8—we don't lend our money for nothing—if there is a balance due we charge an interest on that balance—that balance of 6,16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd is not made up of interest and compound interest from the commencement of the balance—I will swear that—it begins from the date we began business—as the balance got bigger of course interest was charged upon the annual account on the whole balance—when Mr. Page retired in 1858 I did not employ an accountant to go over the books—Mr. Campbell and I went over the books when Mr. Page retired—Mr. Page had his accounts furnished to satisfy him when he retired—Mr. Campbell, Mr. Page, and I went over the accounts—we went over the ledger, and nearly all the important books—I have not spoken to Mr. Page since we dissolved partnership—we did not part upon the best possible terms—he was very exacting in insisting upon having his capital out—I examined the books with him to satisfy him whether he had or had not got enough—that occu<lb/>pied, I should think, a month at least—it was at least a month before all things were settled—there is a fixed day of payment made when we make a purchase—before we pay for the goods warrants are delivered to us—we pay at the prompt or before—when we get the warrants delivered we charge what we have paid against any customer for whom we buy—if a man pays his own prompt we charge no interest, and only half per cent commission instead of 1 per cent.—if he does not pay his prompt we charge him 5 per cent.; it depends upon the rate of the money market—it is sometimes 8, never more—having paid the advance we get the warrants delivered to us—we do not keep a warrant-book—we keep no book to enter securities that</p>

               <p>we have in our possession—it is a business of several hundred thousand a year—we make advances from time to time to persons who do not pay their prompts—the contract-book is the first book in which a purchase would be entered—it is no one's business in particular to keep the contract-book—very often some of the junior clerks enter—if I or one of my partners have made a purchase in the market we come back and enter it in that book—it shows distinctly the date of the contract, and the nature of it—I believe the contract books for 1857, 58, and 59, are here; if not we can send for then—after it is entered in the contract-book it is entered in the day-book—Mr. Goodburn partly kept the day-book, and Mr. Walker partly—Walker is not in our service now; he is clerk in a house in Mincing-lane—after it is transferred to the day-book it is then entered in the ledger—all those books were open to all the partners, so that they knew the extent of the purchase they had made, and of the advances—I depended upon Goodburn as looking after the securities; he got them—the brokers from whom we purchased the goods would hand the warrants over to Goodburn at our office—we have a banker's book—from time to time I found out that we were very much in advance on Mr. Barber's account—the warrants and securities were sent every night to our banker's—I saw that there was a large balance against Barber every year—I found that out two or three times every year—the first time I found it out was about the middle or end of 1853, when we began the saltpetre business—the balance in 1853 was, 1,145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was on account of tartar and acid—it was immaterial whether we took the warrants up or not—we acted upon Barber's instructions about the goods—having ascertained that it was covered by warrants, I did not cure what became of it—I should not desire to realise the warrants if I was satisfied they were covered—I did not consider it requisite—I relied upon Goodburn holding proper securities—whether there was security of not I expected to get my 5 per cent. interest on the balance—it was in 1855 that the saltpetre transactions commenced—I saw the annual account in 1856—the balance then against Barber was 2,034<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Merridew was the person who acted in the saltpetre trade—it is a trade that fluctuates very much—our brokers sometimes give advice as to when it is desirable to sell or to keep the saltpetre—Mr. Merridew had communication with Barber during the time he was in our books, and so had I frequently—I called his attention to the heavy balance against him several times—I advised him that it would be desirable for me to proceed to sell the saltpetre which covered his balance—we nominated the warehouseman after we pur<lb/>chased the goods—very likely the goods were warehoused before we bought them—I never took the trouble to find out what warrants had been used to take away the saltpetre from the warehouse—I depended upon my book-keeper—neither I or my partner ever looked over our securities that were sent to the bank every sight; I did not consider it requisite to do so—I do not believe that any brokers in the lane do, I never did—I should think we had fifty or sixty customers who were dealing in this way, I cannot tell—with the exception of Barber, or Barber's account, I have not been able to discover the slightest impropriety in any of the accounts kept by Goodburn—from 1855 to the end of 1861, the transactions were not so large, as between 90,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; within 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that, I should say—from 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I should think the saltpetre transactions were not to the extent of 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will say somewhere about from 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; upon all that there was a commission, and an interest ve per cent, on the balance—when</p>

               <p>Barber commenced dealing with us, I do not think he had any saltpetre refining place—he began to feline for himself in 1866, I think—I know that he incurred expense in fitting up his premises for refining saltpetre—I do not know to what extent; I have only been to his premises once, when this affair was found out—it was in 1867 or 1858, when the saltpetre, which was coming over by vessels to Liverpool, was damaged; that was saltpetre that we had purchased on account of Barber, to arrive—it was to arrive in more than one vessel; 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, or somewhere about that, had been bought by us on account of Barber, to arrive—we paid the prompt for it when it armed—some of it did not arrive—we paid the prompt for that which arrived; about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Merridew will tell you better than I can, it is his branch of the business—the amount of our contract was upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the saltpetre was damaged in the voyage, and did not make a profit—it was washed out—the water bad got in, and dissolved it, so that the anticipated profit on the arrival of perfect saltpetre was disappointed; I believe if it had all come perfect, there would have been a profit of between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it—the extent of transactions in money and cheques which passed through our hands differed very much—it was some times quite as much as 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month, sometimes less—the transac<lb/>tions were generally very large—Goodburn had no one to assist him in keeping the ledger—he had to keep it all himself; nobody wrote in it besides himself—he had to look in the day-book, and the contract-book, or to receive information from the partners and also from the market clerks—I beg to observe that I have repeatedly offered to give him further assistance, and he has said he did not require it—since this affair has been discovered I have gone through the books with my own clerk—we have not had an accountant to go through them; we did not require one—I have not found a single error in his accounts, save and except those with regard to Barber's affair—it was in 1862 that I had these conversations with Crowther and Goodburn—it was Crowther I first spoke to on the subject, on the morning when he came in and said that Mr. Goodburn was ill—I had not spoken to Goodburn about it before that morning—it was two days afterwards when I saw him, and then I spoke to him for the first time—it was at the counting-house; no one was present—I believe I said some<lb/>thing to the effect that if he told me everything, and disclosed everything, he would not be the worse for it—he, after that, came day by day to make up the books, and to go through the accounts, and worked as hard as he could—I think that was for two months—I think this account, beginning with a balance of 7,609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was handed to me, at the date it was made out, the 8th of April, 1862—that was before he left me—I had these other two accounts from Barber; I. don't know when he gave them to me, with several other papers, after the discovery—it was not whilst Goodburn was making op the accounts; it was after he left, I am quite certain of that—Goodburn remained in my office only so long as I thought he knew nothing about these frauds, but when I began to look into matters, I found it was desirable that he should leave—up to shortly before he left, I was under the im<lb/>pression that be knew nothing at all about this—I don't think I sent Goodburn to my attorney—he has been to our attorney; I never sent him there about Barber's matter—our present attorney is Sharp—I have sent him to Lawrence and Plews—I did not send him to Barber's attorney—I am quite sore of that—Barber handed me both these accounts—I cannot say when that was—he banded me papers almost every time I saw him—Barber has handed me other letters than those which have</p>

               <p>been read today—I cannot tell how many—they are all at the office; you can have them if you like—they have all been put in our attorney's hands—there were more than four or five—in the years 1857 and 1858 I was unfortunate enough to have a large claim against a man named James Windle Cole; proceedings were going on in bankruptcy against him in 1867 and 1858—Mr. Goodburn was required by me to go through Cole's accounts—they were voluminous—he was absent from the office at the hearings against Cole—he attended most times, I believe—during the time he was away, I think Mr. Walker acted for him—Cole's affair was not going on in the Bankruptcy Court above ten months, I should think—we only had eight meetings—the accounts had to be examined very closely—we had printed statements of them—Mr. Goodburn assisted me in making up the accounts—Crowther, in one of his letters, refers to a Mr. Walker; that is the Mr. Walker in my employ—when Campbell retired it the end of 1859, he saw with what he was credited before he took his balance out—he employed Mr. Ball, an accountant, when he joined me in 1851, I think, not when he left—it was for me to be satisfied then more than him—Page employed no accountant when he came out—he came is when Mr. Campbell was there, and left before Mr. Campbell—Mr. Page looked at the accounts himself; all the securities were under Mr. Goodburn's charge—he had the sole charge of the box in which they were kept, and the only key belonging to that box—he used to give all the securities—when Mr. Campbell left I advanced Goodburn 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year more—he was receiving 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Campbell's time—he began with me with a small salary, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—each of the partners had not a key of the box in which the securities were placed—I will swear Mr. Campbell had not—I had not, and the other partner had not—when I wanted them, Goodburn sent the key to me in a letter sealed up—he gave me the key when I asked for it, and so with the other partners—Mr. Merridew was my clerk before he was partner—I had duplicate keys of all the ledgers—the other partners had not a duplicate key of the security box—I will swear I never had—when Mr. Goodburn was at the Bankruptcy Court, he handed the key over to Walker; he was only there a few hours at a time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at that and tell me whether you adhere to what you say (<hi rend="italic">producing a paper</hi>). <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This must have been some of his own stock; it is partly in Crowther's writing and partly one of the clerk's; it is not signed by me—he was not dealing as late as 1857 on his own account with our aid—it might have been some of his stock which he had not disposed of, he did not tell me—I have no doubt whatever that that was in relation to some of the old stock—before he joined me he was what we call a dealer and manu<lb/>facturer; and Barber, whom he introduced to us, was also a manufacturer—he purchased through our agency—we are sworn brokers—we are entitled to 10 per cent. as brokers, and the same for sale—a prompt does not mean a deposit—a deposit is merely a security for the fulfillment of a contract that is made, and the prompt is the balance—if we have to advance the prompt. we, generally speaking, charge an extra half per cent—of course we charge interest on all advances, annual interest—we take accounts frequently but the interest account is only made up to the end of the year—I do not know anything about compound interest; we run it on to the new balance—it is generally made up at the end of the year—we do not make the interest account up three or four times a year; it is possible that it may be made up at anyone's request, but that is not the habit of our office—I did not say that the interest account was made up half-yearly or quarterly—I am quite certain about that—the warrants were deposited with Goodburn, in point of fact, and they would have to be delivered out by him for the purpose) of getting out the purchases, Barber having obtained advances; and he obtaining the warrants and getting out the goods would have to manufacture them—it was the understanding that we should get the refined petre on all occasions—I do not think we ever paid Barber any money; very seldom—I think we must have done so—with the profit he got on the affair if he had been fairly dealt with he would have done very well—there was an express understanding that Barber was always to buy through our house, and sell to our house, and he was neither to buy nor sell through any other house what<lb/>ever;</p>

               <p>that what I represent to hate been the understanding, and to pay I percent both ways—I mean to say that if I had known he was dealing with others I would have closed the account at once; it turns out now that he dealt with Caudery—I did not know it; I have only heard so since we have had several transactions with Caudery—we might bane sold Caudery some refined petre of Barber's; he has had large transactions with Caudery through our house—we did not charge Barber 2 per cent upon those trans<lb/>actions of Caudery's"—there may have been some arrangement to charge Caudery 2 percent, and pay Barber I—it was not a fact to my knowledge—I have not done business in that way to the amount of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, not to that extent—it is very likely we consulted with Barber, and he agreed to pay Caudery a commission—it was not done to the extent of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, nothing like it; it was something very small indeed—there was not an agreement between us and Barber that this should take place—we never charged Barber any extra commission without explanation—we no doubt explained that; I will swear we did—I did not sign all the contracts made by Caudery myself, sometimes one partner signed, and sometimes another—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) those are very large transactions, but they have nothing to do with Barber; I cannot tell that they have—it was the rough petre that we bought on account of Barber; he was supposed to refine it, and then bring it back into our hands, our proposition being 1 percent on the purchase, and 1 percent on the sale—it is clear that Barber has been charged 3 percent, but Caudery would not purchase Barber's saltpetre without receiving a commission, and we communicated with Barber, and he agreed to pay him that extra commission; we did not benefit by it—I remember it all now perfectly—I must have explained it to Barber—I don't think it was anything like to the extent of as much as 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I cannot swear it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some paper</hi>) there have not been transactions of that kind in one year to the amount of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—our books, of course, show the amount of business we did by Caudery; it would take me a day to go through them—I do not think the transactions in which Barber was charged 3 percent, upon the whole was anything like the amount you state, but I cannot say what the amount was—we, being the brokers, were bound to find a customer for the petre—we sold it to Caudery at a charge of 2 percent instead of 1 to Barber, because we get a higher price from Caudary than anybody else; his was the best market—that was partly after the failure of Caudery, and partly before—Crowther had dealings with him to a very large extent unknown to me and my partner; there were very few dealings indeed that were known to me and passing through our books—there were not to my knowledge large transactions down to 1862—there were in 1861—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some cheques</hi>) these are cheques of Crowther's, pot ours—there is no writing of mine upon them—by turning to our books I could ascertain whether they had gone through our bankers—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the books</hi>) on 26th January, 1861, Caudery paid us a cheque 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the end of 1860, Caudery owed us a balance of 3,387<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was in part liquidation of his debt—it has nothing to do with Barber—that 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not apply to petre sold on account of Barber—we had plenty of transactions with Caudery besides those on Barber's account—I say decidedly this 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had nothing to do with Barber, it was a liquidation of a balance due to us at the end of the previous year—that was not a balance created partly by Barber's transactions, dif<lb/>ferent things, there is cochineal, tartaric acid, and other things that Barber had nothing at all to do with—there were some solitary instances in which we made this charge to Barber—we never charged him beyond 2 percent.,</p>

               <p>1 for buying, 1 for selling, unless it was paid to a third party for Berber's benefit—these transactions extended down to the end of 1862—I wish to explain about some of these items—there were several other customers intro<lb/>duced by Crowther; some required credit, some did not—the securities were contained in a box, which was kept by Goodburn; there was no book in which they were kept, we did not consider it requisite—we had a different system; each party had his securities kept distinct from the other—we had no means of knowing by reference to any book what securities we bad in our possession—we paid these men very heavy salaries; we had no check on them; I placed confidence in them—of course I knew perfectly well the purchases that were made, and the account that there was—I did not know that Barter was driving a very ruinous trade; I believed quite otherwise—in January, 1862, the account was 7,509<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I don't think I made purchases for him to the extent of 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after January, 1862, Mr. Merridew will explain—the only security we had of Barber's were the warrants, the best we could hold—I knew that he had something like 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of a fluctuating article on hand—I would have gone into the market with that knowledge and bought 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on credit for him upon the assurance that it was accounted for in the proper manner; that is, that we had sufficient in our hands to cover the balance due to us—whether or not it would have been better for him to part with his old stock was his affair; I did not consider it requisite to make, any inquiry about that—I did not make any terms with Barber to get hold of all the documents and papers; he gave them—I had very great difficulty in getting them; I got them by degrees—I did not get them all on the same day, nor the same month—I made no arrangement or agreement with him whatever—I have an account of the securities, which realised 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can show the amounts; I think we have a list of them; they require some explanation, which can be given——I can give you all the particulars—I have not a list of the warrants we had, but we gave them up to Caudery when he paid us for them—the securities were not warrants; they were memorandums from Caudery for about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the exception of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were no warrants whatever—we delivered these memorandums back to Caudery when he paid us the money—there was no sale in the market alter this discovery; a few tons of salt—petre, nothing more—I charge Crowther with dealing on his own account—that is shown by documents—there was an amount given to us by Hinton Brothers, of Bread-street—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the principal items hers are before 1854—in 1855 there are some large amounts, but the great ma<lb/>jority are in 1852—I don't see any items here applicable to petre—I can say that the whole of this is not applicable to the winding up of hit own business—I believe a great portion of this went through our books, but I cannot tell—this is an account sent to us by another party, the Hintons—it is not a copy of our own books—we have not prepared it—no doubt a regular commission was charged by us upon all the transactions—this is a jobbing account between Crowther and Hinton Brothers—we charged the regular commission, passing through our books—Hinton showed me this—I have vouched this as an account of transactions in which Crowther was dealing irregularly on his own account—I cannot tell whether every single item has not gone through our books; how can I?</p>

               <p>do any business on his own account—he said he was very sorry, it was the only transaction of the kind he ever did, and he promised faithfully it should never occur again—since the discovery of the transactions which led to these proceedings, I discovered the dealing with Hinton, and this account was I furnished to me in consequence—Crowther bought those goods—he transacted all the business—there was some dispute on the part of Barber with respect to those goods—I cannot explain that; you mutt ask Mr. Merridew—I had nothing to do myself with those transactions with Hinton—I was not aware at that time of any complaint by Barber with respect to the quality—no allowance wad made to Barber with my knowledge or consent in respect of the inferior quality of those goods—I had no knowledge whatever of the transactions—I had no knowledge that Crowther was interested in them—of course I was aware that we were doing business with Hinton; but I was not aware that Crowther was interested in the goods purchased from Hinton—I never would have allowed anything of the sort—I was not aware that during 1861 and 1862 any warrants were handed over by Goodburn to Caudery which belonged to Barber; he had no business with anything of the sort—I never knew anything whatever of such transactions until after this affair—I did not hear until after this affair that there had been any warrants—4he warrants were contained in separate packets, with the names of the different parties—this 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was handed over to me by Caudery—there was no written agreement as to the terms upon which it was handed over; I know nothing at all about that—there was some written agreement about not making Barber a bankrupt—I wish to explain the nature of some transactions with Caudery; Goodburn told it me and Crowther too, both of them; I heard it from one and the other, from Goodburn chiefly—Goodburn told me, in 1861 or 1862, and also Crowther, that they had entered into an arrangement with Caudery unknown to me or my partners: the arrangement was this, that they were to deliver to Caudery from time to time a quantity of saltpetre; upon every transaction there was a memorandum given over by Caudery for the amount, Caudery agreeing to pay within A certain time, and deducting from the transaction his 1 percent, commission; Caudery to band over the warrants for the rough saltpetre to Barber, Barber to supply Caudery with refined saltpetre to that amount, and that was how Caudery was to be paid—that was done without my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salt-refiner, at Bermondsey—I have been acquainted with Crowther upwards of twenty years—I knew him when he was in business in Bermondsey—I had business transactions with him when he went into Laing &amp; Campbell's employment—I then owed him from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had transactions with him, on his private account, after he went into their employ—he paid a series of dishonoured bills, to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a house which failed, so that I was in his debt somewhere about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I began to deal with Laing &amp; Campbell somewhere in 1853—I opened that account through Crowther—he did not introduce me personally to them—he told ma he had opened an account for me with them; that I was to pay cash for goods as taken away, and give value for value, and was to have no credit—at that time my circumstances were not flourishing; I was about solvent, getting a living—he told me I was either to send a cheque for the amount or deposit goods for the value for which they were advanced, and that when I was not in a position to pay he would lend me the amount—I agreed to pay him a commission of 2 1/2 percent for the advances—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him and accordingly allowed him 2 1/2 percent on any advances which be procured for me—I got, from time to time, warrants for goods from Laing &amp; Campbell—I cannot tell the amount in 1853—I received accounts from time to time—the balance in 1853 was 1,146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1854, 779<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in 1855, 945<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I likewise paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for the goods which were sold by him—the persons he employed to sell for me were charged in the accounts, as arranged—I am aware of some instances of transactions with Caudery; between myself, Laing &amp; Campbell, and Caudery—my transac<lb/>tions were with Laing &amp; Campbell, and they dealt with Caudery—then were instances in which 1 percent was allowed to Caudery, as well as to Laing &amp; Campbell—that was an understood thing; I was to pay the 1 per cent, to both of them; it was done with my sanction—in 1855 I com<lb/>menced refining saltpetre—it was discussed between myself and Mr. Crowther in order to meet the loss that had been sustained on the dishonoured bills,</p>

               <p>which were the occasion of my getting into Mr. Crowther's debt, and in order to clear off that I began the saltpetre-refining business—I should think I had incurred a loss of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of that transaction—I never spoke to Mr. Laing for years afterwards; he is mistaken when he says I did—I transacted the business, connected with the saltpetre, with Mr. Cowther—I purchased some goods through Mr. Crowther from a person named Hinton, about a year or so after commencing the saltpetre trade—that is a matter of memory only—they were invoiced to me by Hinton—some dispute arose respecting the quality—that transaction had nothing whatever to do with Laing &amp; Co.—Hinton was partially paid in refined saltpetre—that was the reference made to Hinton's account in the letters—the arrangement with Crowther was, that I was to sell the saltpetre in any way I could, but the sale was to be through Laing's books; in fact, they were to be the ostensible sellers, and 1 percent was to be paid on the whole—in many cases they sold, themselves—if I sold goods through Laing &amp; Co., Mr. Cowther had no commission whatever on that, but he was to Have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on any goods which I sold not through Laing &amp; Co.—an account was arranged between us, which was to be kept in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), for the purpose of reducing the old account, for the repayment of the money which he had advanced—that was from time to time mentioned between us, in order to evidence that fact—I sent in goods to other persons besides Laing &amp; Co.; to Mr. Crowther's brother, and, I think, to Mr. Caudery—Charles Crowther is a brother of the prisoner—he was not a broker at that time—I presume he was then what he is now, a merchant dealing on his own account—latterly he has bad a warehouse, to which my goods were sent—when I sent these goods to Caudery, and to Crowther, I did not inform Goodburn of the fact, nor any one at Laing &amp; Co's.—I sent some to Caudery warehouse at Mr. Crowther's request—I paid Crowther's brother and Caudery 1 percent, in addition to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton, on the reduction of the account, and 1 percent for sales—in 1857 I remember proposing to extend my premises—at that time I had made, through Laing &amp; Co., a purchase of saltpetre, and it was out of the purchase of that saltpetre that I anticipated the funds—before the cargoes, or any of them, arrived I had expended money on my premises—I have no doubt that that fact was often talked over between Goodburn, Mr. Crowther, and myself—I cannot re<lb/>member any particular time—an arrangement was made that I should have what saltpetre I required, and when the profit was realised—on the other it would set the account right again—the profits were certain if the ships had arrived—we thought the insurance covered it—I got warrants in pursuance of that arrangement—I can only state what the amount was by stating what the balance would be at the end of the year; it would be somewhere about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I deposited nothing as security against that especially—it was out of the produce of those warrants that I was able to lay out the money upon my premises—I was applied to, from time to time, by both Crowther and Goodburn, to repay this money—I was not able to do so—several times I said that it would be better to lay the whole affair before Mr. Laing, and take his advice, and see what he would wish to do—both the prisoners always objected to that being done.</p>

               <p>November, 1860, which refers to the accommodating party being imperiled—that was in reply to a letter from me—in consequence of that I refrained from mentioning the matter to Laing &amp; Co.—the prisoners were constantly calling upon me—I pointed out the propriety of laying the matter before Mr. Laing, as I thought instead of getting better it was getting worse—that was at the latter end of' 59 or the beginning of 1860—it was shortly before something was done about some warrants which were placed in Caudery's hands to be handed over to me—that was in September, 1860, I think—the arrangement was simply, that Caudery was to sell me the saltpetre, which he did, and duly invoiced it, and I was to pay Caudery for it—that arrange<lb/>ment was made by Crowther, Goodburn, and Caudery—the saltpetre was to be sold and invoiced to me by Caudery, and I was to pay him for it—he was in the habit of buying part of the warrants, and part he had from Mr. Laing; some were Mr. Laing's, and some his; but in the market Mr. Laing held them for me; they were to be handed over to Caudery—Caudery handed them to me, and invoiced the goods to me that I was to buy—that continued from September to 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> March; I am not clear about the year, but I think it was 1861; until, in fact, the discovery of this—to the best of my recollection the whole of the saltpetre was delivered to Caudery, and he executed any orders that Laing might have—I have no doubt that was how it was all disposed of—the saltpetre was not to be found when the vessels arrived, so that the profit vanished entirely; it was <hi rend="italic">non est</hi>—I remember receiving the letter of October, 1857, from Crowther, which begins, "The contracts made by me some time ago are becoming dan<lb/>gerous"—I think they were contracts made by Crowther on his own account, still that is only a matter of memory; they were not contracts that I had made with Mr. Laing—I have heard something about Caudery having paid a composition; I do not know when—I recollect receiving a draft of a letter, which I was to write and address to Goodburn—this is it—I received it from Goodburn, and wrote the letter—I have not seen that letter since it Goodburn'a possession; I know he got it, because Mr. Sleigh produced it before the Lord Mayor, and read it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WONTNER JUN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">proved the service of a notice upon the defendant's solicitor to produce this letter</hi>)—matters went on in this way till March, 1862, when these affairs were discovered, and my account was closed—I remember receiving a letter from Crowther, on 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> March, beginning, "I have not seen Mr. Goodburn this morning"—I have seen Crowther since then, to the best of my belief twice—at the commence<lb/>ment of these transactions I was in the habit of meeting Crowther in Messrs. Laing's sample room; afterwards I was introduced to Mr. Merridew, who was then a clerk in the house, and transacted business with him—I know Mr. Adams' office, in Fenchurch-stceet—I know Mr. Adams very well—I met the prisoners there frequently—I was in the habit of going there and lending a note over to them—I did not go to Mr. Laing's office, because they were in constant fear that they should be found out, and requested me to meet them elsewhere—there is not a Miss Adams; the "Miss A." re<lb/>ferred to in one of the letters if my housekeeper—I recollect the latter part of 1859, when Mr. Campbell was about to retire from the business—I remember the letter which begins, "I have had a plain straightforward talk with Mr. Goodburn"—the state of my account was a matter constantly discussed—there was a proposition made by both the defendants, which was, that they should land me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I should reduce my account 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—they stated that—that amount was so paid to Laing &amp; Co. on my account; 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by each—this letter refers to certain twenty-five tons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186305110133"/>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you stated you had known Crowther some time, and that before you bad any transaction with Laing you owed him something like 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and subsequently I became indebted to him, I think, about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making a total of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was the entire amount I was indebted to him up to that period certainly—it was all paid at one time within 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am in his debt now, for money he paid to Laing and Campbell—the balance of the account rendered by himself, as near as I can remember, is 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so that 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the amount of reduction from the original debt; that would be about it—I was not acting with these people in any design to defraud Laing; I had no such in<lb/>tention—I was not at all assisting to cover my account with any view of concealing it from Laing—I had no motive or wish to conceal the account from Laing, and I would at any moment have given Mr. Laing any informa<lb/>tion he desired—it is not true that Mr. Laing has frequently complained to me of the state of my account—I have no remembrance of such a thing; to me personally he did not until the matter came to be found out—it is not true that over and over again, for years, he was in the habit of calling my attention to the state of the account; that is utterly untrue; nothing of the kind, if you are speaking of me personally—Mr. Laing and I never had any conversation about it, any further than he might have said, "How are you getting on with your account?" but we never entered into particulars, nor did be ask me as to the state of my account—there was an understand<lb/>ing between myself and Mr. Crowther that all the business should be passed through Mr. Laing, and, where it was necessary, that I should employ sub<lb/>ordinate agents, still Mr. Laing should have his brokerage—Goodburn and Crowther both knew that; it was an understood thing—of course I main<lb/>tained that arrangement—I did not always buy through Laing, I bought through other parties—I should think, if the agreement was construed strictly, that would not be in compliance with the understanding—Mr. Laing was not acquainted with the fact that I did so—I don't know whether Mr. Laing knew personally that I employed other persons, but his servants must have known, and did know it—I did deal directly with Caudery in this way for many years—it was done through Crowther, be saw Caudery—within the last two years I have done it myself and Caudery had his brokerage, because be held a great part of the trade in his own hands, and I could not have sold it—two percent was charged on the sale, and one on the purchase—I had large transactions—if I ever received money from Messrs. Laing, it was under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I don't think I ever did receive any; no, I never re<lb/>ceived any—it would have been impossible for me to have worked my business without their capital—that was perfectly known from the com<lb/>mencement—it was not known to Mr. Laing, but it was to Crowther and Goodburn—it is quite clear that, unless I got advances on the prompt and an uncovered account amounting to a certain extent, I could not work my business—I being the manufacturer, and bringing the refined petre into the market, after the goods were manufactured, I always had the conveyance, either through Laing, or some other person getting the money—they were cashed to me—I got the advances immediately—there was not an extra per centage when I sold through Laing—if I sold through Caudery or others, I</p>

               <p>still paid Mr. Laing one percent—My expenses were about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. weekly—I don't think Laing knew anything about my business—I did not come in contact with him for years, not to speak to him on business—at one time I thought everything was brought round—I conveyed that impression to Crowther and Goodburn—they knew it as well as I did—the constant subject of conversation between us was bow my account could be set right with their employers—as far as they were personally concerned, they got nothing out of these transactions, to my knowledge; certainly not with any collusion with me—that I answer distinctly, and not to ay own knowledge, any further than helping me to liquidate Mr. Laing's account; beyond that, I know of no benefit positively which they have derived from their transac<lb/>tions with me—the period when I expected to get out of my difficulty was at the time the cargoes of petre were injured and destroyed—it then appeared certain that there would be from 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that transac<lb/>tion—the petre was sold and insured, and the profit absolutely made, and in my communications with Goodburn and Crowther I treated this as an ascertained fact; and there was every reason for them to believe it to be so—I thought the money was as safe as if it was in a bank—that would have enabled me to pay every single farthing I owed to Laing—that was my full intention, to close my business and pay every farthing—I directed Mr. Merridew to insure the cargo—it was insured, but when the vessels came in with the cargo washed out, I found the insurance was of no value—I cannot explain what I don't understand—I am not an <hi rend="italic">fait</hi> at insurance matters—I left it to Mr. Merridew, and whether it was his fault or anybody else's, the underwriters would not pay the insurance; there was, therefore, a tremen<lb/>dous loss, instead of a gain, which I had foolishly anticipated, as then I could have disposed of my plant and property, and everything else—the expression in one of the letters about some contract becoming dangerous, was not clear to me when I received the letter, bat I have heard the matter discussed since—it appears to me clear now, that that contract was shifted to Laing and Campbell at that time, to saddle them with the loss—there was a loss in the difference of price—there would have been an actual gain, pro<lb/>viding Mr. Caudery had not failed.</p>

MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never knew Mr. Goodburn, I think, until you had entered into the arrangements with Laing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never knew him until I was introduced to Messrs. Laing, and had no kind of knowledge or acquaintance with him—I never knew of his existence—he did not, to my knowledge, derive one single farthing advantage from any connexion with me—my accounts, increased from time to time—I made memorandums of the amounts, fancying I might be asked the question—in 1853, it was l, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—neither Mr. Laing or his partners ever came to me and told me that was too high an amount, but Mr. Crowther and Mr. Goodburn had repeatedly done so—the account was afterwards reduced as low as 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is a long while to refer back; but I have no doubt whatever, that it was Mr. Crowther and Mr. Goodburn who pressed me and occasioned me to make the reduction—the real difficulty was created by that loss of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a very heavy loss—anterior to that, Goodburn had inquired about my affairs, as to my means of paying the previous balances, and I informed both him and Crowther that I was perfectly solvent and able to pay: I considered that I was at that time, not withstanding that Goodburn from time to time pressed me to reduce my balance—my transactions in saltpetre were large—I was to pay with refilled</p>

               <p>saltpetre for the raw which I got, and what I might tell directly, I would hand over the cash for, or my agents would hand it over on my account—I could not carry on my business without baring a large quantity of raw salt<lb/>petre in trust—I could not make the quantity and return it in refined salt<lb/>petre—it is quite clear that unless Crowther and Goodburn had furnished me with very large quantities, I could not hare carried on my business for a week—I don't think Mr. Laing troubled himself about the quantity I had, or the other partners in the house—when they saw that I was carrying on transactions to the extent of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, of course they must have known that I was refining large quantities of saltpetre, and that I should require large quantities of raw to be entrusted to me—it might have been understood that I was to deal with nobody for saltpetre except Laing, and I should not consider myself justified in buying any large quantity from any<lb/>body else—in the first instance, the matter was arranged with Crowther and Goodburn, but not afterwards—I did not see the principals of the firm when my transactions commenced—if Mr. Laing said so, he must have made a mistake—I did not see either of the principals, neither Mr. Campbell or Mr. Laing—I know Mr. Campbell very well, but we never talked on business—I knew him about a year or two years before the dissolution of partnership—of course be knew I was dealing with the firm—I did not enter into details with him as to the terms—of course he knew I had the refining manufactory—in general conversation, I have no doubt that I told him that I was making such and each a quantify—I must have done so—I never told him about the arrangements I had made with Crowther—I don't think it probable that any of the partners ever asked me who it was who was making the arrangements with me at to buying and selling—Mr. Merridew used to do the business with me, but at that time he was not a partner—he bought and sold for me; it came to be rather a large concern—the purchases were sometimes very extensive—I have always consulted him in the business since he has become a partner—he became a partner when Mr. Campbell went out in 1860—Merridew used to tend me the bought and told notes signed by himself or Mr. Laing—my dealings have been with Merridew from the time he became a partner, in that way—if we had order, which was generally the case, the goods were delivered directly to the parties buying if not they were warehoused—we got orders from Laing &amp; Co. to deliver them to the pur<lb/>chaser when sold, so that they never came into their possession at all or their warehouseman—it was done in this way; Laing or some of my agents would get orders for a quantity of saltpetre, either to be shipped or delivered to the various buyers in London; I then delivered it according to the orders, and returned Mr. Laing a note of such delivery—the orders to deliver would come either through Crowther or Goodburn—Mr. Merridew did not counter<lb/>sign the delivery orders of "refined"—the order would come generally with him, and I should deliver it to our customers; they would get their per<lb/>centage—previous to that form of letter which was drawn by Goodburn, the state of my affairs was a matter constantly discussed; never a week passed but we talked about it—I certainly staled before that what my property was, so as to make me solvent—it was in writing that letter that Goodburn and I disagreed—I was solvent, taking the goods at their fair value, but if I was broken up at once, then I should not be solvent—if I could have done that at that time, which was in the summer of 1859, I should have been perfectly solvent—I owed Mr. Laing about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time according to the ac<lb/>count—at that time the amount of the whole of the contracts which I did with Mr. Merridew was. in much as 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; in 1859 we were in full work—</p>

               <p>if that trade had been continued at that rate, the returns would have been from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; the purchases would hare been about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, through Merridew—he acted as the broker—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my writing—I know it perfectly—this is supposing it was disposed of at I told you—about 19th July, 1859, I had saltpetre in hand to the value of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that paper is correct, it is a letter of mine to Goodburn, a mere memorandum, a rough statement—the saltpetre I had was then in process—I had tartaric acid worth 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the metallic lead on the premises I estimated at l, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was what yon call the plant, but I had other things comprised in the plant—then I estimated the building, the freehold estate, plus a mortgage I had upon it, as worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and steam engines, boilers, and other plant, 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was another small factory, which I estimated at about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was all—the total is 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. beyond the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I then owed, always supposing that we found a customer to sell it to—that 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of saltpetre which was them in progress, was afterwards delivered by Mr. Laing's order to his customers, and it was replaced again by more rough from them—this saltpetre would be delivered weekly, and I should receive a further weekly quantity from them—as I sent off the refined, I should keep receiving raw; to keep my works going—Mr. Merridew knew, as well as I did, the profits I expected from buying that saltpetre to arrive—he bought the petre and it was sold through their house—of course I told Crowther and Goodburn as well—every one knew it, because it was such a large profit that everybody was talking about it—it was at a time when saltpetre was becoming very valuable—the habit was, as soon as the contract was effected by Mr. Merri<lb/>dew, to debit one with the amount—I was debited in their ledger as though it had been actually delivered—as the time went on, Goodburn became more and more anxious about the heaviness of my account, and more and more alarmed—at one time it was arranged that he should send an accountant to look at my accounts—he did so; a Mr. Du Pre, and he was there going through the accounts for me a month or six weeks—he came for the purpose of seeing that the business I was doing was all right—that was in the summer of 1859—I was never satisfied with the way in which the account was managed, and it was at my wish as much as Goodburn's that it was done—at that time, independent of my position as a solvent man, I could have paid off, by the assistance of some other person, Laing's account—I could have got somebody to help me, if there had not been the dread of bringing it before Mr. Laing—that is to say I could hare received that amount of accommodation, and paid for it in that way, which would have given me a sufficient sum to liquidate their debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you must, of course, have dealt with other persons, and they would have lost their 2 percent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would have been the induce<lb/>ment—at that time Mr. Goodburn often pressed upon me to get a partner, but I objected to it—I do not like partners—he proposed that I should take a partner so that Laing might be paid—the advance of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Crowther and Goodburn was after this, in November or December—they were to advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and I was to advance another 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to reduce the account; that was the plan that was proposed—it was agreed that the paying of this 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not to effect my payments at all—I was to do all I could to reduce the account lower—it was mentioned how Goodburn was to be repaid; he was to have another factory of which I was in possession, made over to him by way of security—it was to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide sale</hi> sale to him—I was to secure him by a positive sale of the property, putting him in possession—</p>

               <p>it was a factory detached from mine, 3 or 400 yards off—that had nothing to do with Laing's transactions, it was part of my general property—that is the factory which I estimated worth 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a solicitor named Kiley drew up the deeds—Goodburn referred me to Mr. Kiley—Goodburn stipulated at that time that I should also give a bond to pay Laing, and after the lapse of a period of I cannot exactly say how long, wished to reassign the property to me on condition of my mortgaging it to a building society, of which I think he was a member, which was done—he reassigned it to me, and then the building society advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the mortgage—I never recovered the money—there is now 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to him, I think, I acknowledge that—he has no security for that—I do not know that Goodburn raised that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the advantage of Laing &amp; Co. with the greatest difficulty, by selling some little houses he had—I do not know how he got it; I rather think I was told Mr. Crowther lent it to him—he did not tell me that it was with the greatest difficulty he raised it; he did not enter into particulars how he raised it—the premises, plant, and stock, began to depreciate from July 1860—at the end of 1859, I had had delivered to me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of saltpetre; that was in progress of refinement at the end of the year, although it was not delivered—the petre delivered to me in December would be in progress of refinement in the following month, but the system was, to put in more salt<lb/>petre every week and take refined out every week—I cannot identify any particular petre—I got accounts current sent to me from time to time, very irregularly, about once a year, I should think, on an average; in some years there might perhaps have been two sent—they were sent to me by Mr. Merridew, who was acting as the broker, and buying and selling for me—Mr. Merridew never complained to me that he had not bad the accounts current submitted to him, nor did any of the partners—I went on for a number of years doing these large transactions, and neither of the partners ever complained to me that they had not signed the accounts current—in 1857, there was a clerk in the firm named Walker; I do not remember the date exactly—I remember his acting as book-keeper very well—whilst he was so doing, I went on in precisely the same way, receiving the warrants and getting the saltpetre—I was aware that Mr. Goodburn was very much engaged in that great fraudulent bankruptcy of Windle Cole's—it did not trouble me, and perhaps I did not go to Laing's house more than two or three times a year—the business was principally done by Crowther through Mr. Merridew, and all the money matters through Goodburn—besides paying in refined saltpetre, considerable sums would be paid in cash by some of my agents—I would not take upon myself to say what amount, but large sums of money—that would include cash paid by the persons who bought the refined saltpetre—of course the percentage would come on that to Laing—it was in 1861, I think, that Caudery owed Mr. Laing about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—from 1859 Mr. Goodburn got so alarmed, that he managed the concern in such a way as to continue a system of ruinous losses—I pressed that it should be laid before the house, which they refused—I said, "If that cannot be done, put it into the hands of a man of business, and put an end to any further losses—Mr. Caudery was then agreed upon as the man of business, and that was how the arrangement came to be made—Caudery was to pay the money to Laing, and be answerable to them, instead of relying upon me—it was nothing whatever to do with me, they looked to Mr. Caudery for the money, and that debt of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was incurred in that way—Mr. Good<lb/>burn before that got alarmed, and acted like a madman—it was because he said, "We will not let yon have so much" that the ruinous losses were in<lb/>curred</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186305110139"/>
               <p>—it stopped the concern altogether—of course he pressed me, and said I must pay and reduce the account—that is what he always kept at—he also said that if the concern was stopped it would be ruinous to himself—he said that be should be dismissed if it was discovered that he had given me credit—he said that repeatedly, and that was the reason it was not brought before Mr. Laing—I said the only way the concern would be enabled to pay Messrs. Laing was by carrying it on, by supplying large quan<lb/>tities to refine—Goodburn refused to do that, and that is what I call carry<lb/>ing it on at a ruinous loss, and the next project was that Mr. caudery should be the purchaser, so as to give the funds over to pay Messrs. Laing—the balance of the account is stated to be 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—up to July, 1859, the account was kept in a very unsatisfactory way to me, simply because I did not know the way in which broker's books were kept, by making the purchase, debit<lb/>ing me with the goods, and never delivering them—I have even gone so far as to say, I did not believe that I had received the warrants so charged—very likely I had not—I then proposed that an accountant should be called in, and that I should have satisfactory proof of each delivery, that the salt<lb/>petre had been delivered to me that was charged to me in these accounts current, and that I pressed on Goodburn and Crowther twenty times—I can<lb/>not answer as to the amount of the commission and interest, without having the accounts before me—I had the accounts current delivered to me—I have not taken the trouble to examine whether the large balance which out claimed is made up principally of commission and of interest—I have not gone into the question of commission—I did not presume to tell Goodburn how he was to keep his books—I said it was totally unsatisfactory to me—according to my notion it was wrong to enter to my debit sums for which purchases were made before I bad actually got the goods, but that seems to be the broker's system; Goodburn told me so.—I afterwards stopped the system—I will not venture to say as to the particular date, but I believe that it was about July, 1869, that that plan was discontinued; I know it was very shortly after—if the books are here they will at once show when it was, and if I bad been at home, I could at once have stated—I am not prepared to say from memory whether up to that time the accounts had been carried on on that system—I was charged interest on the yearly balances—I was not called upon to take the trouble of ascertaining whether the bulk of the large balance against me was made up of commission and interest—I could make a mental calculation of it in five minutes—it must be a very large sum for interest and commission—taking it from the time when the balance was 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there would be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for interest; then taking the yearly return, there would be 2 per cent. on that—adding the interest at the end of the year to the principal, and taking the compound interest, it would bring it to a very large sum—I am not now carrying on my business—no one is doing so—I am living upon some little money which I bare got—my expenses are very trifling—the works are shut up—I shut them up about February—when I say that, I wish U be perfectly clear, I am paying the wages of two or three men whom I do not choose to part with, and who are leading men in the factory—I have not told that to Messrs. Laing—it is no business of theirs that I know of—Messrs. Laing have not asked me to pay something off their account—Mr. Merridew has not done so—I have not offered to pay anything—the plant is still there—Messrs. Laing have not applied to me to ask how much I could pay off the debt, if I sold the manufactory—I have had no negotiation of that kind with them—the men I retain on the premises merely job about the place, and sweep it up—there are three or</p>

               <p>four steam engines there—if anyone says that last week the steam engines were working, so as to be seen by people going by, it is a direct falsehood; I should think they did not take a single round—the fires were lighted—we always keep the steam up—if large wooden premises like those, saturated with saltpetre, were not kept warm and dry, they would rot, and everything would be destroyed—I am keeping it dry on the same principle as a noble<lb/>man would heat a greenhouse—the cost of doing so is about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—that has been going on from the 20th of last January until the week before last, when I got fairly tired of it, thinking this matter would never come to an end, and I bought another quantity of rough saltpetre, and thought the men might as well earn their money—I have began to work in a small way within the last fourteen days, but two months before that, it was for the mere sake of keeping it dry—I have been working some saltpetre within the last fortnight—I bought the saltpetre of Mr. White of Mincing-lane—I worked out some stock and exchanged it—I gave the refined saltpetre which I had in stock, and took the rough—I worked it previously to January 20th—the great difficulty is here, you think I am fencing with the questions—there were twenty or thirty leads crystallised with saltpetre—one of those I took, put the finishing touch to it, handed it over to a broker, received the value in rough saltpetre, and replaced it—it was part of the stock that was in existence—the stock which was there in March, 1862, would be fairly worked out and replaced with fresh saltpetre—between March, 1862, and the present time, I have delivered saltpetre, and had fresh rough saltpetre de<lb/>livered on my premises—that was stopped on the 20th of January last, or at the beginning of February, and nothing was done until sixteen days ago—when the stoppage took place on the 20th January, I had a stock amounting perhaps to ten or a dozen tons—that would be worth, in refined saltpetre, about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not delivered anything like the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth out—the amount which has passed through my premises since has been very trifling—I think the total produce since January has not exceeded 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the por<lb/>tion which has been delivered is worked out, and for the remainder Mr. White holds his warrant—I have only dealt with Mr. White—he is a broker in Mincing-lane—I do not know whether he is acquainted with Messrs. Laing, I have seen him there—I know it is not Hall and White—I know that there is a Mr. Hall, one of Messrs. Laing's clerks—it was Hall and White—I presume it ceased to be so when Mr. Hall entered Messrs. Laing's service—that would be in March, at the time Mr. Crowther left—that was when he took his place—I first applied to Mr. Merridew for him to let me have salt<lb/>petre—he would not let me have it—Mr. Merridew did not ask me how much I could pay off their debt—he did not inquire at all into my circumstances, not until this matter came out—I believe they thought it was a total loss—they never inquired how much I could pay in the pound.</p>

Laing's people applied to me to attend as a witness—I had not then any documents in my possession—I did not produce them at the police-court—Mr. Laing produced many of the documents which he had in his possession—I have not got any docu<lb/>ments in my possession now that I know of—I have looked at the document which has been produced; I would not swear to the figures—Mr. Laing and I had a dispute about it this very morning, and we cannot agree—I think, on looking at the figures, that they are in Crowther's handwriting—figures are curious things to swear to—I think I have not expressed any opinion as to their being in Crowther's handwriting before to-day—I should be inclined to say that the document is in Crowther's handwriting, but I will not be sure of it—the dispute this morning was that Mr. Laing said he was satis<lb/>fied that they were Crowther's writing—I did not acquiesce in that—I do not think that he or anybody knows—I have seen this document before twenty times—I saw it at the police-court—I never was asked the question whether the figures were in the handwriting of Crowther until yesterday—I never made it a matter of thought whether the figures were in Crowther's handwriting—I never dreamt of such a thing; it was a matter of perfect in<lb/>difference to me—when I first saw it I did not notice the figures at all—I will not swear that I never said I believed the figures were Crowther's—I will state that to the best of my belief I never said so—I cannot tell what may have passed in a casual conversation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came the balance of your account with Crowther to be increased to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold Messrs. Foot a quantity of tartaric acid, and drew upon them for the amount at three months—part of these bills were passed through Messrs. Laing's, part Mr. Crowther got discounted for me—Messrs. Foot failed—he then said it would be a ruinous matter for any of the bills to be returned to Messrs Laing, and it would be ruinous to me; he would therefore come forward and advance the money and take up the bills, and take whatever dividend there was from Foot's estate, leaving me his debtor afterwards—that increased the balance to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently brought it down to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was swollen again to 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the payments to Messrs. Laing—the amount of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was reduced to 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not gone through the account myself, but Mr. Crowther's-account shows 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since the account has been reduced to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have not paid Crowther 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton and interest and commission in addition—during the whole time of the account running, I paid Crowther for discount of bills generally at 5 percent on the transaction; if I drew a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for three months, I should pay 5 per cent, that would be 20 percent per annum—I paid Crowther 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton on a given quantity of saltpetre, which he applied to the liquidation of the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the interest was charged in the accounts—2 1/2 percent, was paid in addi<lb/>tion, upon my sales of tartaric acid—it was put in his accounts—during all the time this was going on Crowther never told me that Mr. Laing had been willing that his balance should be uncovered to the extent of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—accord<lb/>ing to his representation, the dealing with Laing and Company was only to be in cash—I cannot tell how much I paid Crowther for discounting bills, without looking through the accounts—it would be a considerable sum of money altogether during the time the account was running—the 2 1/2 percent. was not on account of Messrs. Laing at all, but for Crowther personally—I know of purchase of tartar from Crowther—there were communications</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186305110142"/>
               <p>between me and Crowther in respect of the value of that tartar—we disputed as to the qualities—he said that the quality was bad, and that it would have to be exchanged, or some allowance would have to be made on it—I did not get any allowance or exchange from Crowther—it was one of the conditions of his paying Foot's bills, that I should forego any claim for remuneration on the bad tartar—at that time I was very ill, and confined to my bed—taking my foreman's representation of it, who was a practised hand at tartaric acid, I should say the loss would amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more altogether—that would be the special lose upon the qualities—exclusive of that, there would be a further loss that would bring it up to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it never came to a claim against Crowther—Crowther sold the tartar to me through Messrs Laing—at that time he was in Messrs. Laing's service—I told Crowther that I was about to make a claim on Messrs. Laing—he told me that it would seriously injure him with Messrs. Laing, inasmuch as he was not allowed to do busi<lb/>ness on his own account—Messrs. Foot failed just about that time, so that that at once would settle the tartar matter—I could not carry on the concern without capital, or having an uncovered advance—I was not at any time aware that Laing and Company had consented to my having credit to any Amount—neither Lang nor Crowther ever told me so—with reference to the lots of the cargo of saltpetre, I had given directions to Mr. Merridew to insure in the usual way I did not suppose that more was necessary—with reference to the contract which was shifted from Mr. Caudery to Messrs. Laing, I do not profess to have the matter at my fingers' ends—the dealings with Messrs. Laing were upon a <hi rend="italic">credere</hi> commission, so that, upon any sales made to insolvent parties, they were answerable, and I should not lose the amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How have you ascertained that the object of the contract being shifted from Mr. Caudery to Messrs Laing, was to saddle Messrs, Laing with the loss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Simply when the matter was discussed in the Lord Mayor's Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you were representing the value of your property at 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., did it occur to you that that was a large amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did—I merely put the figures down as an approximation from memory—they were not absolutely taken from the books—they were pot down at the full amount of the cost, as near as I could give it—an advance was made upon the premises considerably beyond their full value—they have been attempted to be sold since, and a bidding could not be obtained—if you apply the doctrine that the worth of anything is as much as it will bring, the premises would be worth nothing, because a bidding could not be ob<lb/>tained—the value of the property would depend on how it was sold—if the plant was taken at a valuation, the same money would be given for it that it had cost, because you would expect something for your business; if a London brewery were broken up next week and sold by auction, it would not fetch 10 percent, of its cost—in March, 1862, the depreciation in the stock would be very much—with respect to the plant, there would be the wear and tear, perhaps 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not been in a situation to work it since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much did Crowther and Goodburn let you have in the six months succeeding July, 1859? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not tell that from memory—the arrangement about Caudery being the person to take the warrants, and conduct the sales, took place, I think, in September, 1861, but there are numbers of documents there that will prove—from July, 1859, the balance due to Laing and Company was about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in July, 1860, it was 7,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell what was the uncovered balance at each of those times—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186305110143"/>
               <p>the advance of the two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoners was in December, 1859, or January, 1860—in taking the balance of July, 1859, and looking at the increase of the debt in September, 1861, that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be added—you must also add the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stock taken into account in Messrs. Laing's books which had not been delivered, and which was delivered in the follow<lb/>ing January—the arrangement about Caudery making the sales was in Sep<lb/>tember, 1861—I could not tell the uncovered balance at Laing's at that time, as it would be in the middle of the year, when the books were not made up—from the time when Caudery took it up, I think that Laing and Company got no commission—part of the saltpetre which I worked up for Caudery, and which he sold, was represented by warrants obtained from Laing, and part Caudery, went into the market and purchased on his own account—I have had an account with Caudery for years—from memory I should say I owe him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I owed him a great deal more than that in March, 1862—from the time of Messrs, Laing throwing it up, the works were conducted through Caudery, up to the beginning of February—since then I have had the single transaction with Mr. White—I know that Laing and Co. have not had anything to do with the transaction I have had with White, because I asked them to do it themselves—in March, 1862, at the time when Messrs. Laing made this discovery, if the concern had been pro<lb/>perly wound up, I think 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might have been got for it—that includes everything; it would have been 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon a debt of 9,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—that is, supposing it to be sold properly and at that time—provided it was properly done, it could be managed without expense—my estate at the present time would not pay more than the dividend I have mentioned—I was present when a person came from Laing and Company the premises to value the stock Messrs. Laing's system is, that the moment they make a purchase they debit the party with it—about 1860, that sys<lb/>tem was stopped upon my representation—they would debit me with it when the prompt had expired; I am not quite clear about it—I think it is when the purchase is made—I am not sure.</p>

A.</hi> If the cheque is dated the 19th August, that would be so—Caudery at that time furnished me with all my funds-since these affairs I carried on the whole of the business through him—I should think I have paid him 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid that by reducing the stock of saltpetre in my own hands—I included the stock in my calculation of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound.</p>

                  </hi>. I was for many years a clerk in the em<lb/>ployment of Laing and Company—I became a partner on Mr. Campbell going out in January, 1860—before I was a partner I acted as market-clerk—Crowther was the other market-clerk—the dealings in tartaric acid and saltpetre were in his department—up to the time of my being a partner I had nothing to do with the books—the only book that came to my charge was the contract-book—I had no access to the ledger or to the security box—before I was a partner I was not at all aware of the state of Barber's account—upon Mr. Campbell leaving I was present when the state of the account was discussed in Goodburn's presence—Mr. Laing asked him if the balances were all properly covered, as it was necessary to be certain of that before they paid Mr. Campbell over what was due to him out of his capital—he then said that the balances were all fully covered, and that there was not a bad account in the ledger—Mr. Barber's account was transferred from Laing and Campbell to Laing and Merridew—the account has been men<lb/>tioned several times since I have been a partner, both by Crowther and Goodburn, Goodburn merely confirming his previous statement that it was covered by security—Crowther'a conversation with me upon that subject would more relate to the state of the stock in hand than to the other portion of it; I should never speak to him on the cash matters—I mean the stock under the control of Laing and Company—both Crowther and Good barn had access to the contract-book—I refer <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the contract-book of October 13th, 1857—I cannot say whose handwriting this entry is in—there is a mark against it of "J. C."—the entry in, "London, 13th October, 1857, Mr. Henry Barber, we have sold this day by your order, and for your account, the following refined saltpetre for delivery in October, November, and December, 1857, namely, 100 barrels at 56<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., 150 barrels at 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 90 barrels also at 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 340; cash on delivery to Mr. Caudery"—I think the date of Caudery's failure was the 11th or 12th of November—I refer to an entry in the day-book on the 24th of November, 1857, which is as follows: "William Caudery, debtor to Henry Barber, for difference in price on refined saltpetre, as agreed this day, in consideration of the sale made for you on the 26th of September being cancelled: 105 barrels at 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt; brokerage on 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 1 percent, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s".</hi>—the brokerage is deducted from the amount, leaving 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—in the same book, with the same date, there is an entry, "Henry Barber, debtor to William Caudery, for refined saltpetre, transferred 50 barrels at 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt., 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 14 barrels at 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt, 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., total, 192<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; brokerage 1 per cent, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d".</hi>—there is a further entry: "William Caudery, creditor, 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I have referred to the contract-book of the date of the 26th of September—I have gone through all the contracts, and I do not find any contract entered such as is referred to in the day-book—the contract-book is in various handwritings—it was my duty to enter or see entered the contracts which I made myself—it is the duty of a market-clerk who makes a contract either to enter it himself or to see it entered in the contract-book—Crowther was a market-clerk to buy and to sell also—Good<lb/>burn posted this book into the ledger—there are the folios opposite each entry denoting the page in the ledger where the entry is made—I find</p>

Laing and Co. could not be called on to pay except on the goods which actually arrived—I did not know of the existence of the delivery<lb/>book until after the discovery of these frauds—my attention was called to it by a communication from Barber, with reference to two warrants for salt<lb/>petre</p>

               <p>—I searched and found that book—I find no entry in it except in Goodburn's and Crowther's writing—the earliest date is the 27th April, 1860, and the latest is the 3d August, 1861—there is the exception of one marked "not delivered"—we had transactions with other customers in salt<lb/>petre, and in other colonial produce, to an extent equal in gross amount to Barber's)—in many instances we had possession of warrants for them in the same way as for Barber—there was no book kept by our concern for the purpose of containing entries of warrants to anybody else—this book is printed, "Warrants sent to Mr. Henry Barber" throughout—I gave no directions to have such a book as this prepared, and was not aware of its existence—I have seen it before to-day—it was found among a number of other books, in one of our rooms where we put away our ledgers—where I found it, I should think it would not be accessible to the partners; merely because we very seldom go into that room—we hare a room up stairs where we put a number of books that are completed—I should say, the book being full, it would not be lying about the counting-house—that room was kept by the firm for keeping a portion of their books which were filled up—I had not seen that book before—I did not find any other book there; no other in continuation of it.</p>

I was housemaid in the service of Mr. Edmonds on 4th April—it was my duty to fasten up the house at night—I went to bed about 10 o'clock on the night of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—before going to bed I had fastened up the doors and windows—it was the dining-room window that was found open, fronting the street—I had gone into that room about 9 o'clock; the room was then as secure as it always was—I saw this desk on a side-table between the windows, this box by the side of it, and the plumes of feathers, one on each side of it—I saw the album on the same table—I was aroused about 5 o'clock by the policeman—when I came down, I found the dining-room door open—all these things which I had seen on the side-table were moved on to the sofa, and the plume of feathers on to the table in the center of the room—there are wire blinds to the window; they were pulled down, and when I went to bed they were in their proper position, and fastened with two bolts on each side.</p>

On the morning of 4th April, I was on duty in Chenies-street, Tottenham-court-road—about 4 o'clock I saw the prisoner Sonnet in Chenies-street, and about five or six minutes afterwards, or it might have been seven or eight, minutes, I saw him again in Stone-street—seeing him a second time, I had a suspicion that there was something wrong, upon which I went sharp round my beat to meet him again—on coming into Gower-street, where I thought to meet him, I could not see him—I stood at the corner of Gower-street for a moment, and then proceeded along Gower-street, and I saw Sonnet step from the door of No. 69—he was followed by Eagin and another man; they came out of the house, and slammed the door after them—I sprang my rattle, and followed them to the corner of Gower-street and Stone-street—they all three ran up Stone-street, and turned down a mews in Stone-street—I sprang my rattle, and ran back again down Gower-street into Cherries-street to the other end of the mews—the mews runs from Stone-street into Chenies-street—I met Eagin coming out of the mews into Chenies-street—I took hold of him, and told him I should take him into custody—he asked what for—I said for having seen him come out of a house in Gower-street—he said, "Don't use any violence; I will go with you quietly; I have not done anything I care about"—I did not use any violence to him, I declined to do so—he went some distance with me quietly—on coming into Gower-street, he struck me a violent blow on my cheek—I had hold of him at the time by the collar with my left hand—I did not see what it was he struck me with the first time—I then struck him a blow with my rattle, which I had in my hand, and in the struggle my hat fell off—he struck me again; I closed in with him, and we struggled for some time in the street—he tried several times to throw me, and ultimately I went to the ground-Waite was the first constable that came to my assistance—I was taken to the hospital—Eagin made his escape from me, after dealing me two blows on the head; he ran up Gower-street—I was very much hurt, I am suffering from the injuries very much now—</p>

               <p>after my wounds were dressed at the hospital, I was taken back to the station—I revived, and felt a good deal better then than I do now—I saw Eagin at the station, and I said he was the man that had ill-used me as soon as I went in—I afterwards went with Baskforth to Broad-street, St. Giles, about 10 o'clock that same morning—I there saw Sonnet—I pointed him out to Bashforth, but I could not speak loud enough for him to hear—he had to come to me, and as soon as Sonnet saw me point him out to Baskforth, he ran away—he was followed by Bashforth, but made his escape.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the surveyor of claims for the Imperial Fire Office—in consequence of instructions, I went on the morning of 5th January to 68, Brewer-street, Somerstown—I observed than there had been a fire in the house—the back bedroom was burnt out; the roof was gone, and the sky was visible—the other rooms were all more or less damaged by the fire and the water from the engines—I saw the female prisoner there—I asked her the time and cause of the fire—I took a note at the time of what she said—I asked her if she was a married woman—I saw that the insurance was in the name of Eliza Stebbings—she said she was, but that her husband had gone about ten days before to sea; that he was a ship's steward—I said, "Where is he now?"—she said, "At Sunderland"—I said, "Can you give me his address?"—she said, "No, I cannot; I only heard once from him, and the letter had the post-mark of Durham"—she said he was a ship's steward, and had been to the Cape—she then said that she had separated from him (that was in reply to my question why she had made the insurance in her own name, having a husband); that he had used her very ill, and she never wished to see him again—I then asked her about the time of the fire—she said it was in, her absence, on the previous night or that morning; that she and her servant, Mary Casey, had left the house between 10 and 11 on the previous evening (Sunday), and walked to Paddington, to Mrs. Dames, 23, Berkley-street—I afterwards found it was Upper Berkley-street—she said that Mrs. Dames lodged at a Mrs. White's, and she and her servant bad slept there; that they both left the house about a quarter-past 6 in the morning, and walked to Somerstown, and then found that the fire had occurred—she said she had slept from home twice before during the last three months—she said, "When I left there was a very small bit of fire in the bedroom; I put on a shovel of slack, to last till I came back, say for two or three hours; I meant to be away that time; I did not mean to stop all night; I left my night-clothes on a chair before the fire to air"—I then went through the house, and examined particularly, and took a description of the property remaining, and what the damage was—she said that her loss exceeded the amount of her insurance, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I said I could see nothing of the sort; I did not think she had lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she then gave me a description of those things which she said were totally destroyed; she enumerated a number of articles of furniture, and two valuable pictures, and two others—she said they were totally destroyed—I asked if there was no particles of the frames left, or any part—she said none; they were totally destroyed—I asked her some particulars of those pictures, and she said that one was called the "Enthusiast," an old gentleman fishing in a tub, and the other was a portrait of the "Dreadnaught," and they were originals, by either Barrett or Lane—I said, "I know the subjects you speak of; they are engraved pictures"—she said, "Yet—the same subjects, I believe, are in the National Gallery"—I have the list of things here, which was taken down from her mouth—among them is a family-bible, a dressing<lb/>Glass,</p>

I am a carpenter, of 4, Middlesex-terrace, Hackney—I was at Hackney-marshes on the morning of Easter Monday; it was the part near Bow—I was never there before; it was an open field—there were a hundred persons present—about half-past 6 in the morning, I saw the prisoner Howlett there, and the deceased Rivett; they were both stripped—there was no ring made, only by the people—the prisoner Howlett and the deceased were in an open space—they then began to fight—they fell several times—I waited until it was over; they fought about an hour—when they fell they were sometimes assisted up—I could not tell who assisted; they were strangers—I cannot say whether or not the same persons picked them up on each occasion—I saw the deceased at the end of the fight on the field, lying on the ground—I did not see him struck down—I did not see him removed—I next saw him at the "Morpeth Castle" public-house, lying on the table—that is, I think, three or four hundred yards from the field—there were some men standing round him, but I did not stop to see what they were doing; they were rubbing him—he appeared to be insensible—I did not hear any one speak to him—I was present at the "Mary Ann Arms" public-house before the fight—I saw Howlett there, and he put some money down; it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I believe—I lent him some money, but for what purpose I do not know—he asked me to lend him some money, as he had done before—he said, "Wood, lend me a couple of pounds," and I heard no more of it until I heard from him afterwards what it was for—I asked him what he put the money down for, and he said he was going to fight a party—I knew who it was; he said Rivett—there was nothing more said—he did not tell me when, or say anything about the fight—when the money was put down, Howlett, myself, the two Hammonds, were present—their father keeps the house—I did not notice any one else—they were on the serving side of the bar—I did not know what became of the money; I did not see any one pick it up.</p>

               <p>ceased was brought in on the morning of 6th April, a few minutes before 10—I examined his body—he was dead when I saw him—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found marks of contusions over the head, face, chest, shoulders, and hands; the scalp was extravasated with blood—on removing the skull-cap, I found a large <hi rend="italic">coagulum</hi> of congested blood on both hemi<lb/>spheres of the brain, which was congested—the lungs and air passages were congested also—all the other organs were perfectly healthy—I attribute death to the effusion of blood on the brain, which could be caused by a blow at a prize fight—hearing what happened before, I do not entertain any doubt that effusion had been caused by the violence that had been inflicted.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May effusion of blood on the brain be caused by other means than violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; from disease, of from a sudden rupture of one of the vessels in the brain—a rupture of one of the vessels in the brain sometimes takes place without there having been exter<lb/>nal violence, as in the case of apoplexy—excitement brought on, whether from physical or mental causes, will result in apoplexy or the rupture of the vessels of the brain; it depends upon the age in a great measure—it is very extraordinary to see it under a certain age—in my own experience, I have not found it any so young.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am asking you, as a gentleman of science and reading on this matter, no age is exempt from it under certain circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot fully answer that question; not from disease; from injury—I never heard of it occurring in anyone so young—mental excitement might produce a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain at any age—when there is a rupture quite in<lb/>dependent of any blow or any fall, there is generally ossification of the tissues—I cannot say that the excitement of fighting a person who has undergone training would produce a rupture by the sudden change from severity of living to the excitement of fighting, without violence—I could not say, unless the tissues of the blood vessels had been diseased—it might, but I cannot say—I have never known a case occur except in cases where the tissues of the vessels have been diseased by bony deposits—from my examination I observed general extravasation over the two hemispheres of the brain—I should not expect to find extravasation only at the particular spot where a person has received injury from a blow or a kick—it depends upon where the blow was struck—if he received a blow over the temple, and the skull was fractured, and an artery ruptured, I should expect to find extravasation from the concussion to the head throughout—if there was a large blood vessel ruptured, it would flow all over the interior surface; it would depend also upon what position the body laid in; the blood would gravitate—I could not swear what particular vessel in the brain was ruptured—some might be produced by the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> in the act of getting off the skull-cap—the longitudinal <hi rend="italic">sinus</hi> was ruptured in two places—I could not say whether that was produced before death or after—great force is required in removing the skull-cap—this clot could not have been caused by the removal of the skull-cap—no doubt, when the skull-cap is torn off, it must rupture some of the vessels—you are obliged to take the <hi rend="italic">calvarium</hi> off with great force—the rupture of a blood vessel would be doubtful, but I have no doubt about the clot—it was not a clot in one single place, but over both hemispheres.</p>

I am a cow-keeper, of North Woolwich—on 24th February the prisoner came and asked for twelve quarts of milk, which I gave him—he said his master did not send the money—sometimes he would pay one day and leave a day—he came on the 25th and 26th, and did not pay on those days—I did not ask him any question—I do not recollect his saying the milk was so bad that the customers did not like it—I told him to tell his master he must send the money, or I should not let him have more milk.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Whittel, of 18, Trinity-square—on 10th April, we went to bed at twenty minutes to 11—I made the house secure, in the usual way; we are rather careless—the front kitchen window was closed; I cannot say it was fastened—the window-shutters were to, and a desk and work-box were against the shutters—I went into Mr. Madge's room as I went up stairs, and it was perfectly straight, as usual—at about 2 o'clock—I was called up—I went down stairs, found the kitchen shutters were open, and the work-box and desk on the floor, and the contents turned out—there was a mark on the area railings, as if some one had put their foot over and come down the wall; there are no steps or gate to the area—if a person got into the area, he had nothing to do but throw up the window to get in—I afterwards went into the front parlour—I looked under the table, and there was a man there—there was light enough for me to perceive that he was in his shirt sleeves, and had no shoes on—he rushed past me to the front door, which was open, and rushed out—I do not know who had opened the front door.</p>

I am the wife of John Trafalgar Black, a tutor, of 4, Hamilton-place, Brixton-road—on 27th April, the prisoners came—my servant let them into the dining-room, and then into the drawing-room—I followed them, and asked them what apartment they wanted—they said a dewing-room floor and two bedrooms—they told me they were professional singers, engaged at different houses, and that they kept a "trap"—I showed them the drawing-room floor; there was no property of mine them—the servant then took them to this second-floor—my bedroom is on that floor, Over the drawing-room—I heard some one overhead, in my room—the servant then brought them down—they said there was another professional singer, and wished to know what other bedroom I could let them have—knowing that they had been in my room, I suspected them, and directed my servant to show her bedroom, to give me time—they went up stairs again, and I ran up to my bedroom, and missed three rings, which I had left on the looking-glass, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then came down, and waited at the drawing-room door until the prisoners came down—I went into the ball before them—they said the apartment would suit them very well—I said, "I wish to speak to you; step into the dining-room for a minute,"—they said their time was up, and they must go—I said, "I cannot allow you to go until you have given me the three rings which you have taken from my bedroom"—I put the chain on the front door—they were then in the hall, coming towards the door—I stood before them, and would not let them pass—they said, "Oh, dear no, madam; the very idea of such a thing! we are too respectable; we have never been guilty of such a thing"—I said, "You have them"—there was a life-preserver hanging on the folding-door between the front and back room; Kemble took it off the door—I said, "You had better give me up the rings; what do you intend doing f you will be trans<lb/>ported; if you have no fear of man, have you no fear of God? if yon give me up the rings, I will release you"—there was a friend of nine down Stairs—I called him up—as he was coming up, the prisoners said, "If you</p>

               <p>look round the room, you will find your property"—I had seen Brown put something on the sofa, and I said, "I saw where you put them"—he then took the three rings between his thumb and finger, brought them to me, and said, "Now you have got your property, you will allow us to go"—I said, "No"—I thought I saw the life-preserver in one of the prisoners' pocket—it had been lying on the table when my friend came up, and one of them took it off—they refused to give up the rings until the police were at the door.</p>

I produce a bottle of wine which I bought of Martin—I showed it to Mr. Vickers—I took French on 1st May—he' was with Lonsdale, in Brunswick-street, Blackfriars-road—he at tempted to run away, but I overtook him—I told him the charge was conspiring to defraud Messrs. Vickers &amp; Co. of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of wine, and asked if his name was French—he said, "No; I do not know anybody of that name"—I took him as far as Lonsdale's shop—he wanted to go in there, but I would not allow him—I took him to the station—the inspector asked him his name—he said, "French"—I took Bell about a quarter-past 9, on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. May, in Lucretia-street, Lambet—I told him the charge, and asked him if his name was Bell—he said, "No"—he asked two or three times what the charge was; and I said, "Do you know a man named French?"—he said, "Your duty is to caution me that what I say will appear in evidence against me"—I said, "You are very right"—he begged to be treated as a gentleman, as he was a solicitor—when we got to Blackman-street, Borough, he said, "If I know French, I will eat a b—y lamp-post"—the inspector at the station asked him his name—he said, "Bell"—he was dressed in a reversible coat; he looks cleaner now than he did then.</p>
