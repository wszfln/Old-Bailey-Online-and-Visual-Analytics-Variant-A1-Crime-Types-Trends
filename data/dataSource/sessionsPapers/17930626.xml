               <p>I am a watchman in St. Martin's in the Fields; I cried the hour of one o'clock, and I came up Ivory-lane, I was going down the hour of half after one, and I was speaking to a brother watchman, and I heard a noise down Ivory-lane, I went down the lane, and I saw the prosecutor laying on his back, and this prisoner at the bar was across him, and taking his watch from him, she had taken the money from him, she seeing me flew up and made off to me, and I catched her in my arms, and some porters picked up the prosecutor and brought him up to me while I had got the prisoner in my arms, and the prosecutor said that that was the woman that robbed him; no, says she, it is the other girl that robbed him, and gave me the money; with that she put her hand into her pocket, and brought some silver out, and I took the silver out of her hand, and put my hand into her pocket and took the rest.</p>
               <p>Jury. How much did you take out? - I took a guinea and a half, and some silver, and a steel chain.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you take from her hand? - Six shillings and six-pence in silver, and a handkerchief out of her bosom. Then I took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it a linen handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is.</p>
               <p>Herbert. I have kept the property from that time to this. (Produces the chain and handkerchief) the money I have forgot and left at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this man very drunk? - Yes, he was so that he did not know what he was about at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any resistance between the girl and him? - Yes, there was great resistance for they took and tore him all down the face. The first thing that I saw was, that she was across him, and trying to get the watch from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260004"/>Q. I want to know what they did to him before they took the watch from him? - They took and tore him all down the face, and made him bleed; I saw the prisoner strike him, when I was coming down he was on the ground, and when he was crying out this girl struck him about the face, and held his mouth, he struggled and put his hand as well as he could to his watch, when he found they were pulling his watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. By what light did you see this? - By the light of the porters coming to market with their lanthorns.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of a night was it? - It was rather lightish.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you take on yourself to say by the light you had, that the prisoner was the woman that did all this? - Yes, I can swear to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other woman with her? - There were two other women with her.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What sort of a chain was this you lost? - A steel chain belonging to a woman's watch, with a hook to it; I can swear to the chain and the handkerchief; I have another like it in my pocket, there is no letter or name on it I had the chain in my waistcoat pocket for to wear it bright, because it was got rusty; I have had it a great many years; there is no particular mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord about half after one o'clock this gentleman took me from one public house to another to drink with him; we drank five or six pints of cider, and three glasses of gin, and he left me this watch chain and his handkerchief; coming along this place he fell down; the porters were going to Covent-garden market, and the money sell out of his pocket, and I picked up the gold; he had not a farthingworth of silver about him; it was my own silver; I have no witness.</p>
               <p>Jury to Herbert. Did you see her take the chain out of his pocket? - I saw it taken from his person.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you off when you saw this? - Not as far as I am from her now.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said that you saw blows that she struck? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he live at this lodging of your's? - He was there about four months.</p>


               <p>Q. Were all these things let to him with the lodgings? - Yes. He went into the country about the 25th or 26th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260005"/>of March 1793; I received a note from him on the 27th, it was sent by a porter, as soon as I received the note I had a suspicion that something was the matter, I immediately got a smith to get into the room, we got into the room and I found all these things at that time were missing; my wife was with me, and the porter that brought the note; I detained him; we had afterwards an information that he was lodging at No. 1, Plow court, Fetter lane; I went there and took four constables with me, and saw the prisoner there, it was between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; the woman that went as his wife was with him; the officers went into the room and said they had got a warrant; they immediately examined the desk and found duplicates that led to a great part of my property, and the key of my room; the prisoner was then taken into custody; I did not go to the pawnbroker's, my wife went, I saw some of the goods again in a few days, I saw them at home, they were the same goods as I had in the room, and were let to the prisoner; the constables brought them home, Baker and Slane.</p>

My lord, an objection arises here, it now turns out from the evidence of the prosecutor himself, that the prisoner quitted the apartments on the 25th or 26th of March, and in the indictment he has laid this theft to be committed on the 27th, therefore he has laid it to be committed after he left the apartments.</p>

               <p>Q. After he went into the country how soon did you hear of him again? - We never knew he went into the country till we received the note; this gave my husband a suspicion, and he went to Plow-court, Fetter-lane; I went to the pawnbroker's Mr. Berry's, with the duplicates, there I found the pillow biers, the sheets and three window curtains.</p>

I remember Mrs. Neale and the officers came to our house and produced this duplicate, the same I had given; I have had the goods ever since in my possession. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Who brought the duplicate to you? - Mrs. Neale came with Slane and Penny.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gardiner. I believe it is not at all unusual for people that are in distress to pawn things in other names than their own? - Not unusual, they do it very frequently. (The goods deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Is your name Hewis? - It is.</p>

I told him I would; he then came in and went backwards to the back part of the shop, and I watched him, and I saw him take the nails from a copper vessel, and saw him put them into his bosom, between his smock frock and his coat, and he went out of doors, and then I told my fellow apprentice, he was up stairs in the kitchen; I called him down.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>I am a goldsmith and jeweller. To all appearance this is the same ring that I was employed to make for Mr. Jones, but my two men are here.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA CHASSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I put this ring together to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you know that is the ring? - Because it is so very particular, but I cannot be positive without taking the ring to pieces. (Takes the ring to pieces.) I am satisfied that is the ring I made for Mr. Wildman.</p>
               <p>Wildman. I am positive that the ring Chasson put together was made for Mr. Jones and sent to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. Do you know the prisoner? - I cannot positively swear to him that I have seen him in the shop, but his person and his voice are very familiar to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Do you think you saw him within these last three months? - Yes, I am certain I have.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Chasson. Can you point out any mark you know that ring by? - Yes, by the motto part, of which was on an old ring, and the latter part was added.</p>
               <p>Jones. I had some diamond letters by me, and I turned them into this ring; they were very remarkable.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>This ring was brought to me to be sold by the prisoner at the bar, about the 14th of May, he left it with me two hours; I told him I was not a judge of diamonds, if he would give me leave to keep it an hour or two I would send it down to Mr. Jones or Mr. Perigall's; I sent it to Mr. Perigall's, he told me it was not worth more than ten pounds, when he came again he said he did not like to sell it for ten pounds, he must go and ask first at Mary-le-bone whether they would take the ten pounds? he came back again and told me that they would take the ten pounds, and I bought it of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Did he bring the ring fairly and openly? - Yes, he did, he called again in about two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any objection to your taking it to Jeffereys and Jones? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any hesitation about leaving it? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He originally refused the ten pounds? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the name he mentioned? - I think it was Wheeler, but I have forgot the name of the street; I am sure it was in Mary-le-bone; I was in Mr. Jones's shop when the prisoner was there, and he said then that he had it of a Mr. Williams, whom he believed was gone to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You are sure he said Williams, and not Wheeler? - I think he did; I am not quite sure.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mr. Jones; I have no doubt but that ring is the property of Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260011"/>Jones, but I cannot so positively say as those gentlemen that were the manufacturers of it; I remember the ring being in the shop, I can positively say to seeing of it three months back; I suppose I have seen it two months back; I was likewise present when the prisoner in our shop said that he had it of a Mr. Williams that was gone to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have two witnesses to bring into this court to prove that Mr. Wheeler, living at No. 14, Harford-street, Mary-le-bone, offered this ring publicly to sell in the Adam and Eve public house, in Mary-le-bone. I never was in Mr. Jones's shop in my life, till I went with Mr. Miller. In my flurry I might have said that I had it from Mr. Williams, but I meant at Mr. Wheeler's, he has left his house and gone away.</p>
               <p>- THYBAUT sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen a ring in the custody of Wheeler? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the ring again was you to see it? - It was a collar ring with a french motto.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see it in Wheeler's possession? - About three weeks before Mr. Richard's was taken, I was generally where I spend my evening after I have done my work, the ring was brought to to me to know what it was worth; I told him it was worth about eight to ten guineas; I am a jeweller, the prisoner was in the room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Wheeler live? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Wheeler before? - I knew him by sight but not to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Wheeler? - I was told it was.</p>
               <p>- ELLIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the Adam and Eve when the ring was offered to sale; Mr. Thybaut was sitting there, and they were shewing a ring, I should not know it if I was to see it.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. Do you know the prisoner? - I have some distant recollection of seeing him, but not to speak positively, I think I have seen him in our shop, but I am not positive of that.</p>
               <p>Court to Jones. You said his person and voice was familiar to you? - I do believe I have seen him in our shop at the time I tell you, but at the same time I do not swear positively to the fact, but it could not be any where else but in the shop.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave any body at work when you went away? - There was only the prisoner and me at work; just before we went away my mistress came up stairs, the prisoner asked her to lend him two shillings; she told him she had not got two shillings, she would let him have eighteen-pence, I had got on my shoes, he was buckling up his shoes; I went down first, my mistress followed me, and he followed her last; as soon as she came to the bottom of the stairs, she begged we would both come to work early in the morning as the work was in a great hurry; we said we would sooner than usual; as soon as I got out into Saville-street I says to the prisoner, I forgot to take my watch: we had some discourse about it; I said I suppose it will be safe enough by the morning; there are two young men, says he, that sleeps in the room, they will swear it is a death watch in the night; we went on all the way through Leicester-fields together; this was the Monday evening which was our club night in Long-acre, and there he said he had got a pair of scissurs grinding at Russel-court, says he, if you will go to the club I will come there presently; he went away, and I went to the house of call, and found he did not come; I related the circumstance to some young men that were there, they said they were afraid I was done out of my watch; I got up early in the morning and went to work, and I asked one of the young men if they had seen my watch that I had left the last night?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch there? - No, I asked them if they had let that irishman come and take away the watch? they said no, he had not been back.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they in the room when you went away? - No, The prisoner never came back to the place afterwards, left the house of call, and never was seen afterwards till I took him up for this, when I was carrying some clothes home for my master last Saturday fortnight, this that I speak of was on the 6th of May, I was in the London-road, St. George's-fields, just before we came to the Romish Chapel, the man and me run against each other, I put my hand against his breast to prevent him running against me, and I recollected his face again, I said, how do you do my friend? don't you recollect when you and me worked together in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260014"/>Saville-court? he said, yes; do not you recollect that I left my watch there? he said, yes; and don't you recollect that you took it away from me? he then said he would make me pay for charging him with a robbery in the street, and he asked me why I detained him? I told him I should not let him go till we had a hearing before a magistrate; this was Saturday evening, I could not get a constable, and he said he would be damned if I should put him into the watch-house, and keep him there all night, if I had any charge against him he would go to any magistrate with me, he would go to Bow-street or any where; I told him it was too late; at last he consented to go to a constable with me, and we went on, and I met a young man who assisted me, and we took him to a lock up house, facing the New Goal in the Borough, and when I got there I gave charge of him, and related the story, and he was examined, and asked where he worked? and he told two or three different stories, and they said they were sure he was guilty; at last I had a coach and brought him to St. Andrew's watch-house, and gave charge of him at the watch-house, and the watchmen searched his pockets; in his pocket was found several duplicates and a piece of a chain of a watch; I told him that piece of a chain belonged to my watch; he said I was a damned liar, for he had it given him in Birmingham a year and a half ago; among the duplicates was found the duplicate of one watch; one of the officers belonging to St. Andrew's watch-house went with me to the pawnbroker's to examine, but the watch was not mine; we came back to St. Andrew's watch-house, and gave charge of him and he was taken to Giltspur-street Compter, On Sunday some woman came to my lodging and said, if I would go to Giltspur-street Compter, I might hear of my watch; when I came home my landlord told me; I said it was too late that night; I went in the morning; when I came he said he only sent for me to know what the devil I meant by leaving him there; I told him he must stay till he had a hearing, and so I parted from him; when we went to Guildhall his wife came to me and said if I would not hurt her husband she would tell me where the watch was; the woman that went with me, took me to the house of this gentleman Mr. Barney of Old Lukener's-lane; when I came there Mr. Barney was not at home; the woman and me went to Bow-street; I had a warrant to search the lodging, but we could not find it there; Mr. Barney heard of it, and came on Tuesday morning and delivered up the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him when he went to work the next morning, whether there was not one of the men gone out of the room that sleeps in the room? - There was.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I was going to work the next morning, I went to work very early, I met this man who slept in the room, one of the men who lodge in the room in which he left his watch; he took me and gave me two or three pots of beer, and he gave me this watch, either to sell or pawn for what I could get for it; I took the watch, I went down to this man's place and shewed it him, says he to me will you sell the watch? says I, it is not mine, says he, I will stand every rig of that sort, I don't care how you came by it, if I can get a bargain; he said he would give fifteen shillings and another that he had taken out of pawn before to boot, and I had sold him the duplicate, I went and advanced the fifteen shillings down to the man, and I told him I would pay him the rest at proper times; we kept drinking till it was too late to go to work, indeed I was not fit, and the next day I knew there was another man put on in my room.</p>
               <p>Court to How. Upon your oath did you give him this watch to pawn for you? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was not him that gave it me, it was the man that slept in the room, there were two single men who slept in the same room where he left his watch, lodgers.</p>
               <p>Court to How. How long had he worked there? - I never worked there but that day before I lost my watch, I took the call that morning, he came there the Friday before.</p>

Last Saturday morning between three and four o'clock when I got up I went down to my shed, I thought the door a little more open than when it was locked, I went to the door and laid hold of the part of the door, and it was open, the prisoner was inside laying down, and he jumped up, and said halloo, halloo, says I, what business have you here? he said he had been asleep; I asked him what business he had there to sleep? he said he did not know. I laid hold of his collar and took him out to the door, and held him while I put the door to; I took him up the street, and I saw the watchman, and we took him to the watch-house, and there we left him; when I came again I found my kit of salmon moved, and I thought I had lost it; I looked into my basket and I saw it there packed in another, and there was some lobsters, horse radish, and cucumbers also; I had put the kit of salmon in the place at past eleven when I locked the place up; it was moved from the place where it stood, and put into this basket which was before empty; and the lobsters, and the cucumbers stood on the top of a shelf; the basket was as full as it could hold; the lobsters were in a tub in a different place; he had wrenched the lock open, and the lock laid down on the floor, and he had got my shoes on when he was before the justice at ten o'clock; these were nigh a place where I set in the shed, what I used to wear in wet whether.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you locked that shed the night before? - I am positive of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260017"/>it; here is the lock and nails are broke; I know the shoes by the nails on the bottom, and the wear of them, I had them for the winter on purpose for to go to market with; there was another pair in the basket and another odd one, and his own shoes were packed up in the basket likewise, and I went back and fetched them, and carried them to the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the street when he laid hold of me; he never catched me in the place at all; my shoes were my own which I bought at Rag Fair.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you know the prisoner before? - No, but I think I have seen him walking about the street.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Russel. Last Sunday was a fortnight I saw the man take hold of the shawl with his right hand. (It was round a child's neck,) and he took it and tied it up, and put it somewhere behind him, but where it was I cannot say, this was between two and three o'clock in the morning, they were going to Gravesend; I went to see them take boat; the man had the child in his arms, the man came to assist us; it was in Spur-street, Leicester-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you? - My master and mistress, and Mrs. Wall, and two young children. The man came out of the public house facing the coach, and came to the coach window, and said he would take the child out to help us from the coach, the coach broke down, and we were getting out, and he took the child out with the shawl on his neck; I saw him put his right hand and take the shawl off the child's neck, and he tied it up, and put it somewhere behind him; then I went down to the other side, because they could not get out that side; the child was taken out of the window, and Mrs. Wall said, Thomas, where is the shawl? I said that man has got it. So my master charged the watch with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he still the child in his arms when you told them that he had got the shawl, or had they taken the child out of his arms? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the man did stay some time with the child in his arms after he had taken it out of the window? - Yes. The watchman went after him, and he had the handkerchief in his hand, and he threw it way; I saw my master pick it up.</p>

               <p>I hired the coach a little after two on Sunday morning the 8th of June, in Spur-street, Leicester-fields; the coach broke down, and from the said coach which was broke down, they handed the child out, the prisoner did; after that they were going to handle the bundles out, with that I said, no don't handle the bundles out we shall lose them; then after we got out of the coach I asked about the shawl, and Tom said, that man had got it; I said are you sure of it? he said, yes; then I charged the watch with him, and I saw him pull it from behind him, and throw it on the ground; and I picked it up. This is the same that I picked up, that I saw him throw down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the child out of the coach, the coach was broke down; I delivered the child, and every thing, as far as I know, as I found it; I delivered the child as freely as I took it; I have got no witness; there was nobody there it was so early; I have lived in St. James's parish thirty-five years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. He bears an exceeding good character my lord, and I hope you will shew him mercy.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>I am a labourer. I was standing at a public house door in Whitechapel, facing the Church; I heard a woman crying stop him! stop him! and I saw the prisoner running, and just as he passed me I pursued him, and I saw the fowls in Mr. Dungate's hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Miller. How far from where this man was stopped was the place from where he took the fowls from you? - About half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How came there to be a cry of stop thief and Dorman to take him?</p>
               <p>Dorman. He was pursued for something else; some new shoes, a silver band and a hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord I know nothing at all about it; at the change of the moon my head is light, and I don't know what I am about.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was coming along Whitechapel between the hours of four and five, and the people walked very thick on the pavement, and there were two more lads walking close by the side of me, and a kind of a cheesemonger man catched hold of three of us, and called the gentleman back, and one of the other two dropped the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Alefounder. Was there any other boy with him? - I believe there were two other boys with him, but I am sure I saw it drop from him, and not from either of the other boys.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the book keeper at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane; I know nothing at all except that this gentleman, the prisoner at the bar, came with this luggage, a deal box, an hair trunk, two bundles and two hat boxes; they are here; I saw them opened before the alderman. I should imagine there was two milk pots I should know again; I know the hair trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner come? - He came at a quarter past four on the 21st of June, on Friday, they were put in the Liverpool hole; I am sure the prisoner brought them with another man; the officer came about half past four, and I delivered them the same things, every thing as was brought by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner after this? - I did not see him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260022"/>at all after he left the counting house; I never saw him any more till now, except before Mr. Alderman Curtis on Saturday, I believe the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the same man then? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You never saw the man before that day he came to your house? - Never, and never saw him but once since, and that was before Mr. Alderman Curtis.</p>
               <p>Q. He came with another person you say? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any woman with him? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. All the goods were in the trunks, and packed up? - There was nothing loose, all packed up in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know who produced the keys of these trunks afterwards? - I cannot tell from whom they were taken.</p>
               <p>Court to Goodman. What day was it he left your house? - On Tuesday.</p>
               <p>- GREEN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable; I produce this property which was stopped at the inn, an hair trunk, a square deal box, a bundle, a hat box, and a bonnet box; I got them from the book keeper which was in the warehouse at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane; it was last Friday week, about half after four, I have kept them ever since, I took them to a room, and locked them up, and kept the key in my possession; the deal box was locked, not the hair trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the key at any time? - Yes, I got the key from Mrs. Goodman.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys did she give you? - There were three keys she gave to James Hall and me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You say the keys were produced by Mrs. Goodman? - Yes; I took the prisoner, and Mrs. Goodman with him by the side of one another in the tap of the Swan with Two Necks that day after I had stopped the property; the prisoner was in company with Mrs. Goodman, they were both together, had a pint of beer before them, and a small bundle before them, which I have here; here are nineteen check aprons, three muslin handkerchiefs, four linen shifts, one dimity petticoat, six other petticoats, one silk gown, &amp;c. (The same as in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. In fact there were several articles of female dress amongst them? - There was.</p>
               <p>Court to Goodman. Did your wife stay in the house after the day he went? - She did not. I saw him about ten or eleven o'clock, and I asked him whether he had no work? he said he had work enough, and my wife went away between five and six; they both went on Tuesday,</p>
               <p>Q. What articles can you speak with the most certainty to? - The milk pot, the punch ladle, and the counterpane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the things before your wife went away? - No, I found the drawers were stripped almost quite; here are several sheets, I know here is a gown that I have seen on my wife's back, and a green bonnet, but I cannot say that they are marked in my name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go away at the same time? - No, I never saw him after ten or eleven o'clock, and she went away between five or six; they both went on one; I missed the things the next morning about nine o'clock when I opened the drawers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Then Mr. Goodman, your wife went away about five or six hours before the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Green. They were found in the hair trunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat to Goodman. You know the things then only by their general appearance? - No, and having lost such things.</p>
               <p>Court to Nicholson. You was the person that received these things, was it a man or woman that came with the prisoner? - It was a man.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you put them down? - They were only put down, Mr. Brunnen's luggage, 1 l. 15 s. The money was paid I believe by the prisoner, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Then the man that was with him appeared as the witness I suppose? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not you that saw the woman in the tap room? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Green. It was I that saw her with the prisoner in the tap room on this same Tuesday.</p>

               <p>I am a porter to the public house; I have seen the prisoner, he is a lodger there, I saw the prisoner on Tuesday as the wife was at tea in the afternoon, I saw him come out of the house with a shawl in his apron, and that box in his hand, I believe this to be the same shawl according to the best of my knowledge which the constable produces; that morning that he went away, the wife had said something to the husband concerning the pots, and as soon as the husband was gone he went up stairs immediately, and came down with these things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You saw a shawl? - I did, and I have seen the shawl on her, and I believe it to be the same shawl I have seen on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it wrapped up? - It was lapped over the bundle, what was inside I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if you had seen that shawl at York you would have known it? - I am positive, you will do no good by cross examining me, because I have more behind.</p>

               <p>When the prisoner and Mrs. Goodman was brought before alderman Curtis, I was in court, and I was desired to ask who had got the keys, and Mrs. Goodman replied that she had, and I was ordered to ask her for them; I did, and she gave me some, one of which opened this trunk, and they were both committed for this offence</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Goodman depended on me to do her justice, as she was going into the country, and desired me to put the things in in my own name.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. By all means I had a right to have the duplicate of the hat I had bought in the Hay-market, after paying four shillings and six pence for it, because they had a suspicion of this hat they conceived it must be that gentleman's there; I never meddled with the hat, and they cannot say that I did, except they for swear themselves. I have a few words to say. I brought this hat of a jew in the Haymarket, and gave four shillings and sixpence for it, he had told me his name was Shepherd, and that he lived in Rosemary-lane; in the afternoon afterwards I pawned it for three shillings.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. No man can speak a word against my character, except about these breeches; about the 17th of May I left two pair of old breeches in that place which were not worth much; on the 3d of June or 4th, I went to see for my breeches and could not find them, by looking about I found these in the hostry and took these to put them on while I had another pair mended; I takes these to the breeches maker's, which the prosecutor knows at the time I changed them, afterwards I wore these breeches and did not know but they were my own when I took them. I have no witnesses because I expected it would have been made up, because I sent a person to Mr. Fossit yesterday morning, and he said it would come to nothing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you lost this horse? - Lost which horse?</p>
               <p>Q. This horse of your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to your knowledge that you lost this horse? - I will swear it was taken out of my stable unbeknown to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Short Hand Writer be so good as to take that down.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively and allow that gentleman to take it down that you lost that horse unknown to you out of your stable? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before the 6th of April had you seen your horse? - I saw it that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell my lord just now that you had seen it at home a fortnight before? - I did not say that I believe, I had seen it that very day before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in Smithfield market the 4th of April I believe? - No, this happened on Saturday that I lost my horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not in Smithfield market the day before? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath don't you know you was? - Yes, I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw that man the prisoner at the bar before in your life? - Yes, many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - In Smithfield, I was very near Smithfield market and I believe I did see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he go with you to Smithfield market for the purpose of disposing of that horse? - I don't think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that you went together to Smithfield for the purpose of disposing of this horse? - No, not together, I saw him in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you go together? - No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you drink together at your own house before you went to market? - I really cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. But you shall say. Did not that man come to your own house on Friday and drink with you and set off with you for Smithfield to dispose of this horse? - I don't know but he might.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was it not on your own application that he came there to drink with you and go with you to Smithfield? - No, I believe the horse was lame and I met him at Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not he meet you that morning by your own appointment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260032"/>at your own house, and go to Smithfield with you to dispose of that horse? - What on Friday?</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you on the morning of that Friday? - I say I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell us that you only met him in Smithfield market? - I say so now.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them is true? - I have forgot, I have been very ill, I have had a very sad fit.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did meet you by your own appointment? - I forget.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did he or did he not meet you at your own house? - I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you met him in Smithfield market? - I think that is true.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is it true that you met him by appointment to go to your own house with you? - I cannot say, I might say something to him about it, I think to the best of my remembrance I light of him by the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not make the appointment with him to meet you at your own house? - I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Who saddled the horse? - Where?</p>
               <p>Q. Saddled the horse to go to Smithfield? - Myself I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your mare out to go with this horse to Smithfield? - My mare?</p>
               <p>Q. You rode them both I suppose? - Upon my word I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not this man ride the horse, and you rode the mare? - He did get up on it just by porters block at one end of Smithfield, towards Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the mare and horse to Smithfield? - I rode one and led the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that the prisoner did not ride either the mare or horse to Smithfield? - I cannot swear about it, I have forgot what was done on Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have forgot that you gave this man authority to sell the horse for you? - On Friday he said he could get a customer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew your intention to sell it? - He knew I came there to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. On Friday he told you he believed he could get a customer to sell it. He deals in horses, I believe? - I have been told so.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath don't you know so? - Because he never dealt with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he is a horse-dealer? - He may be a horse-stealer.</p>
               <p>Q. So may you, for which you have suffered the law perhaps? - If I have I cannot help it; I have heard that he is a horse-dealer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you hear that he was a horse-dealer when you went to Smithfield market? - I believe him to be like myself, a person that now and then bought a horse, and now and then sold a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you talk to him as a dealer in horses? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, on that Friday, did not you speak to him, and act with him as a dealer in horses? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. When he told you that he believed he could get a customer for this horse, did not you desire him to get one for it if he could? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Then for ought you know you might have desired him to get a customer for this horse? - I recollect very little about Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to swear that you did not give him authority to sell it? - I know I lost it against my desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you give him authority to sell it? - I have forgot it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260033"/>entirely whether I did or not I have forgot all that past on Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go with this man to the public house in St. John street where this horse was put up? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you meet him there? - No, I met him at porter's block, we were there together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this man pay for the horse's keep there? - No, I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who took him home? - I took it home; I believe I rode one and led the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear man that he did not ride the horse? - I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. For ought you know then he might do it? - I do not say so, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that this was not so? It might pass, and I not recollect it, I don't know any thing about Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. No, no, you don't know any thing about Friday which is a material point; I should like to be acquainted with you, who are you, you say you live in lodgings now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how lately did you learn at your lodgings that this man had been at your house to pay five guineas which he said had been the produce of the horse? - I don't know any thing of it,</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that that man had sent his wife with five guineas, as the price of that horse? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have you never heard at your own house that that man's wife came with five guineas, as the price of the horse, a day or two after the 6th of April? - I don't remember any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you see the prisoner's wife and did not she tell you she brought five guineas as the price of that horse that was sold? - The horse cost me eight guineas and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. But it might have been sold for five guineas? - I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you see the man's wife? - I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that positively? - I believe I could venture to say it, because I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear positively that you did not see that man's wife who brought you five guineas, and told you there was the price or part of the price of the horse? - No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that positively? - I will, there was never any such thing as money offered me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the wife tell you that she brought five guineas as the price, or part of the price of the horse? - I will swear that, that I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that it never passed between the prisoner's wife and you? - I don't know; I am pretty sure I never heard it, I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why it is a very material circumstance? - I can safely swear that I did not see the man's wife the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not hear it the day after? - I am not sure, you ask me so many questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was not sent to gaol for rescuing a couple of thieves? - I recollect that, that was an accident, it was not for rescuing them, I never did rescue them.</p>
               <p>Q. The jury are very unjust sometimes? - The jury I believe are very right.</p>
               <p>Q. You then kept the Eagle in Eagle street? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave it? - Because I had money enough to live without.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the cause of your leaving that public house, because you had money enough to live without; on your oath was not your licence taken away? - I believe you are very right, the licence was taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260034"/>Q. Some people said there was a man lost his life there? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he die? - I forget, it is a good while ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he might take it by your order on Friday and dispose of it? - It was not disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, it was disposed of to Mr. Bishop? - That was on Saturday night; I have forgot whether I gave him leave to sell it on Friday or no.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you give him leave on Saturday? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar? - Six or seven months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been intimately acquainted with him from that time? - I have seen him at Smithfield three or four times; he durst not go into Smithfield, he was obliged to stand outside of the bar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. On your oath was not the horse taken from the stable in your presence on Saturday? - I will swear that it was taken out of my stable unbeknown to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you? - I believe I was down at Islington. It was lost as near as I can guess, between four in the afternoon and nine at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you tell this man that if he could sell it for five guineas you should be content? - I never told him so. I bought it at Hopkins's.</p>
               <p>Q. Not on Friday? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought it at Hopkins's as a good horse? - I gave eight guineas and a shilling, it was lame when I bought it; I believe the prisoner was there when I did buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner pass his judgment on it for you at the sale? - No, I bought it on my own judgement. There was a great many hundred people there at the sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any other woman near? - Not near, there were others in the shop, she had on a black silk cloak, but whether she dropped them from her cloak or petticoat I cannot exactly say, they were concealed somewhere about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them up? - I cannot exactly say; I believe my servant did that will be next called; I have had them in my possession ever since, they have never been out of my possession.</p>

I saw the prisoner come into the shop, I had been out shewing some goods, and come home; I found her standing at the window, when I came into the shop I informed my master; he desired me to count the muslins that were in the wrapper; I found nineteen quantities; after she had been in I counted again, and I found there were two short; she chose a particular one, and desired them to cut off a quarter of a yard; while some muslins lay on the counter which she had been looking at, I see her draw something out from the counter while the other man was shewing her the muslins, and removed her gown on one side, and concealed them under her gown, I told my master of it; I then had orders to take no notice of it till she went out; my master desired I would count the muslins over again to see if there were any gone; I made but seventeen pieces of them; when she was gone out we went out after her, and I saw her drop two pieces, I took them up, and gave them to my master; he desired me to go for one of the runners, and then she was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why should he think I should take it any more than the other two women that were in the shop? - They were not on the same side of the shop.</p>

I went to this gentleman's shop, I have dealt there about seven years off and on, my husband is ordered out to sea; I am a weaveress by trade; I have got three children, and a young woman that lived next door to me asked me to make her an apron; work being short I went to this shop, and asked for a bit of muslin; so he took down the muslin, here, says he, here is the muslin; and he says to that young man cut her off a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260036"/>quarter of a yard, for which I paid nine-pence, I went then to the other counter, and left two women at the muslin counter; I was coming out, and there were three women in the shop; just coming out there is a horse like standing where there are prints on it; I looks at the prints, and I says, there is a young woman that lives next door to me that wants a piece of cotton at a shilling a week; I was just going out of the shop, and Mr. Jubb came up to me, and said, come back, you have got some muslin; the two women went out of the shop, and they left me there, and they sent for an officer, and charged the officer with me; Mr. Jubb kept the muslin; he has got now also the quarter of a yard that I paid for; I have dealt with the shop for many years, and they always took notice of my children; I have got three of them now; I have those that would give me the best of characters but they did not know of my trial coming on so soon.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Hatton-garden; I saw nothing of the robbery; I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday last in the parish of Clerkenwell, near Clerkenwell Prison; I examined her, and found a guinea and a half in gold, and eleven shillings and six-pence in silver, good and bad; six-pennyworth of copper farthings and half pence; two small shut knives, commonly called pen knives, both clasp knives; fifteen duplicates; but they did not lead to any thing as I have understood; and a box key; I found two half crowns, one bad one.</p>
               <p>Court to Shifton. Are any shillings marked? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to any half-pence? - No, I can speak to the clasp knife, I know it by the wear; I had it two years, there is no mark particularly, but the person who ground it last put S. or Shipton on it, I don't know which, the maker's name is Charwood.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you swear absolutely to this knife being in your possession? - I do think also I know the half crown; I knew Mr. Randall gave me one, and I believe it to be the same I received of him.</p>
               <p>Randall. This is the half crown I gave him positively, it has two or three scratches on it.</p>
               <p>Foss. I believe this to be the half crown.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you drunk or sober when you picked up this girl? - I was a little in liquor I believe, I was not very much, I was not so much in liquor but I knew where I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I was walking up Holborn, and another young woman with me, I met this gentleman and a tall thin young lad, and I spoke to the young lad that was with the gentleman, and the other young woman spoke to that gentleman; says she to me, shall we all go home to your room? no, says I, my landlady don't like it. O, says she, she will be in bed. We went to my room, and the gentleman gave me six pence to get something to drink; he did not chuse me, he liked the other young woman best; so I asked him for a trifle more; he gave half a crown and a shilling to get some rum, and I went down stairs, and left the other young woman with him; the other young man went off before we were at the top of the stairs, and said to me let me change hats with him, he is quite in liquor, he will not know it. I suppose this man robbed him, I know he was nothing better that a pickpocket, I suppose he robbed him, and then wanted to get rid of him.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in company with any other young woman? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed with this woman, did you give her any money, or make her any present? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give her the half crown? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you gave her gold or silver? - Silver.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was this from Baker's field that you saw the man with the basket on his shoulder? - Better that a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>Mr. Baker came to me yesterday morning, and told me he had lost some copper, and some copper was found; I told him if it came off from his houses I could be sure to tell; I went and matched it directly to one of his houses; the nail holes and every thing it fitted exactly with the place where some copper had been put on the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that that was part of the property that was put on Baker's houses? - Yes, I will be upon my oath it was, it was a gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it nailed or fixed on? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fix it on? - My man did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it before it was fixed on? - I have looked at my books, and it answers exactly to the measurement; there had been a part taken before from the house adjoining, the houses were both of a size, and each took a quantity of copper alike.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right a part of the copper which had been put on the gutter of one house was taken away, and a part left? - This that is now produced is what was taken from the whole of one house; there had been some taken away from the adjoining house sometime before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try whether it would fit the gully holes of the other house? - It would not; it did not go the right way for the current of the water; we value it at twenty shillings now; but it will cost Mr. Baker more than two guineas to replace it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found it in the fields laying in three pieces, and that bit of a bag lay by it; and I took it and put it in my basket, and took it away; I work for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260040"/>Mr. Law, in Chiswell-street, he can give me a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Baker. When had you last seen it on the house? - I had not seen the top of the house for some months, the house was built before Christmas.</p>

             a celebrated watch maker? - I fancy he is not; I can produce the man that made it, it is not the real maker's name on the watch, it was made by one Beck.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had not, but I am positive it is the same, he was in the shop for the space of twenty minutes; I shewed him the watch; he did not approve of that watch; he desired to look at another that was marked three guineas, which I shewed him also; he did not approve of that; I shewed him another which was marked three guineas; then he asked to look at a metal watch; the three first were silver watches, I shewed him a metal watch; he did not approve of it; then after some hesitation he agreed for the first I shewed him, for which he was to give three guineas; he desired then to look at a chain; I shewed him two chains, a steel one and a metal one, and he did not approve of either of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260043"/>the two chains, he said there was a particular chain in the corner of the window which he should like to look at; at this time I had put up two of the watches out of the five which I shewed him first, and there remained three on the counter; when I turned myself about he said there was a chain which he would wish to look at, and he said he would go to the outside and point to it, he went outside to point to it as I thought, and I turned myself about and missed the watch, and the prisoner, and not seeing the prisoner I jumped over the counter to go into the street, and I could see nothing of the prisoner. Hearing of a robbery of the same nature I attended at Bow-street, at the examination, and I knew the prisoner, on Monday evening last; he had on the very same dress as he had on at the time he came into our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the watch? - Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty. Did you see him take the watch off the counter? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any body else in the shop? - Yes, but not at that part of the shop where the watches were shewn, there were customers pledging, and two or three more people of our own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hosty. How long was he in the shop? - A quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I was principally engaged with him, I took particular notice of him when I took two of the watches to hang them up; I have no doubt as to his person.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took down five and put up two? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other people in the shop? - They were, but not in that part of the shop, there is a projection in the shop.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any counter between where the people were pledging and the prisoner? - There was not, there was a partition about the distance of two yards.</p>
               <p>Court. Did any of the other people run away? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know them again? - I do. (Produced and deposed to.) They are new stockings; I deal in them, I know that I bought them by the bills that I can shew for them, and I have my own private mark on them.</p>

               <p>I had the cloak of Mrs. Bradbury; it was taken from me by the prisoner on London-bridge; he asked me if I had any silver in my pocket? I told him no, I had not; he wanted a shilling or two; this was about half after one to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the 8th of October? - I do not rightly recollect, it was the same day the woman lent it me, I went from her house with it; he told me he was going to the ship that laid on the Keys, and if I would wait till he came back again he would bring me the cloak back again, and likewise give me a guinea; he asked me for it, and I pulled the cloak off my back and gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - No, never saw him with my eyes before. I was hired as a servant by Mrs. Bradbury, and by her desire I went with the man, and I followed him along the street with her cloak on.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any thing been said about her cloak? - Yes, he was in the kitchen when Mrs. Bradbury gave it me, and put it on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand he was to raise money on this cloak? - No, he asked me if I had any silver in my pocket? I told him no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober? - I really don't know, he seemed to be sober as far as I believe, he walked very steady; we did not hear of him for two or three days after, and then the cloak was advertized; I have seen it since in Mr. Hall's possession; I don't rightly call to mind what particular time, it was about a week ago or so, I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same cloak that you gave to the prisoner? - Yes, The prisoner was taken soon after he left me, I did not see him that day; when he was taken he was taken before a magistrate, and I went, and he was committed; I did not see that he was any ways disguised in liquor at all.</p>

Whilst he was in the Compter I went to see him, because they said it was not safe for any body to go near him, as he had bit some of the prisoners? (The cloak produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bradbury.

             respecting the prisoner, and I got up the next morning between four and five o'clock, and at five o'clock the prisoner came and rattled at my door, at the latch, he was a stranger to me, then I did not know him, he came to the shop door; I have only one door, and then I asked of my boy if he had not sold some things out of the shop? I did not meddle with the prisoner that morning; the Monday morning following he came again; on the 4th, I see him there, I was in the street on the opposite side of the way, and when I came nigh the door, I heard him say to my boy, there is your master. On Monday morning the 18th, I had two officers ready to apprehend him, he was apprehended in my shop; he rattled at the door, and we opened the door, it was at five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him rattle at the door yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - I asked him how he came to buy any thing out of my shop? he said he had only bought some rags; I called my apprentice and asked him if that was the man that he sold the harateen furniture to? he said it was; he said this in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - He did not say any thing particular.</p>

            , the prisoner, brought the horse to my door to sell, in Whitechapel-road side, on Thursday the 13th of June, to the best of my remembrance, he asked me seven Guineas for it; I told him it was too much money; and he told me that it belonged to a man and that he wanted to part from it sadly, he did not know what to do with it; with that I told him to go to the man, and if he could buy it for me for four guineas, I would give him half a crown for himself; with that I suppose he was gone as much as an hour, or an hour and a half, to the best of my remembrance, with that he came back, and told me I might have the horse at that price that was bid; with that I found the horse very lame; after I had it, I thought the horse would not suit me, being so lame, I took it to Smithfield on Friday, when Mr. Matthews owned it; the horse was detained up against one of the rails, and somebody came up to me, and said that my horse was stopped, that it was stole; I ran up immediately and said, if he would swear it was his horse, before a magistrate, he should have it; with that I desired the horse to be put up at livery; and Mr. Matthews and his friends went to the Bull and Butcher, in Smithfield, while I went to Whitechapel and took this Andrew Crawford going into his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he sold you the horse was he known to you, or was he a stranger? - I knew him very well by being about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where to find him? - did not know justly at the time, but I was directed when I went after him from one Mr. Meads, the Red Lyon. I asked him how he came by the horse? he told me, as I said before, that he had it to sell for a man; I asked him what the man was? he told me that he was something of a travelling drover, or something of that kind, to the best of my remembrance; with that we went to Smithfield, and there several gentlemen questioned him there, and there they told him if he could not make no better story then that, they thought bad would come of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This horse was sold to you in broad day-light? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him perfectly well by eye-sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that he was a horse-jobber? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was it worth more than what you gave for it? - I had it at Smithfield, and there I was bid four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You live in the neighbourhood where the man resides? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if he had stole the horse he could not have come to a worse neighbourhood to conceal it? - That is what I have said all along.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you at the first time, long before there was any suspicion, that the horse was not his, but he sold it for another man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260048"/>Q. He twice exposed himself to your view in the business? - He did, he left the horse along with me sometime, and I told him that I bought it for another young man, and he did not like it, and so I took it for myself; he wished me to put the horse in the stable the first time he came, till he came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at this bill? - I have seen it; they were distributed by the prisoner's wife in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I would ask you, Mr. Allen, supposing you had a stolen horse in your possession, could you take better steps than this man has taken? - I took all the pains I could to find the man that he said he bought the horse of, one

               <p>I am in the service of Mr. Watson and Wayley, in the Minories, in the wine way. The prisoner lodged at my house, he has been about nine weeks a lodger with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lodge with you to the very day that he was taken up on this charge? - He did; and his wife and family are now there at present; I live in New Castle-street, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he used to get his living? - I cannot say; I am always out from morning to night; I know nothing of him only as a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day on which he was taken up? - On Friday the 11th, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he was on the Friday proceeding that Friday? - He was at home in his apartments between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you come from work? - Between seven and eight; I always leave work at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at home before you saw the prisoner on that evening? - I had been out about an hour; he had been out and came in again; he went out, and came in again about half after nine, as near as I can guess; between seven and eight I first saw him at my house and he went out for about an hour, as near as I can guess, and then he came home, and went to bed; at ten o'clock I went to bed; I went to his room and asked if all were in bed? and then I went to bed; he slept level with the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the door of your house? - I did myself; it was fastened with a double lock and two bolts; I left the key in the door; the room that I sleep in is close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you fastened the door was the prisoner in his room or not? - He was in his room, for I bid him good night, and likewise his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260051"/>Q. Who got up first in the morning? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock him in his own room? - I had no business to do that; he fastened his own door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the door when you got up in the morning? - I found it safe as when I left it at night.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time in the morning was it you got up? - About a quarter before seven, as near as I can guess; I found the door locked and bolted the same way precisely as I left it.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know it was between seven and eight you saw him on that Friday? - I always leave work at seven o'clock, and when I leave work I go home.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect you saw him on Friday more than any other day? - Because being in his appartment.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was that day? - By his being taken up the week following, I asked him what he owed for rent? and wrote out a receipt for him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up? - The 14th I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the day by the rent? - It was agreed with him to pay me so much a week for the room, and I asked him for the money on the 7th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here to day? - I told him I would come, to mention the time that he was within. I heard he was in trouble; he has a wife and four children; they are lodgers with me now, and she is big with another.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Fore-street, Cripplegate; I am a shoemaker, I know Crawford, I have worked for him this four or five years.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you tell us what you know about the affair of the horse for which the man was taken up? - There was a relation of mine who wanted to buy a horse, I applied to Mr. Crawford as a horse-dealer for one about three weeks ago; I believe it was a Thursday, I am not quite positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long before he was taken up? - That I cannot tell, to the best of my knowledge it was a Thursday, I believe three weeks to day, but I am not certain. A relation wanted to buy a horse, I applied to Mr. Crawford, he told me that he thought he had got a horse that would suit him; I met him afterwards at the time appointed, just at the Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road, with my acquaintance; my acquaintance said he should like to see how the horse would go; the prisoner had the horse there; while this was going forward a person came up to the prisoner at the bar, and said, that he wanted to sell a horse.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this person mentioned he wanted to sell a horse, do you recollect whether that person was on a horse? - He was, and it was a black one I believe, but I am not much conversant in horses. The prisoner said that he had a horse of his own to sell, and therefore he declined buying of it. The man I did not know, but they seemed to know each other, then the man said I wish you would sell this horse for me, then the prisoner said, what money do you expect for it; he said, he should expect five guineas for the horse, but says he, if you cannot get that, sell it for what you can get for it; the prisoner took the horse from the man and the man went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How many years have you known this man? - About four years.</p>
               <p>Q. From the length of time you have known him what character has he borne as to honesty? - He always paid me very honest, I never heard any thing till this happened.</p>

               <p>Court. You say this was three weeks ago? - It was, to the best of my knowledge on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260052"/>Q. Then that is about the 6th of June? - It was the beginning of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your livelihood? - By shoe making.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a master or a journeyman? - I have been a master for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you ascertain the time better? - No, I cannot, I believe it was on a Thursday, but I cannot say better than that.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. I think you said that it was of a Friday morning that you turned him out? - Yes, and I saw him again on Friday afternoon, but I cannot tell exactly what time of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court to Thomas. How long have you lived in Fore-street? - About seven years, and have kept the house as long.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your next door neighbour? - Mr. Walker, the Green Dragon is on one side; I live in three Mariner-court; Bodel a cheesemonger, lives on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this man come on the horse and ask the prisoner at the bar to sell the horse for him, did you hear nothing about where he was to meet him to pay him the money? - No, no such a thing passed in my hearing.</p>

               <p>Court to Thomas. Did the prisoner and the man that came up to him on the black horse, appear to know each other? - They did, they appeared to know each other very well.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I told her I would have nothing to do with her, she still proceeded on the street with me; she began to be rude, feeling about my breeches, and by that means knocked her bonnet off. I suspected she had some ill design against me, so I says, you will not say I knocked your bonnet off; she said no, on which at that moment, I felt her hand in my breeches pocket, as I supposed, for I did not find any thing, I took the money out of my breeches pocket and put it in my coat pocket, that she should not take it, she did not get the money when I supposed she was at my pocket, I walked on further and I found her hand at my coat pocket, and I clapped my hand into my coat pocket and found the four guineas was safe there, which I supposed then was a mistake, thinking her hand to have been there. I went on further and I found her hand in my coat pocket again, and she immediately turned away and bid me good by. I clapped my hand into my pocket and found the money was taken out, I turned round immediately after I had missed my money and laid hold of her; I then took her to the watch-house, when we came to the watch house I gave charge of her, and the officer searched her she declared she had no money about her, except a bad shilling, a good shilling, and three pennyworth of halfpence, which was all the money she was possessed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officer search her? - They did, they did not find any thing on first searching her, I was positive about the money, and would not give the money up; at last the officer, says possibly she may got it in her stockings, two of the police officers, who were there, insisted on her untying her stockings, and when she untied her stockings, one of the officers saw the shape of the money on the inside, he laid hold of it and he said here is some of it; then she resisted till the second officer got up, and he found two guineas more, one guinea more she concealed, which I did not know where it was put. I saw the money, the three guineas, taken out of the stocking myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the woman before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be from the time she first accosted you, till the time you lost your money, and that you went away from her? - I suppose it might be the space of ten minutes or not so much.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you perfectly sober? - Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In what line of life may you be in? - I am a jeweller.</p>
               <p>Q. A master jeweller? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - In Lambert-street, Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been spending your evening? - I had been taking a walk up the City-road.</p>
               <p>Q. What at eleven o'clock at night? - That was seven o'clock that I went up there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go in the City-road? - I walked up as far as the Green Gate and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the public house? - Yes, I looked in at the pleasure ground at Peerless Pool.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing there? - I drank part of a pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between seven and eight o'clock, what other house did you go in? - Not any other till I returned to Somerset-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went into one there? - I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260056"/>Q. What time did you stay there? - Till about a quarter after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there? - A quarter after nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You were there two hours then drinking, what had you to drink? - I and another we had a pint of porter and some lamb chops, and a glass of gin and water between two.</p>
               <p>Q. And no more than a glass of gin and water? - No, besides the pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing else besides the gin and water and the pint of porter to drink? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing else drinking the whole course of the time? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your wife live with you in Lambert-street? - She does.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been out as late in the evening before now many times? - I suppose I have been out late as well as other men.</p>
               <p>Q. So late as twelve o'clock? - Yes, now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps now and then you have had the misfortune to meet with prostitutes before now? - We cannot walk along the streets without them, nor no other man else.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you begin to dream after this woman came up to you, that she meant to charge you with the robbery? - I was not asleep, so I could not dream.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it in your head that this woman meant to charge the watch with you, because she merely laid hold of your arm? - Her bonnet tumbled off by accident and I did not know her design.</p>
               <p>Q. You state that on your oath? do you mean to have the jury believe you, that you supposed because the woman's bonnet dropped from her head that she had an idea of charging the watch with you? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. The money you say was in your breeches pocket? - It was at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which? - In the right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that next the woman or the other side? - Next the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the breeches pocket buttoned? - I don't know it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was buttoned? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you went out whether you had buttoned your breeches pocket where your money was? - I cannot, it might be buttoned or it might not.</p>
               <p>Q. So you apprehended when you supposed the prisoner was going to rob you, that the safer way was to put it in your coat pocket, and you mean to say that money is safer in your coat pocket than in your breeches pocket, you think it more likely for the breeches pocket to be robbed than the coat pocket? - It is most likely they will look to the breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. This was after the attempt to rob you that you put it in your coat pocket? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you think the coat pocket a great deal more likely to lose the money from than the breeches pocket; if you were to take a large sum of money into the street of a night, you think the best way would be to put it in your coat pocket sooner than you would put it in your breeches pocket? - Yes, when a person has a design on any particular place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you looked upon that to cross the design. Is it not more free than the breeches pocket? - But it is not a place so subject to find money in.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman had not left you all the time? - She had not.</p>
               <p>

            So she must have observed you change the money? - Possibly she might.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260057"/>Q. If she was close to you, she must have seen you change your money? - I don't know but what she might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she had easier access to your coat pocket than she had to your breeches pocket? - That was no rule, she had no right to take it out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was four guineas you lost, and you only found three? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman never got out of your custody, you pursued her directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The guineas you have got here? - I have not got them; the officer has got them.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much frightened she would charge you with the robbery, on this bonnet business? - I did not know but that she might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she attempt to call the watch? - She did not</p>
               <p>Court There was nothing particular about your guineas, that you can know them from other peoples guineas? - No, none at all; I don't know that there is.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to know how she had the opportunity of putting the three guineas in her stocking, without his observing, if she never left him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long time elapsed from the time you first saw the woman, to the time you got to the watch-house? - About twelve or fourteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time had elapsed from the time you suppose you lost your money, to the time you left her in the watch-house? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the first thing that made you suspect the woman, was the hand near your breeches pocket; then you supposed she had an idea of robbing you. Was there any watchmen in the street? - Yes, there was a watchman in the bottom of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after that call watch? - I did not; I suppose the watchman was above an hundred yards distant; it was after I past him that it occurred; when I past him I had no occasion to speak.</p>

               <p>Q. If you had chosen it, having seen the watchman, you might have resorted to him afterwards, and made a complaint?</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you pass the watchman with this woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts was it you first supposed that she had got her hand in your breeches? - In Little Alie-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before you past the watchman? - It was after.</p>
               <p>Jury. When the attempt was made at your breeches pocket, do you know how far the watchman was from you? - About seventy, or eighty, or a hundred yards; I did not see him, because my back was to him, I did not see him at all.</p>

               <p>About a quarter past one, the eighth of this month, I came into Whitechapel watch-house, and I saw the prosecutor there, and he said he had been robbed of four guineas; the prisoner was sitting on the bench, and he said he had searched her, but he could not find any thing about her. She declared she had but fifteen-pence and a bad shilling about her; then he said he had no suspicion further, without the money was in the top of her stocking; accordingly she pulled up her coats pretty high, above her knee, and I saw the marks of money on her shin bone, I took hold of it, and I pulled down the top of her stocking, and I found it was a guinea; I took and pulled her stocking right off, and two guineas more fell out, which Nash picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that mark on the shin bone above or below the garter? - Below the garter.</p>
               <p>Q. Her stockings were gartered, were they? - They were.</p>

               <p>On the 8th of June, about a quarter after one in the morning, I had occasion to go into Whitechapel watch-house, I heard the prosecutor say that he had been robbed of four guineas; I asked the constable of the night if he had searched her? he said he had, and could not find any thing at all. I sat there some time, and then the prosecutor said he believed it must be in her stocking; she heard him say so, and she declared that she had but one shilling and three-pence, and a bad shilling in her pocket; she very readily pulled up her clothes; and directly as she pulled up her clothes Mr. Franks saw the guinea, and catched hold of it; she made some little resistance, but with the assistance of me he untied her stocking, and pulled it off, and two guineas were in it. We pulled the other stocking off, and then we had a woman to search her above; we thought we had proceeded far enough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Nash, how long have you been an officer? - Seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been searching her, and could not find out where the money was? - I did not search her.</p>
               <p>Q. The prosecutor gave the intelligence where to find it? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You searched her in consequence, and three guineas were found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you searched her with all the delicacy you have stated, and a woman afterwards, you did not find any thing but these three guineas? - She was even searched as close as a woman in the world could be searched.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never spoke to the man first, he wanted me to go and drink a glass of wine, but I refused him. It was my husband's money that I had about me; he gave me five guineas; I had got a loin of lamb roasting and my husband was not come home to his time, and I was going to the Horns, in Whitechapel for him, and this gentleman met me, and would detain me, and pulled me about, and wanted me to be concerned with him in the street; At last he took and unbuttoned his breeches entirely, to lay with me by main force in the street; at last he said, when he found he could not have his revenge of me, that I had picked his pocket of four guineas.</p>
               <p>Nash. She said she had the money of her husband, in the watch-house; but I went to her husband, and he denied giving her the money.</p>
               <p>Court. When did she say it was her husband's money, before or after you found the three guineas? - It was after the money was found.</p>

               <p>I lost a pair of womens leather shoes, the 11th of June; I am of no mechanical profession; I lost them on Tuesday when I went to dinner, the prisoner at the bar came in with a stick in her hand; I live in Cheese-court, Mary-le-bone; the stick was about the length of a boy's foot, and asked if I had a pair of boys shoes that answered to the size of that? I said, no; there were several shoes laying in the window, I had bought some to sell again, and several pair of them womens; she went away again; then after dinner I went out on business, there was an old woman that I have for an house-keeper, I left her behind with four children which I have; and this old woman, the prisoner, returned when I was gone; when I returned home again this woman was in custody in my little parlour, with some neighbours; I see a pair of my shoes in the possession of a neighbour,

               <p>I am a smith. I have got a pair of womens shoes. On the 11th of this month I was called out by a woman, and they told me that a woman had stole a pair of shoes of Mr. Cooling; I followed the woman to the top of the court where he lives, Cheese-court, and I saw the woman lay down something on the steps of Mr. Scotland's door, a vine vaults there, I was about the length of this court off, a woman followed the prisoner likewise; when I came up I saw the woman pick up the shoes at the place where the other put them down, the other woman is not here, I see her pick them up, and the woman she delivered up the shoes to me, and desired me to take care of them I brought them, and have kept them ever since. I brought the woman, the prisoner, back again to Mr. Cooling's house; and when he came home I shewed him the shoes, in the presence of the prisoner; and he said they were his shoes; and she told me that she would wish to speak to the man that belonged to the house, because she had spoke to him before. (The shoes produced.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that gentleman when he came to me in the middle of the street, and when he said stop that woman, he and another naked man with him, whether he saw me have the shoes? - I did not see the shoes in her hand, but I saw her lay something down, and when I came up I saw that they were the shoes, and I saw another woman pick them up. (The shoes deposed to by Cooling, by the mark which he made himself on them a fortnight before.)</p>
               <p>Court to Cooling. Were these shoes in the room when the woman came in and asked you for a pair of boys shoes? - They were; they laid in the shop window; they were womens shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down the street by the butchers market, Oxford-road, this man and another little naked shoemaker, followed me, and said, stop that woman; and they stopped me, and I said what have I done? they said, you have stole them shoes; I said I had not a farthing in my pocket; says he, you are a liar; says he, you put them shoes down; says I, I have not, I know nothing about them; says he, where do you live? I told him. Then he took me to that gentleman's house, and when that gentleman came in they took me to Marlborough-street, and there they kept me. I never saw them shoes if it was the last word I was to speak.</p>

I lost three shifts from a lodging house, I brought them home on the 3d of June; on the 4th of June I went out to work, and when I came home, I laid me down on the side of my bed; the prisoner was distressed, had no home nor habitation; I thought she would be an assistant to me, to help my little girl to take care of the children. When I awoke in the morning I missed her out of the room, on the 5th of June I awaked myself, about nine o'clock in the morning. I go out to work, I found her in the necessary, and she had a quartern of butter in her apron; she came in and sat down, and had her breakfast with me; it missed with rain, I said to her, I think I will go and buy me an handkerchief; but it rained, I did not; I heard her say to my little girl, if you don't go for some coals, I will lick you;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260064"/>in the mean while I laid down again, and she took three shifts and three shillings and six-pence out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get out of bed? - Yes, I got up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you lay down again? - I believe about half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your pocket? - Inside of the bed with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you asleep when she took out the pocket? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And there was three shillings and six-pence in? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her take it, nor awake till she got out of the room? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you awake again? - About one o'clock; and she was gone, and three shifts, and three shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else access to the room? - Nobody but a child of three years old; he was paddling about the room, and was in the room when I awoke; I found two shifts on the same day, the 5th of June, I found her in Lukener's-lane, and at No. 5, she had got both these shifts on. one on the top of the other. I never found the third nor the money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He has false swore what he has said, this young man has taken up another girl and has had two hearings. - I took the other girl up first to tell where this girl was, because I supposed that she went down and told this girl which pocket the money was in.</p>
               <p>Court. What business are you? - I am a butcher.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This girl said that she thought I was the person; on that I was taken up the last Sunday night, when I came up on Wednesday before the justice, they asked the woman whether I was the person? she said she never saw me in her life time, she took her oath so to the justice; he knows nothing of me no more than what he goes by hearing; I never saw the man in my life time till I saw him last Monday. I am a misfortunate woman.</p>

The tiles were taken off the top of the house, the rafters broke; he had gone into the house, and had taken a copper from the house, he had put a flour bag into the copper, which I had received from my cousin who serves me with flour, and I was not taken away. The tiles were off and the rafters broke.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260068"/>Q. How long had it been in that condition? - The landlord had mended it but two days before; I know it was whole when I went to bed; the tiling had been fresh pointed two days before. These tiles were taken off and the rafters broke after I went to bed; there were five tiles taken off, there was a hole large enough for a large man to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing besides? - Nothing else. He carried the copper away on my neighbours premises.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that bag before? - On Saturday, my wife emptied the flour out of it. That flour bag was in my possession, it was in the house, it was not in the copper when he took the copper out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the copper stand? - It stood the further end of the kitchen, near the chimney, I had it fixed up about six or eight months ago, it was fixed by brick and mortar, it cost me twelve shillings the fixing of it, I had a bricklayer to do it. He wrenched it out, and he pulled it entirely out.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between one and two o'clock when you got up? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who bolted the door? - I bolted the door myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - My wife and child. There is another lady in the house, but she was in bed. I was not in bed till near one, as it was Saturday night, and we do not leave business till twelve Saturday night.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find these things when you got up? - I found it in my neighbour's yard, the sack and copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the man or any body else? - I did not see the man till I see the watchman bring him in, which was as soon as I got down almost, the neighbours opened their door, and I went in and the watchman brought him in, he said he caught him on the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - I did not he was a stranger to me, my wife saw him on Saturday afternoon.</p>

               <p>I live near the last witness. On Sunday morning between one and two, my mother was up, and she came to me and told me there was somebody in the yard, accordingly I went to the window and did not see any thing, and was going back again, but turning back again I see my next door neighbour's door open; Mr. Shortman's. I directly hallooed out Shortman, watchman, thieves. The watchman being in the other street heard a noise, he came running down the street, my father being at the front window, shewed him the way behind, when I found the watchman was coming I saw the prisoner at the bar come out of Mr. Shortman's; it was light enough to see any body.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him come out of Shortman's? - On the first alarm I made to Mr. Shortman. Shortman, thieves! I observed the door was open; this was before he came out; the pales are low which parts the two yards, and I see him get over the pales out of Shortman's into my father's yard We have tools that are called a spokeshea and a mallet; when I see him getting over the pales I flung a spokeshea at him, he then attempted to get up a pig sty. There is a pig sty in the yard to get on, to get on to the wall by that, I then flung out a mallet; I was above stairs all this while at the window, and flung it at him, the man then fell from the wall into our yard again, my father went down finding the watchman was gone round to assist him, and I went down to assist my father and did not see him in the yard, but immediately as I got down I heard the watchman say, I have got him; he said he had got him getting over the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see him come out had he, or had he not any thing with him? - I did not see him with any thing at all</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260069"/>Q. Did you see afterwards the copper and the flour bag? - I did, they were in our yard, just by our gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them before you came down stairs, or not till after? - Not till after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in such a part of the the yard that you could have seen him from the window? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - No, never saw the man before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very much in liquor. - He rather seemed to be in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did or did you not observe that the man that came out of the house had the appearance of being in liquor or sober? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think he had the appearance of being in liquor when you see him? what distance is Mr. Shortman's door from your window? - Not far, I saw his face plump, for when I flung the spokeshea he turned round and looked at me; I could not be so positive to his countenance as to his dress, size and appearance altogether. I do think it is the same and am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it, or did it not, appear to have been locked? - It was double locked. I asked him what he wanted there? I collared him by his coat; he said he wanted one Mrs. Lewis, a mantua maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any such a person living in your neighbourhood? - Not that I know of, and I was born where I live now. He turned about then, and instantly my mother came running, and we both laid hold of him, and insisted to know what he wanted, we told him we would detain him till we knew what Mrs. De Knight had lost; and while we were holding him somebody fetched a constable, and the constable came and searched him, and found three keys on him, one looks very suspicious, it is here, a pick-lock key, or a patent key. I am a carpenter; I know something about keys. We found nothing else but a few shillings. The other man that was along with him stood about six feet from him, in the arch way, as I suppose to see what he brought out; I had seen them both together before in the arch way, the arch way is about two yards from the door at the beginning. As soon as I catched hold of the one he walked on, and while we were in the room, and the constable was searching the prisoner, we heard that he was looking in at the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he catched me in the house; I was knocking at the door. - As soon as ever I catched him in the room he instantly attempted to knock at the door with his knuckles, and said halloo; but I found him inside of the door; he got back from me as soon as I collared him, but my mother instantly came up, when I asked him what he wanted? he said one Mrs. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite clear that he was inside of the door at the time you took hold of him? - I am.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was you walking with them in the Park before you went to take a pot of beer? - Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in with them or did they follow you? - They followed me in as a part of my company; I told them I would give them a pot of beer; with that I took the beer, and there was a soldier came in, sat down in the same seat, and said that it was very severe work, he was at exercise, and he called for a pint of beer; we drank the pot of beer, and when the pot of beer was out the woman went away, and left me there; then the soldier began chattering with me, and I told the soldier I would treat him with a pint of beer; I did so, and before that pint of beer was out these two women returned; then they told me I was not safe to be in the company of a soldier, accordingly I told them I never was afraid to sit in a soldier's company. When the pint of beer was out I got up to go home, and they came out along with me, and walked along with me, the two women and the soldier, into Hyde Park; we all four went into Hyde Park, it was my way home, I thought to part with them to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260072"/>home, and this woman here attacked me for my watch; on which I was struggleing for my watch, she got it out of my hand by giving me a blow on the back of my head, and knocked me down after a long struggle, on which there was a man came up to my assistance, and asked me if I had been robbed? I told him I had; says he, had you a watch? I told him I had; says he, have you got it now? no, says I, I have not. She made off when she had got the watch, and left me on the ground, and she was taken in the gravel pits, and the watch, by the man, and brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other woman and soldier? - They got away while the man was pursuing after this woman, they were not taken; they were both present.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - I am a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - No more than one pint of beer just after my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you perfectly sober when you was treating these women? - I was pretty sober, very sensible of what I was doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite sober? - I was, I did not take any thing to make me otherwise.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no acquaintance with them before? - Never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any acquaintance with the soldier? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the Park was it that you wanted to go away from them? - I am not very well acquainted with the place.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about nine o'clock at night? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wish them good night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Or did you shew an inclination to leave them? - I wished them a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other offer to meddle with you? - Not that I can tell, because I was so stunned by the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she lay hold of your watch? - She laid hold of the chain; I had the watch in my hand; she had got the watch out of my pocket, and she was behind me struggling with me at the time, and the other was the woman attacking me.</p>
               <p>Q. Just now you swore that the man and the other woman did not meddle with you at all. How happened you to swear that positively? - The man did not to my knowledge, I can safely say that; but I think the other woman was attacking me as well as this woman.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know how this woman could have hold of your watch, and which was in your hand, and yet she got behind you, and knocked you down, she and you had never been any where together? - No, I never meant to give her any more than a pot of beer. I am a married man, and have a wife and children; I only went and treated them with a pot of beer, and no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see how the man came down, whether he was knocked down or pushed down? - He was down when I first saw him. I pursued the woman, and then I brought the woman back to him; he then said he had been robbed of his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us whether he was drunk or sober? - He appeared to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260073"/>been drinking, but he was sensible; I believe he might be in liquor. (The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I and another girl was coming across the Park, we met this gentleman, and he asked us to go and have a pot or two of beer; we went and partook of two pots of beer, and when we came back again it was about half past nine; we were drinking along with three soldiers, we sat down and drank with him a little, and we all came out together, and going along the Park he pulled the watch out of his pocket, for the soldier to see what it was o'clock, and when we came down to the Serpentine River he told the other girl he would give her and I a shilling a piece, and he put down his watch, and I took it up, and took it to one of the Gravel Pits.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of June last I lost a dining table, a three feet best mahogany dining table; it was at half past eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had it been before you missed it? - Outside of the street door. I am a cabinet maker and upholsterer; my servant set it up about seven o'clock in the morning; I had seen it ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before it was lost. At about half past eight in the morning, my family and I were sitting in a back parlour at breakfast, my next door neighbour, who is a baker, Mr. Giles, came running in, says he, Mr. Clarke, I am afraid you have lost a dining table, because there is a fellow turned my corner with a table, and I am sure it is not his own, and I really think it is one of your's; I immediately jumped up and ran to the corner, and a thought struck me, if he was a thief he had taken the court, I took the court which is only two doors up, and ran the length of that court, it is called Nottingham-court, when I got up there I looked each way in Bedford-street, and I saw him with the table, going towards St. Giles's, immediately as I set my eyes on him he turned the corner to a bye way; I followed close up to him, but instead of him turning the common passage, he went through several narrow passages, that I should not have supposed he could have got through with the table; I thought I would not attack him there, because there was no assistance; I knew he must come into Holborn soon, and then I stopped him; the prisoner is the man, I am quite certain.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Never see him to my knowledge; I have no doubt about him. When I stopped him I went before him, and told him to put that he had down; he said he should not; I told him I would make him; he said what do you mean by that. He then put it down, and flew from me down the passage; I ran down the passage after him, and laid hold of him, and I told him, it is in vain for you to attempt to go, for I will hang by you as long as I live; accordingly I brought him out of the passage, he attempted to go again from me, he came and stood then on the pavement, by that time my youngest son had come up to my assistance; I bid him ran for my neighbour

               <p>The prisoner at the bar was brought to the watch-house, seemingly very much in liquor, about half after four on Thursday morning, it was when the Wednesday night was over; the man has made mistake as to the day; there was nothing brought with him but this tinder box; he was brought into the watch-house assisted by two or three watchmen, there was nothing against him at that time; he remained in the watch-house till about four o'clock, our watch was very near coming in then; we told him to withdraw, we thought he might be tolerably sober by that time; I went out to see after the watchmen whether they were doing their duty, and I met the prisoner coming up Bedford-row with the saddle on his back, I went up to him, and I said to him, my friend what do you do with that saddle on your back? how came you by it? says he, what is that to you? I said, it is to me; says I, how did you come by it? says he, you may take the saddle; says I, I shall take the saddle and you too; with that I took him to the watch-house, both him and saddle, and I sent to Mrs. Steele's yard, who keeps a livery stable the top of Bedford-row, and the last witness came and said it was the property of Mrs. Steele; he came much about five o'clock. I have had it in my possession ever since. The hostler brought it here this morning; I gave it him this morning, but I kept it till then. (The saddle produced and deposed to by Hind.)</p>
               <p>Hind. I know it is Mrs. Steele's property; I know it by the button of the saddle, it is a very broad large button; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260075"/>have had it about a year and half; I am quite sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went back did you find such a saddle was missing before you was sent for? - I found this saddle was missing before I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. What is you mistress's christian name? - Mary. It was taken out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the yard or any part broke? - It was open that time of the morning; there were carriages come in just before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The thing was, I was very much tipsey that night; I saw that saddle lay down by the wall, and I took it up, and I did intend to carry it to the watch-house, but before that, this man met me, and I thought as he had took care of me he might take care of the saddle. As to that thing the tinder box, he need not have brought it, that I had for the convenience of getting a light.</p>
               <p>Court to Spriggs. Was he drunk when you met him? - He was very much drunk at half past twelve, but he was sober then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account but what you have mentioned? - No, he told me I might take the saddle; I told him I should take the saddle and him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was. After that I passed him, and went about two, or three hundred yards or four hundred, I cannot exactly say the distance; but as I was coming along the prisoner at the bar was coming towards me, and I was intimidated at seeing him come towards me, but I recollected that the watchman behind me was so near, and he was on his duty, that I passed him with confidence; the prisoner past me, and he had just past me about a yard, he then turned about, and put a pistol to my breast, and said your watch and money directly, and made use of no bad expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he hold this pistol? - He turned it on me.</p>
               <p>Q. In which hand did he hold this pistol? - The right. On which knowing the watchman was just behind, and it may be thinking he was rather nearer me than he was, I sprung back from him, and ran to the watchman, crying out thieves! thieves! watch! watch! I lost sight of him then, he ran away; I saw him about an hour after in the second field, in the New Road; I was over in the field to search for him, and four or five more of Mr. Wright's officers with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this happen to you? - Near one o'clock on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find him? - Two or three of these people brought him up to me; I had been hunting for him along with other people for half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260076"/>Q. Did you know him again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drest in the same way as he was before? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as to seeing this man at the time he attacked you in this way, was it moon light, or what sort of light was it? - It was between light and dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamp there? - No, It was so light it did not need a lamp.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of hat had he on? - I think a cocked hat, but I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of clothes? what colour? - Black, the same as he has on now. The barrel of the pistol struck my eyes, as being bright, it was not an iron one.</p>
               <p>Q. As to his hair, how was his hair? - I have no doubt of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an honest man and ought to be cautious how you swear. Do you mean coolly and deliberately to say, that he was the man? - I am sorry to say that, I am obliged so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you took him again? - I believe he might say I am not the man, or was it me? or words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to that? - I said he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time I was taken how far was it from where was apprehended and detained by the officers, from the place where he was attempted to be robbed? - I was robbed in the road, and where he was taken by the officers I cannot tell; the officers brought him to me, the second field distant from where I was robbed, not half a quarter of a mile, or a tenth part distant. The man behaved exceeding well, he made use of no bad expressions.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any man with him at the time? - I did not see any man with him; I saw a man just before him; he ran across the field, and I followed him, I ran as soon as I was spoke to by Mr. Hurnall; I followed him over two fields, then I lost sight of him among some cows; as near as I can possibly tell in the night, he was dressed in black clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you say that was the same man that you had followed? - The runners brought him to me before that about a quarter of an hour after I lost sight of him, they brought him along side of my watch box in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the man that you saw before with the prosecutor? - I could not swear to the man, only he had the same clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor come up at the time he was in the hands of the runners? - He came up with some of the runners.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Hurnall say? - He said he was the man that put the pistol up to his breast; the man cursed and swore all the way down to the watch-house, he said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him did he know my person? - To the best of my remembrance by the clothes, the size, and the make of the person, you are the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to me? - I cannot swear to you, because I did not see your face.</p>

               <p>I am a mason; I am none of the runners; I live near the spot, and I happened to be up at that time in the morning; I heard the cry of murder! murder! and the prisoner at the bar ran across the fields, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Mr. Hurnall and the prisoner to you when he cried out thieves? - Between two and three hundred yards as near as I can guess; the prisoner was about the same distance running from him in the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed? - I really cannot tell at that time of night; he had dark clothes on; that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - I pursued him till he got into that field among the cows, and there I lost sight of him, and the patroles took him coming back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him with the patroles? - In the space of twenty minutes, or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face at all? - Not until he was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he is the same man? - I cannot say, I was not near him till he was brought to me; I see a man, but whether that is the man I cannot say, I believe him to be the same man, being nearly about the size and dress.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patroles; I belong to Bow-street. About one o'clock on Tuesday morning, the 25th, being at the Duke of Bolton's Head, we heard the cry of stop thief! we turned to the fields back again, and saw a man running; I pursued after him; he got over the rails into the Duke of Bedford's private road; I never lost sight of him; the prisoner is the man, and he was taken; when we had taken him, we took him back towards where the alarm came from; he said he came out of a house, in which house he had been drinking with another; we asked him if he would shew us the house? we carried him to the second field from where I took him from, and there we found Mr. Hurnall, and Mr. Shallard, and some more, hunting all about the ditches to see to find the man; the instant Mr. Hurnall see him, he said that is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At what distanace was it from where the gentleman was robbed you took me? - About nine hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I met him I was turning out of the path into the road, and this man fell down. - I jumped over the rail after the man, and I fell down by accident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could wish you to call the other witnesses in, the gentleman in the blue coat.</p>

               <p>I am a Patrole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Hurnall robbed? - I did not; I heard the alarm, I saw the prisoner run, and I pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him? - Not till after I saw him run; the prisoner was nearly at the Duke of Bolton's, where he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the time you stopped me on the road, was not that last gentleman drunk? - You two fell together when I came up to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I stop to see him picked up? - You two were very close.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other man on the ground? - I don't know that I see him on the ground at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260078"/>Prisoner. How far distant was this from the place where the gentleman was robbed? - About half a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other has said nine hundred yards, which is three quarters of a mile, upon my soul it is unaccountable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was passing along the road; I had been drinking; they took me into custody, and they detained me, asked me where I was going? and where I had been? and were taking me to a place where I had been in, and passing along we were met with this prosecutor of mine, and he said, that I was the man that robbed him: I declare my innocence; I know nothing about it. I have no witnesses, I was brought up to trial so suddenly I have none at present; had it been a future day I might have got some.</p>
