When down, I came to his collar and he snapped a pistol, then they had another tustle upon the ground, and he said he would surrender.

               <p>What do you know of this? - Upon the 27th of October, I saw the prisoner at the bar pass the carriage and ordered it to stop. My master gave him his purse. He asked if he had any regard for his purse. My master said he had, he gave him the purse back. In the mean time I leaped behind him on the horse. He fell to the ground.

               <p>I leave it entirely to the lenity of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050004"/> court. I have no council. I entirely leave it to the lenity of the court.</p>

               <p>Court. If you are satisfied from the evidence in point of law, though Mr. Down did not lose his purse nor his money, as you hear by the evidence, the prisoner being taken by the servant before the robbery was compleated; yet he had in fact demanded his money; and from the impulse of that threat and demand Mr. Down had actually given him the money and purse; and after he had got it, he said, if you value your purse take it, and give me the money, he took it back. Therefore the possession of the money was changed from Mr. Down to the prisoner, if he had it but an instant in point of law, it amounts to a robbery.</p>

               <p>I was going to a place upon Saturday. I was in that woman's room; she told me to sell one of my mother's beds: I would not. I pawned all my things. I took her apron and pawned it, and she took me up for it.</p>
               <p>Court. To the prosecutrix. What value did you put upon them? - She said she did not know the value.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not only necessary the goods should be of the value of 5 s. and no person in the house; but absolutely requisite the house should be broke open, to make the person fall within the penalty of this act. There is no evidence of that, therefore it is less necessary to take notice of the value of the goods whatever they are, as the house was not broke open, they can't be capitally convicted.</p>

               <p>Was your house broke open last month and when? - The 22d of November. I have a wife and three children; no servant. I believe we went to bed about eleven o'clock at night; there are lodgers above stairs. I believe they were come in.</p>
               <p>Were the doors fast? - They were.</p>
               <p>Can the lodgers let themselves into the house after you had gone to bed, without calling you up? - They can't, because it bolts within side; we always bolt it when we go to bed. I have only a man and his wife lodgers that belong to me, they have lived in the house many years; they have others, I believe. I am the house-keeper only. I heard no noise in the night. I was up first in the morning; I got up as soon as it was light enough for me to see to work, about seven or eight o'clock. When I came down stairs out of the dining-room where I slept, and opened the back-room that goes into the parlour, I saw the window quite wide shoved up; I went first into the parlour, the window shutters and window were open. I did not see any violence.</p>
               <p>How is it fastened? - There are two sashes and a post between them, and there are two bolts come a cross and fasten into it; one window was shut down, the other quite open.</p>
               <p>If fastened, how can it be opened without any appearance of violence upon it? - I am not acquainted with that.</p>
               <p>What did you miss? - Two shirts, my wife's red cloak, a silk cloak, a scarlet cloth cloak belonging to my little boy just breeched, and one scarlet cloth cloak, my little girl's.</p>
               <p>Were there any other things of value in the room? - There was. I suppose they were frightned; my son and the lodger thought they heard some noise and called out. My two youngest children slept in the first floor back room; my wife and I in the front room; but my eldest boy about thirteen, slept in the shop, and another young man with him.</p>
               <p>Who was the other young man? - A man that lodged with me about a day or two before this affair happened; he slept with my son. I can't say positively whether he was in bed or no; the goods were found upon the prisoner: I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Did you see the marks of any foot there? - No.</p>
               <p>How came the shutters broke open? - With a knife, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did you see any mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the parlour door locked? - It was.</p>
               <p>Was the door between the shop and parlour locked? - No; very often left open to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050006"/> hear the better. The prisoner had lodged in the house.</p>

               <p>Was there any fastening? - No; there is no fastening.</p>
               <p>How were the outside shutters fastened? - Thrown back each way and bolted into a post, the window post was straight up between the two sashes.</p>
               <p>A bar comes across? - There is no bar, the two bolts come across.</p>

               <p>How soon did you come down after your husband? - He alarmed me and I came down immediately.</p>
               <p>Can you explain how the shutters that were fastened by the cross bolt within side was opened? - I cannot; I could see a step from the dirt of a man's foot in the chair. There was no appearance of force without side the shutters. I could see something of the trampling of feet without side the door as the dirt was soft. No dirt in the room.</p>
               <p>How did you know where the things were or who had got them? - His wife came and told me.</p>

That he had two shirts that were wet with him under his arm, and he stopped him. That he had a silk cloak in his pocket, and the red cloak and coat in his bosom.

               <p>(The Prosecutrix was asked, whether the shirts were wet, to which she answered, they were both hung up wet about an hour before they went to bed).</p>
               <p>(The Watchman was then asked if he said any more at that time, he said, the prisoner told the constable of the night, that he and his wife had quarrelled, and that he had run away from his wife, (as he was going to the round house) he confessed the robbery and wanted to go for a soldier.)</p>
               <p>Where did he say that? - Before the justice.</p>

             had known him the same time. That he had been out of his apprentriceship about a twelve month, behaved very well when an apprentice, and if acquitted would take him into his employment.</p>
               <p>Court. This is an indictment for a burglary, and stealing several things out of the house. The robbery being committed in the night time, upon the 22d of November, the man was stopped about four in the morning with the things upon him. If the back window was fastened and the sash down, he could come at these things no otherway but by getting in at the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050007"/>Supposing there had been no shutter, only a sash window and that was down, though not bolted, if he had lifted up the window and took the things out, it would be sufficient in law to constitute the crime of burglary.</p>
               <p>But to constitute the crime of burglary there is another thing necessary, it must be committed in the night. The time these things were found was about half after four in the morning, it is dark then in November.</p>

               <p>What day of the week was it? - On a Wednesday. My wife and maid fastened the windows after I was gone to bed. I got up first, a little before seven, when I came down stairs, I found the staircase window sash a little up, and I came to the parlour door and found that open, on the ground floor; and the yard door was open likewise backwards, that door goes only into the yard, there is no communication through that door into the street. There is a side door has a communication into the street, I found not locked but latched. There is a side door that goes to the black horse yard, but that don't belong to the back yard. I apprehend the person came in at the staircase window.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How high is that above the ground? - I fancy about thirteen foot, but it is only about three foot from the top of the wall leading to the black horse yard, the wall I take to be about nine or ten foot.</p>
               <p>Is the wall close adjoining? - It is upon a straight line from the window to the end of the house, about two feet and an half.</p>
               <p>Is the wall so near the window any man might easily reach it, so as to get to the sash? - Very easily.</p>
               <p>How high was the sash up? - About an inch and an half. Not high enough for a man to go out. The sash joins to the common staircase.</p>
               <p>Was the sash fastened by any means? - There is a screw pin sometimes it is fastened with, but whether it was or not fastened I cannot tell, I did not particularly mind.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050008"/> When I came into the parlour, I missed the glass first, the looking glass hung over the fire place in the parlour, in a mahogany frame; then I missed two great coats, one mine, and one my lodger Exell's, then the china, I missed a cheque window curtain, a china tea-pot with many cups and saucers, I did not count them, I don't know how many there were, from the corner cupboard, and a pair of steel snuffers very small ones. I had seen most of the things before I went to bed, there were the marks of feet upon two chairs.</p>
               <p>Were they obliged to get up in chairs to get to the cupboard? - No; but there were the marks of mens feet upon the chairs. Upon the table lay a poker and some parts of the beads of the window that were broke to pieces. I never saw them again till the things were in the constable's possession, one Wier.</p>
               <p>Mrs. DOE sworn.</p>
               <p>My maid and I went to bed last at night about one o'clock, it might be rather past. I fastened the doors, my maid was with me. I went up the public stair case where the sash was, with a candle in my hand going to bed.</p>
               <p>You did not mind the sash as you went up? - Yes; I found the sash was quite close; I had my hand upon it: it was quite fast.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell whether it was screwed or not? - No; I got up the next morning about nine.</p>

               <p>Was the looking-glass, the cheque window curtain, the two great coats, the china tea-pot, and cups and saucers gone? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I attend at justice Triquet's office in Hart-street, Bloomsbury; upon Thursday morning he was brought to our office by the constable of the night. I have a China tea-pot I took out of his pocket in the office, and a flint and steel, and some matches, upon searching him the second time, and a knife. I searched him in the office by order of the justice.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Doe. Is that your tea-pot? - It is my tea-pot; it will not hold water; it runs out; there is a crack in it. I put a paper of powder blue in it, and here is the powder in the pot.</p>
               <p>Whose custody has it been in ever since? - Mine.</p>
               <p>Was there powder-blue in it when taken?</p>
               <p>Mitchell. Yes, my lord; I found a paper with some powder blue in it.</p>

               <p>To Wier. I thought you said you took the great coat from him? - I did, my lord, he had another on; he had two great coats on. I looked upon this the most legible, and I left it to be advertised.</p>
               <p>Wier. He had both on when brought to the office; he had one upon his arm, and one upon his back, when brought to the round house.</p>

               <p>To Mrs. Doe. Your own character is called in question; had you any character with her? - No; there is a person worked with me recommended her to me, a person that lived in the city. She has lived with me two months, and behaved exceeding well.</p>
               <p>You never saw that soldier, nor any person come to her? - No.</p>
               <p>How near does she lay to you? - Up two-pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. After he was taken he told this story, and then told a different story?</p>
               <p>Court. Mrs. Doe says the fash was down and fast, the windows fastened, and sash down. The lifting up a latch, if a door is latched, is burglary, whoever lifts it up and enters. So it a window is down, if a man pulls up the sash it is sufficient in law to constitute the crime. With regard to the fact of stealing, the goods were found upon him, that is clear as to the felony.</p>

            , was, that about five weeks before, she went out a walking with my mother's maid, and returned between nine and ten in the evening, and found the prisoner sitting by a table, and soon after picked up a ruffle: some suspicions appearing, and upon my speaking to both together, and each separately, and desiring each if they could, to point out a bad person that had been in the house, or the house must be robbed by one of them: they both declared, and the prisoner in the most solemn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050011"/> manner, they did not. At last they all agreed to go to the public office in Bow-street; I put them into a hackney coach, and went immediately: Justice Gilbert, upon hearing the story, thought the prisoner's story so equivocal, the suspicion lay sufficiently against him to commit him. - I was present; a duplicate, I believe, was found in his pocket of a pair of ruffles. I went in person that night, that no time might be lost, to Mr. Hill's, pawnbroker, in Carnaby-street, Carnaby market, and asked if Mr. Knox had ever pawned any thing in his shop: he said a pair of knee-buckles: I asked if any other things, besides knee-buckles; he said, he has not pawned the lace ruffles or cambrick handkerchiefs, but a gold-headed cane at one time. I judged it to be mine; it was taken back from my house to the pawn broker's; he said he knew it perfectly well, which shewed the man dishonest; he continued in commitment. The next thing I did was to circulate hand-bills to all the pawn brokers in London; I wrote out a description of eight pair of ruffles, the number I lost was about fifteen; I had about 20 pair in all: I wrote out a description of eight, and said they must be in the name of Knox, or

               <p>When I went to look for some cambrick handkerchiefs in the drawers where I left them, I found none; and when I heard the story of the ruffles being lost, I looked to the places, the boxes were mostly full, when I came back I found they were gone. I brought the box to my master and told him he was robbed of his ruffles; when I sent the prisoner at the bar the coat to take away his livery, I was going to send him a coat, and in his press I found a bottle of wine, where this coat lay; it was his press to keep his cloaths; the bottle of wine had my master's seal on; he had no lock or key to it. The wine was in my care; I looked over the cellar to see what wine was missing, I missed fifteen bottles of various kinds of wine, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you ever leave the key of the cellar with him? - Never; I have left it in my pantry upon the nail; I don't know whether he knew whether it was there or not, I left no wine out, he could only get at it by the key.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The press that you found the wine in was open? - It was open.</p>
               <p>So that any body might inspect it? - Yes; it was in the open hall.</p>
               <p>Are you certain you never left any wine about out of the cellar? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Where were these handkerchiefs? - In my master's wardrobe, where his cloaths was.</p>
               <p>Were the drawers left locked or open? - They were locked; I left the key in my pantry.</p>
               <p>And were they locked when you came back again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050012"/>Court. The handkerchiefs you left in the wardrobe; can you tell us where those handkerchiefs were found? - Yes; they were found in a little chaise trunk in the hall, where his cloaths was kept.</p>
               <p>Did you see them found there? - I took them from where he kept his cloaths; it belonged to Mr. Rous.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner use to keep it locked? - Yes; there is a lock to it, but it was open; he did not return from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. The reason I apprehend them to be mine is this, I fancy they are made in the form of a cravat; in the corner of one was done in a figure 3 with blue silk, and over that very apparently there are the marks where the letters have been picked out.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the rest of your linen? It is impossible for a man to swear to linen.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Rous swore to one handkerchief in particular, comparing it with his own, which he pulled out of his pocket, with the mark of 3, and said it is made like a cravat; it seems rather the same size and shape.) I can't swear to the trunk; there is a corded muslin ruffle among the things found. I have none but corded muslin ruffles; there is another.</p>
               <p>Are those the things found upon the man? - They are the same things; they have never been out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The trunk was the property of your master, and the key in it when you took those things out? - The key was in it.</p>
               <p>And you are certain those are the things? Yes.</p>
               <p>(The pawn broker deposed, that he lived in Crown-street, Princes-street; produced the watch, said he had bought it of a man of the name of Malone, whom he knew extremely well, for seven guineas and a crown.)</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Rous. It is eight weeks ago last sunday, I went out to Knightsbridge about six in the evening, I returned between nine and ten, and found William at home, the prisoner at the bar, he let me in, there was no person there but him, there was a book before him, he leaned his arm upon the table, whether he was reading or no, I can't tell. I took off my cloak, he turned round to speak to me, what it was I don't know, he stooped to pick something up close by his chair, he said what is this, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050013"/> said I don't know, may be it may be one of my robins fell out of the drawer; he said no it is not, it is a ruffle of Malone's fell out of his pocket, for he has been here this evening. He said no more to me about it, nor I to him. I went up to the drawing room to shut the windows, from there I went to the door, I talked to a person that had the care of next door house, till a young woman came to sleep with me, it might be ten minutes, he came and let me in, William went to bed. I opened the door and picked up a ruffle in my master's bed room going up to the bed room, about an hour after he picked up the ruffle.</p>
               <p>Did you sleep in that room? - Yes, I did, I slept there. There was a young woman with me, I said ma'm is this your's, no not as I know of, said she. I laid it down upon the table in my master's bed room, and went to shut the window shutters. Upon shutting it she took the ruffle, and said, it is a gentleman's ruffle, she said very like one of Mr. Rous's. I said it can't be one of Mr. Rous's, he had been in mourning, she said she knowed the tacking of it in Russel-street, she was my master's valet's wife.</p>
               <p>Have you that ruffle? - I have; then I said to her, I will go and ask William whether or no he knows any thing about it. I went up stairs, she with me, and called William, he did not answer, he was in bed. I said, William, have you been in my master's bed room; he said, what should I do there; I said, I do not know what you should do there, but somebody has been there, for there is a gentleman's ruffle in it, he took the ruffle very carelessly and threw the ruffle down in a chair by him, I said he need not throw the ruffle away, for I would have the ruffle again, I picked it up and carried it down stairs, and left it till my master came home, which was five weeks.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the ruffle you picked up under the table below stairs? - I did not pick it up, he picked it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rous. I have had it ever since he was at Bow-street, that is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Malone there? - Yes; I saw him with him at the street door.</p>
               <p>Who is Malone? - I don't know; he appears like a very genteel sort of person. It was night, he laid there, when he came home with him it was a storm, William said, it was a very bad night to turn any body out, he came there, and staid from Saturday night till Sunday morning. I did not know it was Mr. Rous's ruffle, I had not been accustomed to go into his bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>But Malone has frequently been at your master's house? - Yes; and he has dined there several times.</p>
               <p>By your invitation? - No, he could not, he is not of my acquaintance; when he was there he slept with William in the garrat.</p>
               <p>Did you see him any part of the night, from the time he went to bed till he went home? - No.</p>
               <p>Many persons came to visit you; one Mrs. Wilmot or Miss Wilmot? - Yes; I never had any person staid with me after eleven o'clock.</p>

               <p>You was very intimate with the prisoner at one time; I am sure you was; and you entertained some resentment against him; did not you say you would certainly hang him? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing to that purpose? - Yes, I have, but it was not in my power.</p>
               <p>What did you say to that purpose? - The last time but one when I came to Bow-street, my master's man and his wife in a coach, the person that slept with me, William pleaded very innocent, and I said if he does not get his deserts now, he will by and bye. I should not be sorry to see him go by to be hanged.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to say, upon your oath, you did not entertain some suspicion of his neglect of you? - No; I never knowed he had any pretensions.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether she has not had men lay in the house frequently? - Mrs. Bolton's servant, who is here; I can be clear she has had my master's mother's servant in the house with her, and another man besides.</p>
               <p>Court. Will you wish to say any thing else? - I have nothing else to say.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>I lost a Turkey carpet, the prime cost 6 l. 3 s. we shut shop always at this time of year, at six in the evening; after we had shut up shop, we fastened the door our two selves; this was upon the thirteenth of November; we afterwards retired to a little back room to drink tea; we shut up shop about half after five, or rather sooner; we had double doors; we bolt up and down one of the doors, the other we lock, upon the single lock, and leave the key in it; we leave a candle burning upon the counter, in the middle of the shop. It rained hard a little after six; a coach coming by, the noise struck me as if the street door was open. I said to my partner, the street door must be open; this was a quarter before six; we looked just at the door; we did not go into the street; I saw a man had been in the house, and in the street, coming out of the shop with dirty feet; it rained very hard; I said, he has not been in for nothing; there were two Turkey carpets, one I missed; we shut the door, and locked it, and immediately after we heard a knock against the door, and my partner looking out, saw the thief going away with the carpet upon his left shoulder, and a hair broom in his hand; there was a knock upon the window; it was an unvoluntary knock, by the broom hitting against it; my partner coming out, cried stop thief; he dropt the carpet, I took care of that; my partner pursued him, and took him. I was not bye when he was taken, I staid in Long-acre to take care of the goods; he found him up Rose-street, and took him, he was never out of his sight, he brought him within a minute after.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the prisoner that you saw with the carpet on his shoulder, when he dropt it in the street? - I can't be sure, I took my partner's word for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You can say whether the door was fast or not, you spoke to the general custom of the shop? - I can't say, when we shut the doors we hang the key up behind it.</p>
               <p>There are other carpets that are hung up upon the outside of the door, by way of sign, I suppose? - Yes; those carpets we lost before.</p>
               <p>This man had a long hair broom in his hand, that had given the stroke against the shutters? - Yes, I suppose it so.</p>
               <p>When you saw him with this carpet upon his shoulder, and broom in his hand, he paraded in the middle of the street, was he drunk? - No, Sir; not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>I look upon it there is a cavity, the window projects, the man had not time to go a cross the street with a carpet? - This man hid himself.</p>
               <p>What would have been the value of the broom? - Not above six pence, but the value of the carpet is 6 l. 3 s.</p>
               <p>Mr. STIMSON sworn.</p>
               <p>You are partner with the last witness? - Yes; upon the thirteenth of November last, upon the dusk of the evening we shut up the shop, and fastened the doors, and then retired to the little room at the end of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050015"/> the shop to drink tea, thinking every thing secure before we drank the tea, we were alarmed by a noise of a coach going along the street, made us think the street door was open, we heard some person's foot went from and returned to the door again, I shut the door; Mr. Abbot said, there is something gone, there is a Turkey carpet lost; I looked round and said, there is a Turkey carpet gone, within the space of half a minute, or a quarter of a minute; we heard something tap against the shutters; I opened the door immediately, and saw the prisoner crossing the street with the carpet upon his shoulder, and a hair broom in his hand; I said, there is the thief with the Turkey carpet upon his back; I immediately pursued him; he throwed the carpet in the middle of the street, and run up Rose-street, when he came to the top of the street he ran into a coal shed, Mr. Mosely's coal-shed; there is a yard, and about the end of the yard I took him; I never lost sight of him from the first time I saw him with the carpet upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>You are sure that is the same man? - I am very sure it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of one Mrs. Spaightly? - There was a woman called, but I don't know her name.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming from Mr. Spranger's about six o'clock in the evening, the 13th of November; I saw something, I kicked it with my foot before I saw it, I then perceived it to be a hair broom; I perceived a piece of carpeting between two houses; I was rather in liquor; I took it upon my shoulder, I thought it might be of service, I thought it was a carpet that gentlemen put in their passages; I put it on my shoulders; a coach coming by, my foot slipped, I dropt it from my shoulder; two or three people followed me, and cried out stop thief. I ran down Rose-street, being rather alarmed; I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>To Stimson. Was the prisoner in liquor when you took him? - He seemed to be in liquor, he seemed to make it appear so at first.</p>
               <p>How do you mean make it appear so? - He could run as fast as I could, and from his appearance when examined.</p>
               <p>Mrs. STANHOPE sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in St. James's Market, No. II: I lived in Piccadilly thirty years.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner at the bar, before the 13th of November last? - Never in my life. I was going along Holborn; who he was I did not know; he was going along in Holborn all the way, he seemed to be in liquor; he saw something and kicked it with his foot, and took something up and put it upon his shoulders, and went into the highway; somebody called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>You was in Long Acre? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That young man was never out of your sight from the first time you observed him, for a considerable distance from the time you saw him take the carpet; do you know whether he did not go into the house of any body? - Sir, I did not see him go into a house any more than I do you go into a house: I came all the way along from Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>And whereabouts did you see this lad? - I saw him go before me, as near as I can guess, to where they turn down to go to the lying-in hospital, and I went all the way to Piccadilly.</p>

               <p>What sort? - It was a shagreen case, the watch was metal.</p>
               <p>Court. The inside was made of silver? - No, my Lord, metal.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is an indictment that will never do, because it is not the same offence. How they could have convicted her is extraordinary: the indictment is, that the inside case was silver, which is very different from an inside made of metal. This is for receiving stolen goods; the indictment says, a watch, the inside case made of silver, and the outside shagreen.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. The indictment says, one watch, the inside case made of silver, the outside shagreen: the witness says, one watch, with the inside case metal, and the outside shagreen.</p>
               <p>Court. It is put altogether 40 s. one watch with the inside case so much, and the outside so much.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. He certainly said silver, when the person was indicted who was convicted.</p>
               <p>Court. She ought not to have been convicted; the conviction is bad.</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. One of the witnesses says, that before the Justice he said it was a silver case.</p>

            , last sessions, was found guilty of stealing a watch; the inside case silver, the outside shagreen. It was a mistake; she could not be convicted of stealing a watch, the inside case made of silver, and the outside shagreen; the original conviction was wrong, and the person is now under punishment. You can't convict an accessary, when the conviction of the principal is not warranted in the fact; you must find her not guilty.</p>

             deposed to the same effect, but was positive as to that piece being there when he shewed the lawns to her, and the reason of not stopping her, was, they did not miss it before the prisoner was gone, the last time that she came there, three times in all, might be in the shop half an hour.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's defence was, she went there to buy a neckcloth for a postilion, her husband's fellow servant, that she did look at things and might be there half an hour in all, that she went and bought two bunches of turnips and left them there, and went to buy other things and then went back for her turnips; and why did not they take her then; instead of which they made her a bow, and asked her whether she would buy a gown of them? Said her witnesses had been there all day waiting, but were tired of staying so long, and were gone.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. Mr. Recorder, the gentlemen of the jury are of opinion, they would not give you the trouble to sum up the evidence, as they think there is nothing to affect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. I will state what the evidence is; you will draw the proper inferences from it. The prisoner was indicted for stealing ten yards of lawn, value 37 s. privately in the shop of BLANCHARD COWARD: the value being above five shillings, privately in the shop, makes it a capital offence.</p>

               <p>I found the goods upon the prisoner in his room, the waistcoat upon his back. - I lost the things upon Saturday last out of my room; I came home about two or three o'clock, and undrest myself, and left the waistcoat and breeches upon the table in the room; I left nobody in the room; the barber was in the room when I undrest myself, but went out before me, and I shut the door after me; the key was broke, I could not lock it; I came home again between twelve and one in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you miss the waistcoat and breeches then? - No; not till next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, when the prisoner called upon me in the room: I first missed them between eight and nine o'clock upon Sunday morning; when I missed them I was going to shew the prisoner the waistcoat, as it was a new one.</p>
               <p>What was you going to shew it him for? As it was a new waistcoat, and a new pattern, having been intimately acquainted with him the last two months past; it was a silk waistcoat: I could not find it, I looked in the trunk, I thought the chamber-maid might have put it in the trunk; then I missed my breeches; the chamber-maid could neither find the waistcoat nor the breeches. I asked her if she had put them any where. </p>
               <p>Where did you lodge? - At the <placeName id="t17811205-11-crimeloc60">Saracen's Head, Friday-street</placeName>

               <p>Did the prisoner lodge at the same house? No; at the Blossoms inn, Lawrence-lane: the chambermaid said she did not know any thing of them; the prisoner was present; then I immediately said they were stole: the prisoner made some remarks, that it was no more than a common thing; he had lost several things at the Blossom's inn. I told the chambermaid not to make herself uneasy, but speak about it, and say who had been in the room; I gave them up for lost. Upon the Monday morning I went to call upon the prisoner, about nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect; and I saw him sitting in the Coffee-room at the Blossoms-inn, with my waistcoat on, with several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050023"/> gentlemen of my acquaintance with him. After the first compliments were over, I asked him where he got that waistcoat? for it was very like that which I had lost, which was stole out of my room: he told me Mr. Stanton's taylor made it; I said the taylor, never could have made it on purpose for him, I was confident, as I saw ne'er another of the pattern in town, and the taylor, or some fellow or other had stole it from me, and sold it to him; he said it could be no such thing; he had made him not only that, but black stocking breeches, and that Mr. Stanton had got a waistcoat off the same piece; that he gave 2 l. 10 s. for the waistcoat, and 2 l. 5 s. for the breeches; I think that is as near the sum as I can recollect. I waited in the room till the gentlemen had done breakfast; I desired Mr. Findley to go up with me into his room, and I desired I might see the back of the waistcoat, and I observed it was pinned with black pins all the way down, to make it fit him. I immediately observed that, and said the taylor was a lubber, or the waistcoat was never made for him.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - I don't know what excuse he made to that; I insisted immediately upon seeing Stanton's taylor; I was positive it was mine, it was a great deal too long for him, and too large: he said he could not see the taylor at that time, he would call upon him another time; he said he was going to Chatham upon a party then; as I found he was, I insisted upon calling upon the taylor directly; I ran to the window to call for the waiter to go for him; he desired I would not: he says, then I tell it you as a secret, I bought it of a Jew, and I gave 2 l. 10 s. for it, which I told him was more than the original value, and when jews sold things, they generally sold them for less.</p>
               <p>That was more than the value? - Yes; I believe it was 2 l. 2 s. or 2 l. 5 s. I gave for it; I told him the man that had the waistcoat had my breeches and things; he said he did not know; he had seen him several times. Before I looked at the breeches, I threw some down upon the ground, and found mine, and I said I will take my oath these are my breeches, have them where you will.</p>
               <p>You found a pair of breeches that you believed to be your own? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they sattin? - They were what they call Florentine, I gave two or three pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular you know them by? - The first day I put them on, I struck them against a place and broke a little hole, one upon the knee and another upon the strap, both at the same time. It is very remarkable, which made me swear to it, there was a little ouze, it broke a stitch in the weaving.</p>
               <p>Did you see those marks upon those breeches you found? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were there any buckles? - There were a pair of stone knee buckles I gave a guinea or a guinea and a half for, I bought them of Mr. Manly of Chatham, there was a purse there but I had taken out the money.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the purse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt they were all your things? - I have not the least doubt they were mine.</p>
               <p>What did he say when you found those other things? - I was angry he did not tell me he had bought the breeches as well as the other things, he said he intended to surprize me. I told him it would be a very agreeable surprize, if he would tell me the person he bought them of. I asked him if he had bought the knee buckles or silk stockings of him, he had often bought silk stockings, he shewed me a pair he bought lately. I asked him if he knew where the Jew was, he said that he did not, that he owed him a guinea or some such thing, and he would come there again. I insisted upon his breaking off the engagement of going to Chatham, and go and see for the Jew, for he had told me his name was

I immediately told him he was both Jew and thief, and he was taken into custody that morning.</p>
               <p>What is he? - When I first was acquainted with him by accident, going to take him a place to go to Chatham, he dined at the ordinary with a gentleman acquainted with our ship, we agreed to spend the evening together; he told me he was an officer in the Irish horse.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Two months; after that he told me he had a commission in the forty-fourth regiment at Quebec, and one night he was intoxicated, and said, his name was not Findley but Carr, but went by that name, as he had killed a man in a duel in Ireland, and desired I would call him Findley.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Saracen's head Friday-street. I know the prisoner at the bar. I saw him there upon Saturday last as near as I can recollect, about eight o'clock in the evening, he enquired for Mr. Littlehales.</p>
               <p>What became of him? He asked if Littlehales was within; I told him he was not come in; he asked which was his number? I said nineteen in the corner; as the lamp was up, I saw him go up stairs. I can't say I saw him go into the room, neither did I see him come down again: about half an hour after that, as I was going to Honey-lane market, somebody touched me upon the shoulder, as I was crossing by Honey-lane market, and followed me to the other side of the way, and asked me if Mr. Littlehales was come in? I said, no; if he had any message, I would deliver it; he told me, Mr. Littlehales and another gentleman had agreed to go out in a phaeton in the morning; I said I should tell him; he came in the morning before he was up.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was Saturday night he asked for him? I am sure.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable; I received the thinge from the gentleman that gave me the charge. (He produces the things.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my waistcoat, and breeches likewise, there are the same marks I described; I have not the least doubt of the waistcoat and breeches; I have not found the buckles and purse; they were all together, the silk stockings and all. I can take my oath to laying them upon the table.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Upon the Friday evening, there was a broker, with a green bag, he told me he had a very handsome waistcoat to sell, and some small cloaths: I brought him to the inn; he had two pair of breeches, the one small, the other large, and two waistcoats; I agreed to give him two guineas and a half for the waistcoat and breeches, he was to come to me again for a guinea, he was to come and bring me another pair of small cloaths; I told him if he would leave them with me, he might enquire of the people of the house, he said there was not the least occasion. I had the waistcoat, it was too wide, he was to come and take it in on Monday; I wore the waistcoat all Sunday, and put it on again on Monday. I intended going to Mr. Littlehales, I had not the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050025"/> least notion of taking any thing from him. Upon Sunday morning, I asked the waiter if he was at home; he said he did not know whether he was or not; I saw the hairdresser; I asked if he was at home, he said yes; I asked what staircase, he said one pair of stairs along the gallery, they directed me to go up another flight of stairs which I had missed; I went up to Mr. Littlehales; I wanted to go away, the other gentleman was going out, I promised to go with him and have Mr. Littlehales with me; he then told me he had got a handsome waistcoat, he described it striped sattin, which made me think the things were never his. When Mr. Littlehales came to me on Monday morning, he asked to look at my waistcoat, I took it off, he said this must be my waistcoat, I said it was impossible, he looked at it again, and said it certainly is mine, and I will swear to it. I told him if it was his, I had purchased it of this Isaacs, the gentleman asked what I paid for the waistcoat; I said two guineas and a half, which the broker said was the price, I was to give him that and the breeches for two guineas and a half; he asked for the taylor belonging to the house, these gentlemen were present when Mr. Littlehales came in, I could not contradict myself before them. I went up stairs and told them who I had them of, we went to Loughborough-street to speak to the person, I knew the Jew; we went to Petticoat-lane, we did not tell the man what we wanted then, but Mr. Littlehales said he wanted to buy some silk stockings of him, he did not appear to be the right person, she said she would give us any information she could. I told Mr. Littlehales as the things must be your's I have no notion of keeping them, though I shall lose considerably by it, and you are welcome, as this man will come to me again, as he was to have a guinea more. I gave him the things again, and went with the other people to Chatham. This morning he came to me before I was up, and asked directly off hand, did you see that man? I said no; then says he, I believe you are the person. No, says I, I am not. Then he insisted upon my opening my boxes. I gave him the liberty to look over every thing I had in the room, and there was nothing of his.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to your character?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No; the people at the Inn must have seen the man going up stairs with me on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>He called no witnesses to his character, he said he had not sent for any, and he had none there.</p>

On the 27th of November, upon opening a box where I kept ruffles and other things, I found they were not there, this was sometime the latter end of last month. I desired to know where they were, what she had done with them. She told me they were in another box in another closet. I desired her to bring them to me, she did not.</p>
               <p>What reason did she assign? - That she did not know where they were, and she appeared confused. I asked if she had pawned them, she said she had.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to suspect her before? - At the time I had no suspicion. I asked her if she had pawned the ruffles. I told her if she had, she must have pawned other things, and I begged to know what they were, and where they were.</p>
               <p>What did she say to that? - She said she could give me no account, but if I would give her three weeks, she would find a friend to get out all the things. I understood it in that light; I cannot remember the words; I asked her who this friend was, what was her expression? - If I would give her three weeks she would find a friend to get out all the things; I then told her she had trifled with me, and I could not be trifled with any longer; I would send for Mr. Bingham, at whose house she lived, who recommended her.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Bingham? - He is a hosier in the Strand; when Mr. Bingham came I told him what had passed in the morning; he asked if I had any objection to his speaking to her alone; I said no; they went and spoke together, and after some little altercation, she delivered up the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Do you know the things? - If they are produced I shall know them.</p>

               <p>What reason had you to suppose she, Brown, had the duplicates? - From what her mistress told me.</p>

               <p>(The duplicates were produced, and shewn him.)</p>
               <p>Court. Are those the duplicates of the things? - I believe so; I did not tell them, I gave them to Miss Thistlethwayte, I did not go to the pawn-broker's, all I did was to receive them from the hands of Brown, and give them to Miss Thistlethwyte.</p>
               <p>You asked her how she came to pawn them? - I did; she said it was through necessity.</p>

Upon the Monday I came up myself to the public office in Bow-street. I first heard of my mare upon the 7th of November. I received a letter from the office, dated the 6th, that the mare was stopped at the Bull and Gate, Holborn. I came to town but not directly, they wrote me word in the letter, he was to be examined on the Monday morning. I came to town upon the Sunday the 11th of November, between ten and eleven. I went up to the Bull and Gate, and found the mare there.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You could not be mistaken as to your mare? - No.</p>

               <p>You have had her four years you say? - Yes; upon the Monday Townsend and another man were examined concerning the mare. I swore to my property.</p>

               <p>Did he ever offer to sell the mare or any thing of that sort? - The mare was put up at auction, to be sold at the repository of Mr. Hopkins, the Bull and Gate. I did not see the prisoner there at those times, the mare was not sold.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. In Bow-street the first night, he said he believed me not to be the man that left the mare.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say at the examination in Bow-street, you believed he the prisoner was not the man that left the mare? - I could not swear to him.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are servant at the Bull and Gate Inn? - Yes; I am the upper hostler, the other man is the under hostler. I was not at home when the mare was brought in. I saw her about eight o'clock at night upon the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>A bay mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner come after the mare? - Yes; I saw him upon the Monday and Tuesday. The mare was brought in on Saturday night. I saw him both Monday and Tuesday at our stable.</p>

               <p>What did he say, or come to your stable for? - He came to put the mare up for sale.</p>
               <p>How soon was the mare put up for sale? - Much about two o'clock on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>He gave orders to put the mare up for sale? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure the prisoner was the man? - That was the man.</p>
               <p>He gave you the order? - No; not to sell the mare, he went into the counting-house to the clerk.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear him give the order? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you did not hear him say any thing about the mare? - Not then.</p>
               <p>When then? - When he came again after the mare was put up on Tuesday, he said he should wish to sell her, or he must put her up to grass.</p>
               <p>How soon did he come after the Tuesday? - He came between that and the Saturday, he examined the swelled heel, he desired her to be worked about, he would have it put up again upon Saturday, and if not sold upon the Saturday, he would send it into the country.</p>
               <p>Had you asked him about the price? - Yes; I asked him if he chose to fix any price upon the mare, because sometimes a customer comes and buys them before the owner comes.</p>
               <p>What did he say to that? - He told me no; he had an acquaintance of his would come and bid for the mare on Saturday.</p>
               <p>This he said to you? - Yes; if the mare could not fetch the money he proposed having for it, his acquaintance would buy it in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050035"/>Was he there upon Saturday again, when the mare was put up? - No.</p>
               <p>The mare was sold upon the Saturday? - I believe not a person bought it in for him. I believe to one Smith, I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Was the mare taken away or put up to sale again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man again after this? - He came the Saturday night and ordered a bill to take the mare away, the prisoner came himself.</p>
               <p>Did he go by his own name? - No; he went by the name of Harris.</p>
               <p>Was the bill made out? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he pay? - No; he took the bill but not the mare, he did not pay the money. I believe upon Sunday, the next day, the mare was claimed, upon Sunday the 4th.</p>
               <p>You did not see him after the Saturday? - No; not till I saw him in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>That is the man that came three times to your house? - Yes; he gave me orders to have the bill made out.</p>
               <p>When was it Hedge came to town? - I am not certain; I believe the Sunday following as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>It was in the morning I believe upon the Sunday he came to town? - Yes; I saw him the day he came to town to the best of my knowledge. I believe it was Sunday he asked me to look at the mare.</p>
               <p>Did you shew him the mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that the mare which the prisoner used to come and look after, and which he examined the heel of; was that the mare that was desired to be put up to sale, by the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Hedge. That is the man that shewed you the mare? - This is the man that shewed me the mare.</p>
               <p>That mare he shewed you was your own mare? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To the hostler. And that is the mare he looked at the heel of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is the mare he ordered to be sold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(Prisoner desired a letter to be delivered to the judge).</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The witness says, the Saturday the mare was put up, he saw me upon the Monday. Upon the Saturday he says I called and had a bill. It was on Monday I meant to send down in the country.</p>
               <p>Court. You came again upon Saturday night, and ordered a bill to be made out in the name of Harris.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Upon Monday about ten o'clock I had the bill of the hostler, it was Monday or Tuesday when she was claimed.</p>
               <p>To the hostler. Was the bill made out before she was claimed or after? - Before; he came for the bill himself upon Saturday.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon Sunday the mare was claimed. You say the gentleman never came after the mare was claimed? - No.</p>

               <p>I belong to the office in Bow-street. Upon the 4th of November last, about nine o'clock at night, one Smith came to give information a mare was stolen from Colchester.</p>
               <p>Court. Smith was the man the mare was knocked down to, it is material he should be here; is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>That conversation with Smith occasioned your going to the Bull and Gate? - I went to see if there was such advertisement, I found it, and then went I to apprehend Townsend that night. It was on Sunday night about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>You took Townsend directly, where did you take him? - In Vine-street Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>How came you to go there? - Smith told us.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what he was charged with when he was taken? - He was told but I was not present. I went that night and stopped the mare. I saw

             this young man, I did not see the mare that night. The next morning I saw her. I took the advertisement out of the book and looked at the mare, she proved to be the same mare by the marks. Then Mr. Hedge was sent to at Colchester.</p>
               <p>To Johnson. I think you saw the mare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050036"/> at eight o'clock the night she was brought in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had she been rubbed down then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to come off a journey? - Yes; she was rode hard.</p>
               <p>Jury. Smith came to inform him where the mare was that was stole, and the man that stole her. I want to know from what circumstance he knew the man that stole her.</p>
               <p>Court. As Smith was not here I could not allow his evidence, that was the reason I stopped that evidence.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, I expected to have had my witnesses here, but my attorney being engaged in the morning with a trial, he had not time. My bill was found only yesterday. I had only notice to come up last night about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>You have no witnesses here? - I had them here in the sore part of the day.</p>
               <p>Are they witnesses to the character or fact? - To the fact, to the delivery of the mare to me.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - His name is Wilson, the person that was with me when the mare was delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. You may read the letter yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Wilson was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Court. You had the bill made out to one Harris, that is a letter to induce the jury to think, it was sent by Harris in order to sell. Harris lives but at Rumford, can you give any account of yourself in what way of life you are, does any body know you here?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that any body knows me in court. I am a cabinet-maker, I did work at Barnet sometime with Mr. Betty, and I have worked at your Lordship's house.</p>

               <p>Court. So far he says is true, there is an upholsterer of that name at Barnet, whom I have employed.</p>
               <p>The upper hostler said, the mare was booked in the name of Harris.</p>

               <p>Did it appear doubtful who took the money? - She did not own she did the robbery, the justice asked who she said that woman there perhaps, the prisoner accused the other woman, and the other woman accused her.</p>
               <p>Was Todd there? - Yes; he said he was robbed by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>How came this other woman to be charged? - She had been drinking with them before, and she was in the room with them when they went up that night, she lodged in the house.</p>

               <p>That was the account Todd gave at the justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say they all went to bed together? - No; he did not say the market woman offered to go to bed at all, the market woman stopped the other.</p>
               <p>What became of the market woman when they went to bed, did he tell you that? - No.</p>
               <p>To Todd. How came you not to say any thing of this other woman being in the room with you? - She was up in the room, but she did not come to bed, the light went out, the market woman went down stairs, and in about two minutes this woman, that is here now, went down stairs, and had the money, the other woman took it from her; she brought it in her hand.</p>
               <p>You do not know who she took it from? - The prisoner, I suppose.</p>

               <p>Had you not hands to stop them, if you felt them? - They were snatched in a moment; she was half-way down stairs, and then stopped.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you felt them taken away? - I felt them go, and called watch.</p>
               <p>Now you say you felt them taken, before you said you missed them? - I felt them pulled away from underneath the pillow; snatched out underneath my head.</p>
               <p>The room was then dark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not follow the woman? - No; I was naked; I did not follow her down stairs.</p>

               <p>Did he say when the other woman left the room? - No; but I understood they had both been in the room.</p>

               <p>My husband's name is Thomas.</p>
               <p>What have you to say? - I let her the ready furnished lodging.</p>
               <p>When? - I don't know the day of the day of the month; she had been in them three weeks; I gave her some work to do a fortnight before; she had it, and did not return it, and I asked her what was become of it; she said she had pawned it; she is a mantua-maker; I went to seek further into the room, and the goods were gone. </p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else? - I lost most part of the property out of the room; an officer was fetched about this being pawned; he went up stairs, and found the things entirely gone out of the room where she lodged.</p>
               <p>What things? - There was a pair of blankets; the pawn-broker has returned them.</p>
               <p>What else? - One pair of sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not in this indictment?</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. There are two indictments.</p>
               <p>Court. Why were there two indictments drawn upon the precise same offence?</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. The offence was repeated upon two different days; the one on the third, the other the fourth.</p>
               <p>Court. Confine yourself to what is in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Witness. One window curtain.</p>
               <p>Any thing else? - One copper saucepan, one copper tea-kettle, and one flat iron.</p>
               <p>Do you know from your own knowledge all those things had been in her lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see those things? - I had not been in the room some time, before she was taken up and carried to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>When was she taken up? - The same night.</p>
               <p>You have not told us when it was.</p>
               <p>In this case you must fix the day, for there are two indictments upon separate days, the days become material. You can't fix the day? - No, the officer can.</p>
               <p>Were they found again? - Not till brought to the justice's the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Who were they brought by? - By the pawn-brokers.</p>
               <p>Were you present? - She gave an account where the things were, and what they laid for.</p>
               <p>Before she gave that account, was any thing said to induce her to confess, that it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050040"/> would be better for her? - It was mentioned, but she did not seem to take much notice of that.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing before that was mentioned? - No.</p>
               <p>All you know, except from her confession is, these things were missing from her lodgings? - Yes; she was not gone out of the house.</p>

               <p>You must specify the times? - I took in the saucepan the 3d. of October, and the kettle the 15th, the curtain and flat-iron another person took in.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the things you took in yourself? - The things are valued at 2 s. in the indictment that I took in.</p>
               <p>Are they of that value? - They are worth more than that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was of the prisoner you took those things? - Yes; I am very certain of it.</p>

               <p>Did you know her before? - Yes, she has frequently pledged them at our house.</p>
               <p>What did you lend upon them? - I lent 2 s. 3 d. upon them.</p>

               <p>I would have got all the things the next day. I had no work to do. I told her she should have all the things upon Saturday. As they took me up on Saturday night, I had not time to take them out of pawn, or I should have returned them to her.</p>

Upon Monday night I pulled them off. Upon Tuesday morning I missed them, and I challenged our boy that had been with us four days, the boy said he knew nothing of them, I gave them up for lost. A gentleman came to me from Covent-garden, and said they were advertised. Upon Thursday I saw the buckles, and I knew them to be mine, I saw them at the office in Litchfield-street. I don't know as I ever saw the prisoner about the house before, in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond, a constable, produces the buckles.</p>
               <p>How did you come by them? - This woman came to the shop of my next door neighbour. I keep a cloath's shop. I am by trade a taylor.</p>
               <p>When did she come to the shop? - Tuesday; the day after this lady lost them. I think it was the 30th of October.</p>
               <p>What is your next door neighbour? - She deals in womens cloaths, she called me to look at them, the prisoner offered those buckles to sell to that woman, I came and looked at them, and she asked my opinion, I said my opinion is, they are stolen, I would not have you buy them, you will get yourself in trouble; I dare say she has not come honestly by them, I dare say they cost thirty shillings; the woman flew at me and collared me, which gave me reason to think her a bad woman. I sent for a constable, we took her to Litchfield-street, and had her examined.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the woman? - I do think it is. I am very certain. The justice advertised them immediately after he had committed her.</p>

               <p>How many? - Eleven.</p>
               <p>How long had it been in the barn? - A week or better. It was taken away on the 31st of October.</p>
               <p>How long before that time did you see it? - I saw it the night before. I found it at Smith's the day following, the first day of September. I gave the key to Smith in the morning to go into the barn, he came back immediately and told me the wheat was gone. I went immediately to see how much was gone. I went to the barn to look, and I found gone five quarters, three bushels taken away in sacks, in a cart. I sent the men after it to seek it and follow the cart, as far as they could find any track of it. I was not along with it, they went to find it.</p>
               <p>Did you know any thing of this man before? - No; I cannot say I ever saw him before. I saw him turn from the gate belonging to the farm yard, the Wednesday before the robbery.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was fetched by Tavernor to Smith's house; when I came there (Tavernor went with me) upon the left hand there was a little wash house, and there was some sacks of wheat there, he said, that is my master's property; I said are you sure? Yes, says he, I know it by the sacks, and likewise by the corn; I said then, it is all very well; I went to Mrs. Smith's and asked if he was at home; she said no; I said my business is particular; he is abed, may be she said now; I waited some time, and desired Mr. Fullagar's servant to go round the house, and take care nobody should go away; presently one came, and said he saw a man looking out of window; I went up, and found this

I am positively certain I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand.</p>
               <p>You did not mistake, in the crowd, one man for another? - No; I never saw the prisoner at the bar before that day, nor since till now.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was not there many persons round you, when you lost this watch? - A great many close to me, rather pressed upon me; there was a great crowd observing the man in the pillory. I know it was him by his drawing it out of my fob.</p>
               <p>You felt some man without any certainty of knowing it was the prisoner? - I felt him drawing my watch out of my fob. I saw it was his hand.</p>
               <p>You are sure that is the man that had it? - Yes; he gave it to a man in a dark grey, or blue coat. There was a woman that stood by me; I happened to turn my head; the woman had her hand in my pocket; I asked what business she had to have her hand in my pocket; Sir, said she, I ask your pardon, I meant no offence; I felt her hand afterwards in my pocket, attempting to take a small book out; I reported her to the mob; they gave her a little abuse, and she went away; this was before I lost my watch; at that time the chain was hanging out; I put the chain in my breeches pocket, and buttoned my coat down to the last button. The prisoner at the bar was standing by me, and took it, as I imagine, by the chain several tugs; the first the seals came out of my pocket; the next tug the watch; I instantly took him.</p>

That something of a sudden made a great noise, and they went to the street door which they locked and bolted, what disturbed them he did not know; they came back and began at the currants in the same manner as before, and the same noise came against the shutters again, and he immediately then went to open the door to go out, he was frightened; that he (the prosecutor) immediately run and opened the sliding shutter door and took him within two doors of his own house, and brought him back; that his maid asked him to come in the afternoon again, as he was going out, I did not hear him make any answer; he rather wrestled with him a little, but some gentlemen coming by he desired their assistance, one of them went with him and the man into the shop, upon examining the prisoner, who had two or three coats on, every one of the pockets were filled with something or other of the provisions of the house.

               <p>Upon the 17th of August last, as I was coming over London-bridge I was accosted by a person whose name was Smith, he entered into a conversation with me, and asked me where I came from, I told him from Dartford, and he asked if I knew a Mr. Cook of Dartford, that he was a brother psalm finger of his, and he wanted some psalm books of the new version, and asked me if I would not carry that message to him, I told him I would; I said I would call upon him and tell him; he said if you will walk in here, that was the <placeName id="t17811205-25-crimeloc131">Swan, Fish-street-hill</placeName>

West then asked me if I had got any notes, I gave no answer; directly Simmonds came in, West asked if he would play any more, he rather refused playing at cards, and said he would toss up for money. West said you should give some chance. I pulled out my notes, thinking to change a small note, and thinking to get some part of my money back again; with that Mr. West gave me his assistance, there was a 10 l. two 20 l. and a 25 l. and West told Simmonds to make the bet good for that sum. West took the notes up and handed them over to Simmonds, and told him to make the bets good for that sum. I was very much confused at that, and told them I did not mean any thing of that kind; West asked Smith if he would be concerned, Smith had a note and West had another, I believe, I rather think they were not bank notes; it was handed over to the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050050"/> and I being much hurried and confused at that kind of behaviour; West asked me to cut the cards, I refused, and I threw them off the table upon the floor, with that West takes up the cards, and cut the cards, and there came up a court card. I then desired them to give me my notes, but West cried double or quit, and there came up another high card; he then cried double or quit again, and that instant the prisoner ran out of the room with the notes followed by Smith; with that West shoved some cards into my hand directly, and said, put them in your breeches or pockets, or any where, and he ran out of the room directly. I being much confused went into the courtyard where the public-house was, and I saw the waiter or landlord, and asked if he had seen any thing of the gentlemen that were in that room; he said no, he had seen nothing at all of them, nor knew nothing at all of them; then I ran into the street myself looking up and down, some person in the street asked me if I was looking after the three men that was in that house, I said yes; says he, they are just shot down Thames-street, running as hard as they can. I did not find them. That the amount of his notes were 75 l. That he afterwards met with Simmonds on Ludgate-hill, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Upon his Cross-Examination</p>
               <p>It came out that he was to have all above five, and the other all under five. That there was a secret in it, and the cards were made of different lengths, in order to defraud people of their property. And it appeared he had been tricked out of his notes by a gang of sharpers, upon a pretence of this Squire, as they called Smith, having money left him. That he had not told the master of the house of it that he had been robbed; that he was ashamed of having lost it as he had in that company. That he had seen Smith since, but did not offer to take him him up. He owned that he took twenty-eight guineas of them, Mr. Prothero and one Swift, said they would get him 50 l. upon condition he would give them 10 l. He owned he had been sharped out of his money, and told Prothero he had been tricked out of it. That he gave a receipt for 29 l. 8 s. that a person got for him; the receipt was August 8, 1781, received of

               <p>How many doors are there to the shop? - There are two doors.</p>
               <p>I want to know whether they might not get in by the doors being open? - The door had been opened during the day time, and is generally left upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Was the front door fastened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you imagine they got in? - We imagine they got in at the back door, because there is a spring lock and a key-hole.</p>
               <p>Was the back door fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many doors are there to the shop? - Two.</p>
               <p>A front door and a back door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was either of them broke open? - No.</p>
               <p>As you were there at five, did you examine whether both the doors were fast? - I did, I opened the front door myself, and let myself out. It was fast and bolted, and the servant maid came and shut me out.</p>
               <p>I want to know whether the back door was fast? - It was on a spring lock; it might be opened by a false key.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This house is the corner of Little St. Helens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One door opens into St. Helens, and the other into a gateway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the people were alarmed, you were at the back door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were alarmed by a knocking at the back door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And immediately made towards the front door? - Yes; the man with a candle in his hand first, and the other two afterwards.</p>
               <p>That was the shortest and most expeditious way? - They were pretty quick.</p>
               <p>The back door shuts with a spring lock, and you suppose that is the way they got in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050052"/>What weight might the bundle of linen be? - About half a hundred weight or more.</p>
               <p>And this man was taken just by the door way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was all done in a hurry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - That he was coming by, and somebody shoved him in.</p>
               <p>He said, he was an hospital patient, and very sick and ill, did not he say so? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>He has a complaint in his arm, which he shewed when the officer ordered him to strip himself; his arm is wasted, is it not? - It seems to be so.</p>
               <p>You found it to be so; did not you? - I never made any enquiry.</p>

               <p>Court to Jackson. Can you tell what is become of the pieces? - They were put in our warehouse till the trial came on; it has been in our warehouse ever since.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the seal, what was it? - I can't recollect what the seal was.</p>
               <p>Has it remained sealed ever since? - Just in the same manner as it was.</p>

               <p>When you first saw the three men, was the prisoner one of them? - I did not see any of them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. He has spoke to the prisoner looking in at the door, all he has spoke to is the man coming out.</p>
               <p>(The bundle produced in court.)</p>

               <p>To Jackson. Can you swear that the same seal is on it now as when it was delivered into the shop? - I can swear that.</p>
               <p>How can you say that, when you say you don't know what the seal was; the seal may be broke open, and another put upon it? - I saw two dim letters, I could not observe what they were.</p>

               <p>Are you sure they were the two prisoners?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050055"/> - I am very sure; I told them a great many people had no intention to buy, and it being late in the evening, I thought they only intended to put me to trouble; they told me if I sold them on an equal footing with other tradesmen, they would buy of me; I told them I had got them on an equal footing with other tradesmen, and I shewed them several pieces of silk handkerchiefs; the man with the white head (Smoulter) told the other if he would buy one, he would pay for him; I shewed them a great many things I had got, and he was on the same side of the bench I was; he then went out of the door. I then packed up my goods, and seemed a little confused; a soldier, whose name is Newton, said I had lost a piece of handkerchief; so he claps this Smoulter on the shoulder, and says this is the thief.</p>
               <p>After you had shewn them the goods, and they did not agree to buy, you packed them up again, and then you missed one piece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You appeared confused? - Yes; I was confused on having lost the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Did you find the piece again? - The constable found them in the course of the night.</p>

               <p>On saying you was true and worthy, what answer did they make? - They said the goods were within five yards of the house where they took them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect which of them said that? - Smoulter; he told me I might go and sell the handkerchiefs, and make the most of them, and bring them some gin.</p>
               <p>Was the other man by, did he hear this? - I handkuffed them both together.</p>
               <p>Was the other asleep? - They both talked to me about it.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - I left the cage, and came to the officer at the watch-house, and desired him to take a walk with me to such a place.</p>
               <p>Who was the officer? - Mr. Williams; we walked down by Mr. Messiter's brickwall, and just by a stone where they said they were, Williams picked them up.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the watch. About nine o'clock in the evening, a person came to my house, and told me that two men were stopped at the sign of the Iron Gate, for robbing Mr. Campbell; I went there, and saw these men in the house, detained by the people; I asked them for what? and Campbell said he had lost a piece of handkerchief.</p>
               <p>How many? - I can't tell; a soldier was there, and he said, if any man has robbed him, it is that man in the white coat, - Smoulter.</p>
               <p>You said some soldier told you? - Yes; he said if any body has robbed you, it must be the prisoner at the bar: he was immediately laid hold of, and he said, I'll give you half a crown if you'll let me go, and let any body else go with me, and you shall have the handkerchiefs again.</p>
               <p>Who said so? - Smoulter; I said you shall do no such thing; you have sent for an officer to do justice, and I shall not come here to compound felony. I charged them in the King's name, and they were taken to the cage.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - I don't know; they were sent to Bridewell, and brought back again on the 10th of November to be examined again. Justice Sherwood committed them.</p>
               <p>After this conversation had passed at the cage, you went where the prisoners had directed? - Yes; I went with a candle and lanthorn up by the brick wall, by Mr. Messiter's wall I saw something lying, I thought it was a brick-bat; I touched it with my bludgeon, and found it was the handkerchiefs. Here they are, (producing them) they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>To Campbell. Look at those handkerchiefs, are they your's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know them to be your's? - They are the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Will you swear them to be your's? - Yes; I do.</p>

When he found he could not deal with them, he packed up his goods; I asked him whether he had not lost any thing, and looking two or three times over his goods, he said he had; I asked him what it was, and he said, a piece of handkerchief.</p>
               <p>How many was there in number? - To the best of my knowledge there was three: I then said, that is the man that has took them.</p>

               <p>From Prisoner Sharp. You did not see me meddle with any handkerchiefs, any further than offering the gentleman two shillings for them? - You offered two shillings, and he could not take the money, and at the same time you came to ask charity in the house.</p>

               <p>I went to this house, and this man was there, which was the first time of my ever seeing Smoulter; one word began another, and we stopped to drink together; we staid there till about eight or nine, and then I was going home; this man came in, and we could not agree, and when he went out, the soldier swore I took the handkerchief, when I never saw the handkerchief in my life, nor any longer than just to offer him half a crown for it.</p>
               <p>SMOULTER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had been at work on board an Indiaman all day; and coming home across Execution-Dock, I happened to call at this house about nine o'clock; I saw a hawker there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050057"/> with stockings and handkerchiefs; and we were in the further part of the house drinking together; he asked us if we wanted to buy any handkerchiefs or stockings; this man answered, and said he would buy a handkerchief for his wife: he then pulled down his pack, to shew his goods, and whispered to me, and asked me if there was any Custom-house officers or Excisemen in the house; says I, I don't know, I am a stranger, I never was in the house before; he pulled out some handkerchiefs, and said they were India ones, and well worth the money he asked; I said they were not India ones, but Spitalfields handkerchiefs, just so; he asked five shillings and threepence a piece, and I told him I could buy as good in the shops for half the money.</p>

The prisoner happened to be in the passage, and he asked me if I could give him change for half a guinea; there was another with him: I told him, though he was a stranger to me, yet if I could oblige him I would: I put my hand in my pocket, and found silver enough to do it; he made a low bow, and said he was very much obliged to me, and that he would bring me three or four pounds worth of silver in return. The next day, they both came up to the bar, which is close to the passage, about twelve o'clock, and told me they had got a guinea's worth of silver for me, and they called for two glasses of brandy; I said I was very much obliged to them, and I pulled a guinea out of my purse to give them in the room of the silver; he makes answer, and says, it is a very good guinea, but I want a guinea of a particular date, and says, I'll be much obliged to you if you will let me look at some of them; I held out my hand, and he took out three or four, I can't be positive which; says he, they are all very good ones, but there is not one of that particular date I want; so he took one of them, and before I could get round from the bar to the tap-room, they were both gone, and I missed two guineas.</p>
               <p>You missed two instead of one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many had you altogether in your purse? - Eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had a guinea's worth of silver in the place of one guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When had you counted them? - About nine in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>This was about twelve? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you laid out no money between nine and then? - None out of the purse.</p>
               <p>How came it in the purse? - Because I wanted to make up a sum of money.</p>
               <p>Did you overtake the prisoner? - I went as far as Clare Market, but could see nothing of them, and was obliged to come back for other business.</p>
               <p>How many guineas had you after they went away? - I had six guineas, and a guinea's worth of silver.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see the prisoner afterwards? - The 3d of November at night, about six o'clock he came, and another man with him.</p>
               <p>This was near three months afterwards? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you never see him till then? - Never, to the best of my knowledge: I was not in the bar when they came; they called for two glasses of brandy, and wanted change as usual; my wife was in the bar, and she having sore eyes, and a handkerchief round her head, she called me to look at the guinea; I said it was a very good one, and observing some face I thought I had a knowledge of, I put the guinea in my pocket, I said it was a very good one, and goes round to get a candle; with that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050058"/> catches them both, one in each hand, by the collar, and called out for help, and before any body came to assist me, the prisoners made their escape together, and ran away; I cried out stop thief, and I believe the prisoner was taken somewhere about Hemlock Court.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you stopped on the 3d of November, was the same man that was with you in August? - I think I may be sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively that he is the same man? - I don't know that I could positively.</p>
               <p>Tell us whether you can or no; have you any doubt whether he is the same man or not? - I think he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Do you only think so, or are you sure of it? - I am positively sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>You have no doubt, have you? - No doubt in my conscience.</p>
               <p>How long was he with you at the time he brought you this change? - He was there just while he drank two glasses of brandy, and what time he thought proper to look at the guineas.</p>
               <p>How long might that be? - About ten minutes, or not quite so much.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure it is the same man? - I think I may be positively sure.</p>
               <p>But are you, or are you not, if you are say so? - I am sure it is the same man.</p>
               <p>When this man was with you, was the other man again with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>While this man was looking about the guineas, what did the other man do that was with him? - He desired him to come as fast as he could, for he was in a particular hurry about some business.</p>
               <p>Had he the guineas in his hand at all, or the other man? - No; not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Could he have had them without your knowledge? - No; I kept my eye upon them as well as I could.</p>
               <p>Did the other man take them out of your hand? - No; he never took them out of my hand at all.</p>
               <p>Could he have laid hold of them? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure this is the same man? - I am sure this is the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I think you said, in the first instance, you pulled out seven guineas out of your pocket, when you was going to give gold for this silver? - I did not say no such thing.</p>
               <p>Then you had eight guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why then that was the first time you contradicted yourself, and allowing for the country where you come from, you have told a good story indeed, and varied very considerably in it; you said, in the first instance, you pulled out seven, and that he wanted a guinea of a particular date, and then you said you had seven remaining in your hand, and that you missed a guinea after you had taken the silver in change for the gold? - I had eight guineas in all, and I missed two instead of one.</p>
               <p>Did the gold remain in your hand, or did it fall on the ground? - No; I took more care of it than that.</p>
               <p>You are sure none fell on the ground? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>In the course of your evidence you were going to say you thought something; I wished to have the sentence out, and know how you was certain whether this was the prisoner? - You will have no more from me than what I have given to my lord; I have been examined as much as any gentleman can, and I don't chuse to answer improper questions.</p>
               <p>Court. The court will prevent any improper questions being asked you.</p>
               <p>In one instance you say you think he is the same man, and in the next breath you say, you think he is not the man, is that the mode of giving evidence? - I swear positively he is the same, and I swear nothing but fair.</p>
               <p>Did you not say just now, that you thought you could swear he is the man? - Very right, and so he is the man.</p>
               <p>Just now you swore he was the man, and so he is the man, you are sure he is the man, and you are not sure he is the man? - He is the man I am sure.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry you did not think so just now; you should not have contradicted yourself, because the jury will not give credit to you, when it is left to them? - I don't want your information.</p>

I lent him two guineas on it, and gave him a duplicate in his own name.</p>

I went with it to Fleet-market, and Murray pawned it, and I gave him 25 s. of the money back again.</p>
               <p>To Bevan. Is it true that she gave you any of the money back again? - I never saw her from the time I lost it, to the time she was taken up in Black-horse-alley.</p>

               <p>How many had you? - Three.</p>
               <p>Where were they kept? - In the yard; they used to go into the orchard, and sometimes go over the river, into my neighbour's orchard; I sent about noon, to know if they had seen anything of them; I searched all about home, and came as far as Hounslow, to see if I could hear any thing of them at Hounslow market.</p>
               <p>Where did you find them? - I found them at Turnham Green on Thursday.</p>
               <p>When did you lose them? - On Wednesday night, or Thursday morning, I can't say which.</p>
               <p>Where did you find them at Turnham-Green? - I found two at Mr. Keeve's, and one at Mr. Grimsdale's.</p>
               <p>What are they? - Mr. Grimsdale is a baker; one of them was killed and hung up.</p>
               <p>You found two at Keeve's, the one dead and thd other alive? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they your pigs? - I could not swear to one, by reason it was scalded, and the hair off.</p>
               <p>Did you know the other pigs? - I could swear to the two living.</p>
               <p>How do you know them? - By the marks; one is a black and white, another black all over the loins, and a little bit out of its ear.</p>
               <p>In your observation of the marks, you are able to swear positively to those two? - I have got a man to swear as well as myself.</p>

               <p>What time of the day? - About twelve o'clock, as high as I can guess: I saw this man driving three pigs along the road; I staid there till he came up to me, and then I asked him if they were to be sold; he told me, yes; I asked him what he asked for the black one, he asked me a guinea for it; I told him I would give him eighteen shillings; he said he would not take that, but he would split the difference; I said I would not give him any more, whether I had it or no.</p>
               <p>Did you buy it? - Yes; then he said I should have it, and I put it into the stable, and went to the public house and paid him the money.</p>
               <p>Did you buy one or two? - Only the black one.</p>
               <p>Was the pig you bought the same as the last witness found to be his? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he got these pigs? - That he had bought them at Uxbridge fair, and sold all but these three the day before.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>How long was you bargaining for these pigs? - About ten or a dozen minutes; and after I paid him, he treated me with a pint of beer; I had another, and I believe we had three.</p>
               <p>You are sure this is the same man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he come to be taken up? - I took him up myself.</p>
               <p>How soon after? - About fifteen days after.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - He was coming by with a couple more pigs; I happened to be at the public house, and the ostler halloed out, here is a man coming again with two more pigs; I said I did not want no pigs: when the man came up to me, he asked me if I would buy a couple of pigs; I asked him what he asked, and he said 16 s. a piece; he went to the public house, and set himself down, and then I said to him, it is my opinion you was here about a fortnight or three weeks ago; yes, he said he was.</p>
               <p>Did you stop him? - Yes; I had him up to one Mr. Lambe at East Acton.</p>

               <p>Who bought it? - Grimsdale had bought one; I asked him if he would sell the boar pig alone, he said he would not sell it alone; I then told him I would give him thirty-four shillings for them both, he said he would not sell them at that price, but at last he agreed to take the money, and they were drove into my yard.</p>

There was a large pile of iron in the yard, I imagine about five or six ton of wrought iron generally together, at the bottom of this coal yard there was a large pair of gates to come in, and we had been laying in coals all day, and the marks of the wheels were very considerable. These bars were placed in the rut, and a woman (the wife of one of the workmen) coming in the evening to her husband, kicked her toe against the bar and had like to throw herself down; she gave information of it to me, and I went immediately to the place, and there I found one bar seven foot nine inches long, and another three foot eleven, they weighed thirty three pounds, and were three-fourths square; when the men left work we fixed ourselves on the outside of the gate, and in about three minutes the prisoner came and stooped to pick them up.</p>
               <p>You left them where you found them? - Yes; we left them to see who came to fetch them, and fixed ourselves opposite the gate, at the distance of about five or six yards across the road.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came what did you see him do? - He stooped down and took hold of the end of the bars, and I immediately ran and seized him with the bars in his hand.</p>
               <p>(The bars were produced in court.)</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He could not give any answer at all.</p>
               <p>The bars are both your master's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are there any marks upon them? - Yes; there are four little notches that I cut with a file at each end of them.</p>
               <p>Is that the mark you use? - That is the mark I marked them with, as they were lying in the rut before I catched the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You are sure they were your master's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before you cut these notches, they had no particular mark had they? - No; it is not usual to make marks, there is a stamp upon them to shew what sort of iron it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You say the wife of one of the workmen, who works for your master, hit her toe against these bars as they were lying in the rut that the wheels of the carts had made? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now who put them there? - I know nothing of that.</p>
               <p>Don't you think that any other person might have hit their toe against these bars as well as this man's wife? - Probably they might.</p>
               <p>If you had hit your toe against them, would not you have stooped to have seen what they were? - To be sure I should.</p>
               <p>And you would have picked them up? - I would have shoved them into the yard.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had returned them next day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050065"/> upon a supposition they were your master's property, would not they have been equally safe? - They might; but I seized him before he had taken them away.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he meant to steal them? - I should suppose so, else what was the reason of his putting them there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner lives in a house belonging to your master? - Yes; he does.</p>
               <p>Now did you never wish to have that house? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Are you quite clear in that? - I never asked the question in my life of any person living.</p>
               <p>There has been some little matter of disagreement between you and the prisoner I believe? - None at all; no further than his getting drunk and my shoving him out of the yard.</p>

               <p>When he came up did you see him stumble against the bar? - No; he stooped directly and took hold of it.</p>

               <p>Could you see distinctly? - I was not so far from him as I am from you.</p>

               <p>Was it moon-light? - No.</p>
               <p>How could you possibly tell whether he struck his foot against the bar or not? - I saw him stoop to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Did not he hit his foot against it? - I can't tell whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>If you had been in his place you would have stooped and taken it up? - I should have carried it where it belonged to.</p>

               <p>Relate the manner of it? - About seven in the evening, my wife and I were going in a coach towards the upper part of <placeName id="t17811205-33-crimeloc172">Grosvenor square</placeName>

               <p>You say as to appearance only, could you see whether he had a pistol or not? - He had something that appeared like a pistol in his hand, he appeared so, and demanded our money, or threatened to blow us to the devil, that was his expression. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050066"/> gave him a guinea, but he was not satisfied with that, and said he must have more; upon my telling him, I could give him no more, he required my watch, which after some hesitation I gave him. He then came to my wife and presented the pistol as I thought he had, and demanded her purse and watch; I was exceedingly alarmed for her, she was like to faint, so I begged she m ight give him what she had directly that we might get rid of him, which she did; and after that he went off, no more passed between us.</p>
               <p>He was not immediately taken then? - No.</p>
               <p>I see when you make use of the word pistol, you repeat the expression as you thought; do you mean by that there was not sufficient light for you to say with certainty, there was a pistol or not? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>It was from not distinctly seeing he had a pistol? - It was so.</p>
               <p>How soon after was he taken? - This was upon Saturday night, I was sent for upon Monday morning, my watch was stopped, and the pawn-broker with whom it was pawned, was at the office in Bow-street; they issued hand-bills, in consequence of which they were informed of it.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one man when the coach was stopped? - No, not as I know of; when I came there I found a man who appeared as a witness with my watch at the office; his name was Woods.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the watch Woods had was your's? - I am pretty sure it was; in consequence of something that passed upon the information of Wood, he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>This was in the evening, about seven; it was dark you might not see, so that you could not possibly distinguish the pistol, you could only judge from his expressions? - It might be a pistol or piece of wood, it was something appearing like a pistol, which I had no reason to doubt was a pistol.</p>
               <p>You know nothing more of it? - No.</p>

               <p>You are a pawn-broker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Princes-street, Soho; he wanted to borrow a guinea and a half upon it, I asked whose watch it was, he said it was his own; I asked him where he got it, he said it was his father's watch, his father left it to his brother, and each of them 30 l. and his brother made him a present of it.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

            ; I asked where he lived, he lived at Mr. Haye's, No. 18, Adam-street, in the Adelphi; I asked him how long he had lived there, he said near two years, but he had had this watch ever since he had been there. I then asked if any servants in the house knew of his having the watch, he said there was the butler and two or three of the servants, all knew it very well. I then proposed sending a man down to his master's house to inquire, he said he had no objection, he would go with the person I chose to send, or he would stay at our house till the person returned. I then asked him where he lived before he went to Mr. Haye's, he said he lived in Harley-street, Cavindish-square, with Mr. Fordyce the banker.</p>
               <p>Upon his giving me so clear an account, induced me to lend him the money he wanted upon it, supposing it might be his own.</p>
               <p>What did you lend him? - A guinea and a half. Upon Monday morning I received a hand bill from the public office in Bow-street, that this watch had been taken upon the highway on Saturday night, in consequence of which I gave immediate information to the office, with the particulars that passed upon Saturday night, and described his person; and in consequence of telling them he lived with Mr. Fordyce, which I believe led to the discovery.</p>

               <p>How long was the man that pledged the watch with you? - I suppose a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you take any particular notice of his face and person while with you? - I am perfectly sure that is the same man, I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050067"/> no doubt at all, my shop was light enough to distinguish him.</p>
               <p>Jury. What dress was he in? - The same he is in now.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. Wood, did you ever see the prisoner before that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to think it was nine o'clock when he came to your house? - I am pretty sure it was, I will not say to a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Is there no obscurity in your shop, places where people go in obscurity? - There is such places.</p>
               <p>Had you any suspicion upon your mind? I had. It is extremely usual for persons of the best characters and most fair dealings, to pawn things in a-different name from their own; people don't always give us the right name, it is our duty to inquire.</p>
               <p>Is it not also usual to give wrong directions? - Sometimes they do, sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Have you not from your own knowledge, received things from people with a wrong direction as well as a wrong name? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The watch shown to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Is that your watch, Mr. Douglas? - Yes, Sir, it is the watch, I am sure of it; it is a stop watch, the name is Delander; I don't know the number.</p>
               <p>To Wood. Has that watch been under lock and key all the time? - No doubt; I can swear it is the watch I had of him.</p>
               <p>Was it kept among other watches? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. PROTHERO sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the public office when the pawn-broker brought the watch there, when he was relating about stopping the watch, I desired him to describe the man to me; I asked him if he had been to the Adelphi to inquire whether he lived there, he said yes, and there was no such person.</p>
               <p>To Wood. Did you go? - I did by order of the clerks of the office, there was no such person.</p>
               <p>To Prothero. Did he describe the person of the man? - He did, and his voice as clear as could be; it struck me who was the man, I found he lived in St. Giles's, at a stable-yard, upon some inquiry I made about Grosvenor-square and that way.</p>
               <p>Where was he taken? - At the yard where he lived, I believe it is the King's-head, he is something of an under hostler at the stable-yard, I found him in the yard, I was present when he was taken; told him what he was taken for, and I sent for his master and mistress, he denied it, his master said he had been a good servant; I said I would not give any trouble to go to the office, I would go with him to the pawn-broker's. His living in service there made be think he was not the man, and indeed I had not seen him for a year and a half; his master came with us, his master and I went into the shop first, and he followed us, he came in without making any words, as soon as he came in all the three pawn-brokers said you have got the man. I went to the pawn-broker's with the duplicates of the other watches that we found in his pockets or in his box. Still I had a doubt in my mind about this man's guilt, and remained so till he owned he had the watch in my hearing to Doctor Douglas.</p>
               <p>Was there any offer to him to confess? - No, my lord, he said there was a man named Tom, with a silver laced hat sent it to him, after he owned he had it; but he could give no account who that person was.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination</p>
               <p>Is it not remarkable as you had not seen the man a year and a half, you should know him so well? If it had been a dozen years it would make no difference.</p>
               <p>Is it not remarkable you should fix upon him? - His description was he lived with Mr. Fordyce, and he had lived with Mr. Fordyce.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. There was a circumstance came out about finding some duplicates of other watches, that does not relate to this, I beg there may not be any questions asked about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. So far it is evidence, that if at the time a prisoner is taken, a number of suspicious things are found upon him, as in the case of a person charged with house-breaking; if you find a number of iron keys, crows, and dark lanthorns, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050068"/> they are found upon a person after taken, it throws a general suspicion, and weighs as much in one scale, as a good character does in the other, and is evidence of the situation of the person taken. It will not be right to enquire how they come into his possession, that would be enquiring into things that he cannot be prepared to make any defence to.</p>

               <p>Deposed that the mare the prisoner had was delivered to him upon the Monday night, and he looked upon it as a gift, to sell it or keep it, or do as he pleased with it.</p>

            . Do you know any thing of it? - She mentioned it before the justice, that if she had sold the lace at five farthings a yard she never would have said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner is indicted for privately stealing in the shop of Mr. Pritchett, about ninety yards of black lace, value twenty shillings. Stealing privately in a shop to the value of five shillings is a capital felony, but you can't convict her of stealing privately, because she was detected by the witness Lion, and therefore does not come within the words of the act; all you can do, if you find her guilty, is to find her guilty of the felony only.</p>

               <p>Court. You have got the handkerchief? - Yes; this is my handkerchief (producing it.)</p>
               <p>What is the value? - Ten-pence, or a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you see him at the time he had got his hand in your pocket? - There was nobody near us but him; I followed him immediately, and called out stop thief; I took him into the Three Tuns Alehouse opposite; I applied to the master of the house to call me a constable, and to his servants; none of them would come to my assistance; upon that a man came in, and said, I saw this man drop the handkerchief, I will call a coach for you if you chuse it. Two coaches came together, and a dispute arose about the coaches just as we had got him to the coach door; I said, I did not mind that, I would pay the expence of both, let the one follow, and the other go with us. Then there came half a dozen men with bludgeons, and cried clear the way, down with him, cut him down; I received several blows, one I feel the effects of now; the first blow fetched me down under the coach wheel; the prisoner got away; I saw him coming up the passage opposite my house, from Guildhall, the Tuesday following, or the Wednesday, as I was standing at my door; I ran up to him, and said, young man you have not reigned long, don't you remember me; he was then in custody of the keeper of a counter for another offence.</p>
               <p>You are sure that was the person you catched? - Yes; I was in company with him to get a constable as much as half an hour; I sat down in the box with him.</p>

               <p>As I was going from Houndsditch, there stood a man with a firkin of butter, who said to me, my lad will you earn six-pence, to take this firkin of butter to Newgate-street; I said I was going to Catherine-wheel-alley, and he lifted it on my shoulder, and when this man stopt me, I thought it was the man that hired me, to give me six-pence. If I had stole it, I would hardly have carried it back to the shop with him.</p>

Upon being asked why she did not bring it to the bar, she said she kept it till it was owned; the cloak that came out of the box was delivered to Mr. Payne immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. PAYNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was sent for to Mr. Smith's about nine o'clock the 12th of last month, when I came into the tavern, I desired to see the girl they suspected, she was called down stairs, and I took her into a room by herself, and would have persuaded her to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050081"/> open and candid, and I intended to have begged her off, she being a country girl; but she denied to the uttermost knowing any thing at all about the cloak, I desired her box might be brought down, it was; I desired her to open it, she did, and took all the things out of the box herself, she said she had found the cloak in the passage, I have had the cloak ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. Is there any particular mark by which you know it? - Yes; it is worn in the neck.</p>
               <p>Is not that a common place for it to be worn in? - It is.</p>
               <p>It is a black laced cloak? - Yes; I know it extremely well, I cannot say from any thing particular, no other than I am very certain it is my cloak.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Not the least in the world.</p>

               <p>As to the cloak I was accused on, I got up in the morning, and another fellow servant in the place, I picked up the cloak upon the stones, I said, here is something I have picked up looks like a cloak, and my fellow servant said it is, and she told me to keep it till farther enquiry; it was down stairs two days, then I said, I dare say now it will not be owned, as the company that was here that night, have not sent. I took it up stairs for farther inquiration, and nobody ever enquired after it, she said it might be enquired after in time, but nobody ever did enquire after it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Which of the maids was it you told? - Sally, the house-maid; I had it in the scullery two days, I told them of it, at the time I picked it up I mentioned it to Sally.</p>

Dear Miss, I received your letter of the 28th inst. wherein you suggest an inclination to be concerned in some genteel line of business in London, particularly a grocer is agreeable to your request; with infinite pleasure I enquired for a person in that line; I have found a very agreeable person, and shall have an answer next week: If it proves favourable, it is in a very respectable family in your own knowledge, the stock in trade that will be wanted, will be 100 l. or less, agreeable to your wish. In consequence of which, I would earnestly recommend to you to come to town, as there is not a doubt of meeting with something in that line; in fact I am astonished, so fine a young woman as you certainly are, should kill time among such unsocial people, so uncultivated in politeness. I have not the idea of your not meeting with success, your conduct entitles you to my highest opinion; if you will inform me what day the coach will come by, I will meet you. I beg you will write on return of the post, stating how matters shall be conducted. Rely upon secresy, and I remain your sincere friend,</p>

Upon my return upon the Wednesday, I found my trunk open, I returned about eleven in the morning, I had the key in my pocket; I am very clear that I locked it when I went out, and I considered some time, and set down and looked all the things over, and found it as I had left it, every thing safe, my bank bills were not in the trunk, then my fears subsided immediately; Mr. Turner in the mean time, asked me if I had locked up my property, if not, there were drawers of his wife's at my service.</p>
               <p>Did you express your fears at your trunk being open? - No; I never mentioned any thing to the family. Upon the Thursday Turner asked me if I had locked up my property, the first part of the time I laid up stairs with the old lady's daughter. On the Friday I lay in the back parlour where the trunk was, Mr. Turner's wife laid with me. Upon Friday morning, going down Hatton-garden, I made observation to Mr. Turner, it was unsafe to wear pocket hoops, it being easy to have ones pockets picked; Mr. Turner asked me, if I had got my pocket-book in my pocket, I told him yes, I had before told him I had two bank bills, a 50 l. and a 20 l. and a note of hand for 20 l. he requested me to lock them up, and said it was not safe to carry them about, this was between nine and ten Friday morning; when I came home, which was not till late in the evening, I promised him I would.</p>

               <p>Did you lock it up on the Friday? - No, not till the Saturday; I lay that night with Mrs. Turner, and upon the Saturday morning, after breakfast, he asked me if I had locked up my things, I told him I would do it before I went out; upon the Saturday I went out for all day, I put the key in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050083"/> pocket, returned about five in the evening, being much indisposed I had my tea in the fore parlour, with Turner and his wife, this was on the 6th of October, nothing happened while I was drinking tea.</p>
               <p>What happened afterwards? - At seven o'clock the same evening, I went and locked up my purse in the trunk.</p>
               <p>What money was in it? - Eight guineas and a half, and a crown piece; I looked at the pocket-book and the bank bills, and they were all safe; Mr. Turner was then at home; sometime afterwards, he told me he was going out to raffle for a gun, and he went out; a little after eight, he returned home again, and called his wife out of the fore parlour backwards.</p>
               <p>What communication is there between them, is there a door that goes out of the back parlour into the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Does the back parlour communicate with the fore parlour? - No; there is a staircase between them; his wife returned in ten minutes, but he did not. In about a quarter of an hour after, the lodger's daughter came in, Miss

               <p>The door being a-jar, was you placed so as to be able to see into the entry? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you sitting down? - I was; during our being there there was a great noise heard on the stair-case in the passage.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Turner was with you all this time? - Yes; I asked the reason of Miss Dickson, of this noise, the answer I received was, that it was her mother's company going home.</p>
               <p>What sort of noise was it? - It was a noise as if three or four people were pushing one another, getting something out of the house.</p>
               <p>What might be the weight of the trunk? - Upon my word I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Could you have taken it in both your hands and lifted it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it about forty pounds? - It might weigh that.</p>
               <p>Then it did not require two or three people to carry it out? - No; when this noise had subsided a little, this young woman left us and went up stairs, a little after nine o'clock Mr. Turner returned home again, he then called his wife out a second time, they had some conversation together.</p>
               <p>You had not supped? - No.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - It was proposed what they should have for dinner on Sunday, as I had not dined in the house since I came to London, having many friends in town besides them, the wife then went to market, they were to have a leg of pork for dinner; then he requested to know, what I would have for supper, and he proposed oysters; I eat what supper I thought proper, a toast and nothing else, afterwards we set down, and talked together, till between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>So from the time you had been in your room at seven o'clock, you never went in it 'till this time? - No.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed? - Between ten and eleven; I went into the room first, and Mrs. Turner followed; as soon as I came into the room I missed my trunk; as soon as I had missed the trunk, I told Mrs. Turner somebody had taken away the trunk, and we looked round the room.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Turner say? - She said it could not be gone, if it was, it must be by somebody in the house.</p>
               <p>Did you call the rest of the family? - I went into the fore parlour to Mr. Turner, I told him I was robbed, and my trunk was gone.</p>
               <p>Did you at that time suspect Mr. Turner at all? - Not at that time, he came into the room and said, if it was gone, he was confident it must be his lodgers up stairs; then he called his lodgers down; Mrs. Dickson, the old lady, he challenged with the robbery.</p>

               <p>You did not sleep much? - No; I made myself as easy as I could till morning: early the next morning, I went to Mr. Albion Cox, my brothers were acquainted with him; I went to stop payment of that note upon Mr. Albion Cox; Mr. Turner went with me, and when we returned, I begged to know whether I could not have a warrant granted.</p>
               <p>This was Sunday? - Yes; he told me there could be no such thing till next day; I was very desirous to go that day; then I wished to have some hand-bills printed, and I set down and gave a description as well as I could.</p>
               <p>(The hand-bill was produced and read by her; she was asked, if all those things were in her trunk, to which she said, yes.)</p>
               <p>Where did you go on the Sunday besides? - I went to my friends in Fleet-street, and got those hand-bills printed upon the Sunday. I lost all my wearing apparel in this trunk, except my gowns, which were not in the trunk, and some of my linen.</p>
               <p>Were they in the room? - No; in another room, in the fore parlour. I went up in the afternoon to Mr. Clark in Bow-street, and I did not see Mr. Turner afterwards till the evening, he came to my friends to seek me; I did not lay at Turner's that night; I had taken my gowns away that evening, and I went to Mr. Clarke, and informed him of this robbery, about three in the afternoon on the Sunday. Turner did not go with me; on Sunday evening, I had one of Mr. Triquet's clerks came to pay me a visit, and wished me to come up to their office; he was an Oxford man, one Fletcher; he desired I would come the next morning and breakfast; when I was there, he related to Mr. Triquet what had happened, and Mr. Triquet asked me whether I would chuse to have those people taken up.</p>

               <p>Then you did not desire Mr. Turner to be taken up? - No; they were brought before Mr. Triquet, and went through an examination.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Turner attend there? - Mr. Turner attended, and said they were a parcel of thieves, and got their bread by shoplifting; he gave them a very bad character, and said Mrs. Fell was under recognizance for taking her trial at Westminster, for shoplifting, that was old Mrs. Dickson's daughter, the young lady that came to see me; they were all discharged. After this I returned to my friends in Fleet-street, and remained silent for a few days.</p>
               <p>There was an end of your engaging with the grocer? - Yes; a few days after I was sent for to Mr. Clark's office, about the Wednesday or Thursday following: Mr. Clark informed me, he had found out the man who had opened my trunk, and who had locked it, and unlocked the trunk, and fastened it down again. This very much surprised me; he told me Mr. Turner had procuted it to be done, upon this I went to the office in Bow-street, and requested a warrant to take him up, he was taken up as I requested a warrant to take him up. - Mr. Justice Wright examined him, and he was ordered to Clerkenwell prison upon suspicion: when he was examined, he gave an account what sort of people his lodgers were, and what money his wife had to go to market; she contradicted him, he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050085"/> he had given her four or five shillings, she said it was half a guinea; nothing passed about the box a considerable time, and after that I told Justice Addington, that when I came home, upon the Wednesday, it was opened. Mr. Addington asked him, how that happened; he said his little girl was in the room, and threw it down.</p>
               <p>Was it a sort of trunk for a little girl to throw down? - No, my Lord, it was not; the little girl was about four years old, and the trunk stood upon a large box; he said, by the force of its falling, the lock sprung open, the things were not tumbled, the things were all very straight as I had left it.</p>
               <p>Was the lock pushed back or forced open? - I thought it had been forced open, I believe, to the best of my knowledge, the lock was shoved back. Mr. Addington then said, how came he to apply to a blacksmith to fasten the lock again; his answer was, he did it, because I should have no mistrust of any thing that had happened, because he did not wish to have any words about his little girl.</p>
               <p>When was it the smith was employed? - I heard the Friday, I had locked it after I found it open upon the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Do you know of yourself of its being opened any oftener than that Wednesday? - No; I did not know it; I constantly locked it from the Wednesday morning, and I always found it locked after: after this examination he was ordered back to prison, bail was granted him afterwards; I had a search warrant to search the house of

               <p>Was any thing found in Mr. Turner's house? - No; we all went to the magistrates; when we came there, Mrs. Brewer said the handkerchief was her property, that she bought it at Plymouth.</p>
               <p>What did Mrs. Moore say about the apron? - She said it was her apron, and she could call Miss Ainsworth to prove she had got it up several times; a day was appointed for it; this was Friday, and they were brought up the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Were they committed? - They were; Miss Ainsworth did not appear, but she brought another woman to prove the getting up this apron: this woman said she had got it up several times, that there was one place she had tore it in the middle in getting it up, but she had neatly darned it; I don't know her name; the Justice requested to look at it, but there was no such thing found in it; she said the flounce consisted of three pieces on one side, and two on the other.</p>

               <p>What did you think with reference to the handkerchief? - I expressed no doubt whatever to the handkerchief, but only to the apron; of my own voluntary motion I swore to the handkerchief, it was not from any suggestion from any body.

             the circumstance of Turner's calling after me upon the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Was that the day you signed your information? - I signed none. - A paper shown him.</p>
               <p>Is that your hand-writing? - Yes; I signed it; I did not know it was an information; Turner applied to me before the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>What day? - That was the part of the evidence I supposed I might vary in, I will tell you why; there were three or four women in the house drinking tea, when Turner came in, and after I had been before a magistrate, I went and asked them severally concerning the day; one says, I believe it was on Tuesday, another said she believed it was Wednesday, another on Thursday, and another said she did not know what day it was; but my lad and I comparing notes, we agreed it was on the Friday; I think it was that day, rather than any other, I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>What did Turner apply to you for? - To put the bolt of a lock in its place, which he had put back with a knife; if I could put it in its place, so that the person that belonged to it could not know it, he said it was his sister's box, he did not altogether care much whether she knew it or not, but he should not like her to know it, he said the box was going to be sent into the country to her; I told him I was very little accustomed to do such jobs, but I had a young man that worked with me, could do such jobs, and he should go with him; I believe this was about four o'clock in the evening, he said he was going a little farther, and he would call for him; in about half an hour afterwards he called, and the young man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050087"/> went with him, his name is

               <p>In his Cross-Examination (he was asked whether he had been spoken to by any people since that made him alter his evidence) he said nothing can excite any thing more from me than my conscience would let me speak.</p>
               <p>Did you or not, before the magistrate, say, when he applied to you, when he said the Tuesday, did not you say no, it was the day before the robbery? - Yes; I believe, I said to the purpose you are speaking of, and then I said to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. The man has a compunction of conscience, he will not swear positively, but he believes it to be the Friday. I don't see it is material whether Thursday or Friday the box was unlocked.</p>

               <p>Where was it? - In Air-street Hill, in a back parlour; I think it was on the bed, he reached it off the bed.</p>
               <p>Was it wood? - It was; when I came there, I locked it again, it had been unlocked; Mr. Turner lifted it from the bed upon a chair; I did not see the inside of it; there were nobody but him and me present; two or three women met him as he went in, I don't know who they were; he told me it was his sister's trunk, he was going to send it into the country to her, and she would be angry if she knew it had been opened; he gave me a pint of beer, and he was to pay my master besides I suppose.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street, I went to this house of Mrs. Wattys, and found this apron and handkerchief, in the rooms of Brewer and Moore, I think it was about the 3d of November.</p>
               <p>You went with Miss Hayes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you find in Brewer's room? - This handkerchief.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was Brewer's room? - She was in the room when we went into it; she was in the front room, and went into the back room.</p>
               <p>What did you find in Moore's room? - This apron and piece of cambrick.</p>
               <p>(Producing the handkerchief, apron, and piece of cambrick.)</p>
               <p>To Miss Hayes. Look at the handkerchief, and tell the jury whether you know it, and how you know it to be your property? - I know it from the hemming, that I swear to, the beginning not being properly hemmed; I cut it out and made it myself.</p>

               <p>You are sure it was in your box? - I am; one of the corners is not even hemmed.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that is your apron? - I am; and the handkerchief is mine; I made this apron myself, I know it by the hemming all round; I can tell it by my own work; it was a round apron before, but now they have made it square.</p>
               <p>Did you put in those pieces at the side? - I did; I whipt the hemming, and I know my work; there is a bit of muslin different from the other in it, because I preserved a little bit by me for another use; this has four joinings on one side, and two upon the other, and they said there was five on one side; as to the piece of muslin, I will not swear to that, I had a piece of muslin like it in my box; I have no doubt of the apron being my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>About the apron you mentioned one number before the justice, and now you mention another? - I am confident before the justice they swore to a wrong number, and I was right.</p>
               <p>Counsel. My lord, the number swore to as she relates now, was sworn to by the person to identify this apron.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050088"/>Court. She originally said three and two, and now says four and two.</p>
               <p>What should induce you to think the corner was altered? - The corners were turned up, and left round, and now it is turned down, and made square.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner Moore. Ask Miss Hayes if ever she got up the apron; if she can answer in a particular thing that is in the muslin alone, not in the workmanship of any woman, but in the muslin itself?</p>
               <p>Miss Hayes. I never washed it myself, our servants washed it for me; I took the flounce off.</p>
               <p>You pretend to know it from the number of pieces? - Not that only, but from my work.</p>
               <p>(The Counsel desired to cross-examine Mr. M'Manus.)</p>
               <p>When you went with Miss Hayes to search the lodgings, did she express no doubt as to the identity of the things? - She said she had some doubt about the apron, on account of its being altered; so she called me aside, and told me; says I if you have any doubt don't take it; it is of very dangerous consequence to the people; she went across the room, and said, well I think still it is my apron, and I said, if you desire me to take it I will, I did not take it then; in going in the coach to Bow-street, she said, I am sure it is my apron; though I left it behind, says I, if you think so I will go back and take it.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - No; she told the justice of it, and they called me in and her, and I went back to fetch it; when she saw it again, she said, she was positive of it; she expressed no doubt as to the handkerchief to my knowledge; when she went back she opened the apron, and examined it more than four or five minutes; she swore to it after that before the justice.</p>

               <p>What are you? - A bookbinder; he asked me whether I knew she had any property; I told him I believed, and was pretty certain she had; nothing more passed than he said he had got some business to do for her in town; he asked me if she had any money left her lately, I told him she had.</p>
               <p>From Turner. Did I apply to you in any house? - No; at Bagnigge Wells.</p>

               <p>TURNER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 2d of October, I agreed with the prosecutrix to meet me at Croydon fair; she was very early at my house in the morning, and begged I would not fail.</p>
               <p>Court. She lay at your house, did not she? - No; she went to the playhouse, and did not lay at my house; she went with an acquaintance of her's into Bishopsgate-street, in a coach; I called upon one Mr. Williams, who was there at the time Miss Hayes was at my house, to go with me to get a coach to go to meet Miss Hayes; when I came home the child I was informed had been tumbling and jumping about upon the box, and tumbled it down.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to go and meet her at Croydon? - I went to get a chaise, but could not; the box either came open by the fall, or is was left open by Miss Hayes, and if my spouse was to go with me to Croydon, I thought there would be nobody left in the house, but the lodgers, and it would not be safe to leave the trunk open, and it would be prudent to have it fastened, I said so to Mr. Williams who was then present.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is Mr. Williams? - He is a school master, a person the prosecutrix knows very well; he went with me to Uxbridge, when I met Miss Hayes; as I went out to look for a chaise, I told him I would go down to Mr. Armfield, and desire him to step down, and fasten it; this was on the Tuesday, I called at Armfield's house, and desired him to step and fasten the trunk; he told me he was very busy, but would send a person with me; I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050089"/> if I could fasten it with a knife, he did not think I could; not meeting with a chaise, I agreed to take my wife to the play. I called again upon Armfield, and he sent a young man with me that locked it again, I believe.</p>
               <p>Court to Lowndes. You are sure you locked the box again? - Yes; I am sure I locked it.</p>
               <p>Turner. He said it was very easy, and probably it might be unlocked by a fall, I did not go to Croydon fair, upon account I could not get a chaise; upon Saturday evening about six o'clock, I drank tea with the prosecutrix, at my own house; I read over then, the articles of a draught of partnership; she was going into partnership with Mr. Hurst; she said it would do very well; I took it down to Mr. Bourne, who I am clerk to, in Clifford's Inn; from there I went to a broker's in Soho-square, to desire him to attend on Monday, to appraise the fixtures of the shop; from thence I called at Newport-market, and drank at a public-house with a person, came home about eight, and acquainted Miss Hayes I was going to raffle for a gun, and asked her in a joking way, if she would be one; I then went to a public-house across the way, and there I staid till I came home, about half past nine, and I asked Miss Hayes if she would dine with me the next day, I asked her what she would like for dinner, it was referred to my spouse, she mentioned a leg of pork, she said it was agreeable; then I took my wife into the other room, not being willing to comunicate every thing to Miss Hayes; I ran short of cash and I gave her a few shillings, I understand it is said, I gave her half a guinea; I sent her out for a few oysters for supper, Miss Hayes had a pint of twopenny and a toast, this was between eleven and twelve, but she says between ten and eleven; she and my spouse went into the back room to go to bed; I sat with my head upon the back of a chair, she came back and said her trunk was missing; I told her I was very much astonished at that, to my surprise the trunk was gone, and the jacket and coat which lay upon it removed; she said she had had occasion to go there for a night-cap, or she should not have known it; I asked her when she saw it last, she said about seven o'clock in the evening; I said was your property safe, I went out about eight o'clock, she said there was a noise about half past eight, for Mrs. Dickson's daughter came down and asked how she did, and watched the parlour; that there were three women on the stairs, Mrs. Moore, one Mrs. Brewer, one Mrs. Fell, and Mrs. Dixon, were at the door; she said I asked the daughter what it was, the daughter said it was the visitors taking leave of the mother; says Miss Hayes, it seems very odd, that they should be taking leave of her mother when she was at the door; it then struck me, the three women were taking every advantage of this trunk, I desired her to call down Mrs.

             the mother, and I accused her of taking it away; with great confusion, she said she knew nothing at all of it, and wondered I knew nothing of it, because our street door is always open; I said you will not tell me it was a common plunderer or thief, that took this box in particular, and I am convinced you are the thief, it can be nobody but you; and you are always asking her when she goes into partnership, or when she will leave my house; I then said to Miss Hayes, it approaches to twelve o'clock, it will not be prudent to make a piece of work, and it will be best to go to Albion Cox in the morning to stop the draught; I went with her to stop the payment; I met Armfield upon Clerkenwell green, and acquainted him with the circumstance, and desired if he heard any thing of it he would let me know, acquainting him, it was the very trunk he had opened.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell Armfield about the opening of this trunk, when Miss Hayes was by?</p>
               <p>Turner. Miss Hayes was at a distance.</p>
               <p>Court. It was in Miss Hayes' hearing was it? - No; Armfield was at a distance, I ran after him and told him, which Miss Hayes cannot deny.</p>

            . I am a schoolmaster, and live in Ray-street; I have known Mr. Turner twelve or fourteen years; I went to his house upon Tuesday, the 2d of October; Miss Hayes came in and another young lady, to change her dress, and said she was going to Croydon; they went out together; Turner and I went to see to get a chaise, but could not get one, we came home and dined there; I lodge in Southamton buildings; we told Mrs. Turner we would go after dinner and see for one; Mrs. Turner makes answer, we must not go till we make the box fast; the child has been playing upon the box, by jumping up and down, or other means, that the box is either burst open, or Miss Hayes has left it open, and said, do you think I can make it fast with a knife; no, says I, I would not have you do that, left you should damage the lock.</p>
               <p>You understood it was Miss Hayes's trunk that was broke open? - That was all that I heard then, he and I went in search after a horse and chaise; I left him in Kirby-street, and went to the stable yard, he went to the man that was to do the lock; I came back to Turner's, and was in the front room, and Mr. Turner and the blacksmith's boy came in together; on Saturday when the robbery was committed, about six in the evening, he came to my lodgings, I was drinking tea, and asked me if I would go with him to raffle for a gun, in my neighbourhood; I said with all my heart; first we went down to Messrs. Bourn and Bower, Clifford's Inn, where I believe he delivered in a paper, I came back with him about eight, or a little after eight.</p>
               <p>Then you separated from him, and about eight came to him? - I never left him from the time he and I drank tea, till near half past nine.</p>

               <p>You drank tea together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From six to past nine he never went home? - No; I remember he went out upon the green, in order to get another member, and returned in seven or eight minutes, and I believe he did not go home at all.</p>
               <p>He was not out of your company above five or six minutes? - It might be nine or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>He could not go home to drink tea? - No.</p>

               <p>Had he time during that ten minutes he was out, to go to his own house? - Yes; I believe he had, his house was within a hundred yards of the place where we raffled.</p>

               <p>I keep the sign of the Crown, the corner of Summer-street, Cold-Bath fields; there was a raffle at my house, it began about a quarter past nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the prisoner Turner at your house that night? - Beyond a doubt he was.</p>
               <p>What time? - Sometime after eight, I think it was about h alf past eight, he staid till the raffle was over, and then went home; I recollect at that time there were some members wanting, and I believe he went out to get another member.</p>
               <p>How far is it from your house to his house? - Within two hundred yards at the farthest.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Two years, I believe; I never heard nothing but a very honest character of him.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I understand his profession to be a sheriff's officer. Something leading to the Law.</p>
               <p>He came to you about half past eight, and was not with you before? - No; here is his own hand writing, a list of the raffle, the day was October the 6th.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect having seen Turner at Villepierre's, at the time at the raffle? - Yes; something about eight o'clock, between eight and nine, (the witness recollecting himself, said) between seven and eight. It makes me confused as I never was in a court before.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was between eight and nine? - Between seven and eight, Sir.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was there before eight? - I am positive he was there before eight, he went away and came again between eight and nine, he was by himself when he went away, and he came again with another person.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A jeweller; I had a raffle that night for the gun, with another person; Mr. Turner said he would go for another, he was there again before the raffle was over.</p>
               <p>What time did he come first? - I cannot be positive to a minute, it was before eight, but how much I cannot tell; he went out by himself and came back with one Williams.</p>
               <p>Court. How far is Turner's house in Air-street, from the schoolmaster's house in Ray-street? - Not above five hundred yards.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner Turner? - Three years? I live opposite, I never knew any harm of him.</p>

             was charged with having printed and published a libel as false in its assertion, as it was pernicious in its consequences.</p>
               <p>That in the beginning of the year 1780, a bill was brought into parliament for the purpose of repealing some laws which were a disgrace to any civilized country. The object of that bill was not as it was falsely represented, a design of giving any countenance to a religion so opposite to the genius of a free country, but the sole object was to repeal some cruel and sanguinary laws, which had been enacted in the days of darkness and superstition, which had so long continued a disgrace to this country.</p>
               <p>That notwithstanding this law had passed with the unanimous consent of parliament, some men thought this law had passed improperly; a very small body of men, at first, had thought fit to complain of it, and by making use of arguments to delude the minds of people in general, had procured a very large and formidable number of people, in order to join in a petition for a repeal of that law.</p>
               <p>I from my heart believed, that their motives were very laudable in petitioning, but I from my heart also believe, that their minds were imposed upon by arguments, and artifices of designing men, who had other purposes in view. The petition to parliament being rejected, produced a very considerable ferment in the minds of some people, and there were some people so lost to their duties, to their fellow citizens, they were determined by acts of violence to loosen the bands of society, to repeal that act, every one remembers the acts of violence committed on the very day of the petition; the Ambassadors chapels and houses being attacked, demolished and plundered, and some persons committed to Newgate for it. The very evening after the commitment of those men, the prisoner thought fit to publish this hand bill, the libel with which he is now charged, and a libel, a greater malignance calculated to produce worse effects, and which probably did produce worse effects, I believe never was stated to a jury. The obvious tendency of it was to inflame the minds of the people against the governing power, to induce the populace to trample upon the laws and constitution of this kingdom, and to substitute anarchy and confusion; the libel runs in these words (see the indictment.) It is impossible for any body to hear this paper read, without seeing its obvious tendency. This was at a time, when the minds of all men were alarmed, and the minds of the lower order of people in the highest state of perturbation; then it was introduced for the purpose of telling them what was intirely false respecting the introduction of popery, and for the purpose of hindering the laws from taking their course. It became the object of this man for the paultry purpose of recommending a trifling paper to sale, to inflame the minds of the people to commit outrages, which we can all recollect did follow. He employed two boys in distributing these hand bills amongst the populace, on the Tuesday, and on the Tuesday night those misguided<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050095"/> persons, as he calls them, were rescued out of the gaol of Newgate; it is a fact notorious on the 6th of June, that great prison of this metropolis was consumed in flames; we all too sensibly feel the horrors that followed afterwards. The prisoner, as the author of such a paper as this, is a bad citizen, and deserving of punishment; as to the fact of publication that will be proved by two or three witnesses, and it will be your duty to find him guilty.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to put this question to the witness, whether he knows me, or where he ever saw me?</p>
               <p>Milledge. Yes; I have seen him several times, he used to come to my printing house often; I am satisfied of his person; upon the occasion of these tumults he sent me a hand bill, intitled England in Blood, it was left for me when I was out of town, when I came home in the morning I found it, I believe it was Monday or Tuesday, I don't know which; I sent it up stairs to be composed.</p>
               <p>Do you know the hand writing? - Yes; I have seen Mr. Moore write several times, and I believed that note to be his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Was that hand bill printed from that note? - There is one I put my name to, I should be glad to see. (a paper shewn him.)</p>

               <p>Who took them away? - I believe Mr. Moore ordered the boy to take it away.</p>

            , I don't know which; I believe there were two or three thousand printed; I came back and found they were printed, and I think I represented to Mr. Moore they were a little inflammatory.</p>
               <p>The paper was printed from the hand writing of Moore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. You should give proof of that paper being lost, before you give evidence of the hand writing, when the original is not produced.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What is become of that paper? - It was given to Mr. Wilkes.</p>
               <p>What Mr. Wilkes? - Alderman Wilkes.</p>
               <p>When did you see Mr. Moore after you had printed it? - The same day at my printing office; I believe it was while they were working off at press; it is a good while ago, I should be very glad to recollect myself perfectly; when Mr. Moore came to my office, I told him I thought they were rather inflammatory, on my advise he altered the first hand bill to the second; I had no more conversation with him about it; I did not see Mr. Moore when the hand bill was left.</p>
               <p>What did he come to you about? - I had connection with him for several weeks or months before, I thought it was his hand writing; I believe it was, he came to me when some were published; I told him I thought it was rather inflammatory, and accordingly Mr. Moore altered it to the second hand bill where my name is put.</p>
               <p>Was you present when the first hand bills were delivered out? - I do not recollect: I may be.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination by the Prisoner.</p>

               <p>You will not undertake to swear it was my hand writing you received? - I believe the very paper was delivered to Mr. Wilkes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is not the question.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that paper which you received, and afterwards delivered up the prisoner's hand writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him write before? - Several times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the hand bill was printed from your press as it was sent to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050096"/> your house, and as you conceived to have been in my hand writing? - The first hand bill was printed verbatim from his hand writing; when I represented to him it was rather inflammatory, he himself came up, and altered it to the second.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That is no answer to my question, Mr. Milledge? - I believe it is, Sir.</p>
               <p>Whether you know the hand bill to be printed as it was wrote, and in my hand writing, for I have evidence here in court, or very near at hand, and you will be cautious in your declaration; the question is whether the first paper you printed was faithfully printed from the paper you think is my hand writing? - I believe it was, here is a man in court will be more particular.</p>
               <p>Whether I employed you, in the first instance, to print this paper? - I don't say you did; you employed one Mr. Barr; Mr. Barr turned it over to me, and you came to me, and brought copy; I was first engaged by one Mr. Barr, who is now engaged in the Morning Herald, his business at that time rather engrossed too much of his attention, and after he had printed three or four numbers, he asked me if I would take it on myself.</p>

I beg I may ask another question, which is this, when these bills, called England in Blood, which were delivered from his house, were delivered upon the 6th or 7th of June, it is a material matter? - My lord, I cannot be punctual to the day, I believe it was Tuesday; here will be clearer evidence than mine upon that question.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it the day before Newgate was burnt, or any other? - I believe it was the morning Newgate was burnt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Were they delivered upon that day Newgate was burnt or nor? - To the best of my remembrance it was about noon of the day Newgate was burnt.</p>
               <p>I should be exceedingly sorry you in a court of judicature or justice should perjure yourself: now you can't undertake to swear it positively? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you swear positively, it was either that day, or the day following? - It was one of those two days.</p>
               <p>That you can swear positively? - I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was upon the evening very late, and no bill was published till that evening, and after all the rioters were dispersed.</p>

               <p>Have you seen him write; - I have; I have seen him before then several times; some were delivered to Mr. Moore himself, which he took away from the press, some from me, and others from the boy; my recollection is rather shallow, as I am now advancing in years, it will not go to swear to a day, but I believe it was on the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You ought to be extremely cautious in what you say, I have evidence to contradict materially what you have asserted. My lord, will you ask the witness whether he will swear upon his oath, the bills were delivered upon the Tuesday morning, the 6th of June?</p>
               <p>Elliott. To the best of my recollection they were, which was what I first declared, and before the burning of Newgate I am confident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I should be sorry to take up the time of the court, universally to ask questions foreign to the purpose; I will take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050097"/> upon myself to prove you have perjured yourself, my lord, my boy will materially contradict it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you recollect the day Newgate was burnt? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was before it was burnt? - I am perfect it was before; but I cannot recollect the day, but I recollect the circumstance, it was prior to the fire of Newgate.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - At noon.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>How old are you? - I am between fourteen and fifteen.</p>
               <p>How long have you been with Mr. Moore? - I believe about ten or eleven weeks, as near as I can guess; I was employed by him in June last, to carry out papers and deliver them at shops, and to people as they passed along.</p>
               <p>Look at that hand-bill, and inform the jury, whether you was employed to do any thing with that bill? - Yes, sir; to deliver them out to people that passed and repassed.</p>
               <p>You was employed by the prisoner for that purpose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you in consequence of that, deliver any out, to people that passed and repassed? - Yes, sir; great quantities.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what day it was? - As near as I can recollect it was a Tuesday.</p>

               <p>Do you remember the burning of Newgate? -</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether it was that day, or any other day? - It was that day.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the hand-bill be read.</p>
               <p>The hand-bill (as stated in the indictment verbatim) was read in court.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination of Ward by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>At what time did you receive those hand-bills from me to be delivered to the public? - About three or four o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>There is no guessing in this matter, it is a matter of consequence; guessing will not do, you must speak as near as possible? - It was near about three or four o'clock.</p>
               <p>I will correct him or try to refresh his memory? - Did you ever see one of those hand-bills before seven in the evening, on Tuesday the 6th of June? - I did, Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>You did? - I did.</p>
               <p>And where did you see them? - At the shop.</p>
               <p>Before seven in the evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon the 6th of June? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Pray had you not directions from me on Wednesday morning, and there could be very little time between six and seven in the evening, or before the shops were shut; had not you strict orders not to deliver another bill? - I had.</p>
               <p>Had you delivered any bills? - Yes; my Mistress told me to deliver a few, I had delivered a few just as the rioters went past.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had orders from me not to deliver any on the next morning, I should have been exceeding sorry to have caused tumults or riots.</p>
               <p>To Ward. Did I not tell you strictly not to deliver any? - You said there was a mistake, Mr. Moore, you told me not to deliver them out till that mistake was altered.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure it was between three and four o'clock on Tuesday, you first delivered them? - As near as I can think of, I know I received them before seven.</p>
               <p>When did you begin to deliver them? - I delivered them just as the rioters came by Newgate, I delivered them just about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>I thought you said three? - That was when I received them; it was just as they came past, my mistress told me to do it as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, I can only say this, I had no intention of inflaming the minds of the people; the hand-bill was written on Sunday the 4th of June, it was sent to Mr. Milledge's office, I believe upon the Monday, and not till seven in the evening upon Tuesday did I see one of the bills, they were delivered by his servant-maid, and they were not in Fleet-street till near eight; there were not more than one hundred or one hundred and fifty distributed, and they were all distributed by that boy; I was apprehensive that some advantage would be taken of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050098"/> exigencies of the times, and the dreadful conflagration with which the city and metropolis was threatened; I told the boy he should not deliver another on the Wednesday morning. The bill your lordship will consider is not addressed to the rioters, but to the Protestant Association; the rioters I believe were a mere band of robbers, and disturbers of the public peace; the Protestant Association were a very different description of men; they had a very different object in view, no less than this, to prevent the establishment of popery by act of parliament; to promote designs of such sort, I hold to be laudable and proper; how far I am liable for that I submit to your lordship and the court.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that it is necessary to call any; I was used cruelly, had my doors broke open, was taken out of my bed, my sheets taken from my bed things, taken out of drawers; carried to Lincoln's Inn, then to Bridewell, and confined in a room not more than four feet square, and there kept ten weeks; and they took above 200 l. of my property, which I never have received, nor perhaps ever may; Mr. Chetham, whom I see in court, or Mr. White, might have found me if they thought proper; I wrote three letters to Mr. White, and desired he would restore what they took from me; he never sent to me, but there was an official letter went to one of my bail, Mr. Reynolds; I surrendered this day seven weeks, and now my trial is brought on, my lord, this witness I can bring, was taken out of his bed prior to this, and carried to Lincoln's Inn, and his drawers searched, to know whether I had correspondence with the French, or had French money.</p>
               <p>Court. That is foreign to the question now before us.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Therefore I would not call him; every step to prejudice me has been taken by the crown, and I know I have been obnoxious to them.</p>

            , she was a lodger of mine; I live in Short's-gardens, near Drury-lane, she has lodged with me near four months; and she lodged with me about four years ago too; I remember the time of her being taken up.</p>
               <p>Do you remember where she was, the night before she was taken up? - She was with me the 30th day of October; she came down in the morning and brought a petticoat to mend it, she asked me for some pieces to mend it with, I searched the drawer for some, she sat down till near twelve o'clock; says she I have some things to boil for dinner, they are not done and it is late, she came afterwards about two o'clock; she went out and was gone a great while, and came in about eight, and said, I must go and make my bed, and make a fire; I said but don't go till you tell me what o'clock it is, go to the snuff-shop and ask; she went, and came back to the back door; I live in the back house, and she lives in the street house, and says she it was past eight.</p>
               <p>How long was she gone to the snuff-shop? - Not two minutes; she had all these four months, and I can justify it, she had nothing but the linen gown and a thing like striped.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050100"/>Has she any dark-coloured gown? - Not one; if she has, I never saw it upon her, and no other person saw any thing upon her, but something like a laylock stripe upon it.</p>
               <p>What day was it you was at home, and came down in the morning as you have described? - It was the 30th day of October.</p>
               <p>How came you to remark it? - Because she was taken up the night following by a schoolmaster and a little boy. I had it put down upon this bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Why then, after she came back from the snuff-shop, did she go out again that night? - Sir, she lighted a candle, and went up to her own apartment; I had a full view of her as I have of your face in lighting her candle; a few minutes after I said, will you make your bed, she said yes, and it was near ten o'clock, and after I asked if she was going to bed, yes, says she; it is true, it is fact and true, gentlemen and lords together, and I believe her as innocent as the child unborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Court. What curiosity had you to know what o'clock it was that evening? - It is a common thing with us in the house, as we are not able to keep a clock in the house, to ask one another what it is.</p>
               <p>But every evening do you send somebody to know what o'clock it is? - Sometimes I do, and sometimes I do not; I did just ask her as she was going down, says I, Jenny, what o'clock is it, go to the shop-snuff, they keeps their clock very regular, it is more true than many great clocks and watches either.</p>
               <p>Do you enquire every night when she goes to bed? - No; may be I might that night, but not other nights; she has ne'er a brown gown; it was put down the very day she was committed, I had it put down upon this bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Who put it down for you? - Why, a man that knew how to write.</p>
               <p>That man had a name probably? - Yes; that man is my husband, his name is Mc. Connel, he is a little taylor, and works journey work.</p>
               <p>He put it down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was to put you in mind of the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The paper handed up to Mr. Recorder.)</p>
               <p>Is your husband a lawyer? - No; he is a little taylor.</p>
               <p>Your husband put this down at your desire, to put you in mind of the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he put it down the day that you was examined before the Justice? - He put down that the very evening.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No, please your honour, he knows nothing at all about it, but as I told him.</p>
               <p>Did you give your husband the paper to put it down upon? - I don't know whether that is what I looked for in the drawer; I forget how I got the paper.</p>
               <p>Was it the snuff paper she brought from the snuff-shop; - No; I take snuff, and the snuff may have dropped upon it.</p>
               <p>And you gave the paper to him to put it down upon? - The paper was partly new when he put it down.</p>
               <p>Can you write yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you read writing? - No.</p>
               <p>How can this tell you the day of the month then? - Because any gentleman that can read, can tell me the day very well.</p>
               <p>It was your husband that wrote it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is a very good scholar, is he? - He can scribble a little.</p>
               <p>Have you any more of his hand-writing about you? - No; I have not.</p>
               <p>He writes a lawyer-like hand, don't he? - No; he is no lawyer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder to the Jury. I will tell you, gentlemen, what is wrote down: Charge against

             deposed, Baynes came in a hurry to the half-way house, Mother Red-cap's, and said he had been robbed in the field; he turned his head about, and said, there goes the three men together, and said that is the man (Chick) who robbed me of my breeches and penny; whether they husled him him, or how they took it, he did not know; that being on horseback, he (Fletcher) got off, and took a stick and pursued them, and brought Chick back by the coat, the others came along behind him; at the time he jumped over, the parcel was thrown down in the field.</p>
               <p>Court. This case, in point of law, is confined to the penny; the breeches were taken privately from his person, which is a different offence.</p>

               <p>Barringer, the constable, deposed, he was present, searched the men, and found about a shilling amongst them, and four pennyworth of halfpence upon Chick.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was going towards Hampstead to see an acquaintance, I was walking before, and I saw some person, I did not know who it was, he came almost to us, and turned and run back as hard as he could, and coming back with another man, they stopped us.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>We were going to Hampstead, and this man met us; as soon as he saw us, he set off as fast as he could, run back again, and fetched a person and charged us.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't think it necessary to put Tike upon his defence at all.</p>
               <p>To Baynes. This place you describe, where these people met you, was in the second field from Mother Red-cap's, you say; is not that in sight both of the road from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050103"/> Hampstead to Tottenham Court and St. Giles's, and the cross road from Pancrass to St. Giles's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was at ten o'clock in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In sight of Mother Red Cap's too? - Yes; it was.</p>
               <p>In this place, at ten o'clock in the morning, in sight of both roads, accosted by men who had no weapons, how came you to give your money to strangers? - At that time it was a very thick fog, I could hardly see for fog; when I saw these men I had a sort of fright upon me, I did not like the looks of them; I was coming the same path they were, I went upon the other, as soon as I did, they came across, and came and catched hold of me, they were coming to me, I was going towards town.</p>
               <p>Was your fright occasioned by any thing Chick said or did to you, or merely from the apprehension of your own mind, from seeing those men together? - I was in fear every minute they should knock me down.</p>
               <p>Was it upon what they said, or your own fears? - Upon what they said.</p>
               <p>What did they say? - I have told you every thing.</p>
               <p>Court. There is not sufficient evidence to charge Tike, no direct evidence he was connected with the other prisoners; certainly, it is a nice distinction, if this can be made a robbery at all; in respect to the silk breeches it is clear, in point of law, if the evidence is true, there was no robbery of that; for the nature of the robbery is, that of obtaining from another, money or goods, by force or fear, either by actual force or violence, or putting them in such fear as induces him to part with his property, from the apprehension of violence, and in order to save himself from violence; that cannot be applied to the breeches, that was taking privately from his person. The evidence, in point of law, must be applied to the penny; the value is totally immaterial, if the fact is clear; the law that makes a highway robbery a capital offence, does not so much consider the property of the party, which differs in nothing from the common larceny, but the fear and personal danger that he is yut into, and therefore whether a man is robbed of a penny or 500 l. it is, in point of law, precisely the same thing; for one is as much a robbery as the other, provided it is attended with those ingredients, in order to constitute a robbery. But in order to constitute a robbery, there must be force and violence, taking the money by force violently, or there must be an actual putting in fear, and it must be by fear occasioned by some act done by the person who is charged with committing the robbery, that the party is iuduced to part with their money, and if it is by fear that the party is induced to part with their money, it is not necessary that any particular words or threats should be used by the party demanding. If a person was to beg an alms of you, alone in a field, at a suspicious place and time, and then say, Sir, give me a penny, presenting a pistol to your breast, there is no doubt it is a robbery, upon account of the weapon causing immediate fear of death: but it is necessary to constitute a robbery, that the fear that induces the person to part with his property, should be a reasonable fear occasioned by the person who demands it, and not merely a preconceived fear, arising from suspicion in the mind of the person robbed; it is necessary it should not be a groundless and frivolous fear, but such a fear, as, in the expression of law, may naturally arise in the mind of a firm and prudent man; it is not because a man comes up to me in a suspicious place, and asks for money, and I give him a penny, if he does no act that would make a prudent man have any degree of fear, that will not constitute a robbery; and any person being in company with robbers when a robbery is committed, makes them accessary to the fact.</p>

            ; his Majesty thought sit to grant him a pardon, upon condition of his going to the East Indies; he remained in custody for eight months, till June last, when he was conveyed on board a ship at Gravesend, a transport bound for Africa, he was extremely uneasy at been so situated; when he came to Portsmouth he found means to convey intelligence to Lord Hillsborough, and an order was sent for his been put on shore from it.</p>

            'Kenzie, that had the command of the military, had such resentment about it, that he ordered him to be severely whipped; he then sent, and an order was sent again from Lord Hillsborough's, he was taken by military force from that ship, and put into prison at Portsmouth, where he remained till the fifth of October last, without assistance, no provision provided for him; he got supported by friends from London, forced to buy water; had an opportunity, and made his escape from there, and came to London with an intention to put the condition of his pardon, as soon as possible, into execution; came here five weeks ago; three weeks ago taken into custody; has been in custody ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050020"/> since; was only told of coming up last night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. As you state, so much with respect of being put on board an African transport, instead of going on board a ship for the East Indies is a fact, I know it to be true, because I applied to the Secretary of State, to procure his being taken out of that ship; so far I can be evidence. But what account do you give of his escaping from the prison, and not surrendering himself to perform the condition of his pardon.</p>
               <p>Council. All I can say to that is he was so weak, and suffered so much in confinement, willing to enjoy what little liberty he could, but was waiting ready to go to the East Indies with the first soldiers that go in the first ship he could get to go in. - If you will give us the liberty, I can have evidence of all those facts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Your defence, however it may go in extenuation, is certainly to admit, that at the time he was taken, he was at large contrary to his Majesty's pardon.</p>
               <p>Council. I can't controvert that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. The consequence of which is, he remains in the condition he was in then, subject to a respite during his Majesty's pleasure, and now in the condition he was before, to be at the disposal of the King's pleasure, and therefore he shall be committed till his Majesty's pleasure can be known. I shall state the circumstances to the King. Let your state of the case be sent to me that the King's pleasure be known how he shall be disposed of. Let Hill be recommitted under his former sentence, a respite till the King's pleasure be known.</p>
