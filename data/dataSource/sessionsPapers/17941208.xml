               <p>Q. Did he leave these articles in your possession, or did he carry them away with him? - The old gentleman kept them.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. And what was the information you received from your son? - Before my son came home, my daughter asked me to look at it, she said she had never seen a diamond, and she thought it looked common. My son is a painter and glazier, he took his diamond that he cuts the glass with, out of his pocket, and he tried these diamonds with the diamond he had about him.</p>

               <p>Q. And this led to all this further conversation about it? When these notes were brought down, and laid on the table, he took them, in consequence of a previous agreement that he should take them? - Yes, that he should have a hundred pounds till on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. So you gave a full consent for him to have these notes? - I put them on the table, and he took them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080007"/>Q. Providing he left that locket you had no objection to his taking them? - He left that locket till the next morning, till I had my hundred pounds, and a hundred and twenty-five pounds, that I was to receive.</p>

               <p>Q. In August last did your mother come with any persons to your house? - Yes, the 27th of August she came with two persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, was he one of them? - I cannot say; I did not look at them, I remember two men coming, but I don't know who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - About four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. You was alone in the house then? - Yes, no one else.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and your mother when they came into the house? - My mother came down to me and said, Mary come up, for I want you, I went up stairs with my mother, and she desired me to look out a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look out a hundred pounds? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In money or in notes? - Bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the identical notes? - I know to the quantity of notes, but not to the number of them, there were two tens, two twenties, one twenty-five, and one fifteen; six in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these notes? - I gave them to my mother, and she took them down to the men, and put them on the table, for them to take.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what your mother did with them? - I did not, no otherwise than what I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the men take these notes from the table? - No, I did not see either of the men take them off from the table; my mother told me I might hear what they said, and so I did, I stood on the stairs. When my mother went down to take the notes, they desired my mother to shut the parlour door; she said she would not; then they asked my mother if there was any body that would hear their discourse? and my mother said no, nobody in particular; with that they asked my mother what time my father would come home to breakfast; they made my mother promise for nobody to see the note that was in the pocket book, till the next morning; they asked if they could not put it in some place of safety till the next morning, my mother brought the tea chest to put it in, and gave them the key of the tea chest to lock it again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by the note? These bank notes amounting to the hundred pounds, or did you conceive that these notes was any thing else? - I did not know then, my father being in business, and I don't know what it might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that tea chest which your mother brought down, left in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was opened did it contain anything? - Nothing in short, but tea and sugar, except this pocket book, containing the trinket; I did not see it open till after they were gone, I asked my mother to let me see it; and she had said she had promised that she would not, and she was very dubious to forfeit her word; and I asked her to let me have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080008"/>the key of the tea chest, and she agreed to it, and I unlocked the tea chest, and when I see the locket, I said to my mother that I had never saw a diamond, but I thought it looked very common; when my brother came home, he said it was nothing but paste stone; with that I went with my brother to a silversmith, and he said, it was not worth more than five shillings and six-pence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>It was my property that was taken away, I know nothing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of the old gentlewoman at all, I never remember seeing her till I was taken; I had some witnesses to call, I beg your lordship to put off this till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys contended that in this case the prisoner had not been guilty of any felony, because the woman had parted with her property freely, and with her own consent, and she had delivered to the men an hundred pounds, which they were to redeliver to her, on their coming to claim this jewel; and it appeared to him, that the terms on which this money was to be delivered to her was never executed, and she had parted with it voluntarily on her own part.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Perryn observed that she certainly parted with it voluntarily, for the purpose of having it restored to her the next day; but the question was, whether the commencement of this transaction was not when the brown paper was picked up; whether from that period they had an intention to rob her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys observed that the terms on which this was to be returned to her, was on their coming to demand that jewel.</p>
               <p>Mr. justice Grose observed that it appeared to him, she had never parted with the property, but put it as a deposit; and then the question was, whether it was not all a trick to rob her.</p>
               <p>It was finally agreed to refer the case to the opinion of the judges, if the jury should find the prisoner guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. To Smith. Have you made any enquiry with respect to this jewel? - It is valued at five shillings and six-pence, by a silversmith and jeweller that looked at it.</p>

               <p>Court. He is a person to whom this was offered, he has no interest in it; it would be a different case if Mr. Watman was to be called and say it was his hand writing, because he would then be liable to pay five guineas, but you never knew a case of this sort, where a man stands in this way, was never objected to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Robinson. Pray have you indorsed this note? - No, I went to get it changed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to you at any time, and when? - He came on the 10th of September last, between the hours of eleven and twelve; he came to my house and ordered a pot of beer, he asked my wife if she could change him a five guinea note? I was present, I made answer I did not believe there was cash enough, I was not willing for her to change; then my wife looked at it and said it was a very good one, and he said so too; and there were three pints of beer owing for, and a pot to go home, then my wife said, there was cash; and she went and fetched him five guineas, and after that he changed one guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the five guineas? - She gave him the five guineas, and he gave her the note for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the note? - He changed a guinea, and payed me for five pints, and a pot to go home after he was gone out, and a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the note? - I went and took the pot of beer, and I said to my wife, I do not much like the note, but I will take the pot of beer; as soon as I came back from taking the pot of beer to his lodgings, I shewed the note to a neighbour, I cannot read nor write myself, and he said, he did not like it.</p>
               <p>Court. We must not hear what any body else said.</p>
               <p>Witness. I went immediately to the Bank of England; it said four partners<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080010"/>on the bill, but it did not say where they lived, I enquired of one Mr. Pearce, clerk of the bank, and he told me to go to No. 18, Change-alley, to get the money for it, I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you go to there? - I do not recollect the name of the bankers, but it was No. 18, Change-alley, where I went to get the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the note again? - Yes, I should know it again, I marked a cross on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Armstrong. Have you got that note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce it.</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. Tell us whether the note was paid at the bankers? - No, they told me it was a forged one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now look at that note, is that the same note you took of the prisoner? - To the best of my knowledge it is, that is the mark I made, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you swear that is the mark you made? - To the best of my knowledge it is, because I cannot read not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be positive, so as to swear that that is the note you received? - Yes, it is, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Why do you think that is the same note? - By the mark I made.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the same note that you received from your wife the same note that you gave to Armstrong? - It was the very same, I had no other in my possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner at the bar was known to you as a customer to you in the house? - He had lived about five days in the neighbourhood as a ready furnished lodger, he lived at Mr. Dugard's.</p>
               <p>Q. He had used your house? - He has come there of a night to have beer.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you knew the prisoner five days only? - Only five days.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apprehend him? - He was apprehended about an hour after; I went immediately to the bankers.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an inhabitant of Stockton on Tees? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived there any time? - Yes, sixteen years and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a tolerable acquaintance with that place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you in there? - A ship carpenter.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether there is any firm of J. Watman and Co. in that place? - No, there has not been any such during the last sixteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. None, either bankers or of any other description? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any enquiry? - I have, generally through the place; I have examined the cess books there, the poor rates, the highway rates, the land tax; and enquired of the post master, if ever he had any letters or parcels directed to J. Watman and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire at the inns there? - No, not at the inns; I got the books of the poor rates from the principal inn, the landlord of the principal inn who collected the poor rates last year.</p>
               <p>Q. With that assistance besides your own knowledge, you have not been able to find such a person? - No, no such a person.</p>
               <p>Q. Can such a house exist without your knowing it? - No, I should think not.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever see the house tax books? - Yes, the house tax and land tax too.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Robinson. Did not the prisoner at the time you took him desire of you, that he might go back to his own lodgings, for that the man that he received the note from was there? - He was in his own house when I took him; he said there was a man, a farmer, that was a witness of his taking of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you did not permit him to go back? - Not at all, we took him to Mr. Armstrong.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he desire to be taken back to his house on that account, to find the man? - No, he did not say so, he said there was a farmer, one Jones, that was a witness of his taking it, who was in the house when he was took, and his wife.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Have you any questions to ask the witness?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to my counsel. I frequently folicited my prosecutor either to go back, or to go in the public house, to settle my business; I told him the person was at my house, which I had the bill of, he did not wish to go in any public house; but still persevered with me to go forward, till we came to the public house next the office; my prosecutor came afterwards to me at the New Prison, and told me he wished he had come to me himself, and not have brought any officer along with him, then the business would have been settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Robinson. Did you ever go to him and tell him that? - I went into the prison about a man that stole my pots and I happened to see this prisoner there, and I told him that I wished the affair had not happened in my hands, because I could very ill spare the money, I wish it had not happened on me.</p>
               <p>Jury. The signature of this note appears to be engraved, and not wrote, nor on a stamp, I should never have taken it if it was offered to me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080013"/>Mr. Const. Armstrong has said he took some notes from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. You ought to know, and you must know, that you ought to speak out, I did not hear one word of what you mentioned about any other note.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I found this Birmingham one for ten guineas, a duplicate, and a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no more notes than that? - No, I found two pounds eight shillings in money, which I was desired to keep by the magistrate, the prisoner asked for it, and the magistrate ordered me to keep it till I came to court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say than what I have asserted, I had no knowledge of the bill being any thing but upright and just, and as such I got it discounted with this man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how he came in possession of the note? - Yes, it was on the 10th of September, about twelve o'clock Mr. Harcock came to be measured for a waistcoat, by Mr. Ball, I lived with Mr. Ball at that time as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the business that Ball was in? - He is a <rs id="t17941208-3-deflabel19" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

Immediately after Mr. Ball had taken measure of Mr. Harcock, a person of the name of Warrell came up, and said, he had come up to look at some buttons that he had got to dispose of, he immediately shewed him them, after he had shewed them, he asked him what they were to be? Mr. Ball told him two pounds thirteen shillings, there was six gross for the coat, and three gross for the breast, that is for the waistcoat; Mr. Ball said, as he took them altogether, he should have them for that; Mr. Warrell immediately gave him a bill of exchange that had got so long to run, so many days to run, what the time was I cannot exactly tell; Mr. Ball said, he could not get that cashed; Mr. Warrel I immediately took that up as Mr. Ball could not give cash for that, he took and put the bill in his pocket, and laid down a five guinea note immediately on demand, the prisoner told him he could not give cash for it, but he would go out and see if he could get it changed or not, and to the best of my knowledge he was gone a quarter of an hour, and returned back again, when he returned back, he told Mr. Warrell he had got the bill discounted, and he gave him the balance due, which was two guineas in gold, and ten shillings in silver; Mr. Harcock and Mr. Warrell and the prisoner at the bar drank together, out of a pot of porter; I went down stairs, and in the course of half an hour the prisoner at the bar came down to call me up, when he came down, the officer and the prosecutor took Mr. Ball into custody, and took him away; I ran up stairs immediately to Mr. Warrell, and I said to him, there is some dispute about that note; he said, what dispute, I know better, I know that is a very good one; he took the buttons and put them in a pocket handkerchief, and walked down stairs, and said, he would go and seek after him, and I did not see any thing more of him. The gentleman who was with the officer that took Mr. Ball, came to me afterwards, and I took him to the house where I have heard Mr. Warrell say he used to frequent; the officer came back and fetched me, and I took him to where Mr. Ball's boxes were; afterwards I took him to the house that I heard this old man say that he frequently, to see if I could find him, this Mr. Warrell, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080014"/>a house in Tash-court, the number I don't justly know, when we were there the people told us that they expected him home at three o'clock to dinner; accordingly we waited till that time, and he did not come home, and he has not returned there any more.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. That was on the 19th of February? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When did you see these notes for the last time? - They were first shewn to me at the justice's, in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. You put these in the letters; where did you get these bank post bills from? - They were brought to us that morning from the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You got these notes when you attended at the public office? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was some where about the 26th of September? - Yes, somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. And you put them, if these are the notes, inclosed in a letter the 19th of February? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is seven months before you received these at the public office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from the 19th of February to the 20th of September, you never set eyes on them again? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. At the time of this robbery being committed, by whom at all did you hear of it? - About two days afterwards Messrs. Davis sent us a letter, and by that we were informed that these post bills were not arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of that? - We sent to the bank to stop the payment of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course when you went to the bank to stop the payment of them, you communicated to the bank the number of the notes? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And that within two days, you had enclosed them in this manner? - Within two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time you enclosed these five bank post bills, take any memorandum of the number of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that book? - At Messrs. Gostings.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must go and fetch it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Certainly the post office ought to be better prepared than this.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Where do you get the Reading bag from? - From a window; the coach draws up close to a window there, within five yards, and I left the Reading bag there, and took the London bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the Reading bag from? - Out of the mail box, as I was going along; as soon as I had taken in the London and Reading bag, I told Mr. Thomas he might ride again a few miles in my situation; I left these small bags at Reading, which I got from the towns, as I came along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deposit these bags you had from Reading in your box? - Yes, I did. At Reading I told Mr. Thomas he might ride a few miles in my situation again, he rode till he came to Hare Hatch, seven miles.</p>

               <p>Q. As I understand you, it was by his particular desire that you took the Tewksbury note in addition? - It was.</p>

He said he received it on Monday evening of a person who was a stranger to him, and who made use of the name of a neighbour of his, of, I think, the name of Wordman; he said he gave cash for it, that in a few minutes the same man came in again and asked for change for other bank notes, which he likewise gave him; that in a few minutes more the same man returned again with a similar request, and he changed those that he brought the third time; that he came the fourth time with the same request with others, and that he complied with that request also; that he came a fifth, and that he believed he came a sixth time with a similar request, that he gave him cash in the whole to the amount of one hundred pounds, or upwards, he believed. I then told him it was my duty to take him to the public office in Bow-street; I intreated a friend of his to go there with us, who was a Mr. Seger, a friend of his; he came in while I was in his house, and I requested him to accompany him to Bow-street, which he did, and he underwent an examination.</p>
               <p>Q. He went with you readily? - Very ready, not the least hesitation about it.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you got the examination that was taken before the magistrate? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner, as to the length of time he had the notes, which were deposited with the Bankers, in his possession? - Those whom he described to have received from a person, he described to have received on the Monday before the conversation. He also said that several of the notes, which he paid into Dorsets, the banker's, he had had by him some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not describe more particularly what he meant by some time before? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before whom was he examined? - Mr. Addington.</p>
               <p>Q. (Producing a paper) Are those minutes, minutes that were taken down at the time? - They are the minutes that I took down at the time, by the direction of the magistrate, from his own mouth; at first when it was read over to him, he said, it was true, at the second examination he said, that that observation what he said before of his being at Croydon was not true; upon which Mr. Addington discontinued reading it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not in any stage of the proceeding any examination signed formally by the magistrate? - None, there was no examination but this paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys objected to this being received as evidence, because neither the prisoner nor the magistrate had signed it, said it was not parrallel with Lamb's case in the Borough, because there, though the magistrate did not sign, the prisoner signed it.</p>
               <p>Court. I see no doubt on it being evidence, the same as he might have spoken to any other man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In Lamb's case the magistrate had it taken down, and afterwards the prisoner refused to sign it.</p>
               <p>Court. In Lamb's case the court said, that if this is not evidence, the court must adopt this monstrous proposition, that whatever the prisoner says, when not before the magistrate, depending on the precarious memory of the thief-takers should be evidence against him, but the moment he gets before the magistrate it is not evidence, where certainly it ought to have the most weight, because it is given with all the solemnity possible.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080044"/>Mr. Garrow. Before we read it we will learn the stage of transaction it was taken in. The prisoner was examined in the forenoon before Mr. Addington? - It was at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time what you have delivered to paper, was delivered by the mouth of the prisoner himself? - It was, before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he withdrew was that paper read over to him. - It was, by Mr. Addington</p>
               <p>Q. Deliberately? - Deliberately.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say of its contents? - He admitted it to be true.</p>
               <p>Q. After an interval of some hours he was re examined? - In the evening. Then the magistrate proposed to read it again, and desired he would mention if it was incorrect in any respect, or if it wanted any alteration or correction.</p>
               <p>Q. That, I conclude, was with a view to be signed by him if he had chose it? - I suppose so. The magistrate began to read it. When the magistrate read about six lines of it, he said, that what he had related was not true, for that he had not been at Croydon, as was mentioned in his examination.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the false fact that he represented to state in that paper on his first examination, what was done on that? - He said also that he was at Bristol, in the mail coach, on Thursday preceding that day of the week; on that Mr. Addington said he should not proceed further on reading this examination as it was untrue in its onset. I made a memorandum on the back of the paper, for my better recollection of the circumstance.</p>

               <p>Q. In the forenoon of that Thursday had there been any charge whether the prisoner had been at Bristol? - The Thursday before I think there was no positive charge, but he was desired to speak in the forenoon, where he was on Thursday and Friday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he disclosed that he had been at Bristol? - No, he did not, he was questioned where he was on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, 2d, 3d, and 4th, of November, with a view -</p>
               <p>Q. So that in the forenoon he had been questioned where he had been those days? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the forenoon he had not represented that he had been at Bristol those days? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent where he had been? - He said he had been at Croydon Fair on Thursday.(Read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

            , Esq. one of his Majesty's justices of the peace for the said country, this 9th of October 1794, who says, That he left his house about seven o'clock on Thursday evening last, and went to Charing Cross, where the Croydon coach goes from; that he went on the top of the Croydon coach, and arrived at Croydon between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, was set down in the street, was booted; that he went into the fair, and continued there till the morning, and did not go to bed; continued at Croydon till about eight o'clock on Friday night, and not being able to get a coach, walked the whole way to town; stopped at a public house at Stretham, at about ten o'clock, where he drank a pint of beer, and arrived in London about twelve o'clock, and went directly home, and let himself in with the key of the street door, which he had with him, and went directly to bed; saw no person in the house, arose a little before seven the next morning, just as the boys were opening the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080045"/>shop; one of Sander's men, the hair dresser, came and dressed him by half after seven o'clock; staid at home the greatest part of the day, and also the next day, Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, from No. 3, Duke's-court, Bow-street and their daughter dined with him; was at home almost the whole day on Monday; about half past six on Monday evening last, a person, a stranger to him, came to his house and asked him if he could oblige Mr. and Mrs. Wigman with cash for a ten pound bank note? he gave the man cash for it; he went away and in less than ten minutes came again, and said, he saw that he had plenty of cash, and desired cash for another ten pound bank note, which he gave him; the man went away, and came again in ten minutes, and asked for change for another bank note, does not know what was the sum, but gave him cash for it; the man went away, and came again in a very few minutes and brought more notes, which he changed by giving cash; thinks the man came a sixth time, and he gave him cash for other notes; the whole amount of the cash, that the examinant gave to the man, was upwards of a hundred pounds. The man with whom the examinant had the above transactions was a tall thin man, middle aged, his hair tied behind, dark colour, wore a black coat and waistcoat, round hat; saw him on Tuesday morning pass by, says, he passed also Mr. Wigman's house, but he did not go in there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He said that what you had taken down about Croydon was not true, and he refused to sign it? - He was not asked to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the notes that were at the bankers, Dorset's, he said that some of them he had had by him some considerable time? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q.There was a considerable number of notes besides those that you call in question? - It does appear so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys here proposed three objections upon which this case was incompetent to go to a jury. First, that they had not proved any letter was taken from the mail in the country of Middlesex, as required by the statute. Second, That the indictment had not stated the letter so directed as proved; namely, stealing it to be directed to

               <p>Mr. Knapp spoke on the same side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Fielding, and Russell answered the arguments; and Mr. Knowlys replied.</p>
               <p>And the court agreed to take the opinion of the jury as to the fact; and leave the point of law to the opinion of the twelve judges, should the jury find the prisoner guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called thirteen witnesses who gave him an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had not known him before.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you see him? - There was one that he called Mr. Clark with him, and there was another man came in that said he was a country man, and said he came from coventry, an ancient man, he had had a grandmother died and left him eighteen hundred pounds; and this countryman he wanted to be introduced to the people, and he said, gentlemen, I hope I have not offended you; he called for some rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there before he came in? - Me and this man, and Clarke. And after he had been in a little while, he said, you are a parcel of ignorant fellows, you have no money, I came to sport money among you, I came to London to spend money, I bet you fifty pounds that you altogether cannot produce four hundred pounds in three hours; one of the gentlemen said, I can produce upwards of two hundred pounds myself; and another man, who's name was Mills, said, he could produce near two hundred pounds; and he asked me what I could produce? I said, I have no money at all, only thirteen or fourteen guineas; well, says he, fetch it and we can make it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was another person in the room of the name of Mills? - Yes. Says he, Mills, you shall have the third of that fifty pounds, the man has too much money. I went to Ratcliffe-cross where I lived, I went on foot, and came back in a coach and this Clarke he went ready to meet me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home what did you do? - My money was in a purse, I put it in my pocket and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back who paid for the coach? - I paid for it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back who did you find there? - I found these three men. Clarke was waiting there for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these three gentlemen; was the prisoner one? - That he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the country gentleman one of the others? - Yes, and Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - I went in and put the money on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing at the time? - I went out to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you put it there for? - Not for their use, for the account of getting part of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Pretty good interest. When you put it on the table did you say any thing? - I said there is the money I went for; I went to go down stairs to make water, Mills followed me down, and said, come over along with me to my counting house, and we will be back in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to go to his counting house for? - To give directions to his clerks. I went with him to the corner of the street, and then he said, you had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080047"/>better go back to the gentlemen, I will be back with you in five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you left in the room? - The prisoner and Clarke; when I went back they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You found all the money there again? - No money, they took care to take the money with them that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see your money again? - Never a farthing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the landlord of the house this? - I told the landlord what happened, and he seemed to be sorry.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw the prisoner at the bar again? - Six or seven months it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you gave that information to the officer about it? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go, to Worship-street? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that information after six or seven months the prisoner was apprehended? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, or had you any doubt when he was apprehended, that he was one of the three men? - I was certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt now? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any intention of parting with your money, unless for the share of this fifty pounds? - I thought a trifle of that money would be a kind of service to me, an old man and my wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You never saw the prisoner at the bar till six or seven months after the wrong was done you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you six on that gentleman first of all, that he was the man? - A man may be mistaken, I thought he had a great likeness of the man, it is a particular thing, and I have not swore positive to any man.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came here to be asked who has done you that injury, you pointed to that man? - I am an old man, upwards of seventy years of age, I would not deprive him nor any soul of any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you do not wish to do any thing that was wrong.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He wanted to swear to the person that belonged to the office where I was committed from.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is the very man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You know any body may be mistaken; did not you say first of all at the office that some other man had done you the wrong? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you give information soon after this happened to the office? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. WEST sworn.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. What day was he robbed? - On Thursday, the 6th of November last, about three o'clock in the afternoon; they came in the shop and desired to look at some silk handkerchiefs, both the prisoners, in company with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it applied to you to look at the handkerchiefs? - I rather think it was the woman at the bar, but they all seemed to speak at once, but it was particularly the woman.</p>

On their desiring to look at some silk handkerchiefs, a bundle was shewn to them by themselves; they looked at them and tumbled them about, in such a manner that gave me an idea they had an intent to steal, particularly the prisoner's wife; Kelly, while his wife was looking over the handkerchiefs, attempted to pull something from over the counter, which strongly strengthened my suspicion; this attempt was made several times; at last I thought I see something taken from the counter on which I immediately swept the whole of the handkerchiefs off from the counter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080051"/>determined to shew them no more; they desired to see more, but I would not shew them any more; whereupon they quitted the shop; Mr. Kelly was the last person that left the shop, whom I seized and brought back, and afterwards the woman, his <rs id="t17941208-9-deflabel51" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Q. Was she out of sight? - No. On seizing her as she walked a few paces back she dropped the handkerchiefs; the goods I have with me, a quantity of handkerchiefs containing six dozen; the stockings she did not drop, she gave me those.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she drop these cotton handkerchiefs, from her petticoats or from where? - From under her cloak. As she was coming along, before she returned to the house again, delivered to me a paper of stockings of her own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these handkerchiefs? - Sixteen shillings and six-pence; it is stated in the indictment sixteen shillings, they cost that money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had they cost that? - I cannot exactly say; the stockings are likewise valued at eleven shillings in the indictment, but cost eleven shillings and six-pence.</p>

When the prosecutor said that I had something that was not my property, I really did not know what he meant; he gave me in charge to the man, and stopped the woman, on whom he found what was mentioned in the indictment; but nothing was found on me; Johnson walked away, although close to the woman when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080052"/>prosecutor took her, and my consternation was such that I really did not know what I said or did; but, as I said before, nothing was found in my possession; but however, I was, with the woman taken before a magistrate and committed for trial. I have wrote to my brother now in the College in Dublin, that I was in trouble; he has wrote me an answer to know what my motives were for going to England, and desires me to send him the abode of my prosecutor, in order that he may write to some of his fellow students to settle it for me.

               <p>Q. Where was this money that you found about her? - I believe it was in her hand first, but she turned about and put it in her mouth, all but two guineas, which was found afterwards; I have kept it ever since, except one guinea, because the man having nothing to maintain him in the mean time, that I gave to Gibbs.(Produces the money.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was sent for that night unto a poor woman that was in labour; I went and staid till it was all over, and coming home about one o'clock that night, I drank rather free that night, and I met with the watchman, and he took me to the Jolly Sailors, and I paid him for a pot of hot, to treat him, and I had fourteen guineas in my pocket, and I took out my money and shewed him, and he wanted me to go with him in his box; and he took my pocket off, and wanted the money out of my hand, and I would not give it to him, and he called for another watchman, and he wanted to take it out of my hand; and when I came to my second hearing, the man said, if I would give him the thirteen guineas up he would let me go; I said I would not let my money go, I would suffer all the laws in England first. Ten guineas my brother sent me from Berwick on Tweed, and the rest I saved up myself, by hard work, to bind my child to a trade; my brother has been a very good friend to me ever since my husband died.</p>
               <p>Court. You are charged with a very capital offence, it is very material for your brother to be here, where is your brother? He is at Berwick on Tweed.</p>

Please you, my lord, to ask him how long he left Mary Robins that was discharged from this place in September Sessions, that was the woman that was with him at the watch-house on Sunday, and Mr. Thomas let me go home on Sunday evening myself, and told me to come on Monday morning, at ten o'clock, and I went.</p>
               <p>Court to Thomas. Did you let this woman go home? - I did, Sunday morning, I took her to the watch-house and locked her up in the watch-house till ten o'clock that morning, and then took her to the Virginia Planter, and begged of the landlord to take care of her; at ten o'clock I went to fetch her, I locked her up again till Sunday night, and then she gave account of herself; she was not charged with any felony at this time, she told me a good story, and where she lived; I said, I do not want to confine you if you will come to the justice's the next morning and prove your property, you shall have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come to the justice's the next morning? - She did.</p>

I pulled my arm from him, and he catched hold of me, this handkerchief was coming off the counter with my cloak, and he said I meant to steal the handkerchief; I had not a ha'pworth with me in the world, but three shillings and three halfpence, I was just as you see me now, gentlemen.</p>

               <p>Q. In November last did you lose any part of your property? - All, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose a silver watch, a black silk petticoat, one other silk gown, and two cotton gowns? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you express what was the value of these things altogether? What was the value of the watch? - Two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the silk gown? - Eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the petticoat-Eight shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of the two cotton gowns? - One pound two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you lose any money? - Two pounds two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What day in November was this? - The third of November, I do not know the time I lost the two guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, was she in your service? - She came to take a lodging of me for sixweeks, she said she was waiting for a gentleman's family coming to town.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080057"/>Q. How long had she lodged with you? - Just the five weeks, and my being a widow with two children, I thought it would be helpful, as I had two beds.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she leave your lodging? - She left it on Monday, and Tuesday the six weeks was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive that any of the things were taken from you previous to the time she left your house? - I perceived the two guineas were gone when she had been there three weeks, I went and unlocked my great chest and found the money gone, she talked so fair I could not think it was her, and so I let it pass; three weeks afterwards she left my place, she said the family were come to town, as she told me, and she took me to the place with her in Finsbury square, No. 8. When I came home on the Monday on which she went, from my business, about one o'clock, she said she had got a note from the family in Finsbury square, and asked me to take a walk with her to the place; and when she came to the place she said, Mrs. C a e, you will excuse me asking you in, because I know nobody here but the cook, and she went down the airy, and shut the door after her, and I came home; and my little girl happened to go to my drawer for something and saw my watch was gone, then I went to my padlock chest, and unlocked that, it unlocked very easy, it used to go very hard. After I found my things were all gone, I went after her to Finsbury-square, and this housekeeper said, she came in there with an excuse, and they turned her out, they thought she was a thief. And then I went to Worship street, and there I spoke to one Mr. Blackiter, and he knew the woman very well, and said, she came to Newgate every day, to her sister, and she was taken there the Friday after; she stayed away from Monday till Friday before she went to her sister in Newgate-street; I did not know that she had a sister any where till Mr. Blackiter told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she stopped? - At Newgate, as she was going to Newgate to see her sister, her sister was tried last Sessions, and transported.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover where she had lived after she had quitted your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her searched? or have you found any property in her possession? - No, she pawned it all, she told me she would tell me where it was if I would not take her to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the Office she confessed to the taking of the things? - No, as she was going to prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you previous to the time promise to shew her any favour? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you threaten her at all? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she confess? - She confessed she pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that confession voluntary? - It was. She confessed them all, and what pawnbrokers they were at.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you discover where they were? - I found one gown at one of the pawnbrokers before I found her, in Newgate-street, at one Mr. Fleming's, he had one cotton gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing in regard to the two guineas? - No, in my flurry I did not say any thing to her of the two guineas, I hardly knew at first what I lost, and when I went to make my bed that she slept in, I found she had taken a good many of my feathers out of the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She shewed me every favour, and said, she would not put me in prison if I would but confess; there it one pound nine shillings taken away from me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you say you would not prosecute? or that you would not bring her to justice, if she would confess? - I did not, she used to pity me, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080058"/>she would not let any body rob me, and yet was robbing me herself. She wondered how I went through my work to maintain my children, I lived so low.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 1st of this month did you lose any part of your property? - Yes; a plow heel and a small wheel that we call a windlass wheel.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner at the bar, previous to the time of losing this property? - I had employed his master, he is <rs id="t17941208-13-deflabel78" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

               <p>Q. In that employment, I suppose the prisoner at the bar had access to your house? - To the shop where the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>Q. What ground or foundation have you to suspect the things were taken by the prisoner? - They were taken on him. Mr. Jostling, belonging to the Lord Mayor's court, sent for me, and there it was proved that he had these things in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not know any thing of your own knowledge? - No, I do not. At the same time, as he is not in the habit of doing these things, I beg leave to recommend him to mercy; I only wish to make him a little example.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. These are two pieces of iron that, I believe, you would not swear to them? - I can bring the patterns; I could swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not his master bail for him? He gave you notice for trial on Wednesday, to-morrow. - I was not at home when the notice came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say it would be more convenient for you to have it brought on to day than to-morrow? - I don't recollect; I don't know that I did or I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know in your own mind the man's surrendering to day, is a day before the notice? - I consented so far as this, as my brother or whoever it was that took the notice, told them it would be more agreeable, because I had so many men under me.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of the city; I stopped the prisoner, on Wednesday, the 1st of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by virtue of any warrant? - It was between the hours of five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080060"/>and six; I was coming across Smithfield, and the lad was coming towards Smithfield, I stopped him, and he seemed very flurried.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no warrant? - No, I stopped him on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned that suspicion? - Seeing him have something heavy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you on an enquiry of him, of them things what he had in his possession? What did he tell you? - He told me it was iron; I told him the magistrate had given me orders to stop every person, at night, with iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him? - I did, at the Compter I told him it would be better for him to tell the truth; I never thought it would come here, I thought he would be convicted under the act of parliament. When I got him and the iron to the Compter I sent to Mr. Bradley, the prosecutor, he came over, and then the nephew claimed the iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the iron? - I have had it in my possession ever since,(produces the iron) it is in the same state as when I took it on the prisoner. It is cast iron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe he was in the road (the place where he walked) to his master's house?</p>
               <p>Q. To Bradley. What marks do you usually put on your property in iron? - We do not mark them; but the patterns that we mould them in is generally sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, a plow heel and windlass wheel, they are common to every person in that trade? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very difficult matter for any person to swear to any loose piece of these articles, that they shall be his property? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you look at these articles, and tell me whether you can positively swear that these were your property? - These are the same that were found in the basket.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that these are your's? - No, I will not venture to swear.</p>

               <p>(Produces the articles) I produce the things; they have been in my custody ever since the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were these things delivered to you? - I was sent for November 26, about the hour of nine in the morning, and when I came to the prosecutors house, he told me he had been robbed of them two different articles; he gave me charge of his porter for robbing of him; as such I conveyed him to the magistrate, and he had a hearing. The things were given to me in Mr. Hoffstetter's house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the things I delivered to Pinner; they have no mark on them, but the remaining part is in our possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me whether you had not entrusted the prisoner at the bar with the delivery of these things, to carry home to some customer? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? Did he give any account how he became possessed of them, and for what purpose? - He said he found them in the warehouse, and thought they were of no use.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In the first place, Mr. Hoffstetter, how lately had you seen these arms before? - They might be, perhaps, six months in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any other person besides the prisoner at the bar had taken them out, and then they had got in the prisoner at the bar's possession, you would not have known any thing at all about it? These arms that I see they would suit any other commodity of the same sort, if they fitted? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you do not mean to state that there is any particular mark about this, peculiar to the thing itself? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the same commodity in other peoples possession, that would fit your's, you would equally swear to as these? - It might happen so.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you mean is this, that you have such a commodity, which these things will correspond with, and which any other thing of a like specie would correspond with? - No doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 26th, I was in the warehouse, in the morning, and I found these things up stairs; I did not know what they were, and I put them in my pocket in order to look at them, and I did not know what they were, and he supposed I was thief, and which I did not like, so I offered to run when he stopped me. I was a weekly porter; I lived almost five years with my master.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it you lost? - Forty pounds weight of rags.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before? - I have seen him previous to the time; there is a public house opposite my warehouse; I saw him carry a bag out, and knowing him not employed in my warehouse, I suspected that he might have taken them; I have not indicted him on that fact, that led me only to the suspicion. The warehouses that I occupy, you will understand, are two ground floors; my porter was concerned with this man, but the constable let my porter escape. My porter came in the morning and opened the warehouses; during the time he was there the prisoner came and looked in the passage for the porter, and not finding him there, he went in the public house to wait for him. My porter came out of the privy, and went into the public house to him; they both came to the warehouse together, and the porter came out to the door, and looked to see if the way was clear, and the prisoner came out with the linen rags, and I followed him, and took him in Philip-lane, and brought him back, and gave charge of him and the porter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you buy rags of those that collect them? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you or your porter had bought rags of this man before? - I do not know; he could not on that morning; but it is not impossible but he might.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner when he first came? - I see him when he first came to the door, and I never quitted my station till I sent my man to the counting house.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you not any transactions with him before? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You know him you say? - Yes, I had seen him come backwards and forwards to the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at any time, offered you any rags? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>Q. Was a bag of rags in his possession at any time? - The rags were in the scale in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Who produces them in the court? - I produce them in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive them? - These rags were carried to the Mansion House, and there a seal was put on the bag; from thence they were carried and left at Mr. Ford's house; they were brought from the prosecutor's house yesterday to the sessions house here, and then they were delivered to me, and have been in my custody from that time till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they are the bag of rags for which the prisoner is indicted for stealing? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can tell you why I put them in the scale, I thought it was proper to know what weight they were, and give the constable an account.</p>
               <p>Q. On the point of identifying them, it is impossible, otherwise than the man went in with an empty bag. Had you the possession of such a bag of rags the preceding night? - They were in a loose package; these had been packed by my porter and the present prisoner. The prisoner told me I could not identify<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080063"/>rags; that was his presumption on this business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing on the day he was taken up with the rags? - Yes, I saw him come out of Mr. Ford's house, and saw Mr. Ford's porter follow him and bring them out.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your lodging ever robbed at any time? - Never robbed before; he lived in his lodgings eight weeks; a friend that he lodged with before came and told me that I had a right to examine his lodgings once a week, and I went up and examined his lodgings, and took a friend with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he left your lodgings at this time? - No, he had not, he never paid me a farthing rent, and bid me defiance of quitting my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that went up with you? - One Edwards, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get into his room? - I opened the door, and went in, I throwed up the quilt from the bed, and missed my sheets, blankets and pillow, and window curtain and a bed curtain.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that you did this? - On Saturday, the 23d of November; he had promised me time after time to give me some money, he told me he would bring it me in three hours, that was ten o'clock; he came home between seven and eight, and he told me he should bring a bill; I told him if it was a good one perhaps I should get a friend to cash it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and him, about these things? - No, he brought me the note.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080064"/>Q. Did any thing pass about the furniture? - No conversation at all; he came home about eight o'clock, and presented a note, supposed not to be worth any thing; he came home between seven and eight o'clock; I told him I would take an hour to consider of it, in the mean time I sent for a constable, and had him taken into custody. It was a twelve guinea note, not worth any thing; he had lived on my property, and never paid me a farthing rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Now have you ever found any of this property that was missing? - They were all found at the pawnbroker's the Saturday evening; I have seen them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So this man had lodged with you there eight weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he had not paid you any money at all? - He had not, he bid me defiance, and my husband was sick, and died at the same time, my husband died the 3d of October, but he has never paid any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. From which of course made you think very hardly of him, not having paid you any rent; you taxed him with it? - I certainly asked him a great many times; by my own distress I wanted money.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether he did not present you down a note that was to pay his rent? - He meant to pay a part of it, as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. He came home on this Saturday? - He did, with this bad note, and presented it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. So that after the charge you had charged against him, he comes home to his own lodging again? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. I fancy if you had been paid your rent we should not have heard of this prosecution? - I scorn to do any thing but what is just; and he impudently came down into my shop between twelve and one o'clock, and says, very impudently, it is me, I want a candie; I was not safe with him in my house.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Look at that sheet, and see if that sheet is your's? - I know this to be mine, it has not been joined, nor yet marked, but I know it to be my sheet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You continued to know it to be your sheet; and you can give no reason at all why you know it? - I know it to be my sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would continue to say so till twelve o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Has there been any stain on it, or any thing that you know it by? - I do not pretend to say there is any stain upon it, but I have cloth at home that will match it, it is my sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told the jury just now that there is no stain, that there is no mark, that there is no reason whatever that you can fix on it to be your property, only it is like the linen that you have now at home; may not another person have the same quality, of the same degree of fineness? - It is my sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see now any of the same quality of linen belonging to other persons, in other persons houses? - I have not examined other peoples houses.</p>

               <p>Q. You must give the jury and my lord some satisfactory answer how you know it; I ask you again how you know it to be your sheet? you must give the jury and my lord some satisfactory answer how you know it? - I never examined so closely.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy it? how long have you had it? - I cannot particularly say, it has never been mended, it has wore a good while, I have had it, I suppose, as much as two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When you bought it, it may be you saw a great deal of linen of the same quality in the shop? - I do not pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that at the time you bought this linen, there was no more of the same quality as that, that you bought at the shop? - I came here to swear to my sheet, I would be sorry to swear to any thing that is not just.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you pretend to swear that your next door neighbour, and all those persons with whom you are not acquainted, may not have linen for sheets exactly of the same quality to that which you are now swearing to? why the sheet sticks close to you, and you to the sheet? Will you take on yourself to swear that your neighbour, or other persons may not have linen of the same quality as you are swearing to? - I have never nothing to do with my neighbours, I have always enough to do at home; I will not swear. I have nothing at all to do with my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear by any mark, or any reason whatever? - I will not swear by any mark or stain, or any thing of the sort, but I know it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had this sheet amongst a deal of linen of the same quality, could you have picked it out as your sheet? - I have one to fellow it at home.</p>
               <p>Court to Morrett. How came your master not to attend here? - Because he was not bound over.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the evening? - Between the hours of five and six o'clock; I went up the inn, the Spread Eagle yard, and left a young man, the ostler, with the coach to mind it while I went up the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the coach? - In Gracechurch-street, close to the Spread Eagle gateway, I went up in the yard, and returned back again to my coach, in the mean time, I was putting the reins right in my hand, I had got on the box, while I was putting my reins to rights my coat was drawn from out of the boot, I laid it at the top.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it there? - When I went from the coach into the yard, up to the office. When I was going to draw my horses off the pavement, a man hallooed out, you are robbed, stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss it before that? - No, I immediately jumped off my box on the right hand side, on the pavement, and went round to the hind part of my coach and saw the prisoner at the bar with the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he the coat? - He had the coat rather hanging on his arm, and holding it in his hand and on his arm, it being a large coat, I could not leave my coach, and the people running I lost sight of him; my ostler he jumped off the other side, and ran after him, and the man that hallooed out stop thief pursued him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they both ask? - I cannot positively say that they both asked; they came in together and conversed together; they asked one anothers opinions on the prints, and they fixed on one which we could not agree for the price of. The prisoners at the bar and me. I shewed them several others and they did not like any of these others; and Bailey replied she would give me two shillings a yard for ten yards, while I was cutting it off and folding it up, Vaughan said that they wanted some cloth, but they had not got the money, and they would come in the afternoon; while I was folding it up I perceived that Vaughan had something very large under her gown, which raised my suspicion, and I fixed my eyes very stedfast on her, Bailey stepped in between us and asked what was most proper for a lining, I recommended her a lining, she desired me to cut her off a yard, which altogether came to one guinea. Vaughan turned about and went towards the door, and Bailey was seeking for a guinea, to pay for the gown; Vaughan got to the door before Bailey laid down the guinea, I immediately gave Mrs. Clarke the guinea, and ran down to the door to apprehend Vaughan, I apprehended her at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mrs. Clarke, the wife of Mr. Clarke? - Yes. I said to Mrs. Vaughan, ma'am, I want what you have got, from under your gown; I catched hold of her by the arm, and took up her gown, and found these shawls under it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there-Eight; the constable will produce another.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a cloak on? - I cannot positively say; her gown was lapped over before her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the shawls? - I took them from her, and brought her and them into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they cotton? - Yes. She immediately begged of me to shew her all the mercy I possibly could, and let her go, she would leave the gown that her and her sister bought, or do any thing, if I would let her go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make use of the word her sister? - No, I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state accurately as to the expression? did she say the gown they had bought, or did she say the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080069"/>gown she had bought? - She said the gown we have bought; that is exactly the expression, and she said, I will give you any thing, only let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept those shawls from that time to this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you separated them from the other goods? - Yes; these shawls were my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were on the counter at the time? - They were laying on the counter, and I saw them during the time the prisoners were there, under some prints that I were shewing to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the other shawl? - I cannot positively say when I see the other shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that shawl after it was missing? Did you see the constable take it from either of them? - I did not; I saw it first about two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you identify that to be your master's? - I cannot say this is ours, because it hath not our private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there such a shawl on the counter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many were missing? - It is impossible out of the quantity of shawls we have, that I cannot tell how many we have got.</p>
               <p>Q. What may the eight be worth? - About thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they cost apiece? - Three shillings and eleven pence apiece.</p>
               <p>Q. They were fit for sale? - Perfectly to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other customers in the shop? - Several.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of your own people that belonged to the shop were in the shop? - Mrs. Clarke was there; I believe there were about six or seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they here either of them? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I know very well you are very correct, and you always give very correct accounts of what passes wherever you go. I take it for granted that you gave the same account to the magistrate as you do now; you omitted no circumstance that is material? - I have told the matter as it passed now.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body confessed that they took it and desired you would forgive them, you would not forget that? - Yes, I might forget that; I never said any thing of the kind to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was sworn at the magistrate's to tell him the whole truth? - Yes, I was. I did not consider that as material at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to state it now? - I gave it just now as it stands; you desired me to repeat word for word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I ask you what she said about this? - You asked me what expressions.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant to say every thing that was material before the magistrate, and yet you left out this circumstance? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, your master was there, I suppose? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mistress was there? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there at that counter? - There might, perhaps, be one or two besides myself.</p>
               <p>Q. As to Mrs. Bailey she said nothing I see, to you; but she bargained for the gown to the amount of a whole guinea, and that she paid for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether a gown of that price was about as much as you expect a person of her appearance to bargain and pay for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing in her appearance? - Nothing except her stepping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080070"/>in between Vaughan and me, to screen Vaughan, as I supposed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do there? - She asked my opinion about a lining.</p>
               <p>Q. Which lining she purchased and paid for? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet when these people are trying for their lives, when she came in and bargained for a thing, and bought it, you say, that you believe she came in to screen Vaughan? - She took it on my recommendation I believe more than any thing else, I recommended a brown holland.</p>
               <p>Q. After she bought that gown did you think a body lining was not a little necessary? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was necessary and she came in and asked for one? - It was not necessary for her to say she had got no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that she had got no money? - She coincided with what Vaughan said.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did Bailey ever say that she had got no money? - She did not make use of those expressions.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the contrary did not she produce her money and pay for the gown? - I did not say contrary to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did she not bargain for the gown and pay for it? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is all that Bailey did? - That is not, when Vaughan said she had got no money, she would come in in the afternoon to buy some, Bailey said, we will.</p>
               <p>Q. When Bailey was apprehended was not she admitted to bail before the magistrate? - She was.</p>
               <p>Q. And she has come here and surrendered to take her trial? - She has.</p>
               <p>Q. Now again, did your master direct this prosecution? - My master has nothing to say in it; he gave me orders to go and proceed as the law directed; I did not understand it, it was totally left to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they now indicted for a capital offence, yes or no? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the justice did not commit them for a capital offence? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is it a capital offence now? - Because it is stealing privately above five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you cannot tell whether the justice committed them for privately stealing in a shop? - I do not know that, I am not sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had not the curiosity to enquire? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that you did not? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not prefer this indictment capitally against the desire of your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to take down the question, Mr. Short-hand writer? Upon your oath, did your master direct you to prefer this indictment for a capital offence? You have told me yes, you may recall the answer, if you please. - He gave me no directions about it, but as the law directed.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, yes, just before? - I did not understand the question or else I should not have said it; I do not remember the question, you have asked me so many.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that your master directed you to indict capitally? - He did not give me the least directions for it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was just before that you told me that your master directed you to prosecute as the law directed. Perhaps you know what sort of a thing a Tyburn ticket is? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you hope to get a Tyburn ticket by prosecuting capitally? - No, I never wished it, nor never shall.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080071"/>Q. How came you to prefer this indictment for a capital offence? Upon your oath, do not you know that your master wished to the contrary? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Be cautious. Do not you know that your master wished to the contrary? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear most positively? - Yes, I do, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. However, you know that you have indicted for a capital offence. Bailey was in the shop and laid down the guinea when you stopped Vaughan? - She was going towards Vaughan at the door, and I went round, and stopped Vaughan as she was going out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not repeat this conversation about the gown before the magistrate? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have indicted for stealing nine shawls; upon your oath, did you say a word before the magistrate about the ninth shawl? - The nine shawls was mentioned, but not by me; it was mentioned before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, whether you said any thing about the ninth shawl to the magistrate. Was your examination taken down in writing? - I do not know that it was or was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sign your examination in writing? - It was a commitment I believe; I signed something, but I declare I do not know what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not you first sworn to what you signed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you sworn to that,(the examination shewn him) and was not it read over to you, and you signed it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing said about the ninth shawl? - The clerk said there was nothing necessary to say about the ninth shawl.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the clerk say so to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was taken down at Bow-street, was not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the clerk at Bow-street told you so? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that you did not mention any thing about the ninth shawl; how came the clerk to tell you that you should not mention about the ninth shawl? - She said she bought it of a linen draper, and the linen draper was produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, if you never mentioned about the ninth shawl, how came the clerk to tell you that you should not mention about the ninth shawl? - The clerk said that another time would do as well for that, the time of this indictment, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you have not put any thing in about the ninth shawl?(The witness here sainted away.)</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. On the 6th of November, I was sent for to Mr. Clarke's; I took the two prisoners into custody, and when I got to Bow-street I searched them, I searched Mrs. Bailey first, and she had nothing at all about her, but three or four guineas in her pocket, and a note, a receipt for stock she had bought; then I went to Mrs. Vaughan, and this shawl she pulled it out of her pocket, and was going to wipe her face with it.(Produces a shawl.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did the young man swear to that? - He said he believed it to be his master's property.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that shawl hemmed? - No; she said she had bought it about three weeks before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This woman Bailey was bailed at the magistrate's? - She was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080072"/>Q. Did you hear Boyd make any objection to a particular part of her examination? - No, I did not hear that, he said he thought that was his master's property, but the magistrate did not let him have it, but he told me to keep it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Boyd. Do you mean to say that the examination was corrected by your desire? - I believe there is no correction in it, I desired it might be looked over, to see if it is right, but the other shawl was not mentioned in it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you signed it in that shape? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is concerned in the business with Mr. Clark? - No person.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived with him? - Near nine years.</p>
               <p>Jury. By what mark do you know these shawls? - They are my own making, with S. and l. besides two characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those marks on them when you took them from the prisoner? - They were on the eight.</p>

               <p>Q. What assistance did you call in? - Mr. Cooper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her long before she was delivered? - I was with her all the day preceding the delivery; I was with her all the day before she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the state of her person? Did she shew you any part of her person? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see? - She had a kick on her left side, just here, on the side.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean the thigh part of her body? - Just below her ribs, on her belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the thigh? - Yes, there was a mark there, which was rather black, white and purple.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was delivered, was the child living or dead? - The child was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been long dead, in your judgment? - I think, in my judgment, about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the poor woman make any expressions how she came by that injury? - I had heard her say several times, the day I was with her, O, Watt I you have been the death of me! she said that several times to herself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she, at all, mend or get better after her delivery? - She got a little better on Monday, but she was very bad again on Monday night; she was delivered on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any judgment of the cause of her death? - No; I think it was owing to the kick that she received.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You found this a difficult case, and your skill was not sufficient to deliver her, and then you called in one Dr. Cooper. Now, I take it for granted, your's is not so good an account of her death as Dr. Cooper's will be? - I really take that to be the cause of her death.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you called in to attend the labour of this poor woman, Mrs. Hubbard, in the workhouse? - I was. I found she had a fever on her, and she complained of a pain in her side; I asked her how long she had been ill, and had had that pain in her side? she said, about a fortnight; the labour was over in about an hour, but the pain in her side increased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her attribute any cause to the pain in her side? - I heard one of the women say, but I did not hear the woman herself say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks about her person? - The body was opened about nine or ten days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you formed any judgment of the cause of her death? - It appeared to me that that fever was the immediate cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you called upon to form any judgment as to any violence about her, at the time she was delivered? - No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Q. You attended that dissection, were there any external marks, or internal, by which you could form a judgment of any injury having been done to the woman? - Not that I could trace to any external injury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You was called upon to deliver this woman because it was a difficult case? - I believe her fever made the midwife think it was more difficult than it really was.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe the fever was the cause of her death; you was present at the dissection? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And of course you have examined whether any external injury whatever could occasion her death? - She was opened by my desire for that express purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. And from the accurate inspection you made, you are of opinion that there were no external injury that could produce the consequence that followed? - That is my opinion.</p>

               <p>Q. As he was going to the watch-house did he say any thing, and what did he say? - As soon as I got him out of the house I fastened him, and then I told him I was very sorry to tell him that I had a charge of murder against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing further to him? - I asked him how he came to commit so horrid a deed? he said he was very sorry for it, that it was done and he supposed he should suffer for it. I questioned him then with what his comrade said to him when he called him out of the room; and he said, that his comrade called him, and told him that he believed he was stuck with the bayonet. I did not after that question him any further, only respecting his sword. After he was at the watch-house it was intimated to me what had become of the sword that he had done the mischief with; I asked him where the sword lay? and he said, it lays under the bed; in consequence of that I sent two patroles immediately for the sword.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe he appeared extremely concerned at what had happened? - He rather seemed stupid, he said he was sorry.</p>

Sampson called me down when I was up stairs and almost asleep, I got out of bed, and my sword was laid drawn on the chair and I catched up my sword, I was between sleeping and waking, I catched my sword up, and when I came down stairs I pushed my sword against the door, but I did not know there was a hole there; the man stood up against the door so that I could not see through that there was any hole, so I put the sword against the door before I hardly got down the steps, and it happen ed to go into the hole, and ran right into the man; but I never saw the man before nor never see him at any time, only when I fell in.</p>

               <p>Q. She brought them in the common room that you all had? - Yes, that we all laid in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing when she brought them in, and where she got them from? - She said she had had a good find, and that she had found them among some straw; and there were some straw among them, when she brought them up, she took them out and shewed them to me, as I sat by the fire side, she took one apron and went to a chandler's shop for a little bread and a little dripping, and a little sugar, for her supper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she sell them? - No, she only left it for security, one old white apron, nothing else; the next morning she called me up, and asked me to go along with her to pledge this petticoat, I went with her to the pawnbroker's in Bridges-street, because I used there.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that dimity petticoat was one that was brought home by her the night preceding? - Mrs. Hordes came in while I was standing at the counter; as soon as I clapped the handkerchief on the counter and untied it

               <p>Q. What did he give you? - The five pounds draft; for the breeches were two pounds two shillings. I took this draft of him, which I told him I did not very well like, but, however, I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing on your telling him so? - He said he did not know how I could dislike it, for it was good enough; he said, if it was not good he had two more that he should be a great loser by, one was a fifteen pounds, and another a twenty-five pounds; he told me to take it to my master, and if he did not like it, I was to take it back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him any change for that note? - No, he was to call the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the note home to your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to your master's what did you do with it? - I gave it to him, and he told me he did not very well like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep the note? - No, he sent me back with it immediately to the prisoner; I went back and took the draft with me, but when I was got back the gentleman was gone out, I went back again to my master, and delivered the note to him again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your master keep it? - He gave it me the next day morning; this was on Sunday morning, and he gave it me on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember sufficient to know that the draft you received on Monday morning, was the same you had given to your master on Sunday? - Yes, very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a check? - Yes, we have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you give your checks in that way? - We do.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you can recollect having paid a draft of the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080096"/>of Thomas Exton on the 1st of September? - There was one paid of the first of September of five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have the book with you? - I have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is that in your hand writing? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you call the book? - A waste book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Is that the book in which you enter them as soon as you pay them? - Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Then that book is not the book in which you minute them down immediately? - We do it as soon as we can; we put the checks in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible another clerks checks might get in that book in your hand writing? - Very possibly it may; but at that time there were no other person attending the counter but myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have the draft? - I have.(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. To Burton. Is that the draft that you received from Mr. Gilchrist, and gave to your master? - I believe it is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. To Lewis. Is that the draft you received from Burton and returned to him on Monday morning? - I believe it is the very same.</p>
               <p>Q. To Burton. Is that the one that you carried and received the money for of Mr. Heslop? - I faithfully believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I understood you before to say you knew this to be the same, but it appears by the draft that there is no mark at all on the draft? - No, there is not.</p>
               <p>Q. That you received a draft from Mr. Gilchrist is very true, but I want to know why you recollect that that very paper is the paper you received from Mr. Gilchrist? - From the hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many weeks elapsed before you saw it again? - I saw it at Bow-street three weeks or a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take other drafts for your master in the course of business? - No, never took one before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say only carrying that draft from a customer to your master, that you made such observations as to be able to swear that is the same? - I swear to the best of my knowledge, I think so by the hand writing, and by the date of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you it in your possession? - I had it Sunday morning above an hour, and Monday morning nearly the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at it more than once? - Yes, I looked at it several times, because I did not think it was good; the reason I objected to Mr. Gilchrist was, because I did not understand these things, and it was not on stamped paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Heslop. I want to know whether you have discharged Mr. Exton? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Now on the subject of this book, do I understand you right, that that waste book is made as soon after the business is done as possible? Does it happen that frequently one clerk pays the money, and another makes; the entry? - It has happened prior to this business, but not since.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you venture to swear that every thing in your hand writing is the transaction of yourself? - No, I cannot say that to the whole book; at the time of this transaction we had altered our mode.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that Lord Kinnard, Mr. Moreland and Mr. Hammersley are partners in this house? Is Mr. Ramson alive or dead? - He is dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Have no part of Mr. Ransom's family any interest of the profit and loss<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080097"/>in that banking house? - Lord Kinnard he is his son-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides my Lord Kinnard? - I believe not, I do not know that any body else has.</p>
               <p>Q. You know my Lord Kinnard of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What rank is he? - He is a peer of Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he Earl, Viscount or Baron? - A Baron, I understand him so in the Court Kalender.(The release from the house to Mr. Exton shewn to Mr. Heslop.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the gentlemens hand writing? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. How does Mr. Hammersley spell his name? - Hammersley.</p>
               <p>Q. I cannot see there before they? - It is his usual way of writing.</p>

            ; I returned to town in a very short time, and the check that I gave to Mr. Lewis, was the first that was offered for payment; when I found that note was paid I did not object taking some more of them; he then gave me three more notes, I gave the one to Mr. Lewis for the payment of the goods I had from him, and he was very well satisfied; the circumstance of my going to Moreland's to enquire about them, if I knew they were forged was not like a guilty mind; when I conceived my life at stake I would naturally fly from justice for my own security. After I had been to the banker's about them, I returned to Mr. Macdonald to the coffee house, and mentioned the circumstance to him, of their having been refused; he expressed himself in a great passion, and wondered that they should have been refused; he set off from me to go to Mr. Hammersley's immediately; in about the course of half an hour he returned, and he told me that he had spoke to Mr. Hammersley, and that both him and Mr. Hammersley were decidedly of opinion that the notes were forged; he then took a note out of his pocket, from which he shewed me a letter that he had received from Mr. Exton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080098"/>that morning, which informed him that he, Mr. Exton, was at Bristol; he then took two checks from the letter and shewed me, and I was very well convinced they were not the same signature as those of the former, and as he had always behaved like a gentleman to me, I conceived the suspicions I had of him were ill grounded; he told me he was going to Bristol, and when he saw Mr. Exton he would remonstrate with him. Having occasion afterwards to pay Mr. Lewis some more, I gave him the ten pounds note to change, I supposed by his paying the former one he would not refuse the other; I owed him six pounds six shillings, and he gave me the balance of three or four shillings; and on the Saturday following in the morning I was at home at my own apartments, and Miller came and took me up.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of November, between five and six in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop to pledge a handkerchief for six-pence; there were two or three people in the shop at the same time, at the front of the counter, and she stood behind; I had the handkerchief in my hand, and she said she would call again; she went away; when the other people were gone away, I dare say it was not five minutes before I missed a gown that was hanging upon a part of the shop,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080101"/>upon some pins. I directly suspected her and sent about to the pawnbrokers, and the shop that I found the gown pledged at was Mr. Swaine's, in Panton-street.</p>

On the 27th of October, about half past nine in the morning, the prisoner at the bar, in company with another woman, came into my shop, to look at some ribbon, they said, they wished to look at some ribbon; in consequence of that I took out the drawer which I generally do to those kind of people, and the other woman said, she did not like blue ribbon at all, and asked me if I would shew her some white ones? in consequence of that I took out the white drawer and placed it half over the blue coloured drawer, and the prisoner at the bar put over her hand into the drawer and took the piece of ribbon out I had been shewing to her, and held it in her hand, and put it from place to place about her. The woman that was with her said she would have two yards of satin ribbon; and while I was cutting the two yards off, the prisoner put the ribbon she had taken out of the drawer into her pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe all this? - I did, the whole entirely, very plainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold any conversation with her? - I did nothing but make the observation. I cut off the ribbon, and the prisoner at the bar paid me for the ribbon that I cut off for the other woman, fourteen-pence was the price of it; when I had put the money in the till I went round the counter, before they got to the door, I made haste and stopped her at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any person or journeyman in the shop? - I was just done breakfast, and the people who were coming in the shop, were not come. When I stopped her at the door, I told her she had got a piece of ribbon of mine, and she denied it. The other woman said, but if you have got any of the gentleman's, give it him; she said she had not; I told her I saw her proceeding, and it was no need to deny it, and if she did not own it I must send for an officer. In consequence of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080102"/>that I told my boy to go for an officer; while the boy was gone for an officer the other woman reasoned with her to take it out of her pocket; and my servant, when he came in the shop, he laid hold of her and took it out of her pocket. This is the piece of ribbon that was taken out; it has been in no other hands but my own; I marked it immediately when he took it out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that was your property? - Very safely. It is a very clear case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He would not stop the other woman that bought the white ribbon. Ask the prosecutor if I did not bid him stop the other woman in the shop?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She did not ask me any such thing; I conceived the other woman knew nothing of the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. To Walter. Did you see that ribbon come out of her pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man was not in the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was not in the shop when the woman took it, but he came out of the kitchen into the shop at the time it was took out of her pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in that man's shop before, I have bought stockings and things these five years of him; stockings, handkerchiefs, and ribbons of one thing and another; I have served him with fish. This woman and I had a glass of liquor or two more than did me good, and she asked me to buy her a ribbon, and I went into this shop to buy this woman a ribbon, and this ribbon was on the ground, and he said I took it; and I have been used very ill since I have been in the watch-house, I lost my apron, petticoat, and gown. The constable told me if I would pay for the ribbon, the prosecutor would not prosecute me.</p>

I did not see it, I was so fixed by the two women.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you believe that to be a man's arm? - Because there were no others but these three at that time near me. They having secured me in this kind of way, I observed

               <p>Q. Your watch went, did it? - It did; my fob is very deep, and it went very hard, it went away very gradually, and I had an opportunity of seeing who did it. After they had my watch I began to be a little released, not much, and then I felt a hand go down to my pocket where I had six guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the same man? - It was; I believe it to be about the size of the prisoner. On having the two women in custody before the arrival of the watchman, I heard him say, d-mn the b-y b-gg-r, cut his bloody arms off, why don't he let the women go; then I felt a stab on this arm, which I had extended out to secure

               <p>Q. Was your brother in company with you while you was pinioned? - He went for the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. He went while the women held your arms? - Yes, but he did not go till I had lost my watch; we proceeded to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080104"/>watch house, and delivered the two women into charge there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said we, who do you mean by we? - The watchman and myself, and my brother was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think it was from the time that you was pinioned up, to the time that your brother went and called the watchman? - My brother did not go to call the watch until after the watch was out of my sob, and the watch was out of my sob in about three minutes after the first transaction, then I began to cry out watch, and he run away for the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had conducted these two women to the watch-house, what did you do? - We then gave a description of the man, myself and my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done in consequence of that description? - How was the man dressed? - I believe the man at that time to he dressed in a drab kind of a coat.</p>
               <p>Q. What height was he? - He answered to the height of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What coloured hair? - I do not pretend to say to his hair or face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to take him? - I did not, the watchman did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner at the bar after that? - The very next day, the two women were delivered into custody, and they were all three brought up together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the man till the next day at Bow-street? - Not till the next day, I think it was near upon twelve o'clock when I saw him come into Bow-street, and my little brother pointed him out directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were with you? - There was the patrol of the night, the watchman and my little brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you and your brother at Bow street when you first saw him, were you in the inner office, or were you near the bar? - We were just in the front place, exactly, I only know that the little boy the moment he saw Lamb, he identified him, and said, you are the man that either robbed my brother, or was concerned in robbing him, and he went on, and said, but you had a different coat on, but I know you now.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Do you know if any person had pointed to you, before that man came up to you, and spoke to you, as to that man? - No, he appeared to me instantly saying do you know me? - I said no; he turned himself about with an air, and said, then I may take myself about my business; then the little boy said, that is the man that robbed you last night, and then the little boy proceeded to state before the watchman, before me and the patrol, what I have stated to you before.</p>

             was the person that came nearest to me, and clasped me in the front, and hugged me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you got ot Essex-street? - There is a cutler's at the corner, and I was got half way by their shutters, just opposite that passage that leads through to go to St. Clement's-inn; it was very near the lamp, I was not in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners at the bar you told me just now, that you never see either of them before; did the crowd encrease or disperse on your being pinioned as you have described? - It increased, but considering there were very few people about.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps there were forty or fifty people about you? - I do not think there were twenty about me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is a watchman's stand to this place where the robbery was said to be committed? - I believe the nearest stand was in St. Clement's Church-yard, which was a good bit off me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the watch-house is pretty nearly opposite to the Church in the passage? - I do not know; if there was a watch-house there nobody proceeded to my assistance from that watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is your brother? - He is now about eleven or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been this evening, Mr. Hill? - I had been in Berry-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Only you and your brother together? - I was there alone by myself, all the afternoon, my brother was sent to fetch me home by my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had a watch out with you that afternoon? - I particularly remember I had, it was a silver hunting watch; I had the seal in my hand not many minutes before I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to do that? - I cannot say what led me to do it. I mean positively to swear that I put my hand to my seal two minutes before I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, the watch had never been found at all? - It has not.</p>

               <p>Q. You have stated that as to the person of the man, that there was only one man, you will not swear to the prisoner being that man. I understand you to say you would not swear to what his hair was, nor his face, but his size you think you could swear to? - Just so.</p>

               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you do not swear to him only by his size? - I do not say the particular size of him, it was about his size.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Bow-street the next day, your brother was with you of course? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners were brought into custody from the Brown Bear? - I do not know where they were brought from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, upon your oath, that they came from the Brown Bear? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not at the door when they were brought in? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, the man, in irons or was he not? - The first time he was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080106"/>Q. Was the officer of Bow-street with him that brought him in? - Not at that time. When he came to the door at Bow-street he ran directly up to my nose, and said, sir, do you know me? and afterwards I perceived a many people following.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought, just now, you told me you was in the anti-room? - So I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the anti-room opened in the street? - It did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you saw him coming into the door you must see where he came from? - I did not; they came slanting from the Brown Bear to the door of the office, I could not see them in the room as I stood.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not, I believe, till after you had said, no, to him, and after he ran up to you and asked whether you knew him? that your brother said one word to him? - The moment I said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very extraordinary I cannot get an answer? - It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the watchmen there at the time? - I believe they were in with him, or they came in with the two women afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that watchman say any thing about Lamb? - Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not hear this, he pointing to Lamb, and saying, this is the man, my boy? - I mean to say that the watchman never did any such thing in my presence as that, and it could not be done without my hearing it.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there are three forty pound rewards? - I do; but I am very willing to relinquish that all up to the poor of the parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been alway with Mr. Clarke? - Before I was with him I was with Mr. Priddle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Whatever persons were about the street, were there more than two females and one male about you when the robbery was compleated? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that your brother pointed out that the prisoner at the bar was the man; had any body any where, or in any kind, pointed to him, to shew him? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hill, just tell me exactly whereabouts it was you lost your watch; you talked just now about the razor shop, was it near that razor shop? - It was against the razor shop, the very corner of Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you saw this crowd of people, the crowd of women of which there was but one man? - At the very corner of Essex-street.</p>
               <p>Q. If there were a great crowd at the corner of Essex-street, and you was robbed at this house, what do you mean when you say there were nobody but these two women and one man about you? you must be very close to the crowd? - About a yard and a half, if there were any.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do not you call people that were within a yard and a half of you, not near you? - They were near me, but not assisting.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us just now, before, that there were not more than two females and one male near you when you was robbed, and now you tell me that there was all this crowd within a yard and a half of you? - I mean to say that they were a yard and a half from me when these people were round me. Your lordship sees that when these people were around me they were a yard and half from the other people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Clement's-inn? - A year.</p>
               <p>Q. Were did you live before that? - At Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the man, the prisoner there? - Yes, I did, he was standing at the front, as soon as I went forward he withdrew, and got into the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he withdraw to? - Unto a little distance from them, and Mr. Hill gave me one of the women in charge,

            , while he took care of the other himself, at that time the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080111"/>was swearing very heavy to him, cursing and d-mning his eyes and limbs.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him swear, did you? - Yes, I did, he said d-mn his eyes and limbs if he did not knock the b-gg-r down if he did not let her hands go. Mr. Hill and I conducted the two women to the watch-house, and the man he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man you spoke to, is the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him long? - No, never see him before, only from the severe language he used at that time; if I was to see him I could swear to him, and he followed us to the watch-house swearing.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you whether you saw the man so as to know him again, before you took the women into custody? - No, not till I took the women into custody, and he followed us until we past the Crown and Anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face plainly? - Yes, I saw his face so plainly that I can swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether the man that was swearing with these women was the man that followed you to the Crown and Anchor? - No; this is the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you went to the watch-house? - The constable of the night, who is here, examined the two women, and so the patrol was called, and they were searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any description of the man, which you now say is the prisoner at the bar, to the constable of the night? - I did, and to the patrol both.</p>
               <p>Court. How was he dressed at that time? - I thought he had something of a whitish coat on.</p>

               <p>Mr. Trebeck. What did you do afterwards? - We took the women down to the Strand-lane and locked the women up, the prisoner had said something to the patrol about sending her husband to her.</p>

The patrol and the constable of the night after we had left the two women locked up, and he thought that if he could make out this Mr. Lamb he might have the watch and property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner Lamb? - No, it was the patrol, and, I believe, the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. After the time you say you saw him near the Crown and Anchor, where he left you; where was the next place you saw him? - In the watch house, past five o'clock next morning, Saturday morning after the 22d.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Bow-street? - Yes, I went along with the rest, the constable was there and the patrol was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080112"/>Q. When you got to Bow-street did George Hill point him out? - I cannot say, for they two were in first.</p>

               <p>I live at the Old Swan, Butcher-row, Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live at that house now? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have lived at that house? - Seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner John Lamb at your house any time in November last? - Certainly; I see him almost every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember hearing of the robbery that was committed by St. Clement's church? - I heard of it the next morning, he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar at your house that night? - He was there from eight o'clock till past twelve, and to my knowledge he did not go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the tap room a good part of that time? - I was in and out several times that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you out at a time? - I was not out except with a pint or a pot of beer to the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you came in again? - Yes. I never missed him out of the room, he has frequented my house for years past.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore I take it for granted, you are sure of his person? - O, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the next morning at Bow-street? - I did, but the examination was over before I came; the prisoner sent for me to go there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. You attended at Bow-street after the examination? - It was over.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house is it you keep? - A respectable house.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you remember the prisoner was at your house the evening of the day a robbery was committed? - Yes, that was Friday night, the 21st, I believe.</p>

               <p>Q. Be so good as to recollect when he came into your house? - I cannot say to a minute, but he was there by eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you think it was eight o'clock? - I am sure he was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Yes, that is very possible, But what makes you recollect it was eight o'clock? - I recollect it very well, because I served him with beer; I am sure it was not nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he sit down when he first came into the house? - He sat down in the tap room; there were two of them that had three pints of beer and a paper of tobacco, who the other man was I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he change his situation while he was in the house? - When he had had these three pints of beer he fell asleep, he put his two hands on the table and fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he fall asleep? - It was past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he asleep? - That I do not know how long he slept.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you from when you saw him go to sleep at nine o'clock, how long it was before you looked at him again and saw him again? - I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect it was eight o'clock when he first came in, and you recollect it was nine o'clock when he fell asleep; it is very odd you cannot recollect when you saw him asleep again. Do you recollect how long he slept before you looked at him? - I cannot recollect the time that he slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sleep an hour? - I will not say that he slept an hour, or half an hour, or whether he was asleep at all, but he had his head down.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080114"/>Q. How long did he keep his head down? - I am sure I cannot tell how long, I saw him there, he was there, he was there past nine o'clock asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you kept your eyes upon him the whole time? - I told you before I did not watch him the whole time.</p>
               <p>Court. He has told you that he had his eyes on him and off him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Recollect the latest hour you saw him asleep? - I cannot tell exactly the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect how long he continued in your house that evening? - I do not recollect that he went out at all till after twelve o'clock, I am sure it was a quarter after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are sure that he did not go out till past twelve o'clock. Are you sure he did not go out before and return again? - I could not positively swear, because I was not always in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your house to Essex-street? - About thirty or forty yards, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you say, that in the course of the evening you was several times out with pots of beer to the neighbourhood, more than forty yards from your house? - I do not know that I go so far.</p>
               <p>Q. While you are going out with the beer to your neighbours, whether he was sleeping with his head on the table you do not know? - I cannot say while I was out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at a time when you was carrying beer to any customer? - I might stay five minutes, I might ten, according to where I had to go.</p>
               <p>Q. There is time enough to go to Essex-street, and stay some time, while you was carrying out pots of beer? - I do not think he could go out without my missing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take your oath that you was no one time absent from your house, from eight in the evening till twelve o'clock, that a man could not go to Essex-street in the same time?</p>
               <p>Court. You had better put it another way.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you ever ten minutes out of the house together or five minutes at a time? - I might five minutes, and I might ten.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times do you think you was out that evening? - Perhaps twenty times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You mean this, that between the hours of eight and twelve, except at the time when you went out to carry pots of beer and when you went in again you saw the prisoner there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner stay in your house till past twelve? - He did stay till a quarter past twelve, I shut it up then.</p>

               <p>Q. At ten o'clock he was sitting with his pint or pot by himself? - It might be, I did not particularly remark that.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that? - I cannot tell particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he by himself then? - That was the time he was by himself, and I was remarking it to a friend of mine at that same time, I says, Lamb seems to be very sleepy to night, and I suppose he will not speak to night; I had spoke to him, saying, Lamb, how do you do now? and he made me no answer, on that I conceived he was fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he light his pipe? - I think he light his pipe about ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. He did not set by himself from nine to ten; and you are sure he came in the house at half past nine? - Between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been there some time? - Before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. So that from nine to half past nine, he certainly was not there; so that from the time you went in till half past nine, he certainly was not there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not come in till past nine, of course he had not been there before you went, he came in after you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether there were any body in the box during that time, or whether he was alone? Was he at any part of the time alone? - I cannot say to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you tell what time exactly you went to the house? - A little before nine o'clock, perhaps a quarter.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any thing particular having happened in their brew-house the 28th of November last? - Yes, that day, Friday. Between six and seven in the evening I went as usual, to see if the men were about their business as usual, to see if they were filling up the beer, and I found the cock was cut off the leather hole or pipe, that they fill the beer up with, and they could not go on; I then told them to look at the other place, and there was three cut away, and that is all that I know that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe how these brass cocks were fixed. - It is a fixture to the leather pipe in the running storehouse, or tun room, where we fill up the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to find out how these were taken? - I could not that night, somebody else did, but I did not till the morning; the next morning the man that went to open the gates, found the lock had been wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing missing the next morning? - Yes, about ten or twelve feet of leaden pipe that was cut off.</p>

               <p>Q. To London. If I understood you right, you did not carry it to Union Hall? - Yes, I did, when I took the prisoner, the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the cocks and lead both? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it separated before it was marked or after? - After it was marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the cocks and see if they are the same you marked? - They are; the cocks were left at Union Hall the Friday night till Saturday, and then they were taken to the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>To Purcell. Did you take any property, or see it taken from Union Hall to your Brewhouse? - I did. On Saturday I took and fitted this piece of lead to the place where it had been cut off, and it corresponded exactly; it appeared newly cut off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any place that had been broke behind the brewhouse? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the front or the back of the brewhouse? - At the back of the brew-house, the staple was wrenched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing near the door by which you could reasonably collect it had been wrenched with? - Yes, there was a dung fork near, and one of the tongues was bent.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brewer. What are you? - I am a cock founder.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these cocks on the table there. - I know the cocks, for I made them for Trueman's brewhouse.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080119"/>Q. Is that Mr. Hanbury's brewhouse? - Yes; it is called Trueman's brew-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago did you make them? - A year and a half ago; there is part of the work that I make myself.</p>
               <p>Court. To what part are they fixed? - They are fixed to a leather pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that leather pipe fixed to? - To a vat.</p>
               <p>Q. When it is fixed there does it remain there? Is the leather a moveable thing? - The leather is a fixture, but the cock is removeable, and takes off to be repaired. The vat is a fixture to the brewhouse, and the pipe is a fixture to that, and the pipe is only moved about as is convenient, from barrel to barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. When once you put it on that leather it is never taken off. - Unless it is to repair.</p>
               <p>Q. They do not shift these cocks about from place to place? - No; it remains there until it wants repairing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is this back or vat? - It is a large tub.</p>
               <p>Q. It is fixed in the freehold? - It is fixed in the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it is as small as this (holding up an ink stand) could you take it up? - No. It is very large.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a tub that is moved about in the brewery from place to place. - It is not. It is fixed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Is it so fixed on account of its weight? Is it nailed and secured? - It is fastened on things on purpose for it, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it as much a fixture to the building as this ink stand is to this book? - No. It is fixed, it is part of the building of the brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What size first of all is this back as you call it? - I cannot tell very well the size of it.</p>

            . What is this vat or back? - This is a square vat that stands about seven or eight feet high, it holds about five or six barrels of beer, we pump the beer out from a well into that, and these leather holes are fixed to this vat on purpose to fill the barrels below, and these cocks are placed to the ends of the holes, the leather, are fixed to this vat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this vat part of the building or not? - It is a vat that belongs to the brewery.</p>
               <p>Q. Now in what manner is it fixed? - It is fixed on posts.</p>
               <p>Q. It is fixed on posts, and these posts are fixed on the ground. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. When the vats are not employed, do not these cocks unscrew? And are they not taken off for cleaning? - When we have done brewing we take them off.</p>
               <p>Court. Are they taken off for no purpose than that of mending. - When we have done brewing we take them off and put them by, for fear of having them stole.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand you that they are put by at the end of the season? - The cocks and leather is all taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. The vat is less? - The vat is in the frames, which is fixed in the building, and then a frame made round, and the vat is put on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the vat, as light as that inkstand, in this frame work could not you take it up in that way? - No, it is above you; you could not lift it up without unnailing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is the frame work, a fixture to the building? - It is nailed to some part of the building, but I can hardly tell you where. This vat is a fixture.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the lead, that lead was fixed to the building, was not it? - Not to the building, to the brewery utensils.</p>
               <p>Court. The leaden pipes are not taken off, they are fixed to the utensils of the brewery, and the utensils are fixed in the freehold? - Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080120"/>Mr. Trebeck. Unto what utensils they are fixed? - Mr. Purcell will tell you, it belongs to his department.</p>
               <p>Q. To Purcell. Where is this lead fixed? - It is a waste pipe of the jackback engine, and fixed to the brewery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I never did any thing but hard labour for my bread, I heard that there was a man wanting; and I went to the brewhouse to see if this place was convenient; and the first I saw, was the mill boy, and I asked him if they did want a man? and he told me they did; and I saw another man and he told me he could not tell; I called in again on Friday, and the mill boy told me he had a man. It was between three and four o'clock I was there, I staid there some time, talking with the mill boy; and I asked him how many horses there were for the mill? he told me twenty-four of them, I told him then the man ought to have good wages to look after so many; he told me he had sixteen shillings a week for looking after them, and four-pence a piece for harnessing these horses, and something the miller allows him a week; and he said they make more than their wages, by what they make out of the brewhouse, such as bran and corn, that they sell. I asked him which way they carried these things out, he said at the fore-door, says I, does not the watchman see? says he, the watchman will not see. Says he, on the morning, they come up this way; and I am here by three o'clock in the morning, and I give them the key, and they go out of this door; and says I, do not they of course give you any thing? No, says he, they never give me so much as a glass of gin; and I asked him, whether the watchman had any thing? He said, he supposed they went shares in it. After that I went to Ratcliffe Highway, where the great fire was, and came back again; and there was a cart there, and I saw something in the cart, and this sack rolled out from the hinder side, the cart having no tail-board to it; and I was going to halloo to the man that something dropped out of the cart, and there was a gentleman said, he thought he saw the man kick it out of the cart; says he, it is not worth while hallooing after him, and I took it up, to see what it was, and then I took it on my shoulder; there was a woman that came up East Smithfield along with me, and she saw me pick it up, and drag it to the cross-way, and see the gentleman help it on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. What day was it you saw the man there? - Friday the 28th.</p>

               <p>Q. Go on with what follows on the printed paper? - That is not done at the office where I am, Mr. Standard does that, a gentleman that is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What follows in the paper? - No. 660, to be paid out of 20001. received the 8th of September, 1794; and allowed to pay piloting, Marsh, Roger and Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. Now explain what 6460 means? - I am not able to do that well, it is done in another office.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the first bill, which has been signed by the three commissioners then comes the subsequent. What are Marsh, Rogers and Marshall? - They are three commissioners, three commissioners first sign the navy bill, and then three the same, or others, sign the assignment, or order the payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is a date assigned 24th September 1794? - Yes by Mr. Standard.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is your initials again on the left hand? - That is to ascertain that it comes to the comptroller's office back again, in order to have that assignment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080123"/>set off against the entry, after it has had the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. Major Wollard, is a gentleman, a clerk in another office? - He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to look at the certificate and see if you know that (a certificate shewn him)? - This is a certificate on which that bill was made out.</p>
               <p>Q. That certificate you remember? - I think I can remember it.</p>
               <p>Q. By looking at the certificate, are you enabled to say, when you first saw it at the office? - No, I cannot positively say, by an entry at the bottom P. H. with the date under the 11th of September, 1794; I conceive it was made out that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The navy bill was made out after this of course? - When was the navy bill made out? - I cannot say exactly the day, after that, and then they are registered; and they are said to be made out when they are past.</p>
               <p>Q. A certificate might have laid in the office sometime, before the navy bill was made out? - They do sometimes for a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the business of the prisoner at the bar, to take in these things and forward them? - The bill unquestionably is not of his writing, the person who wrote it is here.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is the clerk of the acts? - George Marsh.</p>
               <p>Q. But when you have so indorsed it yourself, that is, it self sufficient to entitle the person to carry it to the treasury office to demand the money? - That I cannot say.</p>

Is there any thing further to be done in the office, after you have witnessed it by your subscription, that the certificate within mentioned, is indorsed by Edward Wilson, payable to Mr. William Thornton? Is there any thing more necessary, than that Thornton himself, should demand it and sign a receipt for it? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you immediately transmit it when you have done this? - It goes in the clerk of the acts office, to be entered there? and delivered to the parties, or their agents.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is necessary to register it in the clerk of the acts office? - I conceive so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You conceive it necessary to register them in the clerk of the acts office? Be so good as to tell me what is the meaning of that at the bottom T. D. - To shew that this bill has come down again to me, in order to be set off again with the assignment.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the course of office,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080124"/>what is Major Wollard? - He is a clerk, in the clerks of the acts office.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that written by him, as the clerk, of the clerk of the acts office? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that T. D. your's? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can tell us why it is put there? - It is to shew, that it is brought down, after it has been assigned, to have the assignment set off against the entry of the bill to make it compleat.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a necessary official act done by you? - It has always been done; and I have been there upwards of fifty years.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose that bill could not pass unless your name was there? - I think it is necessary to authenticate the paper, to make it negotiable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. All that Major Wollard does, and your initials there is done after the commissioners have dispatched it all out of their hands? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Is not that D. to be written by you in the course of office, before the party entitled to receive it, gets it out of the office, to get the money for it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. And that you have generally done? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. And for what purpose? - When it is assigned for payment, the bills are sent back again to the comptroller's office and then I put T. D. at the corner, and direct them forward to the clerks, to have the assignment set off against the bill in the book.</p>
               <p>Q. This is your initials to signify that it has come regularly from the commissioners, and for that purpose? - It is.</p>
               <p>Court. Whether the progress of this navy bill would be stopped in the course of it if it had not this initial letter at the soor of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you look on your initials in that place as essentially necessary to the validity of the thing? - How far it may be considered as necessary I do not know, but it is the custom of the office always to act so; but whether the bill can be considered valid without it, that is to be considered by them that pay it.</p>

               <p>Court. I understand that if in case this bill was brought into the acts office, it would stop there, if your initials was not there? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. In all the course of time that you have been in the Navy Office, have you constantly put your initials T.D. as on this bill? - There has been an omission, but I always considered it as a part of my duty to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a part of the bill? - No, it is no part of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Or is it a part of the assignment of the bill? - No, by no means.</p>

               <p>Q. And when you had made them out, in whose department was it to take care of them? - We used to take care of them till they went to the board to be signed; after I made them out I suppose Mr. Hunter used to look at them, and then they go to the chief clerk to be examined, Mr. Davis.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me to whom that bill is delivered out of your office? - It is charged to Mr. William Hunter, because there is more Mr. Hunters than one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I ask you whether you did or not give that bill into the hands of Mr. Hunter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe? - I believe it to the best of my recollection, but I cannot speak on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not always the party that brings it that takes it away? - Somebody comes for them sometimes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You have told us that you are clerk to the clerk of the acts office, and by the course of the office, these bills before they are issued for the money pass through your office? - They should, they do not always.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you do with them when you have them in your office? - We enter them first in the pilot book, and then in this book, which is the delivery book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a regular official act of your's? - Yes, but I do not think I signed this, sometimes a gentleman does it for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a regular and official act; is the money regularly offered into the man's hands, unless it pass through your office, and have some signature to it? - No, it is not regular.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080126"/>Court. But is it not a pilot bill whether you have that signature on it or not? - Yes, it can do without, but it is not regular.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it has always been customary to put your name on it, and when it comes to the pay office, would it not be stopped there for the want of that circumstance? - No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any navy bills paid without that circumstance? - Several.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. If I understand you, the pilot bills have been paid at the navy office without that signature from your office, but they frequently have a signature at your office? - Yes, always when they are brought.</p>
               <p>Q. It does not pass your office regularly without a signature to it, from your office? - It does not.</p>

               <p>Q. What is that stamp? - It is a four-penny stamp, which is agreeable to act of parliament.</p>
               <p>Q. There you saw the name of William Thornton, and you paid it on that authority.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. You are cashier and payee of these bills? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you liable to refund to government for any improper payment that you make? - I have never known such an instance done, I pay for the treasurer of the navy, I am his cashier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The ground work on which you make your payment, is the signature of the commissioners, and the indorsement of Mr. Davis? - Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In your situation as cashier, do not you give security? - No, there is no security equal to the custody, if I was to give a million it would not be equal to the custody,</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. I would take your Lordship's opinion, whether Mr. Slane is a good witness under these circumstances, as a cashier, it strikes me that Mr. Slane would be liable to refund to the treasurer of the navy, any payment that has been improperly made.</p>
               <p>Court. If a banker's clerk pays with out proper authority he must refund, but not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask Mr. Slane what he is allowed the old pence for? - I am allowed it by King and council.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Looking down that bill, you having paid a great many of them in your life, what is the authoritative part of that instrument, does it stop with the signatures of the commissioners, and the indorsement on the other side? - Yes, it does.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you say that the authoritative part of that instrument is the signature of the three commissioners, to the last assignment, and the immediate part is that indorsement on the back, and the signature of the name to which it is to be paid, on the stamp? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it Mr. Hunter called on you with this? - Between two and ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080127"/>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - Not at that time, I know I paid him two other bills at the same time.(The bill read.)</p>

               <p>Assigned 24th September 1794, O. S. 273, 94, T. D. and Major Wollard; the certificate within mentioned is endorsed to Edward Wilson, payable to William Thornton.</p>
               <p>T. Davies."</p>
               <p>Q. Now read the stamp. - For receipts four-pence, William Thornton, William Hunter</p>
               <p>Q. Now you see Mr. Hunter's name is there, it was there when it was brought to you? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You said before that you looked at the assignment, which was Thornton; how came you to pay it to Hunter? - We always make it a practice when the bill is endorsed, to pay it to the person that brings it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have paid that bill unless it had the name of Thornton to it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the import of those names being on that stamp there? - When Thornton's name and Hunter's name were both on this piece of paper, I looked on it as a receipt and discharge of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the office a good many years? - Six and thirty years and upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the custom with you, and has it been the custom of the office to pay on that sort of a thing? - Before the stamp act was introduced it was paid by simply signing the name under the sum, to which the bill was made payable, but since the receipt act has been required it has been always the usual custom to sign it as that is now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the word receipt made use of? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the name put? - Where you see the stamp now</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose before the receipt took place it was on the same paper on the bill? - It was, and we have no other way of putting the stamp on, but by wafering it on the bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now I observe that this navy bill has at the bottom of it in red ink, the name Wollard with the initials of T. D. - I have no authority to look to that; it is no authority to the treasurer of the navy, it is done quite in another office from ours, quite distinct.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you are acquainted with the hand writing of Hunter himself; whether you have ever seen him write? - I do not know that; I cannot speak to his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you pay that money? - By a draft on Coutts and Co. I have got the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever paid any bills that you can say to a certainty that no name of Wollard, in red ink, was ever there? - It is a very late thing that his name has been put there.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080128"/>Mr. Shepherd. I take it for granted that sometimes you pay bills without any assignment? - I do not understand the question.</p>

               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Wilson had come with this bill himself? - If Mr. Wilson had come for the payment without the assignment I should have paid it Mr. Wilson.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell us what you enclosed in that letter? - I am looking at the copy of the bills that I made at the time I enclosed the within amount at the time of sealing this letter; the first bill was a bill drawn at three days fight. The next is a note of the bank of England, No. 914, ten pounds. The next is No. 4,780, bank note for thirty pounds, dated 7th June 1794, Padman; and the other was a bill of exchange, and two shares of tickets in the Irish lottery.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raine. You did not put this letter in the post yourself? - I did not. It was near to the time of the post going out, and I told the boy to run as fast as he could.</p>

               <p>Q. What does that mark import? - The postage of a treble letter to London, one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter to be put in at Ipswich, addressed to Bradford, in Wiltshire; do you forward it to London, or have you any cross post by which you can send it? - I forward it to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter to be put in on Friday, the 25th, at nine in the evening, at what time will that arrive in London? - The next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no bag made up at Ipswich of a Saturday for London? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Is it quite a treble letter, Mr. Goodchild? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. We have understood that this letter, when it was given to a boy contained a very large packet; supposing in this packet there had been a bank note, and it any how had been taken out of the letter, would it have made any difference in the charge? - No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Supposing it had contained twenty bank notes, and short of an ounce, do you charge it more then a treble letter? - Nothing under an ounce is more than a treble letter; half an ounce is supposed to be more than a double letter, we charge for that treble. A single letter is four-pence, a double letter is eight-pence, and a treble letter one shilling; and it is no matter how many enclosures that is while it does it does not weigh an ounce.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was it? - I cannot recollect who it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine to Goodchild. What does your family consist of? - My two daughters are at home with me.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080132"/>Q. Has Mr. Ralph travelled for your house long? - Three and twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the manner of his making up his letters and sending them to you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to observe the appearance of that letter, and tell me how it was when it was brought to you? - This letter appeared much more dirty than any letter we had ever received from him before; when I found the deficiency of forty pounds it led me to look at the letter with some nicety, I observed that the letter appeared much more dirty than we are accustomed to receive from him, and it appeared to be almost worn out at the edges, as if it had been carried in some person's pocket; the seal appeared to have been broke just at the bottom of it and lifted up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been a wax impression? - Yes, a wax impression of the initials of Mr. Ralph's name, and it appeared to be opened by one part of the seal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was it replaced? - It appeared to be done clumsily, yet not so on the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. On examining it carefully afterwards you had no doubt it had been opened after the first seal had been put on it? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend to the stamp? There appears to be two stamps, a London stamp, and another? - The London stamp contains in a circle certain figures and letters denoting the day and month of its arrival in London, the circle remained, but the letters denoting the day and the month, appears to be obliterated.</p>
               <p>Q. These observations apply to only the London stamp? - The other is very legible, 29th of July 1794, this led me to discover in what manner they were obliterated, in looking through the paper, I saw the paper was very thin, so that it was very evident that it was obliterated by being scraped with a knife, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Bush, this letter being put in Ipswich, on the 25th, you ought to have received it on the 27th with the London post mark of the 26th? - Certainly on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Instead of which you did not receive it till the 30th with the London post mark of the 29th; supposing it to come to London by the post of the 26th, it could not by any possibility have remained in the post office till the 29th? - They generally come on the 27th.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Here appears something to be scratched, but whether it is the Post office stamp you cannot say? - It might, or might not be a stamp, it always appeared to me to be a stamp.</p>
               <p>Jury. There are part of the letters left on? - It is just as clear as the sum.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. With respect to the contents of the letter there are forty pounds missing, but what description of notes these were that were missing you do not know? - I did not at that time, but since I have heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Supposing a ten pound note, and a thirty pound note of the Bank of England, were to have been put in, would that satisfy the omission that you discovered? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I do not think a forty pound draft would, because if in the letter it was said the enclosed are bank notes and drafts to such an amount.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Ralph. Did you enclose in this letter bank notes to the amount of 
forty pounds? - I did.</p>


               <p>Q. Was it made up of a thirty pound bank note and a ten pound one? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. The other notes were not negotiable without endorsing? - Not without acceptance; they were drawn at the same dates as dated, but not accepted.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner, Farmer, employed as a stamper there on the morning of the 26th of July? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed in stamping letters and packets at the General Post Office, on their arrival from the country mails? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a letter to have been put in the Post Office at Ipswich, intended for Bradford at Wilts, would that in the course of that morning have come under his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will trouble you to cast your eye on this paper to tell me whether you find this stamp of the 29th of July 94, as a stamp of the Post Office, intended to denote its arrival at that morning, at the Post Office? (The letter shewn him) - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Provided it came by the mail to the Post Office, then it would denote its arrival, but if it is put in London, it denotes a receipt of the day it is put in? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at another part of that letter and see if you see the remains of a Post Office stamp look? - One looks like the remains of a Post office stamp, I have got the stamp in my pocket of the 26th of July, and 29th, and an impression.(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear to you from inspection, that this, that at present is so obliterated, appears to be a stamp of this date? - It appears to me so.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe the figures, 94, is still apparent on it? - They are.</p>

               <p>Q. You have no doubt of this to be a Post office stamp? - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this to have been put in at Ipswich on the 25th, and to have arrived on the 26th, to go to Bradford in Wilts, in due course of post, without being taken out of the Post office, could it have had any other stamp on it than that of London the 26th, it would have been stamped on the morning of its arrival, and and forwarded by the evening mail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Without having been taken out of the post and brought back, by no possibility it could have got the date of the 29th on it? - No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. You are very well acquainted with the mode in which this stamping is conducted? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it sometimes happens that those who are employed to be stampers in turns are sometimes called away to assist one another? - They have no orders so to do, they are not to do it, they have positive orders not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes there are country letters that gets among the town letters? - They are from between three to five hundred of the country letters get among the town letters, but that is owing to the confusion of the towns on the roads.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The way I came by the thirty pounds note, was, I took it in trade, in the shop; a person came in the shop and bought some articles, to the amount of one pound six shillings; a dozen pair of gloves, half a dozen for two shillings a pair, and half a dozen at four shillings a pair; which I gave change for; he was dressed in a black waistcoat, black coat and doe-skin breeches, with boots on; after he had got these articles, he asked me if I could give him change for a thirty pounds note? I told him I would do my endeavours; I went up stairs and brought down the cash, and gave him the cash, and he gave me the note; I at the same time put it in my pocket in the hurry of business; on some time after I happened to take it out on some business in my shop, and I put it in my private book, on the other side, I forgot to put it on one side as I usually do. On Monday morning, on my journey to Huntingdon, as I had promised two or three days before, I went in the stage, and staid there longer then I meant, and that caused me to change the note; I wanted to return on Wednesday morning; I asked several of my friends who were there, some who knew me and some who did not, if they could give me cash for this thirty pounds note; accordingly giving it to one Mr. Pepperdy, (Mr. Pepperdy's brother is a gentleman that keeps the Dolphin inn) after they had it they returned it to me, said, they could not change it; I returned into the town, and said, to my friend Pepperdy, what shall I do for money to carry me to town? says he, I am short myself; I said I must get change if possible; so I asked the servant to go with it; she rakes it to the banking house, asking me what she should bring me? I told her to bring me ten or twenty pounds in notes; I asked him what I should give her? he said a shilling, you cannot give her less; she gave me the notes and cash on the same evening; I came to town in the mail. I should have gone myself, only I detained myself too much on the grounds with the races, and I was packing up my clothes to come off, as the mail could not be detained for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprehend me on Sunday? - No, on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know before you apprehended me that I was lame in my hand? - No, I did not; I apprehended him on account of robbing the shop adjoining me, Mr. Leopard's, the stationer; I apprehended him myself on the 22d; I was informed something between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, in consequence of the information given to me by my servant I attended the shop very particularly two days, and I had seen this man go by the shop, and I was in the counting house, between which and the shop there is a glazed partition; I stepped into the shop, and as I was standing in the shop, I saw this man and two others go by, and I followed them towards Cheapside; when they were got by the shop, I ran out behind a coach and got to a house opposite, and I saw this man with two others, one of them went and opened Mr. Leopard's door, the stationer's; the servant came forward to snuff the candle, they then ran away; they went a second time, and they went also a third time; I was then waiting and expecting every moment that they would take something out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop them at last? - I followed them down the street afterwards, and I took him myself; I had him search ed, and had a suspicion that he was going to draw a knife, in consequence of which, when I got him by the collar the other man came up, and I perceived him put his hand down, and I was afraid he was going to draw a knife; in the pocket afterwards was found a knife, which knife seemed to be adapted for a turn screw or some such purpose, the point was broke off.</p>
               <p>Q. You know no more than that you took him, nothing was found on him at any time? - Nothing was found on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any thing? - Yes, on Monday evening, between eight and nine o'clock. A person came in to look at some stockings, (not the prisoner) and I shewed the person one parcel of stockings out of the window, and he asked for some more, and I was getting this second parcel of stockings out of the window, for the person to look at, and I heard some person, and I saw some person brush against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold those stockings at the time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person looking at them at the time? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brushing against the door of the shop? - No, a door that stood against a side of the counter, a door in the shop, close up to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What short of a door do you mean? - It was a door that belonged to another place, and we had no screen to prevent people from taking any thing out of the window, as they went past, and this door was taken from another place and put there as a screen. After my hearing this bustle against the door, I withdrew towards the window, and I saw a man's back parts, and I called out stop thief! and he flew from the counter with the cloth, and I saw his face as he turned round the counter. With my seeing him take the cloth it rather confused me, and I should have taken him if it had not been for the person I was selling the stockings to, he gave me a push with his hand, when I got over the counter, and if the counter had not been there I should have been down on the floor; I asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080141"/>What he meant by giving me that push? he said, sir, I beg your pardon, I did it to secure the thief. I having no assistance in the shop, nor durst not call any in to secure this man, or I should have secured him, and this person who pushed me down he said he was not absolutely a companion of this Hardy's, indeed, he said, he was not, and he hoped I would not secure him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cloth was it he took away? - About twenty yards, as nigh as I can't recollect, worth about four pounds; I laid it in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a round hat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure of your man? - I had three patent lamps, and a candle on each counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Look and see whether you see your man? - (pointing to the prisoner) That there is the man, I am perfectly sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be in the shop altogether? - He was not above a minute and a half in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the property never been found? - No, never been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, did you lose nothing else the night the shop was robbed besides the cloth? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. No stockings? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What description did you give your master of me? Did you tell him I was lame in my hand? - No, I did not observe you was lame in your hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give your master any description of his person? - I gave my master the description of the person, that the hat was high crowned and pulled down behind and before, and that he had a great coat, with large white buttons, whether plated or metal, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him when your master took him up? - I did not see him till I saw him at Guildhall the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he at Guildhall? - He was in the prisoners box, besides him there was another person in the box, but I cannot say whether it was a prisoner or whether it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him immediately? - I knew him immediately, as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was the constable that was with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know him to be a constable? - No, I did not till I was told.</p>
               <p>Court to Tharratt. Do you mean to be positive? and you must be cautious in swearing to the man; but you must tell the truth; according the best of your knowledge, are you satisfied that he is the man? - I am satisfied he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Why did you take this man up? - I took him up in consequence, when I first saw him go by the door -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him up for the robbery of yourself, or for the act of robbing another, because the boy tells me that he had given you the description of his person? - He had given me a description of his person, but I took him for attempting to break into Mr. Leopard's.</p>
               <p>Court to Tharratt. Had he such a great coat on at Guildhall as when you saw him before? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not take him on Tharratt's description, because he gave me the description subsequent to my taking of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down Newgate-street, about half past eight o'clock, this gentleman took me and two others, and said, that I robbed a stationer's shop in Newgate-street; I went back along with him to the stationer's shop, the gentleman said, no, and gave no charge of me; directly he said, no, the prosecutor said I should go for a soldier; and when he found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080142"/>I was lame in my right hand, he said he would send me out of London. The next morning they brought this lad to see whether I was not the lad that robbed the shop eight days before; accordingly he came in, and said I was the man; that he could swear to me by having my hat lopped, and having a great coat on; and and that I was the person that had taken the stockings out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Had you at Guildhall charged this man with taking the stockings out of the window? - No, nothing but the elastic cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the elastic cloth woollen cloth? - It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had witnesses here last session, when the prosecutor moved to put my trial off. I have been in gaol twelve weeks.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor, Is there any thing but these callico waistcoats, that you know of? speak to them first? - These callico waistcoats were made of my goods, being outside, I bought the whole piece of this callico, at an wholesale house in the city; and when I used it almost, to a very short length, I applied to get some more exactly of the same pattern, and tried at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080145"/>every shop in the city, and at both ends of the town; but I could not get any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in your shop at the time the prisoner was there? - Yes, and he had it himself in his own care; here is a piece that my clerk brought this morning, the remainder of the piece. The prisoner at the bar, told Mr. Serjeant Kirby (which I am sorry to say) that he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing at that time? - We were then in the office I believe, his examination had been taken down, and then the examination was brought in; I believe the whole is my property, I have strong reason to say so; I bought fifty pieces in an wholesale house in the city, in one lot, in the month of May last, these fifty pieces were of the best match I ever saw, all of one shade or one colour. The place in my cutting shop where I keep them, there were nobody had so much access as myself, the clerk, and the prisoner at the bar; but from this room were lost thirteen pieces; the prisoner at the bar, has sold some in my workshop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in your presence? - It was not, but I can produce a witness that was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Will the witness speak to any property in this indictment? - Yes, as to the nankeen; (an apprentice of mine is in the court) but if your Lordship will please to hear me, if the gentlemen of the jury will please to look at the nankeens, which the prisoner has made up into garments, they will see if they are not all of one colour or not. Now here is a piece I have brought from home. Here is a black casimere waistcoat, the front part of it; that I verify believe has been in my shop these five years, the back part is of solicia woolen cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. First of all Mr. Morrison, as to the callico, or cotton waistcoats: Which are they callico, or cotton? - Some people call them cotton, and some callico, but speaking strictly, they are callico.</p>
               <p>Q. They are a very common pattern Mr. Morrison? - They are common.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought a considerable quantity from a considerable warehouse in the city? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There was other pieces, when you bought that of that pattern; When did you go back to that house? - It might be two months, I cannot tell to a week or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Two months! Perhaps you had not been after this two months? - Yes, I had on an average, every week.</p>
               <p>Q. This is so common a pattern, that many warehouses might have just the same sort of pattern; you do not mean to say, that they might not of course? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the nankeen; Is it English nankeen? - It is India nankeen.</p>
               <p>Q. You are, I presume, in a considerable line of business? - As much, as that I make shift to live by what I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You have at this time a considerable quantity of nankeen, as a taylor? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any at this time? - Yes, I have a half-piece, but not of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you bought any nankeen since you bought that? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much nankeen had you in the house when you missed that? - I cannot say how many yards, nor how many pieces exactly; they were in the cutting shop in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they taken out regularly by the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, and myself as we wanted them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now this black casimere waistcoat, there is nothing particular in it? - Only in the back of it, which I had the piece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080146"/>in my possession for this five years.</p>
               <p>Court to Lion. Look at the callico? - This callico, is the same piece which Mr. Morrison had in his possession, I am certain that Mr. Morrison had a peice of it in his house, and that a remnant, which no remains, corresponds exactly with it. On his examination in Queen's Square, he acknowledged it.</p>
               <p>Court. The examination, I understand was taken in writing, therefore we cannot hear that: Can you say any thing to the nankeens? - Mr. Morrison had a great quantity of it in the house; and to my certain knowledge there were thirteen pieces taken out of his house, I have every reason to believe it is the same nankeen, they correspond with those he had in the house, and as such I believe it to be Mr. Morrison's property, they correspond in colour and quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as for the waistcoat? - The back which is in this waistcoat, has been in Mr. Morrison's house, to my certain knowledge, two or three years; it is Solicia cloth, for pockets: Mr. Morrison, had several pieces of the same in his house, it is a very common cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. That Mr. Morrison has lost all the property contained in his indictment, I admit; but of all this property that has been mentioned, do you mean to say, that no other taylor in any other part of the town, of eminence equal to Mr. Morrison, might not have such? - He might have such callico, and such casimere waistcoats.</p>
               <p>Q. And every other article that is here, there is nothing peculiar to any one of the articles that is here produced; that any other taylor might not have? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave every thing to my counsel.</p>

               <p>Court. Mr. Morrison, has said that that callico is a common thing? - I cannot say with respect to the pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Morrison has sworn, that he and his servant has been every where enquiring for these goods, and he could not find the pattern at all: Now I ask you, whether you believe that to be true? - I cannot say as to the pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you cannot say as to the pattern it may be uncommon? - It may or may not, I do not know that I ever saw the pattern exactly.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two more witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Watton. We have had sixteen bags in all.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brookes. Where did you get it from? - I had it delivered to me by Mr. Wimp, Saturday noon, about twelve o'clock, great cart load.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was it delivered to you by Wimp? - About the 12th of October Wimp called at my house with a bit of red cloth and a bit of white cloth, and desired to know if I would buy any, he said, there was a great quantity of it, as much as a thousand yards; I told him it would not suit me to buy it; but I knew a gentleman of credit in the city that probably might buy it. I went to Rankin, of Change-alley, with the samples; he desired me to leave them, and he would take an opportunity of looking at them. I called on him again, he said he had not had an opportunity of looking at them; I waited on him again, and then he said, if they were as good as the samples, he would have them; he said he should like to be satisfied with a sight of them before he bought them; I told him that I should wish he should; and he appointed to be at my house the 25th of October. He saw them delivered out of the cart; he uncut one of the bags himself; he said, Brookes, you have been imposed upon, the cloth is not like the sample, and it being in small quantities they will not suit me to buy them, being small lengths and short pieces; I told the man to take them away again, as they would not suit Mr. Rankin, I had no business with them; but he would not take them again, and they were all put in my room at that time. In the evening, while I was gone to Mr. Rankin's house to tell him how I was circumstanced about the cloth, I learned that Mr. Maitland and Mr. Townsend had called at my house; I did not see Mr. Maitland till Sunday morning; I went to Bow-street after him, but I found he was gone, and at my house he was kind enough to call again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080150"/>on Sunday, he said he had every reason to believe that they were his cloths.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of something that passed between you and Mr. Maitland you went to Bow-street on Monday, and Wimp was there? - Yes, and the other man. Not meeting with Mr. Maitland at home, I went to Mr. Jennings, my attorney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe there is a little part of the story does not occur to your recollection. I believe after Mr. Rankin would not buy these things; you went to Wimp to get him to take back these things? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his conduct on the occasion? - I went a third time to his house before I could get to see him, the last time was about seven o'clock in the evening; he said, you have bought the cloths; he wanted to force them on me; he said to Mr. Townsend, mind you found them at Mr. Brookes's house, you have not found them at mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever made any contract with Wimp to buy the things of him? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever intend to make such a contract with Wimp? - Never. I acted as agent; I took the sample to Mr. Rankin.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose did he bring them to you? - He said they had so much measured to them, and out of that they had so many garments to cut, and by their ingenuity in laying the patterns, they could save something, and that was their perquisites. Mr. Prime and Mr. Davis said so.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now only enquiring about Prime; if any body was in company with him, you may tell me about what they did altogether.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080151"/>Q. Do you know some workmen of Mr. Gilpin? - I know Mr. Allen, Mr. Gilpin's foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Casey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never desired them to get some cloth from their master, and you would treat them with a supper? Did you ever treat them with a supper? - I did, but not on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. During that supper, did not you desire them to get some cloth from their masters? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did you treat these workmen? you knew Mr. Gilpin was a taylor? - I did not know he was an army taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. How much might your supper cost you,that you treated them with? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you there? - I cannot tell, it cost me a guinea I believe, what there was I paid for.</p>

               <p>Q. Now I ask you when did you receive this particular cloth now before us? - It was sometime in October last, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not six the day? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they sent you to prison when you appeared at Bow-street? - Sent me to prison, for what?</p>

               <p>Court. Were you sent to prison or not? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Were you never in custody, was not you sent in custody to appear again as a witness? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Maitland. I do not know whether that falls within your knowledge, the value of a yard of cloth? - It is within five shillings and six-pence and six shillings the selling value; that cloth would sell for five shillings and six-pence, or better, to thy army clothiers.</p>
               <p>Q. Is two shillings and six-pence or three shillings and six pence, any thing near the value? - It is considerably under the prime cost; there is a very small profit on things of that sort.</p>

               <p>Q. And he has such cloths as these. Who does he receive his cloths from? - Chiefly from Mr. Maitland.</p>

               <p>Q. Were such cloth as this what he was employed upon in your house? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this piece of cloth; that piece of cloth is capable of being turned to many uses to your master? - Yes, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was such pieces of cloth ever considered as perquisites? - Never, there are no perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. You disallow all perquisites whatever; I understand you gave very large wages to this cutter? - Yes, they have twenty-four shillings a week, and eight shillings besides, and their victuals when they are very busy; they knew there were no perquisites; Mr. Wimp once called on me, that is here, to know if there were no perquisites.</p>
               <p>Q. We must not have the conversation between you and Mr. Wimp. Have they any right in your business, or are they allowed to take any articles out of your shop? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the fort of cloth your master had from Mr. Maitland and Mr. Fludyer, and the prisoner was at work upon it? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Davison's christian name? - Alexander.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a book, and in that book you enter the remnants that are returned? - When they have a particular size of coats or waistcoats, they go on cutting,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080152"/>and to what is left, they put down a remnant left; this sort of cloth out of which dragoons cloaks are cut, in every piece of cloth there is some left, and it is converted into other purposes, we make waistcoats and breeches of it.</p>
               <p>Court. The cloak requires a large sweep of cloth, of course? - It does.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Is not a remnant of that size of use, so as to be capable of being converted to other purposes? - It is.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not know his character before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark on this cloth by which you can identify it? - The only mark is the round circle from whence the cloak is cut, and this is the manner in which it is left.</p>
               <p>Q. As this Mr. Wimp was a large dealer, he might have had it from other clothiers? - He might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to speak a few words if you please. I met Mr. Wimp frequently in the street, knowing him perfectly well, Mr. Wimp did apply to me in White Horse-yard, Stanhope-street, to get him some pieces of cloth; I told him I had no such perquisites; says I, you had better come to Mr. Sheddon about it. I never took a morsel of cloth in my life, he has accused me with it because I am a particular acquaintance of his; in fact he has asked me to supply him with cloth, but I know nothing of the cloth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Mr. Sheddon. This man was continued in your employment, and, I suppose, you thought him an honest man? - That was not the case; he was not in the service at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever discharged him? - No, I had not, but he left my service on the 29th of October, when I had first the intelligence of the cloth being gone, and he heard of it, and left his work.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you found him at the house of call, where your men use? - I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

                        targets="t17941208-39-victim615 t17941208-39-viclabel231"/>? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever employ the prisoner on board that craft? - He came down on the 17th of July, with a recommendation from Mr. Bristol; I took him on board the 23d, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in your service? - From that time till he was taken up, the 23d or 24th of October. It was my intention to engage him as a navigating captain; we made no agreement what I was to give him, for I wished to try him some time before I made an agreement. The person who sent him me informed me that he would be content with fifteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was on board this craft, did you miss any thing? - On board that vessel I missed a great number of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Articles of wearing apparel? - Yes. I often enquired about my things, and he used to say that Sinclair had taken them, or some one else. On the 11th of October I went down to the Nore; on the Sunday I returned, but on the same day, Sunday, we took on board a boy, who is a witness. Having some thing to do on board, I stayed off Greenwich a whole week. On Saturday, the 18th of October, (I had slept there every day from the preceding Saturday) I went on shore to the Ship Tavern to get my dinner, and returned again to sleep at night, and returned to town, by the stage, the next day; when I returned again, my servant had put up a fine pair of silk stockings I saw, I suspected he might take these stockings, and before I went out I put them in such a position in the drawer, that they should not be moved without my knowing of it; I told him that I should put up every thing that I had in the vessel, and come to town; I told all that were there so; I also signified a wish that if I could be on board in time, I might see my things put up myself; when I returned from my dinner and got on board, there was a large basket, and my things were piled up in it; I asked where my cloaths were? he said they were all in that basket; and I went down into the cabbin, and my brother and he followed me; I had been down previous and looked over my drawers before, and finding no silk stockings in any drawers, I went on deck and prepared to go to town; I then asked him if every thing was there that belonged to me? they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080155"/>said every thing was gone to town except these things. When I got to town, I unpacked the things, and we took the things out of the basket, spread them on the floor, and examined them; some of the articles occured to me, particularly a pair of stockings and a pair of breeches, in short I missed all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you lose these articles from? - From the vessel Tilberina.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the vessel laying when you lost them? - At Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she laying when you saw her again? - In dock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say, that it was on the 18th of October that you missed these things? - On Saturday, the 18th of October, I left these stockings in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? - I missed the stockings particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the other things before? - Yes, but I had not missed the nankeen breeches; I had missed the iron vice before, and the cheese; I then missed the woollen cloth breeches, and the linen breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this gentleman has seen better days before now? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was very intimate with him, and he frequently dined with you at your table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us of a boy being turned away by him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That gave you great displeasure? - It certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the 19th of October that you directed a warrant to be taken out against this man? - It was on Monday night, which was the day after the Sunday, I found this miserable boy looking about the street, wanting to find my house, and I took him in, and the next day I ordered a warrant to be made out against this man.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a warrant for an assault against this boy? - It was; and I ordered a search warrant at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you execute the search warrant till the warrant for the assault on the boy was first disposed of? - I certainly did; I wanted to have him in custody at all events.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether this person's wife did not wash for you? - She did once. I left some linen foul, on board, and she took them home and washed them, and when he acquainted me with it, I said, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, I think, that you had bargained with him for about fifteen shillings a week? - No, I did not make any bargain with him; but I understood he would be satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you paid him a very different sum? - At the time that I was at Greenwich, this very Sunday, I had left in his hands a ten pounds note, and a guinea, over and above that account that we had settled, and he had cut out a leaf of the book in which the account was; that was produced before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever swear, Mr. Fitzgerald, that you owed him nothing? - I have said that I owed him nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear that? - If I was asked to swear it I would have sworn it, if it had been asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many messages were sent to you to attend on this charge against this man from the office? - I have got the messages here. I was taken extremely ill; afterwards I received a message from the office, on the 25th of October, and I then attended the magistrate with some witnesses, and these articles, not all of them, but a great many were produced before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged on his first examination? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged at all? - He was discharged by permission of the justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080156"/>; he was not discharged in point of law.</p>

               <p>Q. We don't want the point of law, we want the point of fact. - I will give you the point of fact. Before the justice I attended, and as I could not swear to the silk stockings, I produced the person who I bought them off, and the prisoner owned that the stockings were mine, but that they were taken by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged then? - No, a week afterwards, and I will tell you why -</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us why? - At this time, after my property was so proved, he had made an attempt to say that his wife was washing them; I said, what washing new stockings! new breeches! and then he said that his wife had packed them up by mistake.</p>
               <p>Court. Cannot you confine yourself to a little detail of the evidence? you are inexcusable going into these extranious matters, because you know what evidence is; you know that that is nothing at all to the case. I am very glad that every prosecutor is not a barrister.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. The magistrate wished me to be merciful on account of his age; after considering sometime, I said, I am very angry now and I will not determine in anger, I will take time to consider of it; but he shall not be sent to prison; but let him be kept at the constable's house, at my expence, till I am determined in my own mind whether I will prosecute him or no.</p>
               <p>Q. After being kept at the constable's house some time, was not he discharged out of custody? - He certainly was discharged by Mr. Staples.</p>
               <p>Q. To shew what state of mind you was in you wrote this paper, I believe, and caused it be posted it about town? - I certainly did.</p>
               <p>The paper read as follows;"Felony, and Shadwell police office.</p>

               <p>Court to Fitzgerald. It appears to me from the testimony you have given already on this place, you have yourself acknowledged that you was very much out of health of body and it appears you was very much out of health of mind, from the evidence that has been last produced, and I should recommend it to you that this trial proceed no further, and then perhaps that may put an end to it.</p>

I have said it, and do intend to prosecute the magistrate, by all legal means in my power; I have left a notice at Mr. Staples's house, that whether I should move the Court of King's Bench, or indict him as an accessary, would depend on the opinion of Mr. Erskine and Mr. Garrow.

               <p>Q. Did you go with a warrant to the house of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did, at Blackwall, to Mr. Perry's dockyard, on board the Tilberina, a pleasure boat.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the prisoner's house, I believe? - Yes, on the 23d of October, in Armitage-street, near Wapping; in consequence of a search warrant I searched the lodgings of Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at home? - No, he was then in custody for the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. You made a search in the prisoner's lodgings; what did you find there? - I found this property. (produces the articles.)</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had that in your custody ever since? - Yes, there are the articles I found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Is this man an honest man or not? what character does he bear in that respect? - I never heard any thing of him but as an honest man.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you went first of all to execute the warrant for an assault? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you executed the search warrant? - Yes, but on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hours was it after? - About three hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did the prisoner know that you was gone to search his lodgings? - No, not till I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - No, not particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about the property at any time to you? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Those things were found among a great number of the prisoner's own? - I went to the prisoner's house, and there were a vast number; of things which the prisoner's wife had partly washed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Not Mr. Fitzgerald's things? - No. Before this time I was conscious I had lost this handkerchief, and amongst these things I searched and found this handkerchief, and in the room in which I was, was the prisoner's eldest boy, I turned my back and he ran up stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This is not evidence against the prisoner, what his boy did.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say, concerning the loss of these things? - After the discharge of the man, by the justice, on the 25th of October; on the intercession of the magistrate, I agreed with him to delay the prosecution, till I could make up my mind about it, we were before the justice on the property lately mentioned; after I had given my testimony, and the other people theirs, the prisoner being there at the time, after the evidence was heard, the clerk demanded if I was determined to prosecute; I said unquestionably, upon that the prisoner said, what, prosecute an old man with three children! yes, said, I certainly, for you will only bring them up as bad as yourself.</p>
               <p>Court. Permit the counsel to put the questions; and you give the answers; let us all know our places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now come to Sunday the 26th, when you got the search warrant? - On Sunday afternoon, I obtained a warrant to search the house, No. 47; and I proceeded to the house No. 47, Armitage-street, Wapping; the house was kept by a woman, whom I understand, goes sometimes by the name of Young, and sometimes by the name of Bolton. After the first discovery of the things being lost. I took what pains I could to inform myself what things were lost; I proceeded, and went to the house, of one Dunbar, and got into the parlour where the prisoner was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner? - I said very little to him at first, I did not wish to have any conversation with him; he began to cry, and begged for mercy, and his wife went down on her knees.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - The constable must produce them (the goods produced) I was going to tell you, I have an inventory of the things that were on board the vessel, and many of the things were missing.</p>

I told him no, never; he said then I should have it again; I said that I would, but it should be by legal means. He however, admitted that the blanket and the tin case was mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I have the same character to give the gentlemen of the jury of this man, that I gave before.</p>
               <p>Court To Dunbar. Was you present at finding all these things? - I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house? - In the one pair of stairs room forward, some, and some of the articles were found in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - Laying about in the room, I did not find the whole of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they open? - Yes, I don't think that any of them were locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to you, that they were visible to persons that happened to come in? - I think they were.</p>
               <p>Q. For instance, if Mr. Fitzgerald had happened to come into the house, whether he would have seen the things? - Yes, I believe he might.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found this lawn handkerchief among some hair that was under the bed, I found the tea pot with a quantity of fish hooks in it, behind a bowl in the closet, on the left side of the fire place. I found all these articles that were put into the possession of Dunbar. The file drooped from a bed, from two blankets, which I was informed Smith claimed, these are dishes (taking them up) I found in the same bed-room, they were in the fire place, in which there was no grate.</p>
               <p>Q. Open? - Yes, it may be said to be open. I left about two dozen of plates and a wash-hand bason, and some other things; but I lost so many,</p>

               <p>Q. From what part of the house did he answer, as near as you can guess? - I thought his noise did not come from the cellar, which made me ask him where he was? he answered he was in the great room, I then asked him what he was doing there?</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you remember that you come down and would not let me go to the door? - When I called him out of the great room, I desired him not to go to the door, because if a ring came I would go myself, and I went down and let this young man in, and I went up stairs again, and when I came down, this Barker was gone out.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say you was not up stairs? - Yes, after you came in again, about three o'clock.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080165"/>Q. Did he give you more keys than one? - Yes, I have got two keys, I searched the prisoner and found two duplicates besides. Mr. Felsted told me he was robbed, and that the prisoner gave him this key, and that this key unlocked his drawer, in the prefence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply that key to any drawer? - I went up stairs with Mrs. Felsted, and locked and unlocked that drawer where Mrs. Felsted said the things were, with this key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present? - Not when I was up stairs, I then took him to the compter.</p>

               <p>Q. State how you came to go to his lodgings? - On that same day, Mr. Baldwin, at the Compter, sent to me, to know if I knew any thing of him, that same day in the evening of the 26th, I said no, I did not. They told me that he had made his escape from the Compter, and they asked me if I should know him again? I said I should, because I had a great scrummage with him in Cornhill, when he wanted to make his escape out of the coach. I was with him the next morning when he was apprehended in Frog-lane, Islington.</p>

               <p>Q. State what happened there. What part of the house or room did you take him? - In the one pair of stairs front room, he had got up the chimney, but that was before I saw him, he was in the room when he was taken, he was very black, it was at his lodgings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him in the room? - Mr. Hillier and Mr. Baldwin were up first, I was not in the room first, he was very black when he came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make a search there? - Mr. Hillier searched the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you take the key of me, or from Mr. Felsted? - From Mr. Felsted.</p>
               <p>Court to Ward. Is that a skeleton or not? - No, it is a very good key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it to open the drawer with facility? - It went rather tight, but it did lock and unlock it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner call at your house after the day that is stated he left Mr. Felsted? - I suppose about a week after he left Mr. Perry's; I remarked two rings on his fingers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice what kind of rings they were? - The one to the best of my knowledge, was a gold ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what kind of a ring the other was? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Is that a gold ring with an hair devise, set about with garnets? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Vaughan. Did you happen to see any money in his possession? - He gave me a guinea to change and I had no change.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have subpoenaed three witnesses since last Monday, and I could not get them served. I was going through a church yard, there was a lady going by and I saw the ring lay, and a lady said what is this? says I, a ring for me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prisoner. In what church yard was this? - In Allhallows church yard, London Wall, and they sent a little boy to me at the church door, and he went and fetched the church-warden out, and he took the ring from me and kept it a week, and I left it between eight and nine days, and I went again to him, and he gave me the ring; so in the course of time, when I had pledged all my clothes, for since I have left Mr. Felsted, I have pledged every thing that I had, and I pledged this ring also, and as to the other ring I had on my finger, it was a fourpenny ring that I bought to play with some girls; if I had taken this property from him I never would have come back for any thing of my wages, I never took a hap'worth of his in my life.(A paper from the prisoner read by the clerk of the Court.)</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am at present distressed and not able to see a counsellor, therefore humbly hope your lordship will humbly become my advocate. On the 27th of September last, as I was going along Allhallows church yard, I found the ring, which one Mr. Henly, who keeps a shop, observed; Mr. Henly told me it would be proper to leave it with the church-warden till I got an owner for it; I accordingly went and left the ring in the church-warden's possession, and I believe a week after I called at the church-warden's, and he said it was not worth advertising, and he returned me the ring, and being distressed I pledged it. I went to live with the prosecutor, and he would at first have a week's trial with me; the second day I was with him I found it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080167"/>not answer for me, and I desired him to provide himself with another in the course of a week, he said nothing then, but when he found I was going, he seemed angry, and when I was taking my things away, he said he would enquire further into my character; I told him he was welcome. In about three weeks after, being distressed and having been obliged to part with my clothes and the ring before mentioned, I went to the prosecutor, who charged me with this felony, and he took from me two keys, one of which his wife went up stairs with; and said it opened her drawers, and said she would have me hanged; I was sent to the compter, and in less than an hour after being there, a man asked me if I wanted to go out? I said, I did, and he let me go out, I went home to my own lodgings, where I was taken the next morning with a quantity of duplicates, but all my own property.</p>
               <p>The prisoner has subpoened Mr. Beck, the church-warden, and Mr. and Mrs. Henley, to prove the finding of the ring; and as to the key opening the drawer, it is only as the circumstance happens for it is the key that belonged to the trunk of a brother in-law of his, who was killed by a fall from his horse; and became the prisoner's property. Afterwards this key was lost for some time, he was obliged to break open the lock; and sold the trunk some time after this; and the key remained in his possession. The prisoner is charged with taking bank notes; yet, it must appear to your lordship, that your lordship cannot think he could have had such property in his hands, it is plain that he pledged his cloaths, as appears by the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Can you prove to the taking out of the subpoenas? - Yes, I took them out of Mr. Shelton's office.</p>

               <p>Q. You took them before a magistrate, and they were committed: What foundation had you to do that? - The foundation was, that the property was found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - No, it was produced to me in the course of an hour after the robbery was committed.</p>

I said to Spinoza, I will take hold of the little one, and told him to take hold of the other: I took hold of his hand and he had a sixpence in it; and the other witness said, the big one had dropped something, says he, he has dropped a watch, then says I, stop him and take him over to the Flower Pot, and examine him.</p>

               <p>Q. Is not that your hand writing, that signature? (the information shewn him) - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave exactly the same account as you do now? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told him that you found a knife? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us see the knife. It is not a common bread and cheese knife, as any body may have? Pray, sir, what has been your employment? - I am a confectioner by business.</p>

               <p>Q. He that seen your employment? - No, I go out to assist Mr. Jostling.</p>
               <p>Q. You have assisted, I believe, a considerable time in this sort of way. How long have you assisted him? - About six or eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You have gone with a good many men? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell me that? Was not you in some employment of this sort six or eight months ago? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you removed from some employment of this sort by my Lord Mayor? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you, on account of a little suspicion of your extorting six guineas from a man for putting off bad money? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been employed by one person or another in taking up persons? - About six or eight weeks, with Mr. Jostling.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been employed by any other person? - Not at all. only going with him, as I told you before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Three years? - It may be three years or four years, it may be later, or it may be sooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a reward? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you could guess to the amount of it, if you was to try? - I don't know that I could. What reward do you mean? I don't know what you mean by reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. What, pray, may the amount of the reward be? - According to a man's desert.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080171"/>Q. What amount may be the reward for a man convicted of burglary? - Forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if there are two, there are two forty pounds? - There may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say your motives are of such a public spirit that you don't expect any share of the reward if the men are convicted? - I do expect some share according to my merit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you along with Jostling, and concerned with him in advising this indictment for a burglary? - No otherwise than the robbery was committed, he indicted it as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>Q. These two young men were not committed for a burglary? - I cannot say; I believe, according to the evidence we gave, it was a burglary.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this, whether you was assisting Mr. Jostling in advising an indictment for a burglary? - No, I did not advise at all.</p>

               <p>(The watch case produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is mine; I know it by the dial plate, and I have the work in this box that belongs to it, it exactly sits; it is an unfinished watch; I can swear it is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It appears to be a very common sort of a watch? - It is a common one, it is a watch that can be sold as cheap as three guineas and a half, when it is finished.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing at all remarkable that a movement should go on four points like this? - Yet it would be very remarkable if you could find another; you might try five hundred and not do it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Good. I never saw the young man, Williams, in my life, before I was taken up, and put along with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Williams. I don't know any thing of the prisoner at the bar, I never saw any thing of him before I was taken into custody with him; when the two gentlemen came up they said they heard something drop from some body, they did not know who; and they swore when they were before the Lord Mayor, that nobody was passing at the time; when it is as public a place as any in London at seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Williams called one witness, who said, he never heard any harm in his character.</p>
               <p>Jostling. Please to ask this person if Williams was not discharged from the New Bastile the night before I took him.</p>

             came in, and said, Mr. Joseph's house was being robbed; I ran out, and went over to the house, and I saw the prisoner in the middle (Collings) with his hand in the window, and the window was about half a foot up; I saw him take out something white, but what it was I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. You are sure it was the prisoner? - I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be linen of any kind? - It appeared to be white linen; I went directly to the door, and knocked at the door, to let Mr. Joseph know of their being robbed; the two doors being shut, they did not come immediately to open the door, but when he see me be ran away, I never see him again till I see him the next day before the justice, and there I fixed on him among them all.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he been pointed out to you? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long have you been servant to Mrs. Jacobs? - About five months.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not of the same persuasion with them? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mr. Jacobs? - A watch maker and slop seller.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he any thing else? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. So Jacobs came home? - Yes, he came home, and with these words, that the jew over the way was being robbed, and I was frightened, and ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. So being alarmed, and frightened to death, you ran into the way of it. There were lights about Joseph's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Lamps? - Yes, there is a lamp at the corner, and lights of each side of his house, and a lamp opposite, it was as light as day.</p>
               <p>Q. Stay then; it was as light as day? - It was light enough that I could discern the prisoner, to take notice of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. We will talk about that by and by. There were lights about? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body has stated that there were no lights about Mr. Joseph's house, according to your evidence it cannot be true? - There were lights; Ratcliffe-highway is always lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us see a little about the prisoner Collings; you never see him before? - Never see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out considerably frightened and alarmed? - I went out with intention of alarming the people.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 19th of November; when did you attend the magistrate's? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say these prisoners were the only persons that were brought up at that time? - Yes, the only ones that were at the bar at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see them at the justice's till they were brought up to the bar? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080174"/>Q. You have had no conversation about this business since you was at the justice's? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. The subject of this felony has never been introduced in discourse? - Not to speak about it materially, it may be said that we shall have to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it may have been said that when you was to attend, you was to be sure to say that you recollected Collings? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said so to Jacobs? - I never converse with my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been attending? - Ever since Monday; now it is Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been talking on the subject, have not you? - It might be mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Jacobs said, mind you swear to Collings, or be sure that Collings is the person? - On my oath he never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of a reward? - No, I never heard of a reward depending on it, I did it for the good of the people.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday, the 19th of last month I was at the house of Mr. Jacobs, in Ratcliffe-highway; I drank tea there, and after tea we were sitting talking, and suddenly, the witness, Mr. Jacobs came in, in a kind of a fright, signifying that there were robbing his neighbours; he said they were robbing the shop over the way; in consequence of that I went out, following Mrs. Jacobs's servant, she went before me; when I came across the way, there is a public house next to the shop that was robbed; I saw the prisoner, which answers to the name of Young; he seemed as if coming from there; as I knew the shop was robbed, I took that notice of him, supposing him to be concerned with it, his bosom appeared to be full, with some shirts or shirts, it appeared very full. Mr. Jacobs's servant by this time was at the door, knocking at it, and I came up to her; it was some little difficulty before we could make them hear in the house inside, I perceived the window was open of the shop, it seemed to be a kind of a sash window; when we gained admission we found that they were inside of the parlour, which had a separate partition to it, and the door of that parlour was shut; the young man, an old man, and little girl, they all exclaimed with a great surprize.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoners? - I met Collings with the appearance of something in his breast, it appeared to be one or two shirts, it was white; but during the time I was knocking at the door, I observed one of them coming up to the door again, and on the maid saying here they come again, he turned off again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you see something peeping out from the breast, it might be an handkerchief or a shirt? - It was to appearance, one or two shirts, by the resemblance on the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard that the part of the charge is stealing shirts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any thing of bulk enough to have the same appearance, would you attempt to swear at about eight o'clock at night, merely by his passing you, that that was shirts, any more than it might be any thing of the same sort of bulk? - I do not say it was shirts, but I had every idea of thinking it was shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing it had been shirts, would you have known the difference? - I cannot swear it was shirts, I can only say it was the appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080175"/>Q. So, whether he had shirts, pocket handkerchiefs, or any thing else, you cannot say; you did not know Young before? - No, never in my life, either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that person that passed you was Young? - I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him previous to the time? - Never in my life, that I know of, I am a stranger here, I live at Portsmouth, seventy-two miles from here.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing of his countenance when he passed you from the public house? - He did not come out of the public house, but his passing by the light of the passage in the public house, it gave me an opportunity of seeing him distinctly; I identified him immediately at the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether you will swear to him now? - Yes, I will, as far as a man can with certainty.</p>
               <p>Q. Every man is liable to mistake. - Certainly; I see an instance of that at the office that night I was there.</p>
               <p>Court. I remember I tried three persons for a robbery and burglary and at the house of justice Penleaze, Mrs. Penleaze swore positively against two of these persons; there were six of them indicted at different times; all the opportunity she had of swearing to them, was, when she put aside the bed clothes, to enable her to breathe, and from that aperture she swore positively to these persons, the consequence of which was, the jury found them guilty of the robbery; I was not at all satisfied with the verdict, and I respited their execution, and it was from time to time postponed, until the six persons that had committed this robbery, were taken up for another offence, at Chester, and they were committed; and they confessed that they robbed this first house. Now that woman in that situation, swore positively to their persons, and she had an opportunity of observing their faces for a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts; and it was afterwards found that she was mistaken, and their lives were spared; here you had not the opportunity of observation that this woman had, and yet you positively swear that this was Young, that past you with something in his breast, but whether it was or no, it does not follow, that he had in his breast any part of this property.</p>

               <p>I went to Mr. Josephs on Wednesday night, between seven and eight o'clock; and as I was crossing over the way I saw two young men at the window as if they were looking at the shew glasses; I went and stood by them a little time, and then I knocked at the door, and went in to deliver some clean clothes, and get some dirty ones; while I was up stairs, I heard the child say, mammy, we are robbed; when I came down stairs Mr. Joseph said he was robbed of between three and four pounds worth of goods. I went home with my dirty linen, and I see no more that night; the next day I went to the justice's at Goodman's-fields, and I looked about, and I said this is the young man that stood at the window last night, only he had a red waistcoat on; and they said he has got it on now, but he has tucked it in.</p>
               <p>Q. You see him take nothing? - No, nothing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the cloth that it was in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the weight? - No, I guessed at the weight of it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing else that you can swear the sat to be yours by? - No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he can swear to the cloth, there is no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is no mark on the cloth, and it was not hemmed, it was just as it came out of the linen draper's shop, only dirty.</p>
               <p>- BRIDGEMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a tallow chandler; about seven o'clock in the morning the prisoner brought a lot of sat to sell on the 11th of November, and I looked at the sat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were do you live? - In Cannon-street road, commonly called the Newroad.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the prosecutor's house? - More than a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it brought in this cloth? - Yes, I looked at the fat and I looked at the prisoner, and I thought it was not got honestly by.</p>
               <p>Q. What sat was it? - The fat from the inside of a bullock. I asked him whose sat it was? - he said it was Mr. Wright's in Ratclisse-highway; I gave him to understand that I would send to Mr. Wright's, he then said he found it, I sent for an officer and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever shew it to the prosecutor, Mr. Williams? - I gave charge of him to Dunbar, the officer, and in the course of the day it went to Mr. Staples, and it was kept there till it was enquired about.</p>
               <p>- DUNBAR sworn.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done with the cloth? - Mr. Bridgeman took the cloth by order of the magistrate. (The cloth produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the cloth, are you sure that is the cloth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said the cloth was two yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Mrs. Williams did you say so? - No, nothing like it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to work at Ratcliff highway, where the great fire was, and I found it in the highway, and I was going to take it to the tallow chandler's, I did not know what to do with it any where else.</p>

When I stopped her I asked her what she had, says I, My dear, I believe you have pots here. No, Says she, sir I have not; she repeated that two or three times; then I turned her cloak on one side and I said, Now my dear you see that I see they are pots. She had six pints and two quarts; then I took her into custody and took her home to my own house; the pots she carried in her apron all the way back, and I led her by the arm. I have kept the pots since. Then I sent for one of my neighbours, a publican, his name is Mr. Blackburn, and he sent for a constable. (The pots produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my pot, it has the name on of the man that I succeeded in the house, (Green.) and I bought all his things.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker's servant. On Monday the 17th of November, the prisoner at the bar, about half past three o'clock in the afternoon, came into our house, situated in York-street, Westminster, she offered this sheet to pledge, on taking the sheet, I saw a figure of three on it, and it appeared to me, at first sight, as though a mark had been picked out, and from the fineness of the sheet, I had a very strong suspicion that she had not come honestly by it, she offered it as her own, it is a very large sheet, it is about three yards and half in length, and ellwide linen. In consequence of this I asked her several questions, she gave me several unsatisfactory answers, I perceived something in her apron, and just taking down her apron, I see this other sheet, that confirmed my suspicions, because on one there was the whole initial in full. I. T. A, and the same Number, on which I did not inspect the other sheet any farther, but concluded at once that the mark was picked out of this that she offered, in consequence of this, I sent off immediately to the police office, and got a constable and gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080184"/>Q. Did you see Miss Sharp at the office? - I did, the next day, and she claimed the sheet.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable at the police office, Queen's-square; I took her into custody, I know little further than having charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the goods? - The pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Pawnbroker. I have kept the goods the whole time.</p>
               <p>Miss Sharp. These two sheets I delivered to the prisoner, they are Mr. Jones's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came to my day's work at five o'clock in the morning, at three o'clock my mistress gave me leave to go for these pair of sheets, and I used to go to Mr. Jones's one Monday for the sheets, and carry them clean the next. I went about three o'clock, and after I had been in for the sheets, and come out, I met a woman, that asked me to buy a pair of shoes for one shilling, and I saw a pawnbroker's facing me, and I ran into the door, and asked him for a shilling for that sheet, and he looked at the sheet, and asked me whose it was? - I said, it is mine, and I said I would come as soon as I had done with the day's work, and fetch it out, and he sent to Queen's-square for a constable, and he took me to the justice's, and I never see the justice in my life before. I have had three gentlemen to speak for me here, four days.</p>

I did see some stays on her arm at the public house, and when she came to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was he in your employ? - It is nearly two years since he came to my employ, he came to learn my business, I am a bedstead maker, we had an agreement between us, he was to give so much money to learn the business, it was an agreement by word of mouth, and I suppose it was six months before he could pay me the money as fast as I requested it, and about six months he offered a watch he had to me as a part of the payment of the money, which I took the watch, and gave him two guineas and a half for it, so we continued, and I sold the watch to Mr. Flemmell.</p>

               <p>Q. Has he industriously applied himself to the business in order to learn it? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer the watch to you openly as an honest man? - He did, there was another man in the court that he offered it to, but that man hung back, and I had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he say he came by them? - He told me that a man his wife did washing for owed some money, which he thought it right to detain the things, and it so happened that the man could not pay, and he offered him this watch for some money in part of payment. The prisoner served me duly and truly for two years.</p>

I said yes, says he, then the thief is fast enough, he is in the watch-house, but he has very illused the men that took him. I see him the next morning at Queen-square. I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again? - No, because I only see his back and a jacket,</p>
               <p>Q. Was he such a person, as the person to you appeared to be, that you saw take the cheese off the counter? - I only saw the back of a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Are the cheeses your's? - They are to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>As Mr. Dungate and I were going from the office, (I belong to the office at Queen's-square) just as we passed the end of Crown-court, we heard something fall. I immediately turned to look what fell, and I heard somebody cry out stop thief, with a faint voice; in a few minutes afterwards we walked towards the corner, and we met a woman, that told us that a man had stole two cheeses, and the thief had gone up Charles-street, towards Duke-street. I immediately pursued him up Charles-street, into Duke-street, from thence to Delahaye-street; in Delahaye-street, I asked two women if they saw a man run past, they said no. I immediately concluded that the man had gone up Gardner's-lane, and we went up there, and we had not gone but a little way, before we met the prisoner with the two cheeses under his left arm. We immediately seized him, my partner on one side and I on the other, and he asked us directly what we wanted with him? we told him he was our prisoner, and he should go along with us; he immediately dropped the cheese from under his arm, and made a cut at my partner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080188"/>with a knife which he had in his hand; when he found that, he struck him over the arm with the truncheon, and said if he did not drop his knife, he would break his arm. With that he swore he would do our business for us if we did not let him go; we told him we would not, in a few minutes, after some struggling, I received a cut over my hand, it is almost well now. We scuffled with him for about twenty minutes, and at last we got him secured, and got him safe to the watch-house. Here is the cheeses here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I making water when you took me? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray sir, what did you say to me when I was in the lock up room in Queen's-square? - I told the prisoner, to the best of my knowledge, that he was not aware of us before we took him, which indeed he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say to that man we must swear, when we go before the justice that we took the cheeses from him, or else he will not be committed? - I did not say any thing of that sort; because he had got the cheeses under his arm and let them fall.</p>
               <p>- DUNGATE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going with my brother-officer along Charles-street; just behind Crown-court, I heard something fall, says I, there is a lamp broke; in a minute or two afterwards we heard the cry of stop thief, we went back to see what it was, and we saw a short gentlewoman that said she had been robbed of two cheeses. We saw a man round the corner, and I said it is ten to one if that is not him, we went into Delahaye-street, and just going down a gateway, we see the prisoner at the bar, with the two cheeses in his left arm, and the knife in the other hand; and we stopped him, and he dropped the cheeses immediately, and he cut me right across the eye, and then he attempted to strike my partner, and he struck him on the wrist; At last justice Addington happened to come by and he assisted to hold him while we took the knife away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he took any knife from me? - No, we lost the knife in the skussle, but we were cut.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can swear by them ark, they are my cheeses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About half an hour after eight, on Monday night, I was coming up the Stable-yard, and these cheeses lay, one lay on one side, and the other, on the other of me; and I was making water, and these men came up to me, and said I had stole the cheeses.</p>

He said he had been moving goods for his mother; he said that all was settled concerning his mother's lodging; and that he would be a lodger with me that night, as I had vacant beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to that? - Yes. He asked my shopman, whether he would drink share of a pint of beer? he agreed to that, and the prisoner went and setched a pint of porter. I went into the parlour, and I saw the prisoner stand near to the fire place.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay in the parlour? - Not above two minutes, I believe; I saw the prisoner stand at the fire place, with his back towards the shop. I have two rails of boots hanging across the fire place; the fire place is not made use for a fire, there are boots hang up there for sale, over the two rails before the fire place, over the fire place are two shelves of boys shoes; a mantle shelf originally. I see the prisoner standing there, and there came in a person for some boys shoes, to have a pair, and another for a pair of boots. I cast my eyes towards the fire place, were the prisoner stood, and I see him put a something in his bosom, what it was I could not tell, I then went on his left hand side, and got as it were to see if I could see what it might be that he had, but as I came towards his left, he turned with his back towards me, and he pretended to be pulling boots down, of a different quality to what the customer wanted, at last he buttoned his coat up. I told my wife, Wilkes had got something, and when he had buttoned up, as he thought convenient, he went out at the back door, I followed him to about two yards of the back door, my back door goes into Leicester-street; and at the door I seized him by the collar, in Leicester-street, I then told him, Wilkes, you have got something in your bosom, but what it is I don't know. I then took him by the collar, and never quitted him till I delivered him up to one of the officers of Marlborough-street who searched him, and I stood present at the time, there was a pair of boots found on him, nothing found on him but that, at that present time; as they were going to lock him up, after I was bound over to appear against him for these pair of boots; I was sent for by the magistrate directly after, and when I went back at half after five, the magistrate produced forty duplicates.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot hear any thing about the production of those duplicates, because that is going to another fact, unless you then heard him say any thing relative to these boots? - He said, he hoped they would make it death, that he might die for the crime he had done, he was sensible of his guilt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. We don't want your sense of his expressions, we want the prisoner's sense.</p>
               <p>Q. So you see the prisoner putting something in his coat? - No, in his bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. He was helping a person on with some boots? - No, he was not, he was standing up at the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a person came in for a pair of boots? - There was.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep an old boot and shoe shop? - And new too.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether officially or not, the prisoner did pull down some boots to shew to this person? - He did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that before or after he had got the boots concealed? - Not till after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There was some person came in before the prisoner put a young in his bosom? - No, he had got the boots secured first.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is that from the prosecutor's house? - Very near a 
quarter of a mile, he desired me to take care of the man, to take him into custody, and to search him, and he rather resented it, he would not let me search him; I insisted on searching him, and I found these pair of boots between his shirt and flesh, buttoned up; the prosecutor was there, he said, that is my property, they have been in my possession ever since, and they are 
marked with my name.</p>

I immediately turned round and see the prisoner at the bar, who seemed to be endeavouring to get off; I immediately seized him by the collar, and charged him with having robbed me; he denied it of course, but finding I was determined not to quit with him, he pushed his hand suddenly from him, and out of his hand he dropped the canvas which contained the money that is mentioned in the indictment. I still had him by the collar, and stooped down on the ground to recover it, I could not find it, I requested a lady that stood immediately before for to move round a little, and she turned round and the bag tumbled down on the floor, I suppose from her clothes; I picked it up and put it into my pocket, I then called for a constable, a person came and took hold of him by the collar. There is one circumstance I forgot to mention, before I called for the constable he said, you have got your money, you had better say no more about it, for it will give you a great deal of trouble. When he got into the street he requested the person that had him in custody to let him walk by himself, he did so, and he then ran away; we followed him, and I overtook him and stopped him; he was not out of my sight. He was then conveyed to the Brown Bear, and given into the hands of a constable who searched him; the next day I attended at Bow-street, and was bound over to prosecute. This is the bag that contains the property.(Produces it.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask if he did not take it from between the women? - I took it from the floor, dropping from a lady that was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a great concourse of people there, and he took hold of me because I was very nigh him. - He stood next to me, from the position in which he stood I could not possibly conceive it was any other hand that was in my pocket.</p>

               <p>I am the door keeper of Covent Garden theatre. On the 18th of November there had been a great deal of confusion in the house, and the constable was obliged to go into the boxes to get some women out; during that time Mr. Wilkie brought the prisoner down to me to take care of him, as he brought him down to me he said, let me go, will you? the gentleman has got his property again, and there is no harm done. Says I, that will not do, you must go with me to the Brown Bear, so I took him by the collar, and he says, don't drag me along; says I, I will not, behave then like a gentleman, says he, I will; so at the end of Martlett court, he took to his heels and away he ran, and we went after him and took him again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I stand here in a very aukward situation, having no counsel, and therefore I hope you will take my case into consideration. On this evening I was taken, I went promiscuously to see this new pantomime which has lately come out, I had not been in the house above ten minutes, before this gentleman collared me, says I, what is that for; says he, you have got my purse, as I was standing next to him; with that, while he had me by the collar, he stoops down and picks it up from the ground between two women, the place was so very much crowded that I had not power to move, and he took and lugged me to the office, therefore, gentlemen, I hope you are convinced in your own breasts that I am not guilty of this felony. I had three witnesses for four days, but I don't know whether they are here now. I sent to Mr. Sheriff Brander, and I did not know he was dead, he knew me from a child.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman of St. Clement's Danes, in Stanhope-street, Clare-market. At two o'clock the 18th of November I was sitting in my box, and I saw the prisoner at the bar come by my box with two carcases on his back, I called to him and said, my brave fellow, what have you got there? he made me no answer; I then jumps out of my box and I said, my brave fellow, stop! and I seized him by the collar, and he throws the upper sheep against my breast, which throws me back about a yard. I jumps over the sheep, sprung my rattle, followed him, and cried stop thief, and in the course of twenty yards he throwed the other sheep down against the watch-box; in about twenty yards further he was stopped in Prince's-street, where there was no thoroughfare for man or horse. Mr. Jolly see the sheep and said they were his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never see the man before I see him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my sheep, I know them by the mark particularly by the side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I am at present distressed and not able to see a counsel, as your lordship is to be my judge, I humbly hope you will also become my advocate. My case really is as follows: On the 17th of November I worked all day at my business until eight o'clock at night, when a shopmate called on me and I went out with him to Charing-cross, and unfortunately staid out drinking with him till near two o'clock the next morning; returning home, I heard a rattle and noise among the watchmen, and being rather in liquor, went to where I heard it, when one of them laid hold on me and said I was the person. I told him I had been drinking with an old shopmate that was going to sea again, and it was curiosity that induced me to come to see what was the matter. All expostulation was in vain, he insisted I was the person that stole the carcases of the two dead sheep, that he saw me throw one at his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080193"/>watch-box, and run away with the other; I was taken before a magistrate, and he persevered in the same story. The magistrate, after hearing the charge, asked me if I was willing to go to sea? I said I had an aged mother and a wife and child that depended on my earnings, and I could keep them decent by my honest industry; I am but recovered very lately out of a severe fit of illness, never used to carry any load, nor ever in my life able to carry the carcases of two sheep; and I humbly submit to your lordship whether I am the person that could do the felony, and that the witnesses must be mistaken with respect to my person. There are some persons waiting to avouch to my character, that I am a good character and keep remarkable good hours.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. By what marks do you know these sheep to be yours? - Particular marks that we have in scoring the shoulder, I could swear to them if I had seen them a hundred miles about.</p>
               <p>Q. Does no other butcher mark in the same way? - Not in our market.</p>

               <p>I have the property. I went down like many others at the fire at Ratcliffe, the 23d of July, between five and six in the evening. In going home I called at a public house at White Horse-street, Stepney, which I formerly kept, drinking a pot with a friend I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately ran out of the house and saw the prisoner at the bar with a bundle in a blue apron under his arm, I stopped him and asked him what he had got there? he said, leather, and that he had found it in the street; I told him that I suspected he had stole it at the fire, and that I should detain him in custody, I took him into the house where I went out of, and a constable came in belonging to Stepney parish (his name is Germaine) then I told him I gave him charge of the prisoner at the bar, on suspicion of robbing some individual at the fire, and he had two examinations before justice Staples, then he was admitted to bail. On the 27th of November I had this summons sent me from justice Staples's, to give evidence concerning that property, which property when I left it at the police office it was sealed up. When I came to Shadwell office again it was opened to me, and there is one skin out of the four that I think to be the same property, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whatever it was that the prisoner had got, it was wrapped up when you see it, and on your asking what it was, he told you it was leather? - He did, and said he found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find out who the owner of this leather was? - I did not until I was sent for to the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the officers took from this man at the time they took him up? Did they take any money from him? - I took a guinea and three half-crowns from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the three half crowns are returned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the guinea kept by Germaine? - The prosecutor lives in the neighbourhood and can give an account.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Germaine is very ill, I don't think he will live long at any rate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gardiner. How far was this from the fire where you stopped the prisoner? - About one hundred yards from the fire at the time it was then burning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, I can swear to it by the piece of satinet.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did Germaine know where you lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did he come to you to enquire about it? - I think it was the second day, or two days afterwards. There were two or three shoemakers sent for besides, they did not own them and then they thought of me, on account of a mark that a leather seller or leather dresser knew, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not own it then? - I did own it as soon as I came up to the office. The prisoner was discharged at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have none of the gentlemen here who were assisting you in conveying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080195"/>these goods from your house to account how they carried them? - I have not.</p>

On Lord Mayor's day the prisoner sent me out on a message that he might have an opportunity of stealing my things; he sent me to the Prince Alfred public house, and told me that he had left threepence there for me to get a pint of beer, as he knew I was short of money. When I came there I asked the landlord if such a person had left threepence for me? he said he had not, and when his wife got up I asked her and she said he had not. When I went back to my room I found the things in the indictment, missing from the place where I live and work, it is in a garret, the prisoner slept and worked in the same place; after that I was obliged to open a subscription among some acquaintances to buy some more things; I was in great distress at that time, I never was in such distress in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do to find these things? - That happened a fortnight after or very near, on a Sunday evening my witness saw the man very near our house and he charged the man with an officer, knowing him to be the person that took my things, and when he was brought before the justice he was asked where he had pawned the things, he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I thought you meant the things that were stolen out of the room, I did not think that you meant the kit.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There were none pawned at all, the runner Blackiter found them in his possession.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I first came he worked for Mr. Hardy, and he spent all the money and pawned his coat, and had not a farthing of money left to support himself, and he owes me money to this day.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner brought the tools to your house? - He worked for me the 8th of November till the 25th, which happened on a Saturday night; he had no tools when he came first, I lent him some to work with, but afterwards he had these tools and worked with some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he begin to work with the tools? - I cannot say. When I went up to justice Colquohon's they asked me where he lodged, and I told them, and we went and searched the bedchamber to see if any tools were there, and there were none, and we went to look where we put our own tools of a Saturday night, and these tools were found there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You swore that I stole the sheets out of the room.</p>
               <p>Court to Witness. Is what he says true? - I know nothing at all about it. When he came before the justice he owned he had pawned the things; I went to the office again and there I saw the tools, and I knew they were my uncle's tools. The hammer and pincers have been in our house these ten years.</p>

               <p>Witness. He had a silk handkerchief which he desired me to take care of before we went before the justice; I told him I would take nothing in charge before I went before the justice. Mr. Blackiter has got it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor owed me one shilling and tenpence; his brother would not pay me nor his nephew, and they would not trust them over the way for a red herring. I worked with this man and he owed me the money, and he told me he should not stop long for he could earn but very little money, and he had a good mind to go to the parish, and he let me have the tools to work with because I was so good as to lend him money when his brother would not.</p>

               <p>Q. Are these sort of things common with other founders as well as your's? - Not that I know of, but if they did their patterns may not be exactly like them.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you be so good to look at these articles, and tell us where you had them from? - From the house of Mr. Botten. I am confident there are not such sword hilts made in this country, they were made for the first regiment of guards, and I made the whole of the core; with respect to this heel plate, it was made for the Prince of Wales, cast by one Barnet, in Cock-lane, about six years, and when the gun came to be stocked, this heel plate would not fit, and it has laid by in the warehouse ever since; the prisoner was employed at this time in my warehouse where these things lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me where he was employed on the 14th of November? - He had been employed all the week in the court. My house was much damaged in the riots in August last, and my house was repairing, and this man came to assist the other man that was constantly employed in the warehouse, and in the course of being there he took them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employed about the premises on the 28th of November? - He certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your warehouse to old Hannah's? - That is joining in the court to my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Then by any possibility could these things have got into old Hannah's house at the time of the fire? - No, they were never removed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mrs. Story after this information? - I went immediately to Mr. Bottens to look over the brass myself, and in looking over it I found this half moon cross, which is for a Turkish cymeter, with this pattern pommell to cast from. This is a pattern that was made for the first regiment of foot guards, for the serjeants, for to cast from, and was never used but for that regiment; it has been broke since it was stolen out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Mrs. Story? - The following day about two or three o'clock, I went to her own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, in consequence of any thing you communicated to her, come to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080199"/>your premises? - Yes, she did, and when she came there I called all the men up into the dining room, Mr. Kirby was there, there was about twenty-five or thirty men; she said it was none of them there. It then struck me that it might be the carpenters; the carpenters were coming out of Mrs. Hannah's house, and I desired this man, as being employed there, to come in. He seemed to have an objection, but the other man that was with him asked him, and he came in; then I called Mrs. Story down, and she pitched on him; there were three or four with him of his partners as they call them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - No, he did not say a word.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your worship and gentlemen of the jury, I was at work next door to this gentleman's for some time, and my partner was at work some days for Mr. Nubley. On Monday, about half past eight o'clock, my partner came down to me and asked me, if I would lend him an hand to move a partition? according I went and took my hand saw in my hand, a chissel, and a hammer. I was there about two hours and a half assisting him; after I had done I took up my tools, went down stairs again, and then went to my own work, and was never in Mr. Nubley's house before nor since.</p>
               <p>Court to Nubley. When can you swear to seeing these things? - I can swear to seeing this box on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the morning following I came down, and I had a basket and a few tools in my basket, then I went to the shop and my partner was not there, then I went home again, and went to the shop again, and coming down to the shop I met my partner, and he told me he had been there and could not find me, and I knew no more of it till about twelve o'clock, when Mr. Nubley took me up. I was only two hours and a half at work at Mr. Nubley's, and my partner was there all the while, and I went up in my shirt sleeves, and went down with my shirt sleeves, and that gentleman was there all the time assisting me to move the partition himself, and his porter was there all the time himself.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman from the ship to the craft; I watch for Captain Starkey, about half after nine in the morning on Wednesday the 19th of November, I catched this man in the craft that I had in my charge, a lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did that lighter contain? - Seven hogsheads of sugar. He was filling a small bag by the side of a coal bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get at the sugar? - He broke the cask open, the other witness see him, and I jumped into the craft off the keys, and I said to the man, what business have you in the craft? I had just come down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the craft when you left it? - There was the king's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080200"/>watchman on the key; there was nobody left in the craft. This man was sitting in the public house.</p>

               <p>Q. How much might he take in all? - About eight pounds, it is here. He spilt about a dozen pounds of it.</p>

               <p>I am a ticket porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the robbery? - I was. I was on shore at Brewer's key, and I saw the prisoner at the bar in the craft, and desired him to come out, and he said he would not; and I saw him take part of the canter piece out of the hogshead, part of the head of it, I see him do that, and take out some sugar and put it into a bag; I called to the watchman, and the watchman jumped into the craft and seized him, and I see him sling the bag overboard, he threw it on shore, the watchman jumped after it; they tussled one another about, and I saw the watchman take the property from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell me to whom this sugar belonged? - No, I cannot tell, I had the working of the ship afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether at any time you had given any orders for any indigo to be brought to your house on the 8th of November? - I know I had not</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house? - About two hundred yards distant.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any indigo at that time in the warehouse? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners on that day, the 8th of November? - I was sent for by Mr. Stoyles to come to the warehouse, I then saw Walker by the warehouse door in the passage leading from the warehouse into the street; Gifford was gone before I came. Mr. Stoyles told me that he had detected Walker and Gifford in stealing a seron of indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a packet of indigo? - Yes, I asked him in what manner? he said there was a man with it on his shoulder; that one of them was guiding it out of the warehouse while the other was looking out to see if any body was coming, and that he came there by accident, and that on his asking what the man had got on his shoulder, Walker desired the man to put it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came there by accident? - Mr. Stoyles, he was not coming to the warehouse, but he was coming that way. He said that when he accused Walker of it, Walker made no other answer than said, lork, Mr. Stoyles, how can you say so? on that I asked Mr. Walker if he knew nothing of the indigo, and what business he had in the warehouse at all? after some hesitation he said he came to look for a pocket book which be said he had lost, I then said I thought it was not proper for these men to have the keys.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was the packet of indigo laying there which you have been talking of? - The packet lay at the door wrapped up in a mat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether the door was then open or shut? - The door was then open.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the door secured with two keys? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there of that warehouse? - The Bull porters ought to keep one key, besides which there is a padlock belonging to the Custom-house officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that Custom-house officer? - Walker, he has always had the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the Bull porters or the warehousemen, if any thing is lost, have been answerable for it? - Yes, they would have had to pay for the indigo.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This seron of indigo was within-side of the warehouse, was not it? - It was when I see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Walker is a person whose business led him there of course? - He had no business there without he is desired to attend.</p>
               <p>Q. It is under the king's lock? - It is under the joint lock of the king and warehousemen.</p>
               <p>Court. What is Walker? - He is a Custom-house officer, a locker employed under the warehouse keeper, Mr. Chandler.</p>

               <p>Court. You say the indigo was covered with matting? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it was possible to be covered with the matting without being removed from the place in which it was situated? - No, certainly it could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Where are your warehouses situated? - In different parts of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this that is the object of enquiry? - In Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - I do perfectly, they are officers of the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what is deposited in your warehouses, and how you secure them? - There are a variety of goods, both under the excise and customs, and in that case the usual officers attend; when any thing of this kind is either taken in or delivered out, the officer of the excise or customs, which ever the case may require.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of November had there been any order to take in any goods or deliver any out? - Not to the best of my knowledge, there was none from myself, and I have made enquiry of my partners.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had must not either you or your partners attended? - That is the regular course.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed on that day? - On the 8th of November, passing by on the opposite side of the way, I discovered Mr. Gifford, supposing as I naturally did, that there was nothing that could call his attention there, I crossed over the way and rushed into the warehouse, where I met a man with a seron of, indigo. I met him in the passage between the two doors; between the warehouse and the street door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this passage under cover or is it an open passage? - Under cover. The man could not pass so readily as he would, and his load was abutting against the brick wall, and Mr. Gifford was conducting it in order to make it pass more easily. Mr. Walker on my entrance desired the man to throw it down; he said, throw it down, throw it down, two or three times he repeated it. The man did not immediately throw it down, but there were some chests of bark in the same warehouse, very near, about four feet high; he immediately put the seron of indigo on the chests of bark. When I got into the warehouse, I naturally felt about, I could not immediately see what the property was, during which time the porter and Mr. Gifford absconded; they got out of the warehouse as soon as they could. I groped about and felt what it was (it was rather dark where it was) and I soon felt what it was, and I desired Mr. Walker not to depart, and I shut the door on him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first see him, you say in the passage, you see him then, but when he returned and put it on the chests in the warehouse you could not see? - No, I could not rightly. I then sent to Mr. Cole, the only proprietor known, and he did not come down immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys are there to your warehouse? - I have one key as the warehouseman, and Mr. Walker has the other as locker.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Gifford any connection at all with that business? - Not that I know of, that led to the discovery.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you use to keep these keys? - In our compting house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080203"/>Q. Where is that? - I suppose it is about two hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you can recollect the last moment you saw it there? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. When had the warehouse been opened before? - Not the warehouse, but the stair foot door had been opened that morning before to deliver other goods.</p>

               <p>Q. Had this warehouse been at all opened that morning? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has the keys of the doors of the passage? - We have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body else a key to the outer door? - No, nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you two keys; a key to the outer door and one to the warehouse door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this seron of indigo in the same state as when you saw it before in the warehouse? - No, it had a mat all round it.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was in the warehouse it had nothing on it but the common skin it has on, but when you see it on the man's shoulder it was disguised by a mat or packet? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you did not know what it was at first, but afterwards you discovered? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right they had this in the passage of the warehouse? - Yes, they had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. I don't know whether you have had the good fortune to take the third man? - No, I have not, I thought they would have produced him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were it either of your men that was at work up stairs? - Yes, Wainwright.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you have partners? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What are their names? -

               <p>Q. In point of fact though nobody has a right except yourselves to open this passage door that you have described to my learned friend, yet I believe goods have been delivered by persons who have not a right to open the door? - Then it was without our knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it in point of fact? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard it? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say when you was in the street you first observed that somebody was in the warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at that time on the opposite side of the street? - I was. There was a little hatch that we look over, and I looked over the door and saw Gifford in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a porter that had this indigo on his shoulder, but he brushed off? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in Walker told him to throw it down two or three times? - Yes, and at last he did and ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say that you was on the opposite side of the way when you discovered Gifford? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Gifford when you saw him? - He was in the passage of the warehouse within the inner gate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told my learned friend just now that nobody could get into this warehouse, but in case of some order received, and your permission of the key? - It does not ought to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us just now that you have three partners, and they are not here; all that you can say to the jury is, that you gave no such orders? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The passage door we understand was open, and had been opened the morning before? - It had.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course other people were at work in the warehouse before? - People were at work at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080204"/>Q. I believe this was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning? - I believe rather later than that.</p>
               <p>Court. What sort of people were at work? - Another gang were at work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know a man of the name of Gallini? - It is Mr. Glenny I believe. I will correct you if I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any goods being delivered to him without your permission, or without your knowledge? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. He never applied to you? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You have been asked whether men were not at work in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the same warehouse? - No; in the warehouse above stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You was likewise asked whether merchants had goods delivered without your knowledge? Was it possible that they could get into the warehouse without having your key and the Custom house key, to get into your warehouse? - Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not this day a pay day? - I heard some thing of the kind afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walker. My counsel is in possession of every thing of facts, and I leave every thing to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to the warehouses of the prosecutor at any time after Mr. Walker was in custody? - On the 13th of November I went into the warehouses, and I found a pocket book belonging to Mr. Walker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. What did you say you was? - I have a place under government.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you heard any thing of the pocket book before? - I went in to deliver some chests of bark; I had heard from him that he had lost a pocket book there.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you looked, and there you found it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did it belong to, to Gifford, or Walker, or both? - To Walker.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to look for a pocket book? - I heard before the Lord Mayor that Mr. Stoyles said, that Walker was there under the pretence of looking for a pocket book.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts was this-pocket book? - About half a yard in on the left hand, in the inner warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it on a shelf where other books were kept, or was it in any other place? - As near as I can recollect it lay by the side of a chest of bark; there were no other books there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pocket book in which he had his private concerns, or a Custom house book? - His private concerns, I fancy; I never opened it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am at present in the India house, a warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you before that? - I was clerk to a ship broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know of having goods delivered to you without applying to the bull porters? - I have delivered goods without, from the warehouse in Chequer-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply then to the bull porters? - No, by no means. The ship brokers sent me there.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did you deliver? - Nankeen and other goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080205"/>Court. What warehouses are these, are they in the care of the bull porters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of the present bull porters? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you at the time? - There were three others employed by the same ship brokers; there were two of the ship brokers, and me, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Walker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he was a locker? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Q. How long have you known Walker? - About a twelve month, not quite so much.</p>

               <p>Q. During that time, what has been his character for honesty? - Undeniable.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Gifford? - Nearly as long; and his character is equally as good.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. What employment have you in the India house? - Lotting up goods for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lived with the ship brokers you used to go and deliver things out without the knowledge of the bull porters. Now I would wish to know whether they were only on one lock? - They had three locks, and the bull porters delivered the keys to me.</p>
               <p>Q. But without that you could not get in, without you break open the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You applied to them as for the owner of the goods? - The man who kept the bull porters authorised me to deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when they delivered the goods to you, did not you apply on behalf of the person that purchased the goods? - I applied on behalf of the brokers; but I made no application to the bull porters.</p>
               <p>Q. Just now you said that the bull porters delivered the keys to you? - The bull porters man has; they are all called bull porters, from the warehousemen to the labourers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this very often? - I have once or twice had the keys delivered into my hands, to get into this warehouse, by these lockers.</p>
               <p>Q. In this warehouse, were there goods of different persons, or only theirs? - Only theirs; the only things in the warehouse was their goods.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean then to swear the goods belonged to the ship owners? - Yes, or to the brokers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My learned friend talks about your getting into this warehouse; you could not get into this warehouse without the key? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you must have the key from the bull porters themselves, or persons who they have under them? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore when you wanted to get in, you got the keys of the bull porter, or of the bull porters servants? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do the bull porters servants come there? - About eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe you are the chief locker to this place? - I am the warehouse keeper on the part of the customs.</p>
               <p>Q. Walker was under you? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are there, if a person comes for any order of goods, if you or your servants are there, you deliver them? - If the duties are paid. The duties of this indigo has been paid some months back, and ought to have been out of my charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080206"/>Court. Who are the sort of persons you deliver them to? - When the duties are paid, they are out of my charge, the land waiter gives an order which exonerates me; in consequence of that, I 
give an order to the locker, there was a free warrant passed for the goods in question, ever since the 
13th of November 1793; a warrant 
signifying that the duties were paid.</p>


               <p>Q. If any person comes at the time you are there, claiming the goods with any order or commission about them, you of course would not oppose their taking them? - If the duties are paid, and his majesty's customs are paid, I have no authority to stop them, if a person comes as from the party that paid the duties, I should deliver them out, and conceive myself justified in so doing, I would not otherwise if the duties were not paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you to deliver them, or the lockers to deliver them? - The lockers deliver them according to the order he receives from me; for I am his superior officer.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say there had been an order made out for the delivery of the whole of this indigo? - There was an order.</p>
               <p>Q. This man, Walker, was your locker at that time? - He certainly was the locker, but this order was in May 1794.</p>
               <p>Q. Who makes out that order for the delivery? - The order for the delivery is from the landing waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make out the order for the delivery? - There is an order for delivering in May, 1794, the goods ought to have been considered as out of charge ever since November 1793. The landing waiter is the officer that lands the goods, and they are considered under his charge till they come under mine, when they come under mine, the goods are examined in the warehouse with my surveyor and the East India officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When do they first come to you? - Immediately after the landing, they are sent up to our warehouses, the goods then examined, and after examination, the duties are paid, either by the broker or agent; after that they remain under my custody, and when the duties are paid, it is the landing waiter who has the warrant, and gives possession, and who sends me an order for the delivery of such and such goods, describing them.</p>
               <p>Q. When is the intervention of this warrant? - The warrant is made out to the landing waiter, and from that warrant he sends me an order, under his own hand, to deliver so and so, he does not say to whom, or to what.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had there been an order to deliver the whole of this indigo, of which this was one seron? - Yes, this one remaining under that order.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore Walker must know that there was one seron to be delivered? - Yes, and that the duties were paid.(The court examines the order.)</p>
               <p>Court. Now I look at the order, it is, deliver the above-mentioned goods to Mr, Cole. As an officer of the customs, you ought to be cautious how you swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you give that order to? - I think it was to Mr. Cole's confidential clerk, Mr. King, and in that case, we say, to such a person or bearer. Here is another order that says only, deliver such and such goods without saying to whom</p>
               <p>Q. I see on this order, it is addressed to the locker of 154, is Walker the locker there? - Yes, the only locker there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whoever is at the warehouse may be imposed upon, and may deliver to a wrong person? - Undoubtedly he may.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Walker? - Ever since October 1793; ever since he has been appointed.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has be borne? - <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080207"/>An undeniable and unblemished character, I never suspected him, or I would never have appointed him, to such a situation as I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Perhaps, as Walker was under you, you can tell me whether all the goods were not delivered by virtue of that order? - I do not believe all were delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. I see that both these orders are signed by Walker as delivered, of course, these goods must be delivered. I ask you when they sign their goods delivered, whether it does not mean the delivery of all the goods that are charged to be delivered? - It certainly does. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I understand from you, that when they are signed, you would understand by the signing of them, that these specific goods have been delivered? - Undoubtedly, without they put down part delivered.</p>
               <p>Court. But these are both wrote delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is an order comes to you, or the locker attending, to deliver so many goods specified - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it necessarily follow, that you are to deliver them all at one time? - No, it does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they are not all delivered at one time, then that warrant is a warrant to deliver all that do remain after that time.</p>
               <p>Court. As to these warrants they are signed delivered? - We must sign that these goods have been delivered at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are the orders of the specific goods Walker has signed, these goods to be delivered. Don't you understand them as delivered, when he has signed them delivered? - I should understand them as such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Do you happen to know whether there was any indigo left in this warehouse after May, from the beginning of November? - I believe there has, only part taken at that time, the merchants take them away as they please after the duties are paid.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not speak positively what quantity of indigo was there? - I will not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know of any order of goods that was to be delivered on the 8th of November? - No, no order of mine that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been of any body else? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be of any body that has a right to be obeyed, if they had given such an order? - I don't know. A landing waiter might have sent such an order.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear of a land waiter sending an order? - But many times the orders are sent, not to me, but to the locker, and I don't know of them till the locker brings them to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Mr. Cole sent to you to complain? - He sent to me, and I attended him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you account for this transaction the same way as you do now? - I could not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. We know you could not, but I want to know whether you did? - I did not. I am not situated at the warehouse, my office is situated at some distance from the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then, every part of the business may be transacted without your knowing it? - No, with respect to receiving in, or delivering out, they render me an account.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no notice of this before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was it you looked back to these warrants, these orders, when you heard a man, whose cha<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080208"/>racter you have given, and who was in your own employ, charged with this offence? - I have the papers in my drawers. I looked for them the same day. or the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in your drawer, find these papers that you have produced? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not have been acting under that order now? - No, he had delivered that ever since May. I am the warehouse-keeper, and therefore all orders and directions the locker returns to me as vouchers of my authority, I had this order, but the warrant was not in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you deliver by virtue of the order. Pray is this door secured by different locks? - It is by the crown and the merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you who call yourself acting for the crown, have got to the warehouse, without the key entrusted to the merchant? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for that key, that day? - No, I do not, the locker receives the keys at eight o'clock in the morning, and afterwards they are in their possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The order had been made out as far back as May last? - I presume so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had a right to deliver out this parcel of indigo? - Undoubtedly, on the part of the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he have the key? - The workmen belonging to the Bull porters have the key in the warehouse, they are in possession of the keys, all of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if you was going there on business, you would not have gone back to the counting house to ask for the keys, if their servants were there? - If their servants are there they have the keys, they are in a bunch.</p>
               <p>Court. I understand you now; the free warrant that you stated to me, that was as long ago as May, the goods in that warrant might have been delivered as free from customs, but when there is a free warrant; still I see that is delivered at different times, as appears by this order; I sec by these two papers, these two papers that have been delivered, have come into your hands, because they are signed by them as delivered. Now I ask you this, that if in the month of November any more of these goods had been delivered, if in the ordinary course of business he had delivered such goods, would not the order have come back to you, if there had been a delivery? - There would have been no order for the delivery of the remaning things.</p>

               <p>Q. You have stated the free warrant released the goods from the customs, but we all know that they are not taken away at one time, for these warrants prove that as the owners want them, they apply to you, and you give them this order. In the month of May he returned you this order, as goods delivered, these specific goods, in these two orders do not take in the whole of the goods that are in the warehouse? - I don't know, they may take in the whole, because there are sundry other things, bark and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you this as a fact, whether on the state of this order, you will swear there was no indigo to be delivered? - No, I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if there had been any to deliver, and he had forgot, would he have returned the order to you, in the common course of business, signed by him as delivered by him? - Undoubtedly he would.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Walker called five witnesses, and Gifford thirteen, who gave them most excellent characters.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 27th of July last, I was walking down the <placeName id="t17941208-62-crimeloc360">Strand</placeName>

                        targets="t17941208-62-off359 t17941208-62-crimeloc360"/>, close by Child's door, the bankers, I observed the prisoner was <rs id="t17941208-62-deflabel361" type="occupation">selling apricots</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17941208-62-defend849 t17941208-62-deflabel361"/>; I bargained with him for five apricots, I gave him a shilling, he put it in his mouth to bite it, and returned it to me, and said it was a bad one; I gave him another, he affected to bite that also, and returned it to me, and said it was not a good one, and then I pulled out several shillings, and there was one with a head on, and he said, give me that with a head on; by that means he got at my hand, I had five or six shillings in my hand; after he had got a shilling out which he liked, he said he had not a six-pence, but if I would give him two more shillings he would give me half a crown I gave him two other shillings, and he was some time fumbling in his pocket for money and he pulled out a vast many half crowns, and I observed to him, good God, you have got a vast deal of bad money here, you must be an utterer of bad money; he offered me three or four half crowns which were bad ones, at last he gave me one which was a good one. I went into the Temple-gardens, when I got into the Temple-gardens I was very much dissatisfied that I had left the man, and I went up to one corner of the garden and examined my silver, and I observed three shillings quite bright, just new, that I could not have had in my possession without observing they were bad.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by quite bright? - As if they had not been in circulation; I could not have seen them in my possession without knowing of it. I knew I had not changed any of my silver that day, nor had I taken any silver in my possession that day. I was very much dissatisfied with myself, and I was determined to find the man; I came back and he was gone from the spot. I supposed he might be gone up towards the park; I followed him, at Somerset house I observed him, he was there selling his fruit, I went past him and took no notice, and I found two men that seemed connected coming to him and talking to him, sometimes taking the fruit out of his basket. I soon found that these two men were connected with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they exchange any thing else besides fruit? - I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they cross over frequently? - So often that I was pretty sure that they were connected with him, and I thought it would be rather dangerous to attack the man by myself, for I was determined to take him. I went to a constable, and all the time this man and another man of the name of Lazarus, were beating their way up towards the Park. The constable, whose name was Bewley, did not like to encounter this man, with the men that I told him of, and we found another constable of the name of Hyde. Bewley, after I spoke to him, said he would get another man and desired me to watch the prisoner, and I believe the prisoner observed that I watched him, for this man still kept going up by the side of him; they knew that I was watching them. When Hyde and the other constable came to me I pointed him out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080210"/>and they took him; I said, that was the man we took in the Strand, and he was carried up to St. Martin's watch-house. Lazarus, when he was taken, was at the distance of about five hundred yards; I had observed him before, but I did not know that he was alarmed at any thing that had passed between me and the prisoner; but in going up Round-court, Lazarus was making his escape another way. He was another Jew also selling fruit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he either of these two men that you saw at Somerset house? - No, he was another man selling fruit at about five hundred yards from this man; he was taken, but discharged. When the prisoner at the bar was taken, I did not observe those two men that had before kept by the side of him, but after he was in the watch-house these two men came to the door, and I desired the constable to go and take them. The moment the constable opened the outside door, these two men made their escape; these men were connected with him I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - After church in the morning, between one and two o'clock. Half after one.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was taking Franks to the watch-house did you meet Lazarus? - We met Lazarus, turned him about, and took him to the watch-house, and he threw something from him into the prisoner's basket; about six and thirty bad shillings. I told him the prisoner had enough to answer for without his throwing his bad silver in. The prisoner was searched, there was a good deal of good silver about him, indeed all that appeared about him was good.</p>
               <p>Q. How many shillings do you believe were changed? - Three, I have had them wrapped up in paper. They were very bright, they are now very much discoloured indeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When he returned you the three shillings back again, did you put them in your pocket before you went into the Temple-gardens? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you that about the person of the prisoner, though searched, there was no bad silver at all? - There did not appear to be any.</p>
               <p>Q. How much silver had he about him? - About two guineas worth, and all good.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that you state to be bad, and found, was thrown into the prisoner's basket? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any sixpences found about him? - Yes there were some.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehend that he changed the shillings by pulling them out of his mouth that he gave to you; - I suppose so, because he affected to bite those shillings I gave him, but I did not find any bit ones in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you at first two? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have had two in his mouth, and the shillings that you gave him in return must have remained in his mouth? - I don't know what he did with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you met him at Messrs. Child's house, and the time you went back again to Somerset house? - In the outside, twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man you had never seen before? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a good many jew boys in the streets, especially in the Strand, selling fruit, I take it for granted? - Yes, I don't remember any other that day but Lazarus and this. The two that were going with him were not dressed as selling fruit. One was dressed very genteelly and the other very shabby. I understand that the prisoner is a glass grinder by trade, but he sells fruit on Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080211"/>Q. We know very well that from the Temple to Somerset-house, there is no occasion for twenty minutes? - I went from Child's door to Temple gardens to meet Mrs. Redhead, who was there, and he was pursuing his journey on.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the money after he gave it you? Did you put it into your pocket? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put it with the other money? - I did. When he gave it me back I supposed that I might have given him the shilling.</p>
               <p>Court. When he was examined, did you find these bad half crowns about him? - Not one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them you do not know? - I can only guess.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I wish to know whether among the silver that was found on him, there were not some good half crowns among them? - There were, but these half crowns I had in my hand, and I am certain that they were bad.</p>
               <p>Court. You are sure that these three shillings you produce now, were not in your possession before your dealings with this man? - I am certain I could not have looked at them without knowing they were bad.</p>

               <p>Q. And what was in the basket when you looked at it? - It was all bad. I delivered it to the solicitor of the mint.</p>

               <p>I only know that I paid the money to my man, five shillings and sixpence. When he brought me the parcel he desired me to open it alone. I said I had no affairs of secresy, I would desire he would see me open it. He told me before I opened it who it was that gave it him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was done when I was in liquor; I own myself guilty of the fact. Judge Perryn has known me a great many years, and never knew any harm of me; it is a fact I never was guilty of before. I am forty years old. I have a wife and eleven children that I maintain, eight of my own and three of my sister's. I have distressed my parents so much through this misconduct that I have not troubled them. My father now serves Judge Perryn.</p>
