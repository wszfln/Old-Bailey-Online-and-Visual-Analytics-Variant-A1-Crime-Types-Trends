Before he went out of the shop, he told the prosecutor, that he had never done any thing of the kind before; he begged to be forgiven. Mr. Wrench said that he had missed bags before, he wished to know where he lived; the prisoner said any person that was willing might go and search his house, they would find nothing there. After he was in custody I went to his house, over Blackfriars Bridge, to search it; I found some bags in the bed room in a cup-board, and some cut up in a child's cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now produce that you found round his waist. - A. This large one was round his waist (producing it); some of these little ones were put up quite snug in the crown of his hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the cellar let. - A. No, the cellar could not be let, because of the common sewer running in it, I had the whole of the house and the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a way from the house into the cellar. - A. No, only from the street.</p>

               <p>Q.When you was in the cellar you could not get into the house. - A. No, there is no way but turning back the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at any time alarmed by any noise. A. I was sitting in the parlour about eleven o'clock in the evening, on the 13th of this month, I heard a noise in the cellar, I called to

            , and said there was somebody in the cellar; he was in the room with me, he lodges in the house; he went out and saw the turncock stand at the door; I ran instantly to the door with the candle in my hand, I saw part of my pipe laying over the flap of the cellar near a yard, I saw the remainder laying underneath the flap; I called out, Thieves, Watch, and seized hold of part of it; the constable came, I gave the pipe to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that pipe before: - A. It was impossible for me to see it; the New River company have occupied the cellar about two years, the steps were broke down.</p>
               <p>Q. This pipe you had not seen for a long time. A. The water came in the same afternoon, the pipe goes through the cellar; it must have been there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190006"/>the very same day, the water comes into the yard from that pipe; the door of the cellar was fastened by a nail on the outside, we never could keep a padlock on it; it was fastened at eight o'clock in the evening. I saw it myself, I went over it, and when I discovered the pipe laying there the nail was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards examine the pipe to see whether the pipe was unfixed from the wall or taken away. - A. I had the constable to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. After this evening did the water come in as usual. - A. No, no water can come in now, because the pipe is gone; we were obliged to stop it up, because the water would float the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put that pipe down in your cellar. A. It was put down five years ago, the man that had the house paid for it, I had the charge of it, and if any thing was gone I was to make it good, it belonged to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at all that night. - A. Yes, in the afternoon he had been to the next door taking the pipe out of the tree as they call it, he was a turncock to the New River company.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him did you. - A. Yes, he had been in my house that day; he was the last man that I should have thought of; he was taken to the watchhouse, I saw him at the watchhouse, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>Q. No part of the pipe was carried away further than the flap of the cellar door. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him with the pipe. - A. No.</p>
               <p>HENRY FIELDER sworn. Q. You were with Mrs. Dibble in the room that night. - A. Yes, she heard a noise at the cellar door as well as myself; she said to me, Fielder there is somebody at the cellar; I immediately ran out of the door, and saw the prisoner standing at the cellar door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing when you went out. - A. He was standing against it, he was just on the curb by the flap.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe him doing any thing at that time. - A. No, he had not anything with him at the time as I perceived. When I went to the door I asked him what he had been doing in the cellar, he cried out What, that is all the answer he gave me; I put my hand to the door, and there was his spoon-hook entangled with the pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stand still all the time while you examined. - A. Yes, he stood still all the time; I put my hand to shut the cellar door, I took hold of the hook which was entangled with the pipe; I says to him you have been and cut the lead pipe, he immediately rushed to me and snatched the hook out of my hand and ran away with it; in running he fell down, and when he rose again I found that one of his shoes was off, he was in George-court; then I heard his hook rattle against the pavement; by his running I perceived he had lost a shoe; I pursued him, he got into a stable, he having gained ground of me. I came back to Edmonds-court, my landlady says go to his lodgings in Green's-court; I went, and in less than five minutes he came there quite out of breath; I was standing just opposite, I took hold of him by the collar, he said it was not him, I said he was the man standing at the cellar door taking the leaden pipe away. He asked me to let him go. I told him I would not, I gave charge of him at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you examine this pipe to see whether it was broken or cut any where. - A. I did not examine it till the constable had got it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say when you saw it laying over the flap of the cellar whether it was cut or separated from the wall where it had been fixed - A. I did not observe whether it was cut or broken then, I know since that it had been broke off. The next morning I went into the cellar I observed the lead pipe was gone from wall to wall; the leaden pipe was fixed in the main and went from wall to wall of the foundation of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time that the pipe had been twisted off from wall to wall. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any part of the pipe left in. - A. There was part of the pipe left in the but in the value, I got it out, it matched with it; a part was missing, with a brass cock, before he was detected, that part we never saw again.</p>
               <p>JAMES SLADE sworn. I am a constable; about ten or fifteen minutes after eleven o'clock at night, I pursued him down Rupert-street, and missed him; I returned back to Mrs. Dibble's, there I found about a yard of the pipe out of the cellar, and a yard in the cellar; I took it up, it was entirely loose from the wall, I took it away; the prisoner was given into my charge at the watchhouse; there were about nine yards of pipe gone from the wall. The prisoner had this instrument in his hand at the watchhouse, I told him he must deliver it up to me, I was obliged to take it away from him by mere force.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call it. - A. They call it a spoon hook, it is what they use in their business, I took the lead to my own house, and marked it on the next morning; we examined the cellar, we found it was stripped off from wall-to wall, and this end of the pipe seems to match the end that was cut next to the but, the other end was gone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is only a spite against me: I am the turncock that belongs to the New River company; I informed against all that let the water run to waste, because a great many got no water, the foreman came along with me, and cut the pipes off, because they should not run it to waste. I was going into my door when they laid hold of me, they said I was going to steal the lead pipe; there is Mr. Nash, I took his water off; it is all their spite because I cut their water off.</p>

             sworn. Mrs. Courtice is my sister, I live with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you when this property was taken. - A. I was standing in the parlour adjoining the shop, I saw the prisoner in the shop, the cracking of the basket made me look towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the cracking of the basket. - A. It made a noise when he took it up, he took the basket off the table, I followed him immediately and cried out Stop thief, but soon lost sight of him; some gentlemen that heard our cries pursued him and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought back. - A. He was taken, I saw him again at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the person you saw at the watchhouse was the same that you saw in the shop. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lost sight of him. - A. Not long.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time had you a view of him. - A. I saw him distinctly take the basket of clothes out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You are positive to him. - A. I am positive to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a light in the shop. - A. Yes, a very good light, I had a very few minutes before that trimmed up the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing whether the door of the shop was secured before he came in. - A. A few minutes before I saw the prisoner come in the shop, I went into the shop, I found the shop door standing open, without being able to account how it came so; I shut it and put my knee against it to be sure the latch had catched.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it shut before that time. - A. It is generally kept shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very clear and positive that the latch took. - A. Yes, I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you to say that you had seen it open a very little while before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a fastening to the outside door as well as to the in. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that any person coming to the door and finding it shut, might open it for the purpose of coming into the shop. - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the usual way of your keeping your shop door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person coming there might let themselves in and out. - A. Just so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had not shut upshop. - A. No, we keep a green grocer's, we generally leave it unshut till about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The shutters were not put up nor the door fastened. - A. No, we always bolt it then, we do not shut up till after ten, this was rather before ten.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner before in your life. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard something crack in the shop, does your shop and parlour join together. - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. Hearing that noise of course it alarmed you. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And seeing a person in the shop of course you were more alarmed. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The very moment you saw the person that moment he went away. - A. Yes, he went away as fast as he could, and he had the basket in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was going out as fast as he could, I suppose he had his back towards you. - A. I had the side view of his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had only this momentary view of seeing him, and that only from his side face. - A. Yes, it was his side face that I saw him.</p>

            , the landlord's son, informed me that somebody was in my parlour, I directly went with my wife with the candle, I found the prisoner sitting on the bed; there was a pair of small clothes of mine and a gown of my wife's that were moved from one part of the room close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she them in her hands. - A. She had nothing in her hands.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the room were they removed. - A. From off a chair that stood at the window at the farthest part of the room from the entrance, they were removed close to the door; I laid hold of the prisoner and asked her what business she had there, she told me that she only wanted a lodging; I then told her I would give her one, I called for assistance, and then went down to the watch-house with her.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you had seen these breeches, waistcoat, and your wife's gown, how long was it before you found them at the door. - A. I pulled them off on the Sunday before the Monday that I found them there.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed on Sunday night. - A. No, about the middle of the day when I cleaned myself, I put my clothes by the seat of the window on the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see them in that place before they were moved. - A. I cannot say whether I noticed them after they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body might have moved them of your family. - A. There was nobody in that room but my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. From the Sunday to the time you discovered these things laying by the door, you had taken no notice whether the breeches had been removed or not. - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the waistcoat in the same place. - A. The waistcoat had lain there some time.</p>

             sworn. I was coming down the Strand about three weeks ago, to the best of my opinion about one o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you drunk or sober. - A. I was a little intoxicated, not much: I was going to my lodgings in Bowling-alley, White-Cross-street, I met the young woman, the prisoner, I enquired of her the way to Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you a stranger in London. - A. I was; with that she told me to go with her that night; I accordingly did; I went with her to Spencer's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where it was situated. - A. No, it was about a quarter of a mile from the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see in the house at the time. - A. No one but the woman; I staid there about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed. - A. No, I was in a bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. After being there twenty minutes did you go away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was there did you see any body there besides that woman. - A. Yes, I saw this man, Spencer; he came up stairs into the room and demanded some gin of me, I refused him, and said I had no money, she made answer that I had, that she see me put it in my pocket; at the same time he collared me, she put her hand in my breeches pocket and took the money out; he asked her to give him the money, she handed it to him; he laid down half a guinea of the money, and six-pence in silver, and some halfpence, and said that was all the money that I had got; I said it was not there was another half guinea and a seven shilling piece; he demanded me to go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up the money that he put on the table. - A. No, I said I would not go out of the house till I had got my money; he said he would take me before a justice; I told him I was willing to go there; I went down with him as far as the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the money. - A. The money was in the room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take your money up. - A. I was not getting all my money.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have taken the money off the table if you pleased. - A. No, I was in dread, I'd sooner be out than in.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you had talked to him, you said that was not all, you would go with him to a justice; you might have taken the money up, might not you. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out together, when you got to the door, what happened then. - A. He struck me at the door and pushed me out, and bawled out to the watchman, that I was robbing him; two watchmen come down and took both of us to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was not taken to the watchhouse. - A.No, she was left in the house; I went back with the watchman and got this money that was on the table in the room where I had been with the woman; the watchman took the woman to the watchhouse then.</p>
               <p>Q. The watchman took the money and the woman; she was then in the room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you were taken before the magistrate, they were committed to prison, and you were to prosecute. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of another half guinea and a seven shilling piece, how came you to know that you had so much money in your pocket. - A. In the morning when I went to work, I took a seven shilling piece, two half guineas, and six-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it from the morning till this time she put her hand in your pocket at the house. - A. Yes, I had, at breakfast time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it afterwards. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at work all day. - A. Yes, till seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from seven till one or two in the morning. - A. I was drinking at the public house; I spent eighteen-pence for my share in that one house with the landlord and some of my shopmates; I am a smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been long in London. - A. Two years next May.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged in this place called Bowling-alley. - A. Twelve months next March.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been working in the same place that day where you had been used to work some time. - A. No, I only worked there from Monday to this day at this place.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, having been so long in London,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190010"/>and having lodged a twelvemonth in the same place, not to know the way to your lodgings. - A. I had only been three days at work at that part of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put your hand into your pocket to take out any money after you went into the house with her. - A. No, not after I had been in the house with her; below stairs I was paying the half crown to the woman of the house, that let me in, for the room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had taken out your money, did you change it to pay that half crown. - A. I changed a crown piece in the morning; I had half a crown and one shilling and six-pence out of it, the eighteen pence I spent.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the morning. - A. I had two half guineas, a seven shilling piece, and a five shilling piece; that five shilling piece I changed at my breakfast in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you was not sober, do you recollect what past in the house. - A. Very well, I was sober enough to recollect afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man going in the house. - A. Not till he came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what the woman took from your pocket, nor what she gave him. - A. I did not, I had my money loose in one of my breeches pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that no money had dropped out of your pocket. - A. To my opinion not a farthing, because I searched my pocket, after she had taken the money away and I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you searched your pocket before. - A. No, after paying the half crown, I put all the money in again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you paid the half crown did you take all the money out of your pocket. - A. Yes, some halfpence and a half guinea I took out in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw the seven shilling piece. - A. Yes, I took out the half crown, and put the rest in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you put the rest in your pocket. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What piece are you sure that you took out of your pocket. - A. I am not sure whether it was a seven shilling piece or a half guinea that came up with the half crown and the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that woman is the woman. - A. Yes, and I am positive that that man was the man that was in the house.</p>
               <p>WOOLSTONCROFT. Q.(to prosecutor) You took me first to Chancery-lane. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>SPENCER. Q.(to prosecutor.) I want to know why you did not make an alarm in the house where you say you was robbed; you went out with me to get some liquor, and you passed the watchman that is here. - A. No.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman: on the morning of the 16th, between the hours of one and two in the morning, just near the New Church in the Strand, facing a private house in the Strand. I was called.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who called you. - A. I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the prosecutor, they both called watch, and gave charge of each other to me; I took them both to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they give charge of each other for. - A. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing of him, and the prisoner gave charge of the prosecutor for robbing of him; at the watchhouse the prosecutor explained the matter to the constable of the night, who ordered me to go back with the prosecutor to Marygold-court; we went up stairs along with the prosecutor, and found the money that he described that the man had laid upon the table, half a guinea, a six-pence, and some copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in bed in the room. - A. The woman prisoner was in bed; we took the money and the woman to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners searched that night. - A. They were not searched, the room and the bed was searched, nothing was found but what was on the table.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman, I stand at the corner of Marygold-court.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of this business till your brother watchman called you to go into the house. - A. That is all; I found the woman in the room, she was dressed and in bed; there was half a guinea on the table, a six-pence, and eleven pennyworth of halfpence, and two farthings; I searched the room, but not their persons.</p>
               <p>Woolstencroft's Defence. The first time I saw this man, I was coming down Fleet-street, he told me he wanted a lodging, he was very much intoxicated, he told me that he would pay for a bed if I would go with him; he took me to Mrs. Norman's in Chancery-lane, there he gave half a crown for a bed; the waiter seeing him so much intoxicated, said he would rather have him take his money back, and go about his business, the waiter gave him the half crown back again; he followed me down Temple Bar, where he squezed me round the neck; I could not get rid of him, I took him to this man's house, he gave this man's wife a half crown, he told her to give me one shilling and six-pence, and she had a shilling; when I went up into the bed room, this man, Spencer, says, my dear, to his wife, I shall lock them in, this gentleman says, I will not be locked in, can we have something to drink, I am an Irishman for ever, do you think I have no money; he put his money in his hand, he says there is half a guinea and some halfpence; they went down stairs, and what became of them I do not know; a woman came to this bed after they were gone out to get some liquor; I laid there an hour on the bed; I did not touch his money, I only told it, there was half a guinea, a six-pence and eleven pennyworth of halfpence, the watchman took it, and told me I must come up to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. When I have a strange person to have a nightly bed at my place, I make it a rule to ask them whether they will be padlocked in, that all may be right in the morning; I never went into the room, I asked him if he would be locked in, he said he would not be locked, immediately he says to me can you give me any thing to drink, I says I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190011"/>not know whether I can or no, he says we will go and try; he came down stairs, and at the bottom of Marygold-court he passed the watchman that has his stand there, he never said a word to him; after we had got a little further, I said I'll go no farther with you, he asked me which was the way to Bishopsgate-street; I still refused going any further with him, on which he called watch, and I called watch.</p>

About six o'clock on the 24th of January I went out of an errand (the candles were lighted in the shops), I double locked my door, I was gone about a quarter of an hour; when I came back I saw a number of people at the door, I went up to my door, I saw it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of force or violence on the door. - A. The lock was sadly bent with the force; I missed from my room my brother's coat, she had the coat in her hand, and the kettle was down on the ground by her, as she was standing at the door.</p>

             sworn. Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, he lodged at my house, in the same room with the prosecutor and this young man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190013"/>Q. Do you remember Waring going from his lodgings that afternoon. - A. Yes, he went out of the house that afternoon, but I did not take particular notice of the hour, I knew it was late in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in his room. - A. Yes, I was up one pair of stairs, I heard a noise in Waring's room I asked who was there; the prisoner said it is me; I went into the room, the prisoner was then sitting on the prosecutor's chest.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a noise was it. - A. It appeared to be lifting up something and letting it down again, I asked him what he was about, he seemed flurried and made me a foolish answer, said he was playing by himself; I came down stairs, and he followed me immediately, he went into the tap-room and I went into the bar and told my husband what I had heard. At the time there was a man that came into the taproom that fells pies, he came to the bar and asked change for a shilling; I examined the shilling, it was a bad one; I returned it to him; I watched him into the tap-room to see who he gave it to; I see him give it to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what he said to the prisoner. - A. No; he returned again to me, and asked change for a guinea, my husband gave him change for the guinea; I watched him into the taproom, he gave the change to the prisoner, we was very much alarmed, we called the prisoner out to ask him how he came by that money.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be alarmed. - A.Because I knew that the prisoner had no money, nor had he any for some time, we asked him how he came by the money, he denied having any, we searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who assisted in searching him. - A. This young man, the witness, the servant and myself (my husband was not present) we found two guineas upon him, half a guinea, two seven shilling pieces, two guineas, two shillings and sixpence in silver, and a few halfpence; I took care of the money, and delivered it to Mr. Griffiths the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us that you was alarmed, because the prisoner had no money; how did you know that. - A. Because five or six weeks before that my husband shipped him in a West Indiaman, he received a month's pay before he went; he returned again in little more than five weeks, and what money he took of the captain he had spent in coming home; he said he was discharged at Portsmouth; the captain gave him half a guinea, which he said brought him up, he said he had no money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.(to witness) Who am I to blame for this; did you see me go to that mans chest. - A. I did not see you go there, I saw you sit there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to witness) Did you find any bank notes upon him. - A. No, he took something out of his pocket and put in his mouth, which he swallowed; we concluded it was the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening was it that you searched him. - A. It was late in the afternoon, Waring was out at the time.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer, I produce the money which I took of Mrs. Ruach; I took the prisoner in custody; here is two guineas, one is bent, a half guinea, two seven shilling pieces, two shillings and six-pence in silver, and seven pence halfpenny in halfpence, which I gave him to buy him some bread and cheese in the morning; the two shillings and sixpence are good money.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mrs. Ruach) Whether that money that you gave the constable was the money that was taken out of the prisoner's pocket. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether one was a bent guinea. - A. I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This guinea I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You only know it by its being crooked. - A. That is all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have to say I have lost things in that house myself, I did not know where it went to. I lost one shirt the first day I came there, from inside the parlour, and the second shirt I lost was inside of the bar, and when I enquired about the shirt, the landlady said to my face, I had taken it out; I had not, why should I deny it, it was my own; if I had heaved it in the fire it was nothing to nobody. I know nothing about this charge, I got half a guinea from my captain, and half a guinea I had. I had two guineas and two seven shilling pieces given me in a bit of paper, when I went into the boat, as I was sick, I paid seven shillings to come up in the coach, and a shilling for the passage boat, and five pence I spent by the way, for a pot of beer; that woman says she knew I had no money; I gave her servant a seven shilling piece to change, she owes me a shilling of it now, I am in want of it.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever examined your plate yourself. A. Yes, and found some plate missing; when the constable came, I insisted upon that man to produce my articles, and I gave charge of him to the constable; the constable searched him, and found nothing on him; before the constable came I searched him myself, I found a bunch of keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Any duplicates. - A. The, duplicates were found afterwards; he voluntarily gave up the duplicates to me when the constable went down stairs with him to his room, the constable has them now.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable; I was going to search the prisoner, and he delivered up the duplicates of the property to me; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There are several things pawned on different days.</p>
               <p>Court. There is only one charge in this indictment, therefore what property can you best swear to. - A. I can swear to them all equally well.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am a pawnbroker; I live in Bulstrode-street, Marylebone. On the 11th of December the prisoner at the bar pawned a desert spoon and a tea spoon with me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my property, they have my cyphers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, I was servant to the prosecutor; one day I went to Mr. Hookham's library in Bond-street, to pay a little debt for my master, they could not give me change, I left a one pound note, and I then returned; Mr. Hookham's people not having given him the note, the next day he sent me with the money to pay the demand, and to receive the note, and on my not giving him the note the prosecutor grew angry; I pledged the tea spoon and the desert spoon, and then brought back a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that true. - A. Part of that is true; I bought a silver ticket at Hookham's in Bond-street, I left a one pound note on Monday, I desired him to call there and get the change, which was twelve shillings; I enquired of him why he had not the change, he said they had no change; I thought it very extraordinary, I very often bought tickets at Hookham's, and the man never came without the change; as he was a short time in my employment, I went to Hookham's, and they told me they had not given him the change, but the next morning he called there and got the change, and gave it me in the afternoon; so he had no occasion to pawn the spoons, because he had got the change before he took away the spoons.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by putting them up. - A. To put them in the bag and make up the bills, and to send them away and the money that was taken with them, and to distinguish between the paid letters and the unpaid, there is a bill made of them.</p>
               <p>Q. This was his duty. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so employed on the 29th of November. - A. I think he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, are you able to say whether on the 29th of November this is the bill that went up with the bag. - A. That is his writing, this bill went up with the paid letters on the 29th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did he use to come. - A. About half after three, to put up the four o'clock bag.</p>

               <p>Q. In the course of nineteen years you found him an honest servant. - A. An honest servant and a sober one, I never saw him disguised in liquor for the nineteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there with him ever any occasion to suppose that any thing was wrong. - A. Never, else I should not have kept him so long.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand this man is a hairdresser; out of kindness you employ him about half after three, to get the letters ready by four. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long has he been in this business of putting up letters. - A. About nineteen years by me, and about four months by my father, before I came home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then he had nothing at all to do with letters that had been received by others that were put in the drawer; therefore of course what might have been done he could not know any thing about it. - A. He could not till he come.</p>
               <p>Q. And after he had done he used to go away. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right with respect to the receiving of letters (and yours is a very large receiving house) during the whole course of time, from eight or nine o'clock in the morning, from the time they receive letters, till half after three, he had nothing at all to do with letters. - A. Nothing at all till that time.</p>
               <p>Q. All that he had to do was to take the letters and get them ready for this bag. - A. That was all.</p>
               <p>Q. He had nothing on earth to do with the receipt of any letters. - A. Nothing, except the time he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. That half hour that he was there. - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miers. You will admit, my lord, that it was towards the evening Mr. Snell put in that letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(to Mr. Snell) You thought that it was in the evening that you put in that letter. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190017"/>Q. What part of the day was it, evening or afternoon; was it before three or after three; will you venture to swear that it was before one or the other. A. I cannot charge my memory either one way or the other, I believe it was towards the evening.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Stevenson). Have you in the course of your business (that speaks for itself) entrusted this man with large sums of money. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always found him honest. - A. Always; I have given him large sums of money, and always found him honest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miers. I believe after the time that the prisoner came into the shop, he had the whole custody of the letters, I mean from half past three to five. - A. He made up the bag, and had the care of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When he was making up the letters for the messenger, before they were dispatched, they went through his hands while he put them up, A. Yes, and then he went away, after five o'clock he had not the care of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miers. What did he do when he came at five o'clock. - A. The paid letters did not go at four o'clock, he used to come again at twenty minutes, or a quarter before five o'clock, to make up the bag of the paid letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner send the bill with the paid letters and the money. - A. I do suppose that he did, it is his own writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. After he put the letters in the bag, and before he came at five o'clock, in whose possession did the bag remain in. - A. The bag goes at four o'clock, and from that time till five, the paid letters remain in the same position as all day long, in the drawer in the shop, till he comes to put them up at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. So that they remain in the open drawer from four o'clock, when you send the unpaid letters, till five. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is absent from four to five. - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. So you keep them in an open drawer. A. It is a way they have been kept for many years.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a very bad way; here is a list of letters sent on that day. and in this list this letter is not given.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner's Defence (read in court). My lord and gentlemen of the jury, I stand before you charged with the commission of an offence which the course of forty years of my life, and the uniform habit of distinguishing between the property of others, and the little I could call my own, has ever been regarded by me in common with every other breach of moral rectitude in the intercourse between man and man, with the utmost abhorrence. This misfortune has so destroyed my hopes of future peace, that had I not yet left sufficient to attach me even to a miserable existence, in the craving wants of a numerous and unprovided family, I should hardly care to preserve a life stained with the imputation of this crime: (for there are many who are always willing to judge harshly with the merely unfortunate and with whom 'tis the same thing to have been suspected as to be guilty) but would resign myself to either fate, and console myself in the reflection that, if I could live without reproach, I should die an honest man; but a wife and six children, the youngest not six years old, without a shilling in the world, call upon me to maintain my innocence; that upon you decision I may still have it in my power to perform for them the common duties of nature, as far as my lessened means and declining spirits may enable me to procure them bread. A father too of seventy five years of age looks to my acquittal before we part for ever. - For their sake and for his I am chiefly desirous to prolong my days, ever under the pressing and painful reflection, that I have stood before you arrainged for a capital offence and received from yourselves the judgement that gave me to my miserable family, or left me to prepare myself for another tribunal; where the innocent and the guilty cannot be confounded; and where the secret actions of all men are known.</p>

               <p>My health is too much affected by this change, and the confinement I have suffered and labouring under, an habitual difficulty in delivering myself in any situation not occurring to me in ordinary life, I beg the indulgence of the court, while I humbly state the ground on which I apprehend it will plainly appear that the prosecution is so far causeless, as respects the object now unfortunately before you.</p>
               <p>My situation has for the first time in my life taught me the necessity of calling to my memory the manner in which I have lived, 'till I had the misfortune to come under the suspicions of any man, and at the same time pointing out the circumstances connected with the prosecution against me, that shews the extreme improbability of my being at all connected in the offence that I am called upon to answer; for after having regularly served my apprenticeship to Mr. Wallis, of King-street, St. James's, who was a hair-dresser, I entered into the service of Mr. Stevenson, the father of the present Mr. Stevenson who keeps the post-office at Charing Cross, where the property in question is stated to have been lost; that was in 1786. The post office business was then received by him, so continued at his house, and by his son till the year 1803, when Mr. Stevenson removed into Panton-street, Leicester-square, during all which time I was constantly employed by the father and son, and for a considerable part of the time was desired to make myself useful to my master in the post office business; and I may safely and truly say, without the least doubt being entertained by either of my employers as to my fidelity to their private concerns, or to the public trust.</p>
               <p>In 1804 Mr. Stevenson returned to Charing Cross, and entered into business with Mr. Bird as a cheesemonger, in which line I could be of no use to them or to my family; Mr. Stevenson therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190020"/>gave up his business as a hair-dresser to

             (another old servant) and myself; in March 1805 Mr. Stevenson again took the post office business as before, and being fully satisfied of my honesty, I was engaged by him in the afternoon, from about half after three or four till five o'clock to make up the letters in readiness to be sent to the General Post Office; Mr. Stevenson having, from the length of my employment in that duty, found me of service to him on account of my ready knowledge of the rates of postage for paid letters. - During the long acquaintance with the nature of the post business, it has frequently happened that letters have been found in the box with property enclosed, but not sealed or made up, and it has occurred to me to meet with an instance of a letter being open, and without any direction, although it contained bank notes to a considerable amount; I discovered from whom it came, in the presence of Mr. Thomas, one of the witnesses, and the neglect of the writer was corrected; but I have never yet found any temptation that led me to forget my duty to others nor to myself. - None of the property which is the subject of this prosecution was put into my hands, nor did I ever see it unless it was with the other letters, and then I assert, with the confidence of a man who is conscious of his integrity, that it must have passed from my hands unnoticed and undistinguished from the rest, and that I am no more guilty of embezzling any one letter or its contents, than I am chargable for embezzling all the letters in the office. I understand the letters are stated to have been left at the office, and paid for some time (perhaps several hours) before I went to attend the forwarding of the letters received in the course of the day. Every person in the shop took in letters; it is the practice when paid letters are brought into the shop, in which there is only one counter, to put them into a loose and open drawer, which is placed on a shelf on the opposite side of the shop, not so high as to be out of the sight of any person of common stature.</p>
               <p>The money received for the postage of paid letters is generally put into the box with those letters, but as change is often wanted, it is not always kept apart; the account is made good out of the till, where in the hurry of business the postage are often thrown; but if I had been base enough to think of withholding any letters, I could not have found an opportunity in a retail shop, where there is full employment for two active partners and two servants, situated in a most public part of the town, and at the very time when the letters were crowding in from the different public offices, banking-houses, army agents, and other persons having considerable correspondence, especially of the common soldiers from their quarters at the guards, who for a quarter of an hour before the close of the post, are thronging into the office with letters. - Besides his business as a cheesemonger, Mr. Stevenson has been many years a collector of the house and window tax, and the tax upon property, for the principal ward in St. Martin's parish, and I have very often been entrusted by him with large sums of money to take to his banker's, and when he has had his receipts to pay over I have been sent by him with drafts on his bankers for seven or eight hundred pounds at a time; the neighbours did not think me unworthy of their trust, for I have frequently been sent by them with money for similar purposes, and other pecuniary affairs on their behalf, all of whom I believe have regarded my poverty and incumbrance as my greatest misfortune, and my integrity during more than twenty years knowledge of me, as my best and constant companion.</p>
               <p>I will not refer more to the actions of my life to shew how undeserving I am of this ruinous prosecution; but leave it to the witnesses, who in the hour of adversity have not forsaken the cause of innocence.</p>
               <p>The offences imputed to me are said to have been committed in November last. On the 17th of December following, 
               <persName id="t18060219-16-person219">Anthony</persName>
             the officer told me he had directions to take me to Mr. Parkin's, solicitor for the Post Office, and who I believe had previously examined every person in Mr. Stevenson's employ. After being examined, I was discharged, but the officer returned with me and searched my lodgings; I do not remember all the streets in going or returning; nothing appeared in consequence of these steps to impeach my conduct, and I was set at full liberty - to my wife I returned a husband, to my children a father, and to my master a servant, without any thing to disturb the peace of my mind. As my examination was the same as the rest, I resumed my employment without any reproach. The next day, as I was shaving Mr. Stevenson, I perceived a letter upon the table, from Mr. Parkin, the solicitor to the Post Office, on the subject of former enquiries; I observed to him that I saw he had another letter from the office about the money, and that they were determined to plague him; he answered, that he was called upon the business again.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of Dec. I was apprehended afresh, my person and lodging was searched as before, and when I had got into the office at Bow-street, I was astonished to find it stated before the magistrate, that a five pound note and parts of a two pound note had been found by some persons the next and following morning after I had attended Mr. Parkin, rolled up and in pieces, and that other pieces of the said notes had been found the following Thursday morning, and that they were found in or about the direction the officer and myself had gone, but at some distance apart, as I understood the examination at the time; upon this examination I was committed to prison, and remained in custody till the 7th of January, when I was a second time discharged, and returned to my business as usual, unconscious of any guilt or any danger. On the tenth of the same month I was taken into custody again, and committed to prison, and am now standing in the awful situation of one indicted for the commission of a felonious offence, and to answer with my life for the verdict of my country. - Here I may remark, that the man who can be dishonest, generally, as I imagine, resorts to some artifice to conceal it, and makes some attempts to escape punishment. Can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190021"/>it be believed that a man who had stolen a bank note, and of such a value as to be of easy circulation, without exciting any suspicions of the means by which the humblest individual could obtain it, would keep it by him for a month, although the common wants of his family required him to be constantly putting his hand in his needy pocket; that I who had been the last person called upon, and had previous information of the examination of others on the very same charge, should not remove every method of detection, if I had been guilty; that after being discharged I should return to my ordinary pursuits, and even after I had seen a letter on Mr. Stevenson's table, by which, and by his own declaration, I found the enquiry was not relinquished; that after all these warnings I should be so regardless of my personal safety, as to stay and meet the prosecution, rather than to have fled from justice, and have effectually destroyed the evidence that might tend to criminate me, unless I could rest my security upon my innocence!</p>
               <p>I must observe that on Tuesday evening, when I went to Mr. Parkin, the weather was frosty, that it thawed on Wednesday, and so continued on the Thursday; but as I know not whom to suspect of this offence, I shall confine myself to my own vindication, and to remark, that from the appearance of the notes they did not seem to me, when the pieces were produced at Bow-street, to have lain in the public streets, and particularly for so long a time; if I had forgotten my proper duty, and broken through the limits which every principle of common honesty prescribes, I must have had some motive in view, some purpose to gratify, that would have caused a reasonable suspicion of the means by which I lived; my weekly income did not exceed the sum of twenty-five shillings in the whole, and my mode of living kept pace with my circumstances; but notwithstanding I disposed of my income with a hand accustomed from necessity, as well as inclination, to make the most of every thing, I am in debt some few pounds to my baker and my butcher; and if I could reconcile an act of dishonesty to my conscience, I think I could not have been involved in difficulties of that kind - thank God, those persons have been indulgent to me, and though they find me without money, they do not suspect me of being without honesty.</p>
               <p>I have never known the feelings of a man who had offended the laws of his country, nor have I ever concerned myself about the means that such a man would probably take to screen himself from a deserved punishment, till within the walls of a prison, with nothing left to employ my mind but the sufferings of a miserable family, and the trouble of an almost broken heart: - these reflections have occurred to me, and I now present them to the consideration of an impartial judge and jury, into whose hands my fate is entrusted.</p>
               <p>The tears of a father, wife, and six children, call upon me to offer these observations, and although the peace of my mind is for ever destroyed, yet before your verdict shall restore me to my liberty, it is my duty to declare - and I now most solemnly declare, in the presence of Almighty God and my country, that I am not guilty of the offence for which I am indicted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Abbot. Q.(to Moss) From the inspection of these pieces of paper, are you able to say that they are all a part of the note put together again. - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Snell) Do you remember whether you put it into the drawer or give it to any body. - A. I threw it on the counter, it was post paid, and marked with red ink.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Whiston) Do you at all times receive the letters. - A. I do sometimes, and sometimes the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the drawer kept open or shut. - A. The drawer was kept open, there was no covering to it, so that any body might see the letters.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Stevenson or Bird) Did you ever take the money out of the drawer for change. - A.(Mr. Bird) We must do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever put change of equal value in it again. - A. We ought so to do, but I suppose sometimes we missed it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

No, he would not agree for the wages, he pretended he came with that intent, but I do not think he had any idea of shipping himself, only to take what he could; I was obliged to leave the ship to find him; I watched the door very narrowly, and at nine o'clock I found him; I took upon me to stand officer myself, it being plain to me that he knew where my property was; when I found him he had my handkerchief round his neck; the coat was found in his lodgings, it was altered and made a jacket of; I brought the tailor who altered it to the magistrate, he satisfied the magistrate that he had altered it; I produce the handkerchief and great coat, I can swear to them, they are mine; here is the piece the tailor cut off the coat.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you think he was sober. - A. I think he was, he turned round and walked up the court, it being no thoroughfare, he opened the gate and went into a stone mason's yard, where I stopped him; I produce the kettle, it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she go home with you. - A. Yes, just to have something to drink, and to have a dish of tea at my own house, and then she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing. - A. Yes, my necklace from my neck, which was two rows of gold beads, and a locket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that necklace on your neck when you was at the public house. - A. Yes, and when I went home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you took it off your neck when you got home. - A. No, I'had been rather ill, so I laid down on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been ill before you went to the public house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking. - A. No, I was very ill.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any more beer or gin at your lodgings. - A. I sent for a glass of gin to treat her for her kindness, my son fetched it for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall asleep when you was on the bed. A. I did; I left her with my own child to have a drop of tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you awake. - A. It might be an hour or two, I cannot say, but when I awoke she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that your necklace was on your neck when you laid down on the bed. - A. Yes, instantly I awoke, I missed my necklace just doing so (the witness putting her hand round her neck).</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the room besides your child, and you, and the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What age was the child. - A. Nine years old.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your necklace or any part of it afterwards. - A. Yes, on the same night, at about eight o'clock, the officer shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of your necklace. - A. I gave one pound four shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner a long time. - A. Only by being in the public house, having a pint of beer, she behaved very civil and very kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. What are you Mrs. Le Sadd. - A. I am a windster.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober. - A. I was not sober; I am sure I had my necklace on when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your husband at home with you in the room part of the time. - A. Yes, he insisted on her having something to drink for her goodness in seeing me home.</p>

I did not observe it then, I saw she had it on when she went out of the public house, it was a gold necklace, a double row of beads; I allowed them a dram a-piece; I went back to the room in the company of her man, whom I thought to be her husband; she was sitting and having some tea there; if I had known it was not her husband, I would not have had any thing to have said to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your wife, was she laying down. A. I do not think she was; I did not come back again till my daughter came and informed me the necklace was gone; my daughter informed me where to find her; I found her at another public house sitting on the pipe box; my daughter fetched an officer, she was searched, and the duplicate of the necklace was found on her; I went to the pawnbroker's and saw a part of the necklace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. The prisoner and your wife had been drinking too much. - A. They were not so well as if they had been at work.</p>

             sworn. I live at No. 5. Bateman's-row, Shoreditch; I am a cabinet-maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190025"/>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, he lodged with me for more than two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember him coming home on the 25th of January in the afternoon. - A. Yes, on Saturday evening between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He served his time to a farrier; lately he has drove a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he bring home that evening. - A. A black writing desk; I was at the top of the house at work, he called me down; when I came down he asked me to open it; by his desire I opened it, he looked in it, I looked over him, I did not put my hand in it, I saw nothing but two or three papers, I fastened it again, it was slightly fastened with a brad at the bottom; he took it in his hand, and asked me what it was worth, I gave him no answer, he said it was worth a pound or fifteen shillings, he said he would leave it there; I went to my employ again, I was very busy at that time, I believe he went out to his employ. My brother came to dine with me on Sunday, he had spoke to me to fix him a temporary desk against the partition of his house; he had seen this desk, I told him it was to be sold, he asked me what it was worth, and authorised me to buy it for him, not to give too much money for it. I told him it was worth thirty shillings, I look upon it that was the value of it. On Monday morning I asked the prisoner if he had sold it, he said no, but he was going to sell it; I told him my brother would give him thirty shillings for it, he said my brother should have it. He owed me fourteen shillings, and I was to give him sixteen shillings to make it up the thirty. On Monday evening he came home at ten o'clock, I was in bed, he told me it was his club night, he wanted some money, I got out of bed, and gave him a pound note, I had no less change. On Tuesday I was going to take the desk to my brother, whom I bought it for; I examined it and found a private drawer, containing eleven pounds and a miniature picture likewise. I took the money for my own use, I thought if it was enquired after in a little while, I could make it up again; I was short of money at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You was pretty sure the prisoner could not enquire for it. - A. On the next Wednesday I took the desk to my brother, he was not at home. I left it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You are by trade a cabinet maker. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you knew very well the value of a desk of this kind. - A. I never saw a desk of that kind before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in the cabinet line. A. I worked for my master in Camomile-street seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. This is the first time you saw one of them writing desks. - A. Yes, a black writing desk.</p>
               <p>Q. You say because it is black; am I to understand you never saw a writing desk like that; you say you are a cabinet maker. - A. It is not in the cabinet line at all.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not give that any ceremony. - A. No, I thought it was right.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was right to open it, taking it for granted that it belonged to this coachman. - A. I really did not give it a thought, I was very busy, I opened it at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not put your hand in to see what sort of papers were there. - A. I did not examine the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did the man go away. - A. I do not know, directly almost.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord that the man asked what in your opinion the desk was worth. - A. Yes, I did not give him any answer.</p>
               <p>Q. When your brother came to you on Sunday, it so happened that your brother wanted such a desk. - A. He had been speaking that he wanted a desk.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell your brother the value of the desk the next day. - A. I told him it was worth about thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you discover this private drawer, was it about half past eight or nine. - Q. That was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not discover it that night. - A. No, I never touched it.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother came to you on the Sunday. - A. Yes, he always comes to see me on Sundays.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you agree to send it to your brother. - A. On the Wednesday I took it to my brother, and on the Wednesday he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the box left in your custody from the time the man came home till you delivered it to your brother. - A. It was left in my house, not particularly in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not left in your care. - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the desk left in your custody. - A. He might come and take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the desk left in your custody; the man went away and left the desk in your hands. - A. Not in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your table then; what became of the box when the man went away. - A. He laid it down.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it afterwards. - A. When I bought it I considered it my property, it remained where he put it, and there it continued till I took it to my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother that purchased this desk on a Sunday, did he examine it all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he that was to purchase it did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190026"/>look at it at all. - A. He knew it was a desk, he only examined it on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you never examined on the inside to see whether it was proper for him to buy. - A. Not before the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you discovered this private drawer. - A. On Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. That was after you had given the man the money he wanted for his club. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the money for your own use, you thought if any person enquired for it you should be able to make it up. - A. Yes, and if ever any body enquired for the desk, they might always have it at my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did understand it was not his property. - A. I thought if any body enquired for it they might have it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person enquire for it when you conceived it to be the property of the prisoner. - A. I knew he was an hackney coachman.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person enquire for that which belonged to the man himself. - A. He might have it left in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a suspicion that it might not be his. A. Yes, when I saw the money in it, I did not know how to act.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean you was anxious to return it to the right owner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that in this private drawer that your ingenuity discovered, you found a miniature picture, and there you found the bank notes that you mentioned. - A. I did not examine any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any letters in the private drawer. A. I cannot tell whether they were letters or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you the curiosity to open them to see what was contained in them. - A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them. - A. The desk with the papers went to my brother.</p>

             acknowledged before the magistrate that they were the three two-pound notes that were in the desk: the prisoner told us where he lodged, and what he had done with the desk; he said that he had sold the desk to him for thirty shillings, for the use of his brother; I produce the desk.</p>

In consequence of some information received at Worship-street, I took the prisoner in custody, I told him he was charged with stealing a writing desk, which at first he denied; after a minute or so he said that he had one left in his coach, which he had sold to Mr. Woodbury, where he lodged, in Bateman's Row, for thirty shillings. I was present with Vickery when he found the notes in the vial in the chimney.</p>

On Wednesday the 5th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the back part of our shop, I was alarmed by the violent breaking of a pane of glass; I immediately run out into the street, I found that one of our panes was broke, and I missed the article mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it. - A. A plated milk pot. As I was standing there to prevent any thing else from being taken away, a gentleman who is here, brought the prisoner back with the milk pot in this here (producing it) glove; it is a double glove, and seems very well adapted for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was brought into your shop. - A. Yes; it was not a cold day; it is not likely that a boy like him would wear a glove like that; I found the glove on the counter after the constable had taken him away.</p>
               <p>Q. It is two woollen gloves put together, one within the other. - A. Yes; I knew the milk pot to be our property, it has our private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>- BYNG sworn. I was going by Mr. Benyon's window on the opposite side; I heard the glass break; I turned round my head to the window, and saw the boy run off; he ran from Fenchurch-street; I pursued him for curiosity, I did not know what he had taken out of the window; I got hold of him shortly after, and when I laid hold of him he dropped the cream jug from under his coat or out of his hand, I am not sure which; I collared him and took him back, I held him with one hand and the milk pot with the other, and took him into Mr. Benyon's shop; I asked Mr. Benyon if he knew the milk pot to be his; he said he did. He took him into the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he catched hold of me, he says, where is that milk pot; there was a mob came round me, and the milk pot was chucked on the ground, and the gentleman picked it up directly.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190029"/>I am not guilty of the crime, you may depend upon it: I do not know any thing of it at all; I never did such a crime in my life; I hope you will give me hardly any punishment.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. For the copy of a register of a marriage there should be a five shilling stamp; I object to this being read.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately did you see her. - A. I saw her the day after the date of that register; I saw her and shook hands with her the day after I took that copy of her register; I could not be mistaken in a person that was brought up as one of my own children.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you were present at the time, and one of the witnesses. - A. I was, I acted as father.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe was trustee to Mrs. Domiley. A. I was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I now stand here hardly sensible of the crime I have committed, inasmuch as I was assured by the father saying to me that his daughter had been dead prior to my marriage the second time for more than nine or ten months; it was a current report in the neighbourhood of Stroud; and that was not only announced so by the father himself to me, but also announced so to Mrs. Domily and myself that the fact was so and no otherwise. Had I not had the confirmation of her father of the death of the woman, who had absented herself a long while (I believe her father is in court to say it) I certainly should not have put myself in a situation equal to where I now stand. I certainly did it from a perfect innocence, not knowing I did wrong at the certain moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hall present. - A. He was; his name was announced to be Mr. Wiffin by some persons that were in the room with him and Mr. Hall; I told him I had heard several reports, I said to him is your daughter dead or alive; he assured me that she was dead, and died with the man that she run away with.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it ago that you heard that report. A. Better than four years ago; the news was brought to my house; Mrs. Hall was in the habit of frequenting of my house two or three times in a week, and all of a sudden we missed Mrs. Hall; the news was brought to my house that she was dead; I did not see Mrs. Hall for a year and a half or better; we believed that she was dead, most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where she lived when she came to visit you. - A. Yes, in St. George's Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not far from King-street in the Borough; when she ceased to visit you, did you go to enquire after her. - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Worship street office: I produce some snuffer stands, tobacco boxes, patty pans and two tin cannisters; I found them in company with Vickery the officer, in the prisoner's lodgings, on the 13th of this month; the prisoner had been taken up, and brought to the office before the room was searched; I found the articles under the sacking of the bed on the ground.</p>
               <p>- VICKERY sworn. Q. Were you present when Armstrong made the search. - A. I was, they were found under the bed; I produce another tobacco box I found on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mills) Look at these articles. - A. There is a mark on this patty pan, I marked 8 to denote that eight came out of a plate.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they were not sold to somebody. - A. That I cannot say; there is a mark on this paper belonging to the snuffer trays, which we know them by, the tobacco boxes have no mark, they are articles that we make and deal in; I believe them to be the property of Messrs. Howards, I have seen them in the warehouse from time to time; Mr. Howard had information that the prisoner was in the habit of going into Rosemary-lane, and disposing of articles under value; he was asked by the master if he would face the parties, he said he had no objection, he went with my master and me to the office, and when he came to the office he owned it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time sell any lignum vitae wood to Mr. Seaborne. - A. Yes, about a ton and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. After that wood was delivered to Mr. Seaborne, did you see any wood upon Mr. Cook's premises that you had sold. - A. Yes, these three sticks, and I considered them as part of a lot I once had; prior to that I had lost a quantity, I then could not tell whether it was a part that I sold, or whether it was stolen from me, but I am sure these three pieces of wood were in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the trade a great many years,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190032"/>can a person in the trade who has it under his eye swear to it. - A. Men who constantly work at this kind of wood can swear to them; if I had a piece of wood I could speak to it the same as I can tell one man's face from another. Wardell took me to Mr. Cook's, he showed me the wood he had bought of Paxman.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he told you that he had bought the wood of Paxman; did he know that Paxman was charged. - A. Yes; he picked out the wood at Cook's immediately, and said they were the three pieces of wood that he purchased of Paxman; this is one, and that is another. (shewing them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you went with Wardell to Cook's. - A. I think it was on the 30th.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to Cook's you went to Neal's. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what passed at Neal's do you remember talking to Cook about your finding some wood that had been stolen from you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember your expression, saying, Neale sells some blocks so cheap, I called on him for some money yesterday, and there I saw some wood that belonged to me. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell 
               <persName id="t18060219-29-person341">Wardell</persName>
             that Neal told you that the wood which he had, which you claimed, was what Neal bought of Paxman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this did not Wardell directly say, yes, I have had some wood of Paxman which I have sold to Cook, and Paxman told me that he bought it of a shipwright. - A. It may be so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the fact that he had told you before about the three pieces that he had sold to Mr. Cook. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that Paxman, when he sold them to Wardell, he said, he (Paxman) had bought them of a shipwright. - A. Yes, he pointed out the pieces of wood, when he went with me, which he had sold to Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. And he went with you to apprehend Paxman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All this before Mr. Seaborne knew that the wood was at Mr. Cook's. - A. I told Seaborne that I had found some wood that I had in my possession, that was after this; I saw Wardell and Paxman together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Paxman taken up. - A. He was not in the the hands of an officer; Wardell was in search of him, apparently so, if I may judge of his actions; he took him at a public house, and wished me to follow him; as such I went to an headborough, when I returned, Paxman and Wardell was gone; we went to another public house where we found Wardell; he said I have lost Paxman; he has gone out at the back door, and was gone down the Commercial road.</p>
               <p>Q. Wardell attended before the magistrate as a witness. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He was suffered to go at large. - A. He was; on the first day he found bail.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Whether at the time that Wardell went with you to Cook's shop, did he know that Paxman was suspected. - A. I believe he did know that Paxman was suspected; that Paxman was suspected of the theft there can be no doubt, because Mr. Neal pointed out to me that Paxman was the person who sold it.</p>

Sometimes running and sometimes walking; there was another young fellow walking by the side of him; he had the truss on his back, holding it with his two hands quite a stoop; I stopped him just going out of the passage from Austin Friars into Winchester-street.</p>

I was out of employment; I went out about nine o'clock in the morning to look after employment; going along Threadneedle-street, I met this man, he asked me if I would carry this load for him he would give me half a crown. I was very glad to carry it for him; I followed him when I got into Winchester-street, that gentleman stopped me, accordingly I lost the man in a minute. I did not make the least resistance in the world.</p>

On Thursday, the 24th of January, between three and four o'clock, I observed the prisoner watching about the door; from information that I received, I went to Marlborough-street to get an officer to take him into custody, and while I was gone this bible was taken away; I suppose I was not gone above five minutes; when I returned, the man that was lurking about the shop, and the bible were gone; I then gave notice to different booksellers to stop it if it was offered for sale; on the 28th of the same month, I was informed that it was on a stall in Piccadilly, I accordingly went down Piccadilly to get my bible; as I was going I met the prisoner, but I did not take hold of him till I was sure it was my bible; I went to see the bible, and returned and took the prisoner into custody, I am sure the prisoner was the man, that was lurking about my shop.</p>

             sworn. I am a bookseller, I keep a stall in Piccadilly. On Tuesday, the 28th of January the prisoner came to me and asked me whether I would buy some books, I told him I could not buy them till I saw them, he told me there was a good bible among some other books, which induced me to go and look at them; I went with him to a pawnborker's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190036"/>shop in Cranbourn-alley, where the bible in question was taken out; he took me to two more pawnbroker's shops in St. Martin's-lane, where there were more books taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did you give him for the bible. - A. I gave him five shillings and sevenpence farthing; he said it was his property (the bible produced).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my bible.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As to my being near the stall, that is a fact; I was bred up to the profession I had a writ to serve for a person who had employed me, I was there to serve the process from time to time; Mr. Mudie, says, that while he was gone this book was stolen; Mr. Hayes, says he bought it of me; the duplicates came into my possession from a man who could not pay me; as to my stealing the bible, there is no absolute proof; that they came into my hands, is certain, I did not see the bible at Mr. Mudie's; it is wonderful; just while he was out he says the bible was gone, and I was gone from the door.</p>

               <p>- sworn. I was at work between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, I heard a cry of Stop thief, I ran out and collared the man, just at the bottom of Fashion-street, and took him to the watchhouse; he went down upon his knees and begged my pardon, thinking I was the prosecutrix's husband.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, is that the bundle that you took from him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Whose piece of patchwork is that. - A. The patchwork and cotton is mine, they laid upon a box in the two pair of stairs room, I had seen them in about twenty minutes before, I had been in the room hanging up a few things I had been washing; the boots are my son's, he is nineteen years old.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was in that place, I was coming from Blackwall, going home to my family; as I was coming down Fashion-street I saw two men, one of them throwed a bundle and a pair of boots to me, I catched the bundle and the pair of boots, and endeavoured to run after them, this woman came up to me, I said is this your property, she said it is, she immediately took the property and turned from me; and going on further, two or three men came up to me, they said they thought it proper to take me to the watchhouse; I went to the justice, and while I was there a man came in, who said he saw two men run, and saw them drop the things, this woman immediately wanted me to be turned over to my regiment, I said I did not like to be exposed to my regiment, I had not been guilty of what I had been charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man here that said he saw them drop the bundle. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is no such thing, nothing of the kind passed at the magistrate's.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you keep the house - A. No, my partner Jane Rawson lives there; I live in Bevois Court, Basinghall street. On the 20th of January, a little before seven in the evening, my shopman informed me that all the remnants of lace in a basket were stolen from a broken pane; I looked and found they were gone. About half an hour afterwards I was requested by a neighbour to go into Mr. Dowling's, as a young man was taken there on suspicion; I went there and was shewn a piece of lace, which I knew to be mine; the prisoner denied ever having it in his possession.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know how this lace was taken out of this shop. - A. There was a piece of glass pushed out of the broken pane, it could not go any other way.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it. - A. I cannot tell the day, I believe it was Monday; to the best of my knowledge it was between seven and eight o'clock; I saw this man at Mr. Dowling's window, and as he was standing there this piece of lace was flying with the wind by his side, I took hold of him and put him into Mr. Dowling's shop, where he put the lace on his left hand behind him on some flannels that were on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he lay hold of it from. - A. I cannot say, the lace was hanging out on one side of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it hanging from; from his pocket, his shoulder, his elbow, or where. - A. I cannot say whether it was from his waistcoat pocket or breeches pocket, it was somewhere thereabouts; Mr. Dowling sent for Mr. Cookson, he came and owned the lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw some lace flying. - A. Yes, he was standing at the window at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him standing in the shop, he was very near the counter; there was lace laying on the counter at that time. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear that there was no lace laying on the counter at that time. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you saw him. - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was not between six and seven o'clock. - A. No.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I produce the lace.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Is that your lace. - A. It is my lace, there is no mark on it, it is the pattern that I swear to, I know I had it in my shop, there is a yard and a half of it; I calculated that there was from five to eight pounds worth in the basket; they were all taken out of the window, and this is the only one found on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that. - A. Seven and six pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understand you know it by the pattern, and I take it for granted the pattern is not different to every other piece of lace in this large town, will you venture to swear that there may not be other lace of that pattern. - A. It is impossible that I should say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was going by this place this young man catched hold of me and took me into Mrs. Dowling's shop, and said I had got some lace of hers; she said I have lost some tonight, I do not think that he took it, I think you took it; I was searched first, and after that Mr. Sapwell came in, he was not satisfied with that, he took all my things off but my shirt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 24th of January, about four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the shop, she had a very large cloak on her, there was a man in conversation with her, he was watching of me apparently, to see whether I was attentive to them or not; the woman was standing by him with her arms under her cloak, she seemed as if she was creeping something down in her pocket under her cloak; I went over the counter and turned her about into the middle of the shop, and took from her a whole piece of gingham of twenty-five yards, which was under her clothes round her body; I sent for an officer to take her in custody, she then begged to sit down, and immediately dropped her pockets; in one of these pockets was found twenty-eight yards of cotton print (her pockets were large bags which she had by her side; the pockets shewn in court), and in the other pocket was twenty-five yards; she had taken two pieces of print, and one piece of gingham.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her taking this. - A. No, I only saw her as if she was creeping something in her pocket; the man ran away out of the shop, he has not been seen since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in your shop. - A. I suppose about a quarter of an hour, I did not see her come in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q.(to prosecutor) I wish you to say whether you took it from under my petticoats. - A. No, I took it from round your waist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had it in my hand, I had it not round me, he found me pregnant instead of any thing about me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(to prosecutor) Where is your shop. - A. I live in Holborn, my shop is in Newgate-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190038"/>the corner of St. Martin's-le-Grand.</p>

Yes, she came up to me as I was at the bottom of the shop, she said she wished to look at some prints; there was a man with her; I shewed her some, and went to the bottom of the shop to get some others; before I came back again, Mr. Clarke took the gingham out of her apron, he then sent for a constable, I stood by her and saw her pockets drop from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had these goods been before she come in. - A. On the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left these goods which you found afterwards in her pockets on the counter. - A. Yes, the goods were left there while I went to the bottom of the shop, and when I came back they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the shop. - A. The shop was nearly full.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Whitewick) Are you sure that you left these two prints on the counter. - A. Yes, I am sure; they are my master's property, they are all three marked with a private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the gingham. - A. Two pounds eight shillings, and the value of the print is three pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent as a baby in the womb, though these gentlemen have brought me before the court; my husband is gone aboard a-ship ever since that gentleman sent a letter to him.</p>

On the 27th of January, about a quarter before five o'clock in the evening, I received information from a woman; in consequence of which I pursued the woman prisoner, and stopped her in Camomile-street, and took a piece of print from her, which she had under her cloak; there was a a man with her, who appeared to be assisting her. I brought them both back to my shop, and gave charge of them; she was dragging the print on the ground, he picked up the print and gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the print in your shop. - A. It was fixed on an iron just withinside of the door.</p>

             sworn. I am a warper; I was coming down Bishopsgate-street, I see the woman come round from Mr. Moore's shop, I did not see her come out, I saw something dragging on the ground, I thought it was her gown at first, till I saw about four yards of it, I then saw the man run after her, and put it under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them in company before. - A. No, I told the gentleman I thought they had stole it; Mr. Moore ran after her, and took them.</p>

               <p>Murray's Defence. Me and my husband went out to buy two pair of shoes and some meat; we bought them and was coming home; my husband met a man, and stopped behind to speak to him, I walked on slowly, I knew he would soon come up, as I went on I saw this piece of cotton on the ground, I picked it up, this woman says half of that is mine, I says you have no right to that, you did not pick it up; she says if you do not let me have half, I will make you sorry for it; I said you may make me sorry for it if you like, if I knew the owner of it he should have it; when my husband came up I had it in my hands, I told him I had picked the cotton up off the curb stones, and that woman wanted half, he said if you picked it up off the curb stones it is your own, he said he wished he knew who it belonged to; I staid on the curb stone about a quarter of an hour; the gentleman came up, tapped me on the shoulder, and said you must come back, you have got something belonging to me; I went back with him into the shop, and laid my shoes, meat, and the print on the counter; he says have you been stealing these shoes and the meat too; I said neither, I was taken into the kitchen, the constable stripped me naked to my shift, he found nothing on me but the key of my door, and the ticket of my own counterpane. When the gentleman brought me into the shop he seemed confused, he asked whether it was sold, and if I did not pay for it, he said I should suffer.</p>
               <p>Gardner's Defence. I had been out along with my wife, I met an acquaintance of mine, I stood talking to him at the corner of Camomile-street a quarter of an hour or better, I overtook my wife in Camomile-street, she shewed me that piece of print, she said she had picked it up, I told her it was then certainly her own, and she had no right to give half of it away; when Mr. Moore overtook us, we returned back with him, I told him if it was his piece of print there it was for him; Mr. Moore told me that I had nothing to do with it, I might go about my business; I stopped a little time in the shop, and when the officer came he took me in custody.</p>
               <p>Gardner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you miss them. - A. A few minutes after seven, I went to the place and found they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards search the yard and the area. - A. I found one piece of metal in the yard, and one piece in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the pieces of metal that you missed. - A. No; I believe they belong to the prosecutor, I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the small shears. - A. No, the candlestick I know that was found at his house on the same evening,</p>
               <p>Q. It could not be taken on that day. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the metal that was missing the same that you found. - A. One piece I believe to be the same, I did not pick it up.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordships, and gentlemen of the jury; I am a poor young man slow of speech and much confused: I think you will suffer this to be read as my defence, I have lived with the prosecutor two years; the tools as is usual in the trade, were taken only to be used at my own home on private concerns, which I believe every journeyman usually does, the brass is my own, and though it has been admitted that it belongs to the prosecutor, yet there is no marks to distinguish it from others; the patterns are similar at various engineers, and however at first sight and the pattern may correspond, I submit that they are one and the same only. My master is a good man, it is his servants that are against me, I do not wish to speak against them, but they may be mistaken; I have three children and a wife now pregnant, and I am their only support; I shall not be able to provide for them if the sentence is against me; I throw myself upon you lordship's mercy and the jury, I pray god to appear for me at this awful moment; the witnesses at the back of the bill promised to forgive me if I could discover any person taking any property from the prosecutor; I in consequence told them of two, and though he never noticed them, he has acted strange against me.</p>

We have no evidence against the prisoner but what she herself has said; it turns out from the examination of the prosecutor, that what she said was after she had the promise of proceeding no further, which is the same as if they had promised they would not prosecute; it appears though she gave this full account, she was induced to do it by that promise, though perhaps we may not have any reasonable doubt; the law is, we cannot hear what she said; where there were held out hopes of forgiveness, or whether she was frightened, we must adhere to the rule of law, independent of that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a waistcoat. - A. I lost a waistcoat about two or three months ago at the shop where I work; finding it too warm for me I pulled it off, and put it on a chest. On missing the waistcoat from off the chest, I made enquiry about it; the prisoner at the bar told me that there was a man in the shop that had a large family, very likely he had took it to make use of for his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work in the same shop. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your waistcoat again. - A. Yes, the prisoner told me that the duplicate of the waistcoat was in the till behind the chest; on the 19th of February, when he was at the

               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to the waistcoat by the make, and the pearl buttons, and likewise here is a piece of the same pattern I had left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark that you know it by. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been of opinion that this is your own waistcoat. - A. As soon as I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath have not you this morning said that you could not swear to it. - A. No, to nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. If I should mention any person's name to whom you said it, you will recollect it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say so to a person of the name of Stafford. - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190041"/>Q. Not this morning. - A. No, nor any other person, I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>FRANCES WHITE sworn. I am a washerwoman, I wash for the prisoner and the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever at any time take that waistcoat to pawn for the prisoner. - A. I cannot say, because I was in the habit of pledging for them both; and whether the prisoner or the prosecutor gave me that waistcoat to pledge, I could not say if I was to die for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always deliver the duplicate to the person to whom you pledged it for. - A. Always, they desired me to pledge them in my own name, as they would get me to take them out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had pledged waistcoats for each of them before. - A. Yes, all kind of wearing apparel; I pledged for them both in my own name by their direction. I never heard the prosecutor say he missed a waistcoat, it is nothing but malice.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prosecutor has been asked to look at that waistcoat, and whether he did not say that he could not swear to it. - A. Yes, I was present, and my husband, Mr. Stafford, and Mr. Townshend at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there more persons in court now who heard it as well as you. - A. Yes, and ready to come forward.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Yes, at six o'clock in the morning, and fixed myself at a spot which commanded the whole view of the gates of George Yard; I had not been there ten minutes, before I saw Oney come knocking at the gates in George Yard, and called, Will, it is past six o'clock; then he immediately went towards his master's house, and returned from there with his master with a candle and lanthorn to George Yard; the gates were opened almost immediately after Oney and Baldwin came, by Carr the prisoner; Baldwin; and Oney, went into Baldwin's stable, and Carr went into Baldwin's stable for a light.</p>

               <p>Q. How close did you follow him. - A. As close as convenient, he did not see me, he went into Baldwin's stable, I went in after him, I saw him give it into the hands of Baldwin, I got hold of Baldwin's collar, I looked at Carr, I said, you villain, I have detected you; Baldwin said, as near as I can recollect, I beg you will forgive me, consider my wife and family, I told him he had sufficient warning before, as I had detected him I must do my duty and inform Mr. Fagg.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Alley. I belong to the Thames police office; on the 29th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner in Nightingale Lane with a coal scuttle concealed under her apron. I asked her what she had got, she told me a coal scuttle, that her master sent her for it; she told me where she was going to carry it: going along with her she turned up an inn, about a quarter of a mile from the place, then she said that a man had given it to her to carry; I took her in custody, and brought her to the police office; the next day the owner was found Mr. Cooper.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner before your shop on the day of the robbery. - A. Yes, on the 17th of January I saw him a little while before the robbery about the door, he had another boy with him rather less then himself they were walking before the door, I had not any suspicions of what they were about, they both of them came a little way in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190044"/>the shop, and I think this is the one that stole the jacket; they both attempted to take it, it was hanging up withinside of the shop, and they pulled it down.</p>
               <p>Q. How high did the jacket hang. - A. Nearly out of his reach.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get it down. - A. By pulling it down with force; they succeeded in pulling it down; the moment it was down they run away with the jacket, I pursued them, and within three doors of my house I took them both; I then not seeing the jacket, undid the blue wrapper the prisoner had got on, he had the jacket concealed under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your jacket. - A. It was, I then brought him back, and sent for an officer, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am an officer, I took charge of this boy in Mr. Ingle's shop, this is the jacket, I wrote my name upon it directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, I saw a boy go into the shop, I thought he was an apprentice there; that boy came out with something under his arm, he chucked it down, and I picked it up.</p>

I reported it to the foreman, and kept the glass in my possession; these are the squares of glass, they are the property of Messrs. Quinton and Co. they are a peculiar species of glass, made for the royal navy.</p>

Yes, she had been gone two nights and two days; I found her at No. 3, Chequer-alley, Bunhill-row; she hid herself in a cupboard when I first went in the house; she said the best of the things were made away with by a woman that lodged with her, and she was not able to get them back again; I do not believe the prisoner did pawn them; the other woman said she would be half towards getting them out again.</p>

             sworn. I was a constable of the night, I produce seven farthings, eight penny-pieces, and eight shillings, and seven-pence halfpenny in halfpence, they were taken from the prisoner Taylor's pocket, I saw them taken by the watchmen; here is the pig's jaw, it was taken from Taylor's leather apron.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Look at that pig's jaw, is there any thing that you know it from any other pig's jaw. - A. I went to the salesman at Covent Garden, and bought thirteen pig's jaws; I took notice of one of the tongues having a piece cut off, I told the constable before the leather apron was opened, that there was one of that description, the top of the tongue cut off, that was the only one that was so, and I told him that there was some of the hair on it before it was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. That is so. - A. Yes, here is two old halfpence, one is hammered something hollow, the other is marked with a chisel; a poor woman came into me for a halfpenny worth of bread, she gave me one of them, I refused it, she then gave me the other, and said, keep them both, and when I come round again. I will give you a good halfpenny; the woman never came near me; at the time I was counting the money to send them to the tallow-chandler, I threw them off the shelf, and counted them in; these are the same two halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say they were among your halfpence when your house was robbed. - A. Yes, they remained in a large drawer under the counter in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long before had you counted them. - A. From eight to nine o'clock that very evening; between the hours of eight and nine o'clock I counted them over.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Are these cheeses yours. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the cheese and tea were either in your shop window or so near the shop window, that any body having broke the window, could get them out without getting into the shop. - A. By no means, that cheese is marked I for James and P for Purcell.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. As I was going home on Wednesday evening, I stopped to make water, and I kicked this pig's-head before me; I picked this pig's-head up, I opened the parcel, and in it there was some halfpence; I went to make the best of my way home, this watchman stopped me.</p>
               <p>Britten left his defence to his counsel; called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go occasionally to visit this house, to see that every thing was right. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there on the 27th of January last. - A. Yes, I think about the 27th, I was there all was right then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go there on the 30th. - A. On the 30th I cannot swear to; went I went again, the lead was gone from the roof of the frontispiece of the school room, it was affixed to the building.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the lead was gone, in consequence of that you gave some information to Mr. Brown, who had put it up for you seven years ago. - A. Yes, Mr. Brown was working for me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner. - A. I did, he worked for a mason whom I employed.</p>

               <p>Q. In the evening of the Friday, the 7th of this month, did the prisoner at the bar come to your shop. - A. He did, about seven o'clock in the evening, he told me he had about an hundred weight of lead to sell, he had it with him in a sack; I thought it did not look well that a man of his description should have that lead to sell, I knew his resources, and what wages he had; I told him I had not an opportunity of weighing the lead then, I desired him to leave it till the following morning, if he would call then, I would weigh it, and pay him for it, he went away and left the lead in my premises; the next morning he came again, the lead was weighed, I think it weighed ninety-four pounds, I think I paid him one pound, four shillings, and sixpence for it, at the rate of thirty shillings a hundred; I had previously ordered a man of mine, to be upon the spot, that he might be a witness, that it was the identical lead that I bought of him.</p>

               <p>Q. On Tuesday the 11th of February, had any accident happened to any of the panes of glass at your shop window. - A. Before the 11th of February, an accident happened to a pane of glass, there was a hole in it about the size of the palm of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover at any time on Tuesday, the 11th of February, that that pane of glass had been broken to a greater extent. - A. I missed the property between six and seven o'clock last Tuesday week, my husband was out.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before you had missed it had you seen the property. - A. I cannot tell, I missed twelve swansdown waistcoats, of different patterns, they were placed in the window, near the pane of glass that was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. When you so missed them, did you examine the pane of glass, and find that it had been still broken more than it was before. - A. Yes, there was a hat before it, which had been moved and some of the waistcoats had been taken from the hole, and the hole was as big again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the hole was large enough for an hand to be put in, and the waistcoats to be taken out. - A. Yes, the next morning I went to Monmouth-street, and took an old marcella waistcoat with me to the different shops, and among the different shops I went to Galloway's, when I went into his shop, I asked him if he had any swansdown waistcoats, he said, yes ma'am; I told him I wanted one, and I had the size with me, I produced the marcella waistcoat of the size, he took two or three waistcoats from a shelf, and one from the outside of his door, and shewed me, we measured them; I looked up to the shelf, and I thought they were the whole of the property that I lost; I said to him, I cannot agree with you about one, I will go home and send my husband; I went home directly and sent my husband.

               <p>Q. You saw them hanging outside of the door. - A. No, he went out and brought one from the outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him go into the street, therefore, it must be hanging outside there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And any body going by, must see them hanging out, exposed to public sale; were you present when these were purchased by your husband. - A. No, he gave four shillings a-piece for them, he bought them at a sale at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. The other waistcoats that you saw on the shelf, he pulled them down very readily, they were exposed openly in the shop. - A. Yes.</p>

He did, to detain the boys, while he went to Bow-street to get an officer to take them into custody; I was to sew on a button for one of them, and while my master was gone, I broke my thread several times in sewing on the buttons.</p>
               <p>Court. He went to Bow-street and got an officer, and took them into custody. - A. He did so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In consequence of that, he and the boys went to Bow-street, and he was committed. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 13th of this month were you fetched to the prisoner, Galloway's house. - A. On the 12th, between one and two o'clock, I went to his shop with him, there I found the three boys at the bar, the little boy, Osborne, was on the shopboard, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190049"/>man was sewing on his buttons; I asked Galloway in their hearing were these the persons he had bought the waistcoats of, he answered yes; I took them in custody and searched them, I asked them where they brought them from.</p>
               <p>Q. Before they said any thing, did you make use of any promise whatever or threats to enduce them to confess. - A. Not any at all, Osborne told me he would tell me the truth, he told me that the other two boys took from the window of Mr. Benjamin twelve waistcoats, he being present saw them take them, and he took them from them, they went to Mr. Galloway's house in Monmouth-street, and asked him if he would purchase them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the other boys say any thing to you. - A. Yes, on the Saturday after, when they were all together, they said they were the persons who took the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pound reward. - A. I am satisfied with that, God forbid I should do it for that.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, what is said by one prisoner against another is not evidence; in the first place, it is not upon oath, no man can be convicted by the law of his country but upon taking a solemn oath, that what he says shall be the truth, therefore, what one prisoner says of another, even at your bar, cannot be evidence, because, it is not under the sanction of an oath; here is a confession, that goes no further than he was one of the parties that stole the property, I am not fond of confessions obtained by officers, because it is not a thing which is easy contradicted, it is generally made by a prisoner in private, and we have no way of ascertaining the truth of what a man unfortunately says; therefore, I keep a tight hand on all confessions, I would much rather a guilty man escape justice, than an innocent man be punished.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mr. Benjamin) Produce the waistcoats. - A. These are the waistcoats (producing them). They are my property.</p>
               <p>Lucase's Defence. When I was in Castle-street, I met these young men, he said he was going of a message for his mother, he asked us to go with him, we did, and as we were coming back we picked up this bundle, we immediately looked at it, and found they were waistcoats, we went immediately to Monmouth-street, and asked Mr. Galloway if he would buy them, he said, yes, he would give three shillings and sixpence a-piece for them, that is all that passed; he paid us and we went away; the next morning

             asked us if we would go with him to Mr Galloway's, to have his button sewed on his breeches, we went with him, Mr. Galloway told the man to sew on all his buttons; Mr. Galloway went out and brought in three constables.</p>
               <p>Haycock's Defence. As Lucase and I were coming along Castle-street we met Osborne, he said he was going of a message, he asked us if we would go with him, we said, yes; coming back we found this bunble, we saw they were waistcoats, we took them to Galloway's, we asked him if he would buy them, he said, yes, or any thing that we brought.</p>
               <p>Osborne said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Galloway left his defence to his counsel, called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. The prosecutor lodged in Hampstead Road, at Mr Mane's; I was sent for on the 27th of January, on suspicion of stealing a coat; the prisoner worked for Mr. Rhodes, as soon as I saw him he made his escape; I was informed he left the coat at St. Giles's; I made haste after him and overtook him with the coat on; they both work for Mr. Rhodes.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor.) How long had you lost it before you found it. - A. I missed it when I came home at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found it before it was lost. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had worked for Mr. Rhodes three weeks, I told them I would not stay any longer; when Saturday night came, he stopped three shillings, for fear I should not come on the Monday morning; Mr. Hunt sent for me to the same place as I had left, my coat being dirty, I put that coat on to get my work, they told me I must come again at four o'clock, Mr. Hunt not being in the way; I went back to Mr. Rhodes's for my money, he said he would leave me in the hands of a constable, I thought it was because I would not work there any longer, I ran away and went to Mr. Hunt's for my work, and then when I went home to my lodgings they took me into custody.</p>

On the 21st of January, he came to my house to lodge, he had the two pair of stairs back room furnished, he took the place weekly, at three shillings per week, and he was to breakfast with me, and to settle with me for it at the end of the week; he went away on the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you notice of his dislike to the lodgings, and that he meant to go. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time miss any part of your property and when. - A. On the 24th I missed my property; when he came to the lodging he said that he was a gentleman, and had a law suit in town, that he resided in Paddington, and it was too far for him to go up to his family of a night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you missed from any part of your house any property. - A. On the 24th the sheets was missing, I did not miss the money till between ten and eleven o'clock, I was going to bed, I found my door unlocked; my wife told me about three o'clock the sheets were gone, when I came home, and the money was missing from my drawers, which stood of one side of my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had locked this drawer on the 24th. - A. I am certain of it, I went to the drawers that morning, and took five guineas out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the key of the drawers. - A. I always keep them, I saw no alteration in the drawer, except it was unlocked, it had not been opened by force.</p>
               <p>Q. What property did you leave in the drawer. - A. Sixty three guineas, two ten pound notes, and a one pound note; when I looked in the drawer, I found it was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What room do you sleep in. - A. The one pair of stairs front room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner could have no business there. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. His was the two pair of stairs back room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not miss any rasors at any time. - A. Yes, a case of rasors; I believe these rasors were in the same room, they were either in my room or his room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever borrowed them of you to make use of them. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever return to your house again. - A. No, I never saw him from that time till the 3d of February, when I saw him in the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your money, notes, or rasors, again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any more lodgers in the house. - A. Yes, one; he slept in the same room with Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Thompson. - A. The prisoner at the bar took the lodgings in the name of Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of your lodger. - A. Mr. Brooker, he lodges with me still.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this man in the House of Correction did you say any thing to him. - A. I said how do you do Mr. Thompson; he says you have the advantage of me, I do not know you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking this property. - A. Yes, I asked him if he knew where he lodged on 21st of January, and where he left on the 24th, he said he did not know any thing of that, he had only been two or three days from the country, he did not know the town at all; he knew me extremely well the following day, when he came up to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to prosecutor. Did you not say before the magistrate (I dare say it is in the deposition) that you did not recollect whether you had locked the room door or the drawer. - A. I said I was not sure, whether I had locked the door, I am sure I had locked the drawer.</p>
               <p>Court. In your deposition it says, that the key you now hold in your hand, and which is the key of the drawer, of which he is not certain that he locked it or not; therefore before the magistrate you were not certain whether you locked the drawer or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Q. From the time that I came to breakfast was I ever out of your presence. - A. Yes, during the time you went to write a letter, I asked you whether you was going out at that moment, you said stop for a moment, as you was going to write, and you asked for pen and ink, you was some time up stairs, I waited below for you.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) Did you go out of the house while he was up stairs. - A. No, I waited for him a quarter of an hour, thinking he was writing a letter all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You was then upon your oath when you was before the magistrate, you was not certain whether you locked the drawer or not. - A. I am sensible that I had locked the drawer.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM CHAPMAN sworn. I am an officer of Hatton Garden. On Tuesday the 28th of January, in the City Road, I met 
               <persName id="t18060219-64-person660">Vaughan</persName>
             the prisoner, and Mrs. Hill's daughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take charge of him respecting any thing of this business. - A. No, I searched him, I found nothing that belonged to this case, I found about half a crown on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Any Bank notes. - A. Nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to lodge at the prosecutor's house at the time he mentioned, and came away also at the time he mentioned, I agreed to breakfast there; I staid there till the 24th, I got up in the morning to breakfast along with the man's wife, I never went out of the parlour, only through the parlour, I read the newspaper before I went out of the house; their house happens to be a very inferior, low public house, the tap is forward; and the parlour is backwards, you cannot see any one go up stairs, any one can go up stairs, without their seeing them, and they are very seldom any where but in the parlour; when I was there I saw a man of the name of Davis have five or six glasses of rum and water, they were intoxicated, they threw the toast about; the woman said he is drunk and mad, and my husband also; he is extremely riotous when he is drunk, but he is a good customer, we may charge him what we please. I never went up stairs, nor went any where except reading the paper, and then I was not out of their presence; they pressed me to drink, I said I never drink of a morning, he said it was not friendly if I did not drink with them, I stopped about five minutes in the tap room; after I went out I had an account of the death of my daughter at Salisbury, I was obliged to go to Windsor about the funeral, I did not return to London for three days; when I was apprehended not a farthing was found upon me, I was in a very distressed state indeed, as I am at this present time; it is not likely that if I had twenty-one pounds in Bank notes, that I should be in this distressed state, there was no duplicates found upon me; I declare most solemnly I was not in the room. I never took a note out of it, nor did I know where the money was.</p>

No, he was only to have the bed for one night, he lodged there two nights; he went into the parlour and called for a pint of porter, in a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190054"/>time after he rung the bell, I went in, and he said he wanted to go to bed, I lit him up stairs, and shewed him the bed and turned the sheets down; I said my rule is to be paid before you go to bed, he said he had only gold, and he was afraid he should get some bad silver, I said very well, if you pay me in the morning it will do, he said he should breakfast with me; accordingly, in the morning he came into the kitchen to me, and said, may I have breakfast, I said no; he never offered to pay me for the pint of porter, I did not know but he had paid my son, he put in my hand a seven shilling piece, and I gave him six shillings, he said he should sleep there the following night; on the following night he came, the fire was very low in the parlour, he grumbled about that, I said we have a good fire in the kitchen, if you should like to sit down in the kitchen, he went and sat there and had a pint of beer again; my daughter went up stairs and turned the sheets down; on Tuesday morning he laid till ten o'clock, he came down stairs, I was in the yard.</p>

He was going out of the street door when my mother came into the passage; he returned back, and bid her good morning; in about three minutes afterwards I went up into his bed room, and found there was one sheet gone; there was nobody else lodging in the house that night but my father, mother, and myself.</p>

             sworn. I am one of the patroles of Bow-street, on the 7th of October last, about half after five o'clock in the morning, I was standing at the corner of Red-Lion-street-Holborn, the prisoner at the bar passed me; I stopped him, and took him into a liquor shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing about him. - A. He had the nails in a bag on his back; I asked him how he came by them, he said what is that to you; when he was brought before the magistrates he said he found them on a butcher's block in Newport Market.</p>
               <p>A. How came he not to be tried before. - A. He was kept till the 14th, and then he was discharged, we could not find any owner to the nails; I have kept the nails ever since, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. On the 7th of October was the Monday, the 5th was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Court. (to Mr. Gill) Was it on Saturday your premises were robbed. - A. It was; that bag is not mine, they were emptied out of the bag, and the bag was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined the nails before. - A. I have, there is eighty seven pound, and from a general knowledge of the nails, I believe them to be my property, they are worth a groat a pound, they are valued at 10 s. in the indictment, they are made in the same tool with what I use, I should know the nails any where.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the value of them would be about twenty-seven shillings; you are quite sure they are made in the same tool as those were in your manufactory; and you believe them to be yours. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what weight of nails you had in your manufactory. - A. I had two hundred weight in on the 27th of September, there had been none of them used on the night of the 5th of October, one bag was nearly emptied.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the nails lost correspond with the quantity found. - A. As near as my ideas can recollect; I do not believe there is another nail among them, I have examined the bag carefully.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. That is they are as near as you can guess, it is a common cart nail. - A. It is a common cart nail.</p>
               <p>Q. You have them from the manufacturer, which manufacturer supplies other wheelwrights of course. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found these nails about one or two o'clock, in Brook's Market, Brook's street.</p>
               <p>Jury. (to Jones) Which way was he coming from. - A. From Brook's-street, I took him at the corner of Red-Lion-street, coming from Brook-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was it that staid behind. - A. I think it was the prisoner, there were three tea spoons laying on the tea board in the first floor front room, I perceived the gentleman did not come to follow me, and the other to go up into the second floor room, and when he came out and attempted to go down stairs, I heard the spoons gingle in his pocket; I said you have got my spoons, sir, come back again, he went back in an instant, and he husstled them down upon the tea board, he then asked me to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any man with you. - A. I had not, I was too much frightened to search him; he went away down the street, and I followed him; he turned the corner and went into Perott's Hotel where he was taken, he had not on the same coat when he was there as when he was at my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you loose sight of him. - A. While he turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he pulled off his great coat when you saw him again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man that was with him. - A. He ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before. - A. I never saw him before nor since, I only saw him that night he was taken to Marlborough-street; I have been ill ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did loose sight of the persons whoever they were. - A. I must of course, I could not see them when I was in the street, and they had turned the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say two gentlemen came to your lodgings for the purpose of hiring lodgings. - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You let lodgings, and they coming to look for lodgings, you went about with them to shew them. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever the person was (and you say you believe only) that you spoke upon the subject of the spoons, he immediately turned back. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The spoons that were in the tea tray were to be made use of by the person who hired the lodging. - A. Certainly, but they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you come back you found them on the tea tray. - A. I saw him put them on the tea tray, I never saw the tea tray at all till the gentleman returned, and put them on the tea tray.</p>
               <p>Court. Whoever that person was, he was on the top of the stairs, and you both went into the room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him turning the corner of the street. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the person that you saw at the hotel the same person that you saw in your house. - A. I took my oath of it before the magistrate; I have been ill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190056"/>since, it affected me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that you saw at the hotel the same person that you saw at your house. - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it. - A. I did not doubt then.</p>
               <p>Q. I only want to know at the time you was at Marlborough street, whether you had any doubt then. - A. I had not.</p>

             sworn. I live in Mrs. Wilkinson's house, as clerk to a gentleman; on Monday the 20th of January, about five in the evening, I had occasion to clean myself, I went down stairs; after I had been there some little time, I heard some noise, I thought it might be Mrs. Wilkinson speaking to the children loud, it did not strike me at first what it really was; in the course of a moment there was cry of Stop thief; hearing the door open, I ran to the door immediately, and Mrs. Wilkinson pointed to the prisoner at the bar, saying, that is the man that has got my spoons, he had got into the street, about three doors off. (There was then another man who ran out first, that was the one that went into the second floor, he stood at the corner peeping by a watchman's box, immediately he saw me run he made off.) I pursued the prisoner into Perott's hotel, where there is a glass door exactly opposite the street door; when I opened the glass door he came up to me and asked me what was the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. How was he drest going into the hotel. - A.He had a great coat on and boots with tops, and when he came to the glass door and asked me what was the matter, he was without his great coat, I then looked him in the face, seeing him without his great coat, I turned him round, and by turning him before me, I knew his boot tops again, I turned him round and looked at him again, I said to him, you are the fellow, and I laid hold of him by the collar; immediately then Mr. Perott came out, and asked him what business he had there (Mrs. Wilkinson was at the door); I said that he had been robbing the lodgings of some spoons, the girl brought his great coat to him (they found it in a back room under a bed), he put it on, he had the same under coat on, as he has now. (Mrs. Wilkinson has swore to him, but people coming to the house and frightening her is the occasion of her being so ill); Mr. Perott held him while I fetched a constable.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutrix) You have done what is very right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. (to Williams) At the same time that you took that man in custody he had the same coat on then as he has now. - A. Yes, if he was in any disguise whatever I could swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. You in consequence of what Mrs. Wilkinson said to you, followed a man. - A. I followed that man.</p>
               <p>Q. She pointed to somebody, and you followed him, and he had a great coat on. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a long coat or a short coat. - A. A long coat, it did not cover the top of his boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he out of your sight at all. - A. Not at all till I got to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. The person that you saw at Perott's hotel had no great coat on at all. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Perott's hotel from Mrs. Wilkinson's. - Q. Just thirteen doors.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that you pursued had a pair of boots on. - A. Yes, top boots.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boots were produced to you, could you swear to the boots. - A. No, I swear to the man, the boots may have been disfigured; I am swearing the truth.</p>
               <p>- PLANK sworn. I am a constable, I was sent for to Mr. Perott's hotel; the prisoner at the bar was given into my custody, and Mrs. Wilkinson gave me the spoons; I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix They are my spoons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed (to Plank) Was the prisoner searched. - A. Yes, nothing was found on him but a few halfpence, and a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix I would not wish to be too positive to his person, I had lost sight of him, I would not positively swear that is the man.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. I am a servant to Mr. Gascoigne.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the person that carried the hollands. - A. Yes, I was to take it to Mr. Barker's, No. 27, Broad-street; I took the gin, and when I got to the door of No. 27, the prisoner at the bar asked me if I had got the change, I said yes, he gave me the note in my hand, and I gave him the seven shilling piece, the half guinea, and two shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man. - A. Yes, I am perfectly sure that is the man that took the money from me, he desired me to give the liquor in the house and to say that he was just gone round the corner; I knocked at the door, and a lady came, I asked the lady if the liquor was for her, she said no, I told her a man had ordered it to be brought there, he had given me a one pound note, and told me to take it in, the lady asked me if I had given the change, I said yes; I asked the lady to look at the note, she said it was a bad one, I asked the lady to be so kind as to go home with me, which she did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner. - A. On the 24th of last month.</p>
               <p>Gregory. It was the 14th of this month I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Are you sure that he is the same man that came to order the hollands. - A.Yes, I am sure that he is the man, he gave me the order himself; he has altered his dress very much, he is the same man.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PETHERIC sworn. On the 26th of December last, I went into Mr. Gascoigne's house, Broad-street, I asked him to give me a description of the man; finding he had been defrauded of a one pound note, he gave me the description; and on the masquerade night, the 13th of this month, the young man that is here gave me an account that there were some bad people lurking about the Opera House in the Hay Market, among whom I saw the prisoner at the bar; he shunned me, I went up to him, I asked him how business went with him, he said you are an insolent fellow, what do you mean by that; I called to Gregory to lay hold of his hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190058"/>he put his hand in his left hand pocket; Gregory came, he said he had got a counterfeit two pound note, which he had throwed away, resembling the one which Mr. Gascoigne took.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. Q. You know no more than Petheric. - A. When I catched him by his hand, I said what are you about; he threw the note away; the note is here.</p>
               <p>- BERCHER sworn. I am a tailor by trade; Mr. Gascoigne came to a public house to look at a man, he could not identify that man, he gave me a description of the prisoner at the bar, I told him I knew the person, and in the course of a day or two I would get him apprehended; I was in company with Gregory and Petheric, I said here is some suspicious people here, I says catch hold of him, they did, but before they could catch hold of his left hand, he pulled out the note from his left hand pocket, and threw the note away, which is in your possession.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man. - A. I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had known him before. - A. I had seen him many times before; the cheese has been in my possession ever since; he broke out of the watchhouse on Sunday, when me and my wife were at dinner; I happened to hear that he was in Bridewell, I lodged a detainer against him; I found him in Bridewell; I produce the cheese.</p>
               <p>Lamb. I am sure it is my master's cheese, and I am sure he is the person.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you recollect pawning two rings A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get them from. - A. From Bosary.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get them from him. - A. I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190060"/>say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after he went to Portsmouth. - A. I believe he had been home some time from Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What else did you pawn for him. - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and he lodge together in the same lodgings. - A. Sometimes we did and sometimes we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect looking into his drawers any time when he was absent from you. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you looked into the drawers any time when he was along with you. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see there. - A. I am sure I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any tea and sugar. - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. You was sober when you went before the justice. - A. I do not know, I believe it was on Sunday morning I looked in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What shape or make were the things that were in the drawer. - A. I saw somewhat in paper, I cannot directly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it gold, or silver, or brass. - A.They were yellow; I saw some like them that are produced here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see some razors. - A. I do not know, I saw some; I cannot say they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. So sure as you are committed, I will prosecute you; tell the truth and you will be protected; upon your oath what did you say before the magistrate you saw in the drawer. - A. I saw something wrapped up in paper, it was somewhat yellow; I told the justice then; I cannot recollect now; there were two things that went round the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the things that go round the neck. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a necklace; something else goes round the neck, sometimes, to people that do not tell the truth; you saw two necklaces. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they the appearance of gold or silver. A. They were yellow; and I saw some razors done up in paper, there was more than three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of these razors and necklaces. -

               <p>Court. Did you see any rings in the drawer. - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see anything of that sort. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner wear a watch. - A. I never see him with a watch; when he wanted to go out, I was obliged to go down stairs to see what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Court. You talk of drawers, whose drawers were they. - A. They were drawers that were in the lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put these things in the drawer. - A. I do not know, I did not put them there, nor did I see who put them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did other men visit you besides Bosary. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether they were put there by Bosary, or the other men, you cannot tell. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. (Q. to Robinson) Look at the watches. - A. That watch is one that was packed up, and the other also; we have our name and number on them.</p>
               <p>Q. They were found upon Bosary; can you swear to these things produced by Brown. - A. I have every reason to believe that these were a part of the package.</p>
               <p>Q. The watches you swear positively was a part of the package. - A. Yes.</p>

As we lay at Portsmouth, the cook said he would leave the ship, the first boat that came by; he asked me to give him a bag to put his things in; I told him I had but one bag, and that I wanted myself; well, says Francis, the cook put my handkerchief, containing my shoes, in your bag; I saw the handkerchief with the shoes put in my bag, but I did not know what else was in it; I jumped over into the boat, I did not like to stay in the ship; I saw two men in the boat, I thought the cook was in it; when I opened the bundle, I said the cook must be a bad man, there must be some bad thing done in that ship.</p>
               <p>Court. You mean to say that you had the things of the cook, and that you did not know that they were there. - A. I did not know that they were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove that. - A. No, I was never in London before, they all are in the ship that know it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner your servant. - A. No, he was the excise officer on duty.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this soap concealed. - A. In a room in the manufactory, between the cieling and the floor. In consequence of discovering it, I kept watching, and at half past twelve o'clock at night I observed the prisoner now at the bar coming into the room where the soap was concealed; I saw him put his hand in a situation to take the soap, which he apparently did, and then he put it into his pocket; I did not say anything to him, but waited; in the course of half an hour the other officer came to relieve him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see you. - A. He could not. When Dunstan, the other officer, came, the prisoner then was going away; I went from the place where I was to look, that I would be sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no doubt before. - A. I had no doubt; finding the soap gone, I called to my brother that he might stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention it to the other excise officer. A. No, not a word of it; my brother stopped him, and the soap was taken from him in our accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it. - A. I saw part of it took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you mention it to the other excise officer. - A. We wished to keep it as secret as possible; he knew of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The other officer was on the premises when he was detected, you saw him did not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. As he passed you it was very easy for you to have called him, you might have done that. - A. We might, to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man visited you. - A. Six weeks or two months.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of soap was there in all. - A. About four pounds, it is worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took this man nobody was present but your brother and yourself. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for a constable. - A. Yes, we searched him before we sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say. - A. He begged for mercy, and he begged for mercy when the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. When you challenged him did not he give you the soap himself. - A. I cannot say, for the first part, that my brother took from him; the latter part was taken from his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he beg for mercy after the constable came. A. He did. I am sure this is the soap that he delivered up; it has not been out of our possession ever since, nor he had not been out of our premises before it was taken from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare myself innocent as to my intention of taking the soap; finding it in a secret place, I took it.</p>

             sworn. I live in Rosemary-lane; I collect the rents in the Change. On the 12th of February, a little after eight o'clock, my little girl was coming through the Change, she told me there was a woman in there; I went up to her, and asked her which way she came there, she said she was very much intoxicated, and which way she came in; she could not say. I| saw a bundle lay by the side of her, I asked her what bundle that was, she told me she had brought it from the country; and seeing her have something in her apron, I opened it, and found two dimity petticoats wrapped up, she told me they were her own; I then went about the Change to see if all the lockers were safe; I found one open, I lifted up the lid, and found a vacant place, which had the appearance of something being taken out; I knew whose locker it was, I sent for the prosecutrix, and detained the prisoner.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER sworn. I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; I produce the property (The property identified by the prosecutrix).</p>

            , my father is a plumber, glazier, and painter, living at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes; on the 17th of January, they all three came to my father's shop door, about nine o'clock in the morning, they asked whether Mr. Cooper was at home, I told them he was not, but they might leave the lead. (I did not say my father had taken his business, Mr. Cooper being dead.) They left the lead, and I told them they might call again the next day; they came the next day, my father was at home; I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what they said about the lead. - A. The coal meter's man, Francis, he came to receive the money for the lead; the prisoners came in about an hour, I was not present then, I was sent after Mr. Brown, the officer, and when the officer came they were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did two, three, or four men come. - A. Francis made four.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is a plumber. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very honest man, I am sure he would not buy any stolen lead. - A. He would not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he brings you up in the same honest way; you had no doubt but they came honestly by it, and so you desired them to leave it. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HAVELL sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the father of the boy. - A. Yes, I saw the prisoners on the 17th of January; three of them came to my house about ten o'clock in the morning, they informed me that they had left some lead about an hour before at my house; they informed me that they had got this lead in a ditch between my house and Mile End road; I told him I was sure it was stolen from some place or other by the appearance of the mark of a crow bar wrenching it from some wall; the reply made by Saunders was, I have not the least doubt of that business, we found it in a ditch, it must have been stolen from somewhere; he asked me if I would not purchase it of them, they assured me they had found it there, and they could bring witness to prove it; they mentioned a Mr. Sumner, a coal meter, that came by at the time, who saw them take it out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave some instructions to Mr. Rogers, the officer. - A. Yes, and Rogers came into my house, and apprehended them when they came to see if I would purchase it, about an hour or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. After this lead had been left with you, and you told them you supposed it was stolen, they called again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The lead is laid to be the property of the churchwardens of Shadwell. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is only a stone's throw from your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith said to you, we have found the lead very fairly, he said he would go to the police office himself, after you had told him what Rogers has stated. - A. Yes, he said he would go himself.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that Rogers took him in custody. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a servant to Mr. Sumner, a coal meter. - A. Yes. On Friday the 17th of January, about half past eight in the morning, I was coming across Shadwell Fields, I saw Saunders by a ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing in any ditch before you was shewn it by Saunders. - A. No, he told me there was something black in the ditch, like lead; after that curiosity led me to go back, and when I looked I saw it was lead by poking it with a stick; it was about six inches under water; Saunders told me he passed it about half after seven o'clock in the morning, he would have picked it up, but being by himself, if he had been detected, he had no witnesses to prove that he did. not steal it; I made answer, you have got plenty of witnesses now that we have found it under water, laying in a ditch, so now we will pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many witnesses had you. - A. The three prisoners, me, and my master Mr. Sumner; we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190063"/>it up out of the ditch; afterwards we rather paused what we should do with it; we thought it best to take it to the first plumber's shop to sell it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, it is needless to go on; we must believe the witness on the part of the prosecution. How can we say these men stole the lead; it might have been stolen by somebody else.</p>

            : on Friday morning, the 17th of January, the prisoner at the bar came to our warehouse, he told me that he came from the house of Taylor and Newbury, of Walworth, for some shawls for them; they are customers of ours; he said they would be much obliged if I would let them have the shawls on sale of return, meaning, that if he did not suit the customer that they were: to be shewn to, that they might be sent back; I told him we never let any shawls go out on return, that if he looked them out, I should consider them as bought, he said he hardly knew what he should do, whether to take them or not; I recommended him to go home and tell his principal what I had said, that we would not let them have them on sale of return; I told him if he would stop till the following morning, that we should have a fresh assortment in from the manufactory, and that then he might probably better please himself; he went away at that time and come again the same afternoon, he said he was come again, sent by the house, and that he must have some rich shawls; the most particular prices that I told him was shawls at four guineas and a half each, shawls at three guineas and a half each, and shawls at thirty-eight shillings each; I mentioned different prices between those, but that is not material. He said he was at a loss what to do, which price to take, whether the shawls at three guineas and a half, or the lower price which I shewed him at thirty-eight shillings, which created a suspicion in me; it appeared strange that he should not know whether he should take those at three guineas and a half, or those of thirty-eight shillings, especially as there were prices between that which he had been shewed. On the strength of that suspicion, I wrote upon a little bit of paper to my warehouseman,</p>
               <p>'John follow him to Aldgate;' he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What shawls did you give him. - A. Two shawls of three guineas and a half each; these are the shawls that he pitched upon; I am sure of his person, I had a great deal of conversation with him.</p>

Yes; he went down Cheapside to go to Aldgate; he come through Goldsmith-street towards our warehouse, back again, he crossed towards Gutter-lane, and come the back way to Newgate-street, through some courts; he went up Holborn into Oxford-street; in Oxford-street. he went into Mr. Foster's, a linen draper; I passed the door, I saw him open the parcel on the counter, I went into the shop and passed the prisoner, and went to Mr. Foster; who stood at the far end of the shop; I asked Mr. Foster if he knew the prisoner, he said he did not; I asked him if he had offered the shawls for sale, he said he had; I begged Mr. Foster to let him be secured; he was secured and the shawls too.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, my poverty renders me only able to write in my defence, and my mind being so much agitated by the situation in which I am placed, I feel myself under the necessity of craving the indulgence of the court, by submitting the following: I am charged of obtaining these shawls under false pretences, but which shawls came into my possession in the following manner: having met a young man in the street, whom I was in the habit of spending an hour or two in the evening, who informed me that he had purchased a couple of shawls in Ludgate-street; he wished to sell them again; and as I was acquainted with the business, he would be much obliged to me to dispose of them; accordingly I went to a shop in Oxford-street with them; no sooner had I got into the shop than the witness followed me into the shop; the young man that was with me saw him waiting in the shop; he went away on seeing me detained. I have conducted myself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190064"/>through life in an honest upright way, never having a blemish in my character till the present time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 25th of last month do you remember the prisoner coming to your house. - A. Yes, she came in the afternoon, she called for a glass of rum, which I drawed her, and put before her; she gave me a one pound note for payment; I took the one pound note and laid five shillings and six-pence before her, and three pennyworth of halfpence, that made six shillings with the three pence for the rum; I then laid before her a seven shilling piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the seven shilling piece that you laid before her a good seven shilling piece. - A. Yes, that made thirteen shillings. I turned my head a moment, I saw the seven shilling piece was changed and shoved along the counter; I said to the prisoner in a passion, you d - d hussy you have changed the seven shilling piece; with that I took the remains of the change, and kept the one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the seven shilling piece that you supposed she had changed. - A. I supposed that she had put it in her mouth; I immediately went out for an officer, and left my wife with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say anything else to you before you went for an officer. - A. She said if I could not give her all silver, I must return her the note; when I returned I stood against the door; she said if I would let her go she would take the seven shilling piece, if I would give her the remainder of the change, she knew where to pass it. When the constable came the seven shilling piece was delivered to him; she said it was a good one, I tried it in the scale, it was not a good one.</p>
               <p>- CATER sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Did you happen to be in Mr. Chapman's house on that day. - A. Yes, I saw the prisoner there, and I saw two seven shilling pieces in her mouth between her teeth; she told me that her husband was a soldier, and she had come to London to buy some trinkets.</p>
