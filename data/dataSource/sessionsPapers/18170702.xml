On the 25th of April, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I shut his seventeen pigs into the sty, in the yard, fastened the door with a latch, and pinned it outside; I also fastened the yard gate. The sty and house are enclosed with a fence all round. At half-past six the next morning I found the sty door unpinned, the pin on the ground, and the pigs all gone; I went round the premises, and found seven of the pigs in my master's field. The yard-gate was shut-there are three or four gates round the yard, they were all shut and fastened as usual. There was a ball pig among them. I had fed the pigs with wheat the day before, and traced them by their dung across a field, but then lost the trace.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. From information that I received I went to the prisoner's house at Mitcham, which is about fouteen miles from the prosecutor's, on the 26th of April, which was the day after the robbery, and found nine pigs there, dead; they appeared to have been killed the day before - I saw the offal of them. The prisoner kept a pork-shop about half a mile from his house - I went there, and found several pieces of pork, and two pigs' heads. Smith was with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I knew the prisoner before. I told him what I came for. I knew it was his shop also - I have bought meat of him there. We found him at his house, and he went to the shop with us.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN SMITH. I am the prosecutor's servant, and went to the prisoner's house with King; I saw nine pigs there, among which was a ball pig, and two others, which I knew to be Mr. Cane's. I afterwards saw the heads of two more-they were the same sort of pigs that my master lost. I saw their dung at the prisoner's house-it was wheat dung.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I knew one of them by its not being the proper shape, and another had a particular mark on the head - They had been killed about a day. Mr. Cane's house is completely surrounded by a fence-there is no gap that they could get out at. The sty is within the railing; the mark on the pig's head was a defect in the skin, which was visible. I knew the pigs immediately.</p>

             I receive the toll at the Upper Newton gate, near Epsom, it is about fifteen-miles from Heston. On the 26th of April, about six o'clock in the morning, I took toll for eleven pigs, from the prisoner, they were black spotted pigs, he was by himself. I asked him where he was going to take them, he said, to Croydon. He went towards London-that road would take him to Mitcham-it is the longest way, by a great deal.</p>

             a check for 10l. payable to Eliza, for house, or bearer (looks at it), it now appears to be date the 27th of September, 1816, but it is the same check that I drew on the 17th of October, 1815, I have the tally, which exactly fits; the date has been altered, and the alteration, I am positive, is the hand-writing of the prisoner - I have a pertect knowledge of his hand - He had no authority to alter it. It appears by my banking account to have been regularly paid on the 17th of October, 1815, and also to have been paid a second time on the 28th of September, 1816, the day after the altered date. The prisoner, almost invariably fetched my checks from the bankers. I have occasionally missed a few checks, and have asked him about them, he said, "the bankers sometimes will mislay them. On the 8th of April last he absented himself from my service, in the course of my inquiries after him, a letter, in his hand-writing, fell into my hands, addressed to a Mr. Mann; in consequence of which I got a warrant and searched Mann's livery stables in Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, in company with Mr. Warry and Ruthven.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. My checks are numbered altogether.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Snow and Paul. I have known the prisoner about two years (looks at the waste book). On the 17th of October, 1815, there is an entry of the payment of a 10l. check, drawn by Mr. Frowd (looks at the check), this answers the description, all but the date. On the 28th of September, 1816, I find an entry, in my own writing, of a check for 10l. drawn by E. Frowd. I do not know to whom it was paid.</p>

               <p>HENRY GUBBINGS. I am the ledger-keeper; there are my figures on the check, which refer to the folio of the ledger; I there find 101. paid to Eliza - I turn to the 17th of October, 1816, and find 101. paid also to Eliza.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is only one reference to the figures on the check. I may have omitted it.</p>
               <p>MR. FROWD. I did not draw any check for 10l. payable to Eliza, between July and December, 1816.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTHVEN. I am an officer. On the 19th of April, I went with Mr. Frowd and Warry, to Mr. Mann's premises, Mr. Warry found a bundle of papers stuffed into the end of a truss of straw in the stable-there are several checks among them, drawn by Messrs. Frowd and Rose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The checks have not been out of my possession since, except when they were before the Grand Jury.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. He has frequented our house since November last. He gave me the papers on the 7th of April; they laid in my drawer for sometime, and I put them in the stable the evening before Mr. Warry found them. I told them where to find the papers.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KING. I live in High Holborn. The prisoner lodged with me. My house is in Middlesex.</p>

               <p>COURT to WILSON. Do you not usually, when you pay checks, draw your pen through the signature - A. Yes; if a check had been presented with a mark across the name I should not have paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. The check appears to be crossed out only once - A. if it was paid twice it must have been omitted the first time.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Mann-Unless you give the papers, immediately, to my mother, or the bearer, I must give Mr. Frowd a full statement of the transactious between you and myself; I really cannot tell what you mean by keeping the bundle of papers, none of which relate to you, and which I particularly want.

            . I live in Little Gray's-inn-lane. On the 8th of June, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was coming up <placeName id="t18170702-5-crimeloc23">Russell-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

I caught hold of his breast in falling, I held him 'till assistance came up, I called out, Mr. Bury came up in five minutes, I had a three shilling token, a half crown, and some small silver, in my pocket, in all 10s. 6d. which I lost. I also lost a pocket-book; I did not know I had lost it until after the prisoners were taken to the watch-house; I was then going to get some drink, and missed my money out of my waistcoat pocket-my book was in my inside pocket. I could not have dropped the money; I was stunned by the blow; when I came to myself I found them all gone from me. I am sure Willey is the man who struck me.</p>
               <p>WILLEY. Q. Was you not intoxicated - A. I was not. When Bury came up I was quite insensible. I am groom to Sir John Malcolm.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURY. I am a constable. I heard the prosecutor call out, I went up to him, and found him holding Willey by the neck, the prisoner, Hutchinson, and another man were running away, the prosecutor was half up and half down, he appeared insensible and not drunk. Willey was trying to get away, I laid hold of him, he struck me several times and got from me, I called after him, and Bartlett stopped him. I knew both the prisoners before. I fetched the prosecutor to the watch-house, he went out and returned in ten minutes, complaining that he had lost his money and pocket-book. I went with him to the spot where the scuffle took place, and found the pocket-book laying in the gutter. I am certain it was the same place.</p>
               <p>WILLEY. Q. Did he not ask you the way to Gray's-inn-lane before the scuffle took place - A. Yes; and I directed him - He was quite sober.</p>

I collared him, and took him into the house, I asked him where the two bags were that he brought into the house? Brothers was present. Moore said, what bags? I have brought no bags in here; I then asked Brothers, and he said he knew nothing about any bags being brought in. I found several rolls of paper, and one bag of fine wool, in the shop; I asked him again where the bags were that he had brought in? they both answered, that there were no such things brought in there - I found them on the landing of the first-floor, and knew them to be the same. Brothers said he slept at the top of the house - I went there, and found a roll of cloth, the bags had wool in them. I took them both into custody. Moore asked one of us to go with him to his masters' warehouse, for fear it should be robbed, as he had left it open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They did not see me; I took notice of the bags as he carried them.</p>

I went back with him to his master's house, by his desire, and found the candle burning; he offered me 1l. to let him see his master.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELCH. I lodged with Brothers. The wool was not brought to me.</p>

The prisoner was one of the two who asked me who I had been speaking to - They both asked me. They then seized me; the prisoner seized my right arm, and the other my left. I told them the man had asked me what was o'clock (which he did, as well as asking relief); they then asked me if I had a watch. They both collared me as I answered them, and knocked me down. I called out, "If you are not out of hearing, come back!" being in hopes that the man who first spoke to me was not quite gone. I was on my back; one of them tore my face, and put their hands into my neck handkerchief. I felt them put their hands into my right-hand waistcoat pocket, where my watch was; they tried to take it, I tried to keep it. I said, "do not murder me, and I will give you what I have got," and gave them the watch and seals-it was a gold hunting-watch, three gold seals, and a gold chain-they ran off; I did not see them again. It did not last more than four minutes-it was a very bright moon-light night. I gave information to the watchmen outside the rails of the Park. In the morning I heard a person was taken up - I went to Marylebone watch-house, saw the prisoner there, and was sure he was the man. Before I saw him, the watch-house-keeper asked me to describe him, which I did, and when I saw him I immediately recognized him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LONG. I have been four years in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in possession of this property - A. I have had the chain and seals five years, and the watch three - I bought them myself. I believe the watch cost fourteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given a different account to any other person as to what it coast - A. I have been asked what the property that I lost was worth altogether; I said I could not replace it under 30l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Chaff - A. I do not. I have been threatened with vengeance by the prisoner's father. I did not speak to any person in the Park afterwards - I got to the gate in two minutes, and then told of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you lived with a lady - A. Yes. I am a lady's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of going to Kensington at so late an hour - A. I only arrived in town on the 20th, and wished to see my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave information of the robbery, did you describe the prisoner's dress - A. I described him to have a long, dark, slouchy coat on, and either a glazed or old oil-skin hat; and the other man as having a lightish coat on. I saw them walking towards me, and put my watch and seals into my waistcoat pocket quite concealed.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is on the Edgware-road. On the night of the 23d I had just called eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of murder in the Park; I could see nothing-it was moon-light. I took the prisoner up on another charge, between half-past ten and eleven o'clock, just by Tyburn-turnpike, which is about six hundred yards from where the robbery was committed - He was walking with another man, apparently from the Park; they abused me very much, which made me take them up. They were taken to the watch-house about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man who was with him was Sibley, who lives in the Edgeware-road; I knew him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SELLERS. I am a constable of Marylebone. The prisoner was taken up on another charge. I saw him the next morning, and the prosecutor charged him with the robbery.</p>

            . I am assistant watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house between eleven and twelve o'clock by Creighton. The next morning the prosecutor came, and asked if we had any person in the watch-house; I told him we had several. He described the prisoner to me, and said he had been robbed by two men, one having a light and the other a dark dress. He said one of them struck him; he thought it was the man in the light dress. I asked him if there was any difference in the size of them. He said the man in the light dress was the tallest-the prisoner was dressed in a dark brown long coat. In consequence of the description he gave me, I let him see the prisoner alone - He said he was one of them. I had no person else in the watch-house answering the description of the other man. I saw Sibley come into the watch-house with the prisoner; he had a light dress on, and was rather taller than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>GEORGE ROCHFORD. I am a watchman at Cumberland-gate. Just as I had called eleven, I heard a cry of murder in the Park. When I had called half-past eleven, I saw three men standing at the corner of Park-lane; two appeared dressed in dark, and one in light clothes-neither of them were dressed like a soldier. One of them said "Away!" and the other two set off down Oxford-street, towards Tyburn-turnpike-Sibley was one of them. I heard the rattle sprung by Creighton.</p>
               <p>JAMES DAVEY. I am constable of the night. The prisoner and Sibley were brought in between eleven and twelve o'clock. The prisoner had a dark coat on, and Sibley a light one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Sibley, and he asked me to walk down to Knightsbridge barracks with him. We got there at six o'clock, and staid drinking till eleven, and coming home we met the watchman; we were singing, he took us to the watch-house. The next morning the prosecutor said he believed I was one of the men. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>ROGER CHAFF. I am a musician. I had been at Lord Carlisle's, in Grosvenor-place, and returning home, just by Grosvenor-gate, I met the prosecutor; it was half-past eleven o'clock - He gave an account of his being robbed(it must have been about half-past eleven); he was coming from the Park-he said he had been robbed by two men. I asked him particularly how they were dressed; he said they were dressed in white jackets. I asked him what brought him into the Park at that time of night? he said he was a servant, and could not get out before ten o'clock - He said he was going for a little air. When he came out of the gate, he told a different story to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020009"/>watchman; he said he had been robbed of his watch, which cost him thirty guineas, and that he was returning from Kensington; he said he was making towards Cumberland-gate, and coming back, knowing that he could not get out; he was throttled by two men, and if he had not delivered his watch he should have lost his life.</p>
               <p>JOHN SIBLEY. I am a pipe-maker, and live in Bell-street, Marylebone. On the 23d of May, I was in company with the prisoner; we went from Bell-street between four and five o'clock in the afternoon to Knightsbridge barracks; we got there about five o'clock, and remained there till a quarter before eleven, and returned home through Edgeware-road, up Park-lane-no person was with us. We had a parley with the watchman; this was about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and lasted a quarter of an hour - We were both taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know Rochford, the watchman at Cumberland-gate - A. No. I was not standing at the corner of Park-lane, with the prisoner and another man. We never stopped until we were with the watchman. I was dressed in a short white jacket. The prisoner had a dark, long great coat. I do not know what hat he had on-it was a shabby one. I do not know whether it had an oilskin or not; I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILCON. I keep a canteen at Knightsbridge. The prisoner and Sibley were at my house till about a quarter before eleven o'clock; they were both intoxicated. Sibley brought me some pipes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time did they come to you - A. At three or four o'clock in the afternoon; on person was with them. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

             re-examined. The witness, Sibley, told me at Marlborough-street that he was out of the prisoner's company for a quarter of an hour; this was when he was taken up on suspicion. I am not certain that I saw Sibley before this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say the two men had white coats on - A. No. I described one as having a light coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about taking the air - A. I do not know that I said so, but I might if any person had inquisitively asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been stated that you said you had lost your watch, worth about thirty guineas - A. I said the watch, chain, and seals were worth thirty guineas. I did not say I had come from Kensington. I said I intended to go there, but found it too late.</p>
               <p>SIBLEY re-examined. Did you see Willoughby at Marlborough-street - A. I did; I was taken up on suspicion, but he would not swear to me. He said he could not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say at Marlborough-street that you had been out of the prisoner's company for a quarter of an hour - A. About ten minutes-this was on the way from the barracks.</p>

The watchman came up, and secured the prisoner - He was rescued from him and secured again; he was rescued a second time, and I took him the third; he was then rescued from me, and got off. I am sure he is the man that the watchman laid hold of; I did not point him out. I did not say that he took the seals, but he put his hand round me at the time that my property was taken.</p>
               <p>SHELAH FRANCIS. I am a watchman. I saw a mob in the road fighting-Sanders went to look atthem; the mob came round him - I went up; he said he had lost his seals, and I secured the prisoner. I did not see him take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not examined before the magistrate - A. Yes. I thought I saw him make a snatch at him. I have known the prisoner from a child.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you see the prisoner make a snatch at Sanders - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you see him put his hand into his own pocket - A. Yes; I laid hold of the prisoner. He was rescued twice from me and once from Sanders. I gave information to Coombs.</p>

            . On the 22d of March last I sent the prisoner to pay 22l. 8s. into my banker's; among it was 20l. note - I gave it into his hand myself. He left the room, as I supposed, to go there; he entered it previous to his going out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was on a Saturday morning, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not four o'clock - A. Certainly not-it was before twelve o'clock. I did not ask him to let me see the banker's book. I did not go out of town that evening. There was money in his hands to answer any necessary purpose in the office.</p>

            . I refer to the waste-book. There is no entry of money received on the 22d of March-there was 100l. paid on the 29th.</p>
               <p>MR. FROWD. There was 100l. paid in on the 29th of March. I do not know who took it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I thought you said you always entered the name of the person who took the money - A. I think I sent it by another person. I made the prisoner enter the 22l.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not seen the entry in the book should you have known that he took it - A. Yes, I should. I remember giving it to him when I received it, independently of my book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money was paid at the office. I entered it in the book-it was not paid till four o'clock. Mr. Frowd sent the boy out, and when he returned it was too late to send it to the banker's.</p>

            . I am a locksmith. I was passing up Cheapside about two o'clock, and saw the prisoner in company with another man dressed like a sailor, walking backward and forward by the corner of Foster-lane. The sailor held his apron against the wall, while the prisoner

             the stockings from the door, and put them into the sailor's apron. They ran down Cheapside - I told Mr. Dew, and ran down Friday-street, but lost sight of them, and returned to the shop; in about two minutes the prisoner was brought back with the stockings. I am sure he is the man - I had watched them for some time.</p>
               <p>EMBLIN STEVENS. I was in Cheapside, and saw two men lurking about the shop - I watched them, and observed the prisoner go up to the window two or three times, and then went back to the tavern door, and called the sailor to him-both then went to the window. A lady went into the shop, and as soon as she got in, the prisoner took the stockings, and put them into the sailor's apron. I pursued after them down Friday-street - they turned down a lane, I lost them, and saw them standing against a post, and pointed them out to Pretty. They had the stockings tied up in an apron, which was then off. I pursued them down Basing-lane, stopped them, and asked what was in the apron-the sailor dropped it, and ran off; I secured the prisoner. I am certain he is the man who took them.</p>

Hussey paid the prisoner 3l. 5s., and the other man remarked that he had got a good bargain. They had three glasses of gin, which the prisoner paid for. The next evening Hussey came and said the horses proved to be stolen. I went with him to look for the men, and found the other man, who shewed us the prisoner, and we secured him.</p>

            . I keep the George, at the corner of Compton-street, St. John-street. On the 30th of May, I saw two men coming from towards Islington - They came into my house; the prisoners agreed to give them 4l. 10s. for the horses which stood at the door - He was in the house before. I took particular notice of him. I saw him give 4l. 10s. for them.</p>
               <p>ANN ALLEN. I deal in cat's-meat. I saw the prisoner at the public-house, bargaining for the horses. Just before that, I saw the two men driving the horses in Northampton-square. He gave 4l. for them. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

I looked at him, and he pushed me one side; I turned round to pursue after him, when some person caught hold of my collar - I got loose and ran after the prisoner, gave the alarm, and followed him to the end of Crooked-lane, but lost him in the crowd; I got into Fish-street - hill, and saw him in Monument-yard - He was secured in Pudding-lane. I am sure he is the man. I felt my watch go from me - I did not see anybody with him until I turned round and was collared.</p>

            . I am a ticket-porter. On the 23d of June, about half-past four in the afternoon, I was sitting on the bench under the church at the bottom of Lawrence-lane, and saw a man come out of Mr. Wood's warehouse with a quantity of shawls under his arm; I remarked to my fellow-porters how he ran with them, and said, "surely he has not stolen them!" I immediately went over to Mr. Wood's to inquire of the warehouseman, and found he had not sent any out. I said there was a man gone out with a quantity, as hard as he could run - He sent me after him. I went out, and took the direction that the prisoner had, which was up Lawrence-lane, and through Castle-court into Milk-street. I saw him going up by the side of Honey-lane-market, in Milk-street - he had the shawls under his arm; I brought him back; he used some very bad expressions. I told him he must take them back, and kept hold of him; he then dropped the shawls from under his arm, put up his fist, and gave me a smack on my head, a person took them into the warehouse, and I secured the prisoner.</p>

On the 25th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, he called and had a pint of beer, there was no person in the house but him, he came and drank it in the back-parlour, where I was; while he was there my daughter brought me down the key of my bed-room, and laid it on the table. I was called into the bar, and forgot the key. Sometimes after the prisoner had drank his beer I saw him come down stairs, and asked him what he was doing there? he said he was going for Mr. Curry, as he had heard of a place for him, who was a lodger of ours-this was between eight and nine o'clock. I was going to put my child to bed between nine and ten o'clock, and missed my key; I did not miss it before. After I had seen the prisoner come down he went into the parlour and finished his beer - I was in the bar; he was gone when I missed the key. I tried the door, it was locked, we got it open, and I missed the property stated in the indictment out of my drawers, which were shut, but not locked; there were eleven 1l. notes and a 5l. check in the pocket-book. I saw the spoons again at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Curry lived on the two pair of stairs. I sleep on the first-floor-the prisoner did not stay long after he had finished his beer. Curry had been out all day, and was then out.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER BYERS. My wife said she had not got the key; I broke the door open, and missed the property; from what she said I suspected the prisoner, and got an officer. We searched the prisoner's lodging, but found nothing there; we found him at a public-house in Davies-street, I gave him in charge; the watchman took him away, and let him go, he sprung his rattle and secured him again; we immediately searched him in the street, and found eleven 1l. notes, five tea-spoons, two tablespoons, and the sugar-tongs, upon him; we neither found the check or the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He was not drunk - He was quite able to run.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer. On the 25th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I went to the prisoner's lodging with Byers; I afterwards heard the cry of stop thief, and the rattle sprung; I pursued, and found Byers, the watchman, and the prisoner, struggling together; I searched him, and found fourteen 1l. notes, and one 2l. note, upon him, with the spoons and sugar-tongs; he struggled very hard to prevent me searching him, and I was obliged to cut his pocket off - He then said I had put the things into his pocket, which I did not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Curry had been with me. It is not likely I should remain in the house if I had got the property.</p>

He knew that my duty at the Docks would keep me twenty-four hours-as we always march off at ten o'clock, and stay twenty-four hours, which is the regular way. He had been to Mott's with me twice before this, and knew he was my uncle.

            . I am Mr. Keily's servant. On the day that the apartment was robbed, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming down stairs, and met the prisoner, Pitfield, on the first-floor stairs, he went to Mr. Mott's apartment-our street - door is always left open. I had seen him with Mr. Mott's nephew two or three times before, and knew him. I told him Mr. Mott was not at home - He did not ask me any questions; he then went up, and I saw no more of him. I went into the parlour, stopped there about ten minutes, and then saw him come down again and go out, I did not speak to him; before I saw him come down I went out at the side door, and saw a person standing under the gateway, very much like the prisoner, Jackson, dressed as a soldier. I am not sure it was him. I am certain Pitfield is the man that went up stairs.</p>

On the day of the robbery, between four and five o'clock, I was playing on the stairs, and saw the prisoner, Pitfield, on the staircase of the second-floor, I said nothing to him, but saw him go into Mott's room; he was pulling the door about - I do not know how he got in, he had no key; I went out for an errand, and did not see him come out. When I went out I saw a man under the gateway, I believe it was Jackson, I only looked at him as I passed him; I took notice of him because I had seen Pitfield(who is also a soldier), up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that Jackson was the man - A. I could not say that it was him. I think if I had seen him with more soldiers I could have picked him out.</p>
               <p>JAMES SCHOFIELD. I am in the same regiment with the prisoners and Doubikin. On the evening of the 21st of May, between nine and ten o'clock, I was at the King's Head, public-house, in the Tower, with the prisoner, Pitfield - He had a silver watch with a metal chain. I saw something in his other hand, but do not know what it was. He changed a 1l. note to pay for his beer.</p>

I was at home until eleven o'clock, I then locked my door, went down, and spent the afternoon with my landlord, stopped there until about five o'clock, I then went up stairs and found my door broken open.</p>

               <p>JOHN KEILY (called on the part of the prisoner PIT-FIELD). I was at home all day-Mr. Mott came into my apartment between four and five o'clock, before the robbery, and stopped until it was found out. He set half an hour with me.</p>
               <p>DOUBIKIN re-examined. Mr. Mott is my wife's uncle. I never knew him at any time to have the least propensity to any such indecency.</p>

On Saturday, the 14th of June, soon after three o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by White (my son-in-law), who lives with me; I got up, went down, and found the back-kitchen window broken open, the square of glass was broken, and the sash pushed up-the inner shutter cut through, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020015"/>the bell taken away, so that a man could put his hand through the hole and take the bar out. Three pair of boots were taken from the front kitchen-the plate was taken out of the celleret drawer in the dining-room - I missed the articles stated in the indictment; my cellar-door was broken open, and also my bureau. The prisoner, Wheeler, lived in China Mews, which is at the back of my house, within about sixty yards of it; his place is opposite the back of No. 16, which is two doors from my house - He is a coach-broker and dealer in marine stores. I got a search-warrant about three o'clock the same afternoon, and went with Plank and Jefferies to his house. We found the seven yards of linen cloth stuffed in his mattress under his bed - A pair of the sheets were in the same mattress. We found my wife's shoe in an old chariot. Mr. White's boots were also found among some rubbish. I told Wheeler that we came to search for my things - He said he had nothing, and that we were welcome. When I got up between three and four o'clock in the morning, I saw Wheeler looking out of his place, but did not suspect him-it was known in the neighbourhood that we were robbed.</p>

            . I am Mr. Gibbons's son-in-law. The night before the robbery, about eleven o'clock, I saw the shutter closed and barred, and the bell put up. About three o'clock in the morning I heard the rattle sprung; I alarmed my father, went down, and found the things as he has described. I missed two umbrellas, a hat, and a pair of boots. I went into the garden, and saw footsteps which I traced quite to the wall, and the other side of the wall, I observed several persons looking over the wall of the next house, No. 15-the watchman gave the alarm. I went out, and I believe I saw Wheeler standing at his loft-door.</p>

            . I am coachman to Mr. Smith, whose carriage is kept in China Mews. I sleep over the coach-house. On the 14th of June, about a quarter after three o'clock. I heard a dog barking - I went to the window, and looked into the Mews. I saw a man coming out of No. 15 in the Mews, which is also No. 15, Thornhaugh-street-my stable comes against No. 15, Thornhaugh-street-it is a wash-house. A person going in there could get out of the garden of No. 15, and over the wall to No. 14. He had three umbrellas under his arm, and ran across towards Wheeler's. I do not know that he went in - I could not see, as a carriage stood before the door. I dressed myself and came down, and ran to the washhouse, but could see no person-the door was open. I ran towards Wheeler's, and looked into the boots of the carriages which stood there, to see if any property was concealed there, but found none. Stooping by the door, I heard a talking in his stable, and called out, "Wheeler, are you up?" He answered, "Yes, Captain." His voice came from within the stable-the door was shut. He said a person knocked him up, and said he was broken down. I told him a man had run across from No. 15, with three umbrellas. He said he had just been to the gateway, and had seen no person; the gateway of the Mews fronts his stable; I went round but could see no person; and as I returned I saw Wheeler talking to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. It was quite light-the prisoner, when he ran across, appeared as if he had the yellow jaundice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Wheeler did not let me in - I did not ask him. I heard a talking in his stable.</p>
               <p>MATTIHAS RALPH. I am the watchman of China Mews, Upper, Thornhaugh-street. As I was calling half-past three o'clock, I saw Wheeler looking over his half-batch; he said, "Watchman, there is a man come out of the doorway under the lamp (which is No.15), and is gone round the corner, and the coachman after him." I sprung my rattle and went round, but could see no person. I went to the wash-house door of No. 15, and found some broken bottles there, and some wine in them. I found the other door was on the latch, and went into the garden, and saw several footsteps which led over the walls of 16 and 14 - They went close up to the walls on each side. Wheeler had not got his coat on. There was no appearance of a carriage having broken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. My beat is in Thornhaugh-street. I did not go to look if a carriage had been broken done.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I went with a warrant to search Wheeler's premises. I asked him if he had heard of Mr. Gibbons being robbed? he said he had. I asked him if any person could have concealed property there without his knowledge? he said that it could not be without his knowledge. I told him we came to search his premises - He said, "you are perfectly welcome, there is nothing here." We went up stairs, and between the sacking and his bed, in an old hair mattress, we found the piece of linen and two sheets stuffed into the mattress. At the further end of the stable, behind a great deal of lumber, in an old chaise seat we found a pair of boots. Mr. Gibbons gave me the shoe out of a coach-body - We also found an umbrella. I went to Wheeler, and asked him again if it was possible for any thing to be concealed without his knowledge? he said it could not. I shewed him the boots and shoe-he said he knew nothing about them, and could not tell how they came there. We then went up to, make a second search - He was present when we found the linen. On our going up the second time he appeared much agitated, and said "as you have found these things, it is of no use denying it. I will tell you the truth." He said, two men came to him on the morning between two and three, and called him up, saying there had been a coach broken down, and they wanted something to repair it-that they brought the things and asked him to take care of them, and they would call in the morning or afternoon for them, and he expected one of them almost immediately. We were then in the hay-loft. At that instant he said, "here is one of them coming up the loft-stairs." I saw Kemley coming up. The moment he saw me, he turned round, and endeavoured to run down - He knew me to be an officer; I secured him and pulled him up. I asked him what he came there for? he said for nothing. I left him with Jefferies, and asked Wheeler if he knew the other - He said he should. I asked him to go with me, and see if he was waiting about the house. He went to several places with me, and at last to the King's Head, in the New Road, we found Smith there-Wheeler pointed him out as the other man. I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020016"/>came to apprehend him for a felony. He had a drab great coat on, and a whip in his hand - He was behind the table; he saw Wheeler with me - He told me I should not take him. I caught hold of his whip - We struggled together for sometime; several in the tap-room encouraged him. He got his coat off - I asked Wheeler to assist me, which he did, and we secured him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I knew Wheeler before, and have reason to believe he knew me. I never had any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES JEFFERIES. I was with Plank, and heard the conversation with Wheeler. He said it was of no use to deny it, and he would tell us all about it, as it would be better for them to be hanged than him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The Mews is a thoroughfare, and leads into the fields-Wheeler's house does not command a view of the fields.</p>

I asked him what business he had to get up to the counting-house that way, he said he had been for the keys to lock the coal-warehouse. I told him he could not have been for that, for he had them out in the morning. He said if he had acted wrong he would take them back; I did not see them in his hand, I told him to do so. He went away, and came back in about six minutes, and told me he knew he had acted wrong, but he had not taken anything. I told him I did not say he had; he said I might search him if I chose. I told him I should not, for I had no business to search him, he then said, you will not say any thing to my master, will you? I told him if I did not the rest of the men would, for they all knew it - He then left me.</p>

            . I am the constable of Brentford. On the 16th of June, Mr. Thomas Rowe applied to me, about a quarter after eight o'clock, I went with him to look for the prisoner. I found him at the Magpie, about a quarter of a mile off; it was about twenty minutes before nine. I secured him and found a 1l. bank note, No. 53,061, and 24s. in silver on him, there was no dollar among the silver. I then went to Franklin's and got a 1l. note from him, No. 54,614, I showed them to Mr. Rowe. As I was taking him along he said he had not taken it.</p>
               <p>JOHN FRANKLIN. I keep the Magpie, at Brentford. On the night of the 16th of June, the prisoner came to my house and had three pots of porter, he staid there about an hour; he was not sober when he came in; he paid me a 1l. note and I gave him the change, and I put it into my pocket with others; the officer picked a note out, I cannot say that it was the one I received from the prisoner, I had ten or eleven altogether. I took two or three 1l. notes the same day.</p>

I keep one key, the curate and sexton have each a key. I went to it again the next morning (Sunday), at half-past nine o'clock, and found the vestry window opened - A pain of glass had been taken out close to the latch, apparently for the purpose of admitting a hand to open it. The iron chest had been forced. I missed seven 1d. loaves, and a pair of black buckles out of the closet over the chest, which had also been forced open-they were my property. I missed two black scarfs out of another chest, belonging to the Rev. Mr. Greenlaw, the lecturer, and a quantity of prayer-books belonging to different persons, and a latin bible, in four volumes.</p>

            . I am a corn-dealer, and live in Kingsland-road. On the 13th of June, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners, Coleman and Savell, in the Kingsland-road - I never saw them before; they were driving four oxen, they were Highland Scots; they drove them out of the road into a bye lane-they drove them into Mr. Clement's fields, and over some very high banks into Mr. Smith's field; there was no road, only a footpath. I went into Smith's field and told him-they went away directly.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is the distance from Childerditch to this place - A. Twenty-two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible, between nine o'clock at night, and half-past six in the morning, to drive cattle that distance - A. It is possible.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I live at Haggerston, in the county of Middlesex, and in the parish of Shoreditch. Cook informed me that four bullocks had been put into my field. I went there, and saw the prisoners, Coleman and Savell, and asked them who gave them authority to put them in my field - I am sure they are the men. They both said they brought them by Rogers's order - I knew Rogers very well. I afterwards saw Rogers (in about an hour and a quarter), and asked him how he came to put the beasts into my field; he said they should not be there above half an hour. I told him what the prisoners had said to me. He said if I liked to take them on my own account at 40l. I might have them. I told him I thought they had not come honestly by them, and I would have nothing to do with them, nor should they be in my field. I called Rogers out-all the four prisoners were together. I met Brace before I had seen Rogers; he asked me if I had seen Rogers, before I suspected him-this was after I had seen Coleman and Savell; he said Rogers ought to have been there at half-past four o'clock in the morning, to take the bullocks away, for they ought to have been killed before that time. He said they had brought the beasts twenty-one miles. I gave information at the Public Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect (on Tuesday night, the 10th), any conversation between Rogers, Brace and Savell about a dog - A. Yes; they came to me, and asked me to lend them a dog to go into the country. They said there were four deer lying in a gentleman's paddock, and they wanted to get them. I told them I had not got one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. They were all three together. I will swear that I never had any disagreement with Brace - I never saw him before that day. I saw Rogers at his own house. The cattle were quite broken down and overcome-their tongues hung out of their mouths.</p>

            . I am a constable of Shoreditch. From information that I received on the 13th of June, I went to Smith's field. In going there, I met the prisoner, Brace, coming from the field-it was about seven o'clock in the morning-the cattle were laying down. He went across Haggerston to the Kingsland-road, and there I saw him join Coleman and Savell; I was some distance off. I and Armstrong went to the Hackney-road, and took Brace and Rogers. I told Brace I apprehended him on suspicion of stealing beasts - He said he knew nothing of any beasts; he had just come from the Eagle and Child,(which is on Epping Forest), and had slept there that night. We found Coleman and Savell at a public-house in the Kingsland-road. I told Savell I took him on suspicion of stealing four beasts - He said he knew nothing of any, but found four on the road near the turnpike.</p>

            . I am an officer. Maycock has spoken correctly. I took Coleman in the Kingsland-road - I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing four bullocks - He said he knew nothing about any beasts whatever. I asked him if he knew a man named Rogers, and if he had not been at his house that morning? He said he knew no such a man, nor had he been to his house. When I took

               <p>SAVELL'S Defence. I know nothing about it.</p>

               <p>ROGERS'S Defence. I never saw either of them. Smith called me out, and asked me to lend him a horse; the officer took me.</p>
               <p>SMITH re-examined. I said I wanted a horse. The officer told me to make some excuse-when I first went to them, I found them all four together.</p>

I ran after him, and called out stop thief! - I am certain the prisoner is the man that took my bag from me-it was a moon-light night; he let the bag fall. Thompson and Forbes ran after him with me; I saw Thompson lay hold of him. He was not out of my sight until Thompson laid hold of him. I did not see him afterwards. I picked the bag up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am a constable. On the 13th of June, I and Forbes were in Barbican, and saw the prisoner, with two more, loitering about, we followed them all three into Finsbury-square, they followed the boy across the square, and then crossed over on the opposite side in Princes-street, and got before him and then crossed, and all three rushed upon him at once - They faced him; I was not near enough to see them take anything from him; I heard him call out violently, the prisoner and another ran from him, I heard something fall but do not know who dropped it, I seized the prisoner, a scuffle ensued between us and he made his escape, he got about four yards from me and Forbes seized him; I found a snuff-box upon him. I brought him back to the spot, the boy had gone home, and came back to me quite agitated, the snuff run out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORBES. I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoner in Barbican, I knew him before, I laid hold of him when he got away from Thompson. I am sure he is the man.</p>

As I was taking down the shutters on the 9th of June, about seven o'clock in the morning, and carrying them into the private passage, I heard a noise, and looking into the shop, I saw the prisoner going out - I immediately followed him. He crossed over Ratcliff-highway, down Breeze's-hill, and in the middle of the hill I saw him throw the handkerchiefs down; when he got a little farther he threw off his hat - I still followed and secured him - He was never out of my sight; I gave him in charge - They were worth 5l. I had seen them safe on the Saturday night. Tailor picked them up. I am certain I did not discover the prisoner until I saw him going out of the door. I did not see him take the handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of May, in the evening, I was at the Coach and Horses in Charles-street, Drury-lane, which is about four hundred yards from Castle-street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020022"/>into the house just at eleven o'clock, with a watch in his hand. He asked the landlord if he would let him leave a watch, and lend him 3s. till the morning-the landlord refused. I heard him use the word "watch." He inquired for some person, and went out up Charles-street. I followed him till he came to the end of Short's Gardens, and asked him what he had got; he said he had got nothing. I said,"have you not got a watch?"-he said he had. I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it in France when he was discharged. I asked him what he gave for it - He said 15s., but it had been in pledge, and his mother had taken it out for him the Friday before. I took it from him and secured him.</p>

On the 18th of June, I spent the evening at Lord Roseberry's (who is my master's brother), in Portman-square. I left there about half-past one, or a little before two o'clock in the morning. I met a friend in South Audley-street, talked a few minutes with him, and then came direct home. When I got under <placeName id="t18170702-53-crimeloc304">Temple-bar</placeName>

They came up to me-two of them collared me, and the third drew my watch out of my fob; I felt it go. I can swear that the prisoners, Swainson and Drummond, are two of them. I do not know who took the watch - They surrounded and pinioned me before they took it. Swainson got hold of my arm, which I had put round Drummond's neck at the time I was trying to secure my watch. I called out, "you have robbed me!" and"watch!" I saw them hand it from one to the other, and heard the seals jibgle. Drummond's hat fell off-he picked it up, and ran away round the Bar into the Strand. I followed Swainson, who went the same way - I never lost sight of him. I came up to him before he got through the Bar. He turned into the road - I secured him, and said, "you have stolen my watch!" - He said he had not. I said he was one of the party, and gave him in charge of Allden, the watchman, who came up at my cry; we took him to St. Dunstan's watch-house-nothing was found on him. I went out with the constable into Fleet-street, Wainwright was given in charge by some person, I do not know who. I only recollect the persons of two of them. I have not recovered my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I never saw them before. It was about five minutes after three o'clock, quite daylight. I was not the least intoxicated.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LEFEVRE. I am a collector of the City tolls. On the morning of the 19th of June, I was walking backward and forward, between Chancery-lane and Templebar, to collect the tolls; I knew all the prisoners by sight - I have known Swainson and Drummond particularly well for a fortnight. I had seen Wainwright one or two nights before. I suppose I saw him pass me, in the course of the night of the robbery, about twenty times, in company with Swainson, between Temple-bar and Chancery-lane-another person was with them, it was not Drummond. About one o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to look at a book, and went under the gas-light to look at it; the prisoners, Swainson and Wainwright, came, and stooped and looked down under my hat. Knowing them, I put the book into my pocket; they went away-this drew my attention to them. I saw them walk backward and forward several times after. About three o'clock I saw all the prisoners standing together at the end of Shire-lane, on the City side of the Bar-they were talking together, and walked backward and forward. I got very near to them at one time, and heard a voice say, "Come along over!" I do not know who spoke. They went into the road, under the archway, and on the pavement on the opposite side, on the Middlesex side of Temple-bar. I crossed over to observe them, and placed myself on the City side of the Bar, next door to Messrs. Child's banking-house. In a minute or two, I saw the prisoners, Drummond, come along directly after Mr. Taylor, who was coming towards the Bar-all the prisoners were on the Middlesex side. Drummond came under the Bar first, walking very slowly, Mr. Taylor came next, and the prisoners, Swainson and Wainwright, came behind him-Mr. Taylor was between the three. I saw Swainson and Wainwright seize him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was he at that time - A. About a foot, or a foot and a half, within the City, the farthest side of the Bar is in the City. Directly as they seized him, Drummond turned round, his back was then towards me. I saw him, just at that moment, lift his arm up, as if he had made a snatch in a hurry-that moment Mr. Taylor put his arm round Drummond's neck, and said, you have robbed me, and called out watch! While he was calling out, the prisoners, Swainson and Wainwright, laid hold of his arm, lifted it up, and Drummond got away. As soon as he got his head from under Mr. Taylor's arm, I saw him stoop down and pick his hat up which fell off in the scuffle - He picked it up with his right hand. I looked down, and saw a watch in his left hand; he ran under Temple-bar, and turned into the carriage-road, into the City again, and started up Shire-lane - I saw no more of him. I kept my eye upon the others, and heard Mr. Taylor say, "you are one of them." He laid hold of Swainson. Swainson said,"I have not got your watch." Allden took him in charge. When I found the prosecutor had not given charge of Wainwright, I kept my eye upon him - He was never out of my sight. He stood, and appeared very much alarmed. When he found he was not noticed, he walked gently up towards the watch-house-by that time Swainston had gone up the court to the watch-house. I walked by the side of Wainwright, counting some halfpence. Just as I got to the end of the watch-house court, he said to me,"Do you know what they are going to do with that poor man?" - I made no answer. He said, "Do you know whether he has taken a pocket handkerchief?" I told him I did not know, as I had my business to mind. I staid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020023"/>by his side a few minutes, and the first watchman that I saw, I told that he was one of them - He was secured; a man named Turner took him. The next day I described Drummond to Gimber and Turner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Wainwright did not attempt to get away. Drummond held my place formerly. I never said right or wrong he should not have it again.</p>

            . I am constable of the night. On the 19th of June, about ten minutes after three o'clock, the prisoner, Swainson, was brought to the watch-house by Allden, and Taylor, the prosecutor. Nothing was found on him. He said he had not seen Taylor before. He said, that having been in trouble before, he saw the bustle, and endeavoured to avoid it, but Mr. Taylor came forward and gave him in charge. Wainwright was brought in soon after, and called himself Thomas Leonard-Mr. Taylor did not know him. Lefevre described Drummond to me, and told me his name was Drummond. I apprehended him at Waterloo. Fair on the same day. I took him into a public-house and searched him. He said,"What do you want with me? I know nothing about the matter; I know nothing about the watch - I have been in Shire-lane this morning at seven o'clock; and is it likely, that if I had got the watch that I should be without money?" This was before I searched him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you first saw him, did you tell him what you took him for - A. Not a word of the kind - I never told him what I took him for. He said he knew nothing of the watch, without having any thing said to him about it.</p>

               <p>Court to THOMAS TAYLOR. Q. At the time the three prisoners assaulted you, did you perceive any other persons near - A. I did not. It was not in my power to see any but the three who assaulted me.</p>

               <p>SWAINSON'S Defence. Unfortunately for me, Mr. Taylor has mistaken me for the right man. I was coming by, saw the scuffle, and tried to avoid it. Lefevre has sworn falsely - I was not about the Bar before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 27th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming along Skinner-street, and observed the two prisoners lurking about the door of an oil-shop, which made me watch them. They came into Newgate-street; Mr. Gaulter came out of a pastrycook's shop. They passed the door before he came out, and returned again. Wright came back, and left Evans standing towards Cheapside. Immediately as Mr. Gaulter passed, Wright turned round and fellowed him. Evans came up to him-they walked together, and Wright put his hand into Mr. Gaulter's coat-pocket, took out the handkerchief, and gave it to Evans. I seized Evans with it in his hand-Wright turned up towards Giltspur-street Compter. I called out stop thief! - He was secured immediately. Evans got from me; he was stopped immediately.</p>

               <p>LOUISA WOOD. I am servant to Mr. Porter, who lives in Quebec-street. I am fourteen years of age. On the 6th of June, I had the care of his little boy, who was six months old that day; I was by Lady Montague's house with two more girls, who also had children, the prisoner came up to me and said what a pretty child it was; she gave the other girls a penny, and told them to go and take a walk which they did; after they were gone, she asked me to go on an errand for her, she said I will hold your child while you go, I said I would take it with me; she told me to go to No. 21, Lower Berkeley-street, and she took the child out of my hands, and said I shall sit here till you come back. This was in George-street, she sat at the step of a door; she gave me sixpence, and said she would give me sixpence more, and told me to go and tell a young woman to come directly. I went, and found there was only nineteen houses in the street; when I came back she was gone and the child also. I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. It was after six o'clock in the evening. The girls who were with me live in Mr. Porter's house; Mrs. Porter desired me to stay with these girls and not to trust myself alone; the prisoner was not dressed as she is now. When I first got home my mistress was gone to look for the child. I described the prisoner when she returned, and said I should know her again; the prisoner said I could not knock at the door if I took the child with me. I wished to take it.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When you returned and found it gone, did you go home directly - A. It was not long. I told all the people; my mistress had heard of it before I got home.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMROD. I am a waterman at the coach-stand at Paddington-street, which is about five minutes walk from Lady Montague's house.</p>

               <p>On Friday, 6th of June, a little before seven o'clock, the prisoner came with a child and took Mr. Woolhead's chariot; I first saw her in Crawford-street, she was going towards the stand, I asked her if she wanted a coach, she said yes, and gave me the child; she looked rather hot in the face; she told me to tell the coachman to go to Piccadilly; the child had a white frock and cloak on; she immediately contradicted the order, and said, go to Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. The prisoner was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How soon after did you hear that a child had been lost - A. About eight o'clock, a man came about it; I told him, that she went away in Woolhead's chariot.</p>

            . I am the owner and driver of a hackney chariot which stood in Paddington-street. On the 6th of June, in the evening, the prisoner got in with a child. I am certain it was her; she told me to go to the White-horse-cellar, in Piccadilly, and immediately afterwards she said "drive to Charing-cross, and make haste." On the road the child cried, I looked back and saw the prisoner putting a clean frock and petticoat on the child. I drove on, and as I was going along Cockspur-street, she let down the glass, and said I will not stop here, go over Westminster-bridge, which I did; when I got to the obelisk, I asked her which way I was to go, she said "to the Elephant and Castle, road but go gently, as the shaking of the coach frightens the child;" I passed the Elephant and Castle, and went to the Bricklayer's-arms; she asked me where the Elephant and Castle was, I told her we had passed it, and this was the Bricklayer's-arms; she said with the fatigue of the child she did not know where she was; she asked where the Brighton stages went from, I told her the Elephant and Castle; she said I must go back there; I got her a pint of half-and-half, and she drank it, I asked her why she flurried herself so, the child was wranglesome; we went back, she told me to enquire for a return chaise to Croydon, that it might forward her to Brighton. I could not get one; I got the child some milk, and something for herself; she asked me what I would take her to Croydon for; I agreed to take her for twentyfive shillings, and to stop at any place she required to pacify the child; I went on till we got to the Horse and Groom, at Streatham, which was about nine o'clock, it was dark; the landlady took the child and nursed it, and brought it to her again. When we got to Croydon, she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020025"/>asked me to get her a post-chaise; I put her into one at the Greyhound, to go to Reigate, which is the first stage to Brighton; this was about half-past ten o'clock. I got back about half-past four the next morning, and found a child had been lost. I went to Mr. Porter and told him what had passed; I immediately took him, and his father, to Croydon, and got there about five o'clock in the morning, we went on to Reigate and through Brighton, and found the prisoner and child at Chichester, about two o'clock in the afternoon; it is about eighty-three miles from London. It was the same child.</p>

About a quarter before eight I received information, and went to Woolhead's house; he called on me about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning; I, and my father, went with him to Croydon immediately, in a chaise, from there we went to Reigate, from thence to Ilinton, and to the Golden Fleece at Chichester; and was informed there was a lady just gone up with a child. I went up into the bed-room and saw the prisoner and my child, it was crying on the bed, and she was leaning over it, and patting it with her hand to quiet it; the child immediately recognized me and laughed; I said, "ah! Henry, have I found you," it immediately recognized me; it had not got my frock on-the prisoner appeared confused.

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate at Chichester. The prisoner was brought before me, what she said was not taken down in writing; I asked her how she could be so cruel as to deprive the parents of their child, and if she was married herself; she said she was a mother; I told her I did not think it possible for a mother to be guilty of such an act; I asked her what she intended to do with it, she said she intended to return it to its parents. Mr. Porter stated the very distressed state in which he had left his wife; I sent her to Bow-street immediately; she begged I would not send her, an the mob in Chichester would tear her to pieces.</p>

            . I am surgeon to the garrison. On the 21st of October last, I was called to look at the deceased, I found her on the bed; understanding that she was senseless, I tried to bleed her but could not; she was quite dead, and cold. I noticed a lacerated wound about the right eye-brow, and several severe contusions above and below both ears and on her neck, and bruises on her neck and chest; she had a small cut below her ear, which appeared to be the marks of finger nails, and had penetrated through the skin; I opened the body the next day and fond a considerable effusion of blood on the head, upon the vicia, which is sufficient to produce death; there are other causes which could have produced death. I found a great quantity of extravasated blood on the chest, which I attributed to the violence of the blows; it might have been from other causes; the prisoner laid on his left side crying over her, and it was with difficulty I persuaded him to leave her; he said if he had been beating or ill-treating her, he should not have been surprized at her death; the wound was from an inch to an inch and half long below the ears, which I should have judged had been given by some weapon; the fist might have produced it, and so might a fall; the whole of the bruises could not have been produced by a fall.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The mark over her right eye-brow might have arisen from the fall. Supposing a person had been intoxicated, and had repeatedly fallen down, it might have produced the wound on the eye.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think could not have proceeded from the falls - A. The contusions about the ears could not have proceeded from the fall and would have caused death; if a person had been convulsed and had struggled, it might possibly have had that appearance. I have attend

             the deceased often-from what I have observed, she was addicted to intoxication, and rather inclined to be plethorical; with that inclination, encouraged as it must be by extravasation of the brain, it might have produced it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you conceive the extravasation of the brain to have been the immediate cause of her death - 
               <persName id="t18170702-59-person516">A. </persName>
            Either would have caused it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bursting of the vessels of the brain, the immediate cause of death - A. Drinking alone might have caused extravasation of blood on the brain.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing an extravasation of blood to be caused by a fall, would the party be able to walk afterwards - A. A very short distance; they would retain strength for a short time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The two women who came, said there was no blood; it is very strange that there was no blood on the body or the floor, as she had cut her eye.</p>

            . I sailed on board the Cornwall as quarter-master, the prisoner was also quarter-master. I recollect while the vessel was at Whampoo-reach, a party of us had leave to go to Canton, Brown, Glanville, Fitzpatrick, and the prisoner were of the party; we returned from Canton towards the ship, between five or six o'clock in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020027"/>evening of the 24th of October, there were eight of us; I had the command of the boat. Brown said, Fitzpatrick had not pulled an oar since we left Canton, and that he had better lay it in; Fitzpatrick said he could not pull on account of the chest which was in his way. - Glanville offered to change places with him, they got up to change, Fitzpatrick was going farther aft in the boat, next the prisoner; the prisoner said he would heave him overboard if he did not pull. Fitzpatrick was twenty-one years of age, and rather slender. Fitzpatrick said he could not, and was in the act of sitting down on the seat, when the prisoner took him by his back and trowsers, and shoved him over-it was between seven and eight o'clock; we were about half way down the reach, towards the ship-the river is about a quarter of a mile broad there, and six or seven feet deep-the tide was very strong, and going down. When the prisoner had thrown him over, he said, "there you are." I was upon the bow-oar, I jumped aft, and took his place; the prisoner wished to jump overboard to make away with himself; we stopped to look for the body. It was dark. We saw no more of him. We laid there eight or ten minutes, calling out, but could hear nothing; the river was very deep with mud about the place; we then made for the ship, and got there about half-past nine o'clock. The prisoner was secured. In seven days after the body was brought alongside. I knew it was his body, by the dress, and the hair on his upper lip; his face was muddy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. If a man had been thrown in there, and got on his legs, he would be unable to stand. The body was not brought on deck. It was his body.</p>

            . I was in the boat, Brown said, the deceased, did not pull his oar, I made the same remark; the deceased and I were going to change places, my back was towards him. I heard the prisoner say, if he did not pull better, he would heave him overboard; the deceased said, thank God, he could not do it, or he dare not; the prisoner said, "Can't I." I was turning round to take my seat, and the prisoner threw him overboard. We stopped the boat, but never saw him again. I afterwards saw a body brought to the ship, his clothes appeared the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. We were all friends. I got into his place and rowed very well-there was no chest to hinder me. There was no chaplain on board. The body that I saw afterwards was dressed like the deceased.</p>

            He did; he was very much agitated, and wished to throw himself over, and was held down to prevent it; he said, several times, that he had been the cause of a man's death, and wished we would let him jump overboard also. The deceased could not swim.</p>

I had told him on that day week that my father had had a little money, and was going to put us to school with it; I did not know the amount. He said, if I would let him see them, he would tell me what they were. I took him home. I knew my father had put them under the flap of the table. I could not read writing. He looked at them, and said it was a 30l. and a 10l. - I wrapped them up, and put them under the table again; I went out, and left him in the room by himself; he used to go to my father's sometimes. I was called away, and returned in about half an hour, but never saw the notes after.</p>

In consequence of what he said, I went with him to his master's house, and immediately the prisoner took us into the privy, and put his hand down the hole, and gave me a parcel, which contained a 30l. note, with a 5l., and one 2l. together. I produced them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRLEY. I searched the privy. Flint has spoken correctly.</p>

On the 10th of June, I was at work at Mr. Ley's yard, he is a stone-mason, which is about forty yards from Perkins's, and saw the prisoner, a little before eight o'clock in the morning, go by the yard, which is on the same side of the way as Perkins's with the bed on his shoulder - I did not see where he came from; he was a stranger to me. A wo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020029"/>man came up, and asked me if I had seen a man pass with a bed? I told her I had, and in consequence of what she said, I went after him, and stopped him before he got out of my sight. I caught him coming out of a court, about a mile off; I ran after him directly the woman gave me information - I had lost sight of him before, and I called out stop thief! he had got over Hare-street Fields-it was about a quarter of an hour after I had seen him go by; when I first saw him again, he was coming out of Hare-court - He was stopped ten or twelve yards from me; he ran as fast as he could; he had not got the bed then - I am sure of his person. He was stopped about a mile from where I work - I secured him. A mob came round, and said, I should get into trouble if I did not let him go - He said if I would let him go he would walk quietly by me; I did so - He immediately threw his coat off into the road, and ran off as fast as he could; he was pursued,and secured just by Spitalfields, and given into the charge of Boston. I am positive he is the man I saw go by with the bed.</p>

I am sure the prisoner is the man, he was taken to the watch-house.

On the 24th of June, about a quarter after nine o'clock at night, I was by the King's Mews-three men met me, one of them asked me the way to Paddington - I directed them to the Haymarket - They came straight up Whitcomb-street with me, and kept jostling me; I looked at them several times-the prisoner was one of them; it was day-light. I went on till I came to the corner of Meard's-court, they then got round me. I felt one of them take my watch out - I did not miss my bag till afterwards. I called out stop thief! and ran after them. Two went up the court, through Queen-street, into Bateman's-buildings, and Soho-square. I was pursuing them, and missed one of them. I followed the prisoner into the square, and he was stopped there. I never lost sight of him, and am sure he is the man. I came up as soon as he was stopped; he asked me if I could swear he was the person who took my watch? I had not mentioned a word to any person about a watch. A gentleman brought the watch up immediately-the case came off in the fall; another man brought the case, and said he found it about two yards from the place where he was stopped. I am positively certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL CRAWLEY. I am a jeweller, and live in King-street, Soho. I was crossing Soho-square, heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running, as hard as possible, from the corner of Bateman's-buildings; I endeavoured to stop him - He was running from the cry, a man was pursuing him - I stopped him. He stooped down to the knees of his breeches; I thought he was putting something there, and he said "I have not got it." The mob came round, when Shand came up, and said he had been robbed, and that the prisoner was the man. The watch was produced by a gentleman, who said he picked it up just round the corner-the case was afterwards produced.</p>

The next morning, at eight o'clock, I missed them. My house is at Upper Islington. I have some pens at the back of my house. If I wanted to go from the Pied Bull to Cross-street, the nearest way would be to pass the front of my house; there is another way by the back road. When I lost the sheep, I sent for Beasley; the next morning he made a communication, which made me suspect the prisoner Harvey. At eleven o'clock the next morning, I went with a constable to Castle-street, Clerkenwell, and took him up-we found him bed. I believe he said he had been to Portsmouth. I next went with Beasley, French, and Lack, to the house of the prisoner, Parrott, in Blue-gate-fields, Shadwell. I found her at home, sitting in the shop, which was fitted up like a butcher's shop; there were a few hooks in the window, and two knuckles of mutton laying on the window. I found a neck of mutton laying on the board, with the lamb, exposed for sale. I searched further, and found a shoulder of mutton behind a great coat in the shop. The constable opened a cupboard, and found two pair of hind-quarters of mutton hanging up, covered with a dirty cloth; the cupboard was in the shop, the door was not locked. The constable went up stairs, and brought down a pair of fore-quarters and a brisket, with a cloth over them; they were fat mutton, and answered to one of the hind quarters; all the joints corresponded, and were fat mutton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. I do not know whether Parrott has a husband. The fore-quarters were cut up by a butcher; the hind-quarters were together. The cupboard was a very improper place to keep meat; it should be hung in an open place.</p>
               <p>JOHR BEASLEY. I am a drover. The last witness gave me orders to drive seven fat sheep to his house at Islington. I marked them on the back, and along the off hip; they had an O branded round the tail. I took them to his house. On Monday, the 26th of May, I was sitting on the bench at the Thatched-house, Lower Islington, just at the bottom of Cross-street, about a quarter before five o'clock; I saw a young man named French, drive two sheep down by Paradise-place, by the mad-house - They were fat sheep. I asked him where he was going with them? he said he found them in the back road, and did not know where he was going with them. I saw the O on them, but did not observe the other marks-the O was just above the tail - They were just turning the corner. I told Mr. Sanders, and afterwards took French to him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. There are a number of sheep marked with an O on them.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FRENCH. I know the prisoner, Harvey, and re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020031"/>member seeing him last Whit Monday just by Smithfield-bars; he said he would give me a job to drive two sheep. I went to the Pied Bull, at Islington, with him; when he got there, he told me to go round by the back road to the Rainbow public-house, and stay there till he came to me. I went, and very soon afterwards he came to me - He came out of the pens by the Pied Bull - He was driving two sheep through the palings. He brought them to me, and told me to drive them and follow him. I went round to Upper-street, Islington, and down a street. I saw Beasley at the Thatched-house - He asked me whose sheep they were? I told him I found them in the back road, and did not know whose they were; upon which the prisoner (who was just by me), ran down by the river. I drove them on, and saw him again soon after - I saw him just by Shoreditch Church turnpike, turning down to Bethnal-green; he went on before me, into the Commercial-road, and left the sheep at the prisoner's, Parrott, house. Harvey went on there before me, and I drove the sheep in. He told her to give me 2s. I went to the house and saw her there; I did not stay five minutes - I heard him tell her to give me 2s., which she did. The sheep were put into a little bit of a shed, like a small slaughter-house. I went away. They were marked on the back, and down the off side, with ochre, and an O put at the back of the tail, branded with tar. Beasley came to me on the Monday morning, and I afterwards went to the prisoner, Harvey's house. He told me, if any person stopped me, I was to say I found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Parrott's house is a butcher's shop; it was market-day at Smithfield. Harvey used to be a master-drover.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LACK. I am an officer. On the 28th of May I went to Harvey's house and found him in bed. I told him I came about two sheep which belonged to Mr. Sanders - He said he knew nothing about them. I took him to Hatton-garden, and then went to Parrott's shop-her shop looks more like a cat's-meat shop than a butcher's. I asked her if she knew a man of the name of Harvey-she said, No. I asked her if she knew that boy (I had French with me), she hesitated, and then said she had seen him before, she did not say when. I asked her what she had done with those sheep which the boy had brought there? she gave me no answer. I asked her if she should know the man that came with the boy; she said she should. After the meat was found, I asked her what became of the skins - She said the man who brought it there had taken them away. I had spoken to her of Harvey being the man, before I searched the house. A table stood before the cupboard door; I removed it, opened the door, and found the hind-quarters of two fat sheep. I went up into the bed-room, she remained below. I found a clothes-basket against the head of the bed, and two fore-quarters of fat mutton in it, covered over with a cloth; this was all I found there. I went back again the same day, as she told me I had not got all. I searched the same room, and found a fore-quarter of mutton hanging behind the door, covered over with a petticoat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I believe there was some cat's-meat hanging up in the window. I do not know that she has a husband. I searched for sheep-skins, but could not find any.</p>

             re-examined. Lack brought the last fore-quarter to me-that, together with what had been previously found, made two whole sheep, except the offal. It appeared to be nearly fresh killed.</p>

               <p>Q. If you employ a drover to drive sheep, and he employs a boy, who pays the boy - A. He does. I have known Harvey fifteen or sixteen years - He is a drover. When a butcher buys sheep the skins belong to him.</p>
               <p>HARVEY'S Defence. The boy has spoken falsely. I was quite lame, and could not follow the sheep.</p>
               <p>PARROTT'S Defence. I have a lawful husband. I did not know but what he had bought them; he is a butcher. I have often paid the drovers for bringing the sheep home.</p>
               <p>Jury to FRENCH. Q. You say, when Beasley spoke to you the prisoner ran away, and you did not see him again till you got to Shoreditch turnpike - A. He had told me to go to the Commercial-road when he first spoke to me. I knew the road very well.</p>

On the 4th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by a knocking at the door. I was the last person up at night, and fastened the doors before I went to bed, which was about a quarter after twelve o'clock. I examined every thing, and saw the doors and windows all fast. My family consists of my wife, son, nephew, niece, and servants. I had been in the parlour before I went to bed-there is a bookcase there. I did not leave a candle there. In consequence of the knocking at the door, and what I was told, I came down undressed - I did not find any person in the house. The street - door was shut, but neither locked nor bolted - I had seen it safe when I went to bed; there are two bolts, a chain, and a lock to it. I found the door of my library open, and every thing that laid in the front<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020032"/>taken out. On the edge of the bookcase, there were marks of a candle which had been burning, and marks of fire; it was not burning then, the candle was not in the candlestick. The prisoner Bull lived servant with me for two years and one month, and quitted my service about three months ago; I searched my house and missed a great quantity of things. My son's name is William, he is twenty-two years of age. The room-window was also broken open by cutting a pane of glass out by the fastening, undoing it, and lifting it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CURWOOD. The shutters and windows were quite open; if they had had daylight, they had enough to do without lighting a candle.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cartwright, I came into his service when Bull left it; I sleep in the pantry under the back parlour in question. I am seventeen years of age next August. On the night between the 3d and 4th of July, I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, I went to sleep and awoke as I heard the clock strike two, I heard something like the breaking of a bottle almost immediately, and persons walking about the rooms over my head. After the clock struck three, I heard somebody come down stairs to my door, it was not locked; I did not hear them go away again; I heard something like the wrenching of drawers and locks; they did not come into my room. I was afraid to get up; I did not get up until my master called me.</p>

            . I am a milkman. On Friday morning, the 4th of July, I was going from the barn with my milk; I was passing Mr. Cartwright's house; I turned round and saw the prisoners, Fitzwilliam and Wilkins, come out of Mr. Cartwright's house, they had bundles with them, each of them had a bundle, or more than one each; I saw them go round the corner; I then saw the prisoner. Bull, standing inside the house holding the door and looking at me, thinking that I was watching him; Blyth came up, and we both went over to the house, and just as we got up to the door the prisoner, Bull, said,"what do you want?" and shut the door in our faces, it was not shut before. I am certain that he is the man; I knocked at the door twice, Mr. Cartwright came to the window we told him, he came down. Before he came down, I looked through the key-hole and saw Bull going backwards; I saw a light from the back of the house so as to see that he went through the passage; I told Mr. Cartwright that there was a man in the house; we went round to the back of the house, and saw Bull getting over the paling of Mr. Cartwright's house; there is a brick-field there; he got over before we could lay hold of him; I sent Blyth round and he secured him. I told Line, in the presence of Bull, that he had been robbing the house, and there had been two more gone out with bundles, and told him which way they went. I am sure the other two persons are the men I saw come out of the house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BLYTH. The last witness has spoken correctly; I know the three prisoners; I saw them - I saw Bull in the house that morning, and afterwards took him. I am sure he is the man; I saw him getting over the wall. I am certain he is the man I saw at the door.</p>

On Sunday morning, the 25th of May, between six and seven o'clock I went to the shop, and found the back-door of the house a-jar; I found the shop-door burst open, the padlock was forced off, and several of the shelves cleared of the property; the window-shutters were forced, and the windows thrown open; I mean the back-windows of the yard, the bolt was wrenched off and the sash up. I told my mistress, and got an officer; I went round to look for the property and saw the prisoner, Grogan, in Blue-anchor-yard, which is about one hundred yards from the house, with a bundle on his shoulder; I knew him; Ellis was with me, we went up to him and took the bundle from him, and Ellis secured him; this was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

Howard asked me, in the presence of Jones, if I would buy a jacket, I said I would; I went into the shop. Howard produced one, and asked 4s., for it; having my suspicions I sent my boy to Mrs. Jacobs; she came, I heard she had been robbed, two jackets were taken from Howard and one from Jones; Jones wore one of them, and Howard two.

On the night of the 14th of June, I had some pistols in my workshop, two of them were marked BASS on the back of the barrel; I had also several of my own; I locked the counting-house at half-past ten o'clock, and went to bed at eleven; there is a door which leads into a court; I was not disturbed myself, but between five or six o'clock in the morning, my servant called me, I found two squares of glass cut out of the window, and the cross bar taken off, so that a man could get through, I tried to open the counting-house-door but could not, the lock had been strained and hung on the bolt; I put my porter through the hole and he let me in, I found the lock wrenched off, and the handle laid on the counter; I missed twelve pistols which I had locked up in my desk, and the counting-house strewed over with papers; my name was on most of the pistols; two of them had the name of BASS on them; I saw them at the office on the 18th.</p>

On the night of the 14th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard the noise of glass breaking; I went to bed at eleven o'clock, and had been in bed about an hour; I am certain I did not go to sleep before I heard the noise; I also heard a sawing, which continued about ten minutes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020034"/>and then a violent crush; it seemed to proceed from the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am certain I had not been asleep; it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRANCIS. I am porter to Mr. Baker; I left the house about nine o'clock, on the 14th of June; the door which leads from the work-shop was safe; I went out at the front-door; between four and five o'clock the next morning, I was called up, and went to the work-shop door that leads into the court, and found it half open; I went in and found the counting-house windows were all cut open; I called my master, he came down and went with me to the counting-house.</p>

He was stopped in John-street, which is next to Windmill-street - he was running. I assisted in taking him to the watch-house, and took the spoons out of his pocket, and saw the gentleman take the watch out of his hand. I saw the prisoner thrust his hand into his left-hand pocket, I thought he was going to throw something away, and put my hand in and took the spoons and skeleton keys out-they were wrapped up together in his pocket-handkerchief; he did not say how he came by them.

I came out and got about twenty yards from the door, the prisoner laid hold of my arms, pinioned me, and pushed me against the wall, while the others took my purse out of my pocket. I laid hold of him, he made off with the rest, I ran after them, and secured him, he said it was not him, but that the others had got my purse, and shewed me which way they were gone. I went after them, and left him with the crowd, but could not catch them; when I returned I found the prisoner had got away. I ran after him, secured him, and gave him in charge. I am sure he is the man.</p>

On the 27th of June, I saw Byers come out of the shop, he pulled his purse out to count his money, and put it into his pocket again; the prisoner took hold of his trowsers and pushed him against the wall, when another man took the money out; there were three others with him-they ran away. Byers caught the prisoner, he said it was not him; Byers let him go, to run after the others. He caught him again. I am sure he is the man.</p>

On the 15th I put the prisoner and Bois on board, in charge of her; on the 17th I went to the vessel again, the prisoner was not there, he had broken his arm on the same day that he went on board. I gauged four casks, the ullage of three of them was four inches and a quarter dry, and the other three and a quarter, which is an unusual ullage-the casks were new. I discovered a spoil in the top of the bilge, which had been cut off even with the cask, the cask was perfectly dry on the top. I rummaged the ship, and found twelve gallons and a half of whiskey in the lockers, in two kettles, a teapot, and some stone bottles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Bois has also been suspended.</p>
               <p>JOHN NICHOLSON. I was on board the Lord Melville; the prisoner came on board on the 15th of May; I cleared away for stocking the casks-the prisoner then asked me, Tully, and Backers, to go into the hold with him. When we got there he handed me down four quart bottles, and told me to fill them - He found a crane - I filled them, and returned them up the galley to Tully, he handed them to Backers. When I was drawing off, he said the crane was not big enough by half an inch, and asked if I or any of the ship's company had a funnel, to put water into the cask; I told him I had not. The crew were all on deck. He took the crane out of my hand, and 
               <persName id="t18170702-79-person666">drew</persName>
             the liquor off himself, saying, that I was no hand at it. I filled all the bottles, and drew out two tin pots full, one of which contains about three pints, and the other two quarts; he handed them to me. I handed them up the galley - We filled other vessels, when we had done, he said, "such casks as I have not taken into stock, you may take what you want out of them, for the crane cannot hurt these casks; but when you have done, be sure and spoil them up, and cut it off snug, and I shall bore in the same holes, so that our betters may ******." We were there about ten minutes after that, and then went up. Moore is an apprentice on board. About two o'clock I saw Bois speak to the prisoner. They went up with one bottle, and the prisoner fell down, broke his arm, and went on shore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never saw the prisoner before. This was all done in two hours. Tully and Backers saw what passed. I am now in confinement. On the 17th the officer came on board, and found the whiskey.</p>
               <p>BRISBANE MOORE. I am an apprentice on board the vessel. I saw the prisoner go into the hold with Nicholson, Tully, and Backers, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I was in the kitchen at dinner-time, and saw a tin-pot standing on the table with whiskey in it-it would hold about a quart. While I was there, some whiskey was handed up from the hole in a tin-pot-the prisoner and Nicholson were in the hold at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was first asked about them two days after it had happened. I drank once of it.</p>

            , who is the son of one of them. I gave him a 3s. piece, a half crown, and a sixpence, which I marked-he was to go to the prisoner's house to purchase base coin-Lines was with me. I saw him go to the prisoner's house myself; he keeps the house. Caine stopped there about twenty minutes. We placed ourselves about twenty yards off-on his coming out, he gave me a signal that he had got the money; we went up and laid hold of him; the prisoner had got the door in his hand letting him out. I searched Caine in his presence, and found a paper, containing 12s., which I produce. They were folded up separately. I asked Caine where he go them from? he said at first he did not know. I asked him if he got them from the prisoner; he said, in a low tone of voice, that he did-the prisoner heard me ask him. I then searched the prisoner, and found 21s. in good silver on him - I did not find those that I had given to Caine. I went up stairs to search, but found nothing; I afterwards went up again, and found a board loose in the floor of the garret, I took it up, and found the marked money which I had given to Caine; I also found a quantity of base coin. The prisoner was with me - He said he knew nothing about it. There was no other person in the house-there are only three rooms in it, one above the other; I took him into custody, and returned and researched again, and found a melting-pot in the cellar, and in the garret I found a vice and a black-lead pot. I took up another board in the garret, and found a great many papers which appeared to be of the same kind as that the money was wrapped in.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAINE. On the 11th of June last my mother was in custody. I afterwards saw Lines and Jones. He gave me a 3s. piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence. I went to the prisoner's house and found him there - He shut the door, and took me into the kitchen. I told him my aunt was very bad, and could not come herself, and I was to have 6s. worth of Derbys. I did not know what it meant. He told me to speak softly, and he would go and fetch them for me. My aunt had sent me once before, and told me to ask for Derbys. I put the money that Jones gave me into my waistcoat pocket, and gave it to him. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020037"/>locked me up in the kitchen and left me there; he came down to me again, and gave me a paper, telling me to put it into my pocket before I got to the door. I put it into my waistcoat-pocket. He said the people could see them there; I said they could not. When I got to the door, I scratched my head, to give

             a signal that I had got them, which I had agreed to do. Jones stopped me on the step, and put his foot against the door to prevent its being shut, and asked me what I had got? I told him nothing, as I was afraid of the prisoner's striking me-there was no other person in the house. He searched my pocket and found them there; I never opened them-it was the parcel that the prisoner gave me.</p>

            . I am a beadle of Limehouse. I and Jones sent Caine to the prisoner's house; I saw him go in and come out, and had him in sight all the time, except while he was in the house. On his coming out, Jones took a paper from him. I afterwards went into the house, and found a paper, up stairs, which contained the marked money that was given to Caine. Jones found a paper containing ninety-eight bad shillings, and four punches with letters on them, with which the old shillings were marked; I also found a paper containing eight counterfeit shillings and six 1s. 6d. tokens, apparently new, and three separate papers, containing forty bad shillings in each, imitating the new coinage.</p>

The three papers, containing 40s. each, are also counterfeit, and of the same die as the twelve - They are each wrapped in separate papers, to prevent their rubbing.

               <p>"It was No. 32,719, dated 24th Feb. 1817," there were other notes in the book at the time; I have seen it since; I missed a tea-spoon, and saw that also at the office. The prisoner is a turn-over apprentice and had been in the house about five months; he had an opportunity of going into the room where my coat hung; the door used to be open; I sent for an officer and apprehended him on suspicion. My son-in-law is a tailor.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody at his master's house, searched him, and found a pocket-book in his coat-pocket, which contained several duplicates; one of which applies to the tea-spoon. The prisoner said it was a duplicate of an apron belonging to a young woman; I also found the duplicate of two table-cloths. On the Thursday, I found the bank note under the drawers in the room where I searched him, it was a 2l. note. Mr. Harlow told me the number of it before he saw it. After I had searched the prisoner, I told him he must have done it, and asked him where he had put it; he said he threw it under the drawers while I was searching him.</p>

            . I live in Cock-court, New-street, Golden-square. On the 1st of June, about half-past twelve o'clock at night. I was going to see a young woman in St. James's-street. When I was at the corner of Silver-street, I asked the watchman the way - He directed me into Swallow-street; the prisoner was listening to what I said on the other side of the way, with four others, it was moonlight. I went towards Swallow-street - all five followed me till I came to the <placeName id="t18170702-83-crimeloc474">corner of Vigo-lane</placeName>

The prisoner said, "hand over your money." There were four 1l. notes 10s. in silver in my pockets. They immediately left me and went down Swallow-street, towards Piccadilly. I went along Sackville-street, and as soon as I met the watchman I told him. I cried out when they first went away, but there was no person near me-the watchman went after them with me. As I was going into St. James's-street, and was telling the watchman of it, I saw the prisoner standing by a hackney-coach in Piccadilly, and gave him in charge - He did not run away; he stopped till the watchman came up and took him-nothing was found on him. I am positively certain that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What are you - A. An unfortunate girl. I was not intoxicated. I had received the four 1l. notes that night of a gentleman.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Sackville-street - I go to the very bottom of the street. I met the prosecutrix about one o'clock in the morning of the 1st of July. I saw about four or five men at the corner of Vigo-lane; they went down Swallow-street. She called to me, and said she had been robbed by the five men; I did not go after them. She kept walking with me till we got to the bottom of Sackville-street, I stood there, and saw four or five men following her again; they appeared to be the same men-it was about five minutes after I had got to the bottom of the street. I followed behind them, and was about ten yards off - She was about four yards before them; they came up to her again. One of them, with a blue coat, demanded some money of her for shewing her the way to St. James's-street. I got up to them; she said she had none, for they had robbed her of all she had; she accused them of taking it, and turned round to me and said</p>
               <p>"here is one of the men."</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You saw five of them - A. The four separated from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not seize them immediately - A. She did not give them in charge-she told me to take a man by the coaches, he stood on the pavement. I laid hold of him - He acknowledged he was one of those that had spoken to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a 40l. reward - A. Yes; I never spoke to her about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She asked me the way to St. James's-street, and gave me in charge.</p>

            . I am servant to Messrs. Richardson and Want. On Sunday morning, about five o'clock, I was getting up, and saw the prisoner knock down the two boards at the window, and get through into the yard. I watched him, and saw him bring a piece of timber out into the street, and put it on the top of my master's cart; he went about twenty yards farther, then returned, took the boards on his shoulder, and walked into Air-street with them. I followed and secured him with the boards. He threw them off his shoulder.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Church-road, St. George's in the East. On the 6th of June, Mrs. Dempsey, who lives next door to me, and keeps a broker's shop, came to me, and said a man had brought some things which she thought had been stolen, and asked me to come into her shop, while she followed him, as he said he was going for another parcel. I went, and saw one of the boxes lying open on the floor, with a pair of pistols and some loose papers in it. She returned, and said she had watched him, and had lost him just by the Wheatsheaf. Just at that moment, the man returned with another mahogany box, in a canvas bag. I asked him what he brought them there for? he said,</p>
               <p>"your master knows." I told him he must have been wrong informed, and that I should detain him till I sent for an officer. He wanted to go out, and seemed very much agitated. I delivered him to Williams. It was not the prisoner; it was a man named Afflect.</p>

             DEMPSEY. I am a broker, and live in Church-road, St. George's in the East. I was standing at my door - A man ran in with the box into my back room. I asked him what he had got there? he said, "your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020039"/>master knows." He said he had another to fetch, I let him leave it. it was open - I lifted up the cover, and saw some pistols in it; I got Williams to watch my door, and followed him, but lost sight of him; he returned with the other box, and was secured. It was Affleck.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM AFFLECK. I am a cordwainer. On the 5th of June I was sitting at work about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in with a box under his arm, and his wife with another box, they requested me to let them leave the things there while they went a little further; knowing them, I did not suspect any thing was wrong, and let them leave them, expecting they would return and take them away as they promised; no person came-but the next morning his wife came, and asked if her husband had been to fetch them - She went away, and I saw no more of them. At five o'clock the next day I went to his house, and saw his son, he lives at No. 2, Church-road; the boy said his father and mother were locked up for things they had left at my house. I went and told the patrol - He advised me to send for an officer, I thought I had better send them to the prisoner's house, but instead of going into No. 2, I went to No. 4 (which is Dempsey's), by mistake, and left them there-when I came with the second box, I was taken into custody. I put the box into a bag that the things might not fall out-it being open.</p>

I said, "Sam, they have stolen my watch;" upon which Mr. Parsons went in search of the prisoner, and called out stop thief! I immediately received a violent blow on my breast, and one on my eye, which completely stunned me, and knocked me down - I do not know what passed after! I was taken to the watchhouse, and when I got a little better the prisoner was shewn to me, and my watch. I only saw one person come up at first - I did not see anybody afterwards.</p>

            . I was in company with Langton, near the New Church, I had hold of his arm; I saw the prisoner's hands against his fob - He instantly made off-the prosecutor said he had lost his watch; I run after him very quick towards the church, and had him in sight till he had turned the corner. I took notice of his dress. He turned up a court at the back of the church, when I came up the court I found him in custody. I am positive he is the man. I found my friend in a passage, very much bruised, lying on his back, insensible; I saw the prisoner's hand close to his fob, and he gave a jerk; there was no other person near.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LANGLEY. I am a constable, and live in Drury-court; I heard the cry of stop thief! I went to my door, and the prisoner was the first man that passed. I laid hold of him - He was running as fast as he could; he said "what do you want with me, I have done nothing." The moment I turned round Parsons came up, and said,"what, have you got him." I took him to the watchhouse, but found nothing on him. Gregg brought a watch, which he said he had picked up on the stone railing of the church, where the prisoner must have passed; there was no other person in the court. I could see clearly. No person could have passed before him.</p>

She had told me, that if she did not get a situation in a very little while, she did not know what she should do, as she was in distress. The evening that she left me, I saw her bring in a very large bundle. On Thursday, I missed two 5l. notes and 2s.6d. in copper, in a brown paper, and one yard of sprig muslin; I should not know my notes again; I suspected her, and got an officer, and sent for her over to a public-house, opposite to where she lived, and told her I had been robbed - I neither promised or threatened her. She seemed confused for a short time; I told her I had every reason to suspect her; she denied having any knowledge of it for sometime. I gave her in charge, she then confessed she had taken them. The constable did not promise her, she said she had taken the two 5l. notes; I asked her what she had done with them, she said she had laid them all out; I then told her I had lost one yard of sprig muslin, she said she took it, and had torn it up one day while she was with me; I then told her I had lost half-a-crown worth of halfpence; she denied it for some time, and then said she took them before she took the notes, and begged I would forgive her; I had not done anything to induce her to think I should forgive her.</p>

               <p>"you are the person I want;" I have been robbed, and you are the person who did it; she denied it at first. Mrs. Smith asked her how she came by her new linen and bonnet; she said, she could not give any account. Mrs. Smith said she should give her in charge - I shut the door - She began to cry - I neither promised or threatened her. Mrs. Smith said,</p>
               <p>"you are the person and no one else;" she then confessed taking the two 5l. notes, and asked me if I could forgive her - I told her I could not - She said she had changed one of the notes at a linen-draper's in Holborn.

            . I am a constable. On the 3d of June, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, the two prisoners passed my window in Castle-street, Leicester-square; Steward had a bundle concealed under his coat; I went out and overtook them, and asked them what they had got, Steward said it was nothing; I took the bundle from him, and found two trusses; I asked him where he got them, he said, from a broker's shop in Duke's-court; he said he was going to take them to Monmouth-street to the woman's brother. I secured them, and found they belonged to Edy.</p>

I stopped a few minutes, they went in doors and I followed them, and saw the prisoners and the landlord together, in the back private room; Loader had a little basket of corn in his hand, when he saw me, he threw it under the seat; I found the sack of corn in the stable, I asked the landlord who put it in the stable, he said there had been nobody there to his knowledge; I think he must have seen it go through, the prisoners heard what the landlord said, they made no reply; I secured them, and asked Barrs what he left corn there for, he said, he left it to get a few shillings for himself. It was mixed oats, beans and chaff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The master was not giving Loader any directions. I did not see him till after it was taken in.</p>

            . I am an oilman. On the 1st of June, between four and five o'clock in the evening, I was going up Mr. Atkinson's yards, and saw a man up in his loft. I asked him what he did there? he said he had been there to sleep, and that he was in liquor. I told him if he had had his sleep out, he had better go off the premises, instead of which he went to the privy. I found the lead cut off the gutter - He made the best of his way out of the yard, I followed and secured him. I asked him why he cut the lead off? he said because he was a fool, and hoped I would forgive him, as he was in distress.</p>

He desired to look at some umbrella silks; he looked at one piece, and agreed to buy two, he was to pay ready money for them. He ordered them to be sent to his house at five o'clock, and gave me a printed card, from which I copied his direction-it was "
               <persName id="t18170702-99-person809">
                  Solomon

             and Co., Ship Agents, Newroad, St. George's" - I returned the card to him. The two pieces came to 40l. 9s.; I went with them myself, and found Solomon Cohen and Co. Ship-agents, written on the door. I saw the prisoner there, he paid me in the counting-house, which appeared to be a place of great business, there were some slop-goods there-he did not take a receipt. The next day, about eleven o'clock, he came again, and ordered two more pieces of the same sort; I took them to his house at five o'clock as before. He told me to bring them to his house after Change hours - I left them there without the money; he said he would call with it the next morning, which he did-he paid me 25l. 18s., and ordered two pieces of umbrella silk, and one piece of parasol silk, amounting to 60l. 3s. - I delivered them between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. He then told me he expected a large order from a captain, and if we could serve him well, he would give it to us. On the 12th of June (next day), about eleven o'clock in the morning, he came and paid me 61l., which left a balance of 17s., and ordered twenty-four pieces of umbrella silk, and said they must be very low, and I must take off ten per cent. discount, as he bought for cash - I had only taken off five per cent. before. The order being large, and for ready money, induced me to consent to take off ten per cent.; they were to be delivered that evening, after Change hours; he fixed five o'clock for me to deliver them, and for him to pay for them. I looked out eighteen pieces-the amount of them was 472l.; after deducting the discount it was 425l. I went with Pearl, a ticket-porter, who carried them. I only took eighteen pieces, because I thought the order was large, and I wished to be cautious. I made the invoice accordingly. I took a blank receipt stamp with me. I got to the house at six o'clock, and found the prisoner at home - I was shewn into the counting-house to him; the porter staid in the passage with the goods. The prisoner ordered him to put them down, began looking at them, piled them up upon the floor, and told the porter to go, and said he would give me something for him (this is not customary), the porter did not ask him for any thing. The porter went out. I asked for the money-the prisoner got out his cash-box. The porter staid in the passage; I had desired him not to go away, the prisoner heard me tell him so. The prisoner asked me if I could give him the difference of a check for 700l., he put his key into the box, I do not think he opened it; he neither shewed me the check, nor said what house it was upon. I told him I could not, and asked him if he would favour me with the check; he said it would be of no service to me, as the banking-hours were over; I could not put it to any use, but I might have the money in the morning, as soon as the banking-house was open. I pressed him several times to give me the money, he said he could not pay me, he had only that draft in his box, and was unable to pay me-several words passed about it; I was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020044"/>duced to take his word and leave the goods, believing at that time that he would pay me in the morning-it was expressly understood that I was to go for the money at nine o'clock the next morning (he told me to call at nine o'clock for it). I left the house about seven o'clock in the evening. I went back again that evening, not being satisfied in my own mind, in about five minutes, and the servant told me he was not at home-(I had not left the house above minutes, and was in sight of it all the time) - He might have gone out; I did not see him again that night. I went at nine o'clock the next morning, and was told he was gone to Limehouse. He called on me at eleven o'clock, and asked if I had been to his house? I told him I had. He asked me what I had been for? I told him for the money. He said he had come to order the remaining six pieces (which I had left out of the order), to make up the twenty-four, and ordered six more also - He left me to look them out, and told me to bring them at the usual hour, and a receipt with me, for the goods which I had delivered the day before, and those which were now ordered. I asked him for the money for the eighteen pieces I had delivered, as he was out that morning when I called. He said he had been to the captain who had bought them, and was now going to a coffee-house to meet him for the money, and he would pay me for the goods at five o'clock. I told him I would not let him have the goods without the money for the former - He said he would pay me for the whole, and he did not desire me to leave the goods without receiving the whole amount-the amount of the six pieces was 228l.8s.2d.; after deducting the discount it was 200l., making, in the whole, 625l. At five o'clock, Deighton, our porter, went with me with the goods. I told him we should not leave the house without the money or goods. We got there exactly at five o'clock - A female servant opened the door, and said Mr. Cohen was not at home. I took the goods to a neighbouring public-house, staid there till near six o'clock, and then went to the house again, and found he was at home; I fetched the porter and goods, and was shewn into the counting-house. The porter came to the counting-house door-the prisoner ordered him to put the goods down, as he wanted to look at the parasol silks; he said a piece which had been delivered the day before did not please him. He examined one or two pieces, and asked me to take back the piece which had been delivered, as the captain did not like the colour - I told him I would; he did not return it. After examing the goods he piled them up in the same place as he did the former eighteen (they were gone), and asked me if I had brought a receipt for the goods? I told him I had a stamp, but had not written it out, as I did not know whether he would have it made out with the discount put into the receipt, or not. He told me he would have it made out with the discount taken off. I was writing it - He got the cash-box out, apparently to pay me, and told the porter to go away, and he would give me something for him - I ordered him to wait; I supposed the prisoner could hear me, I did not speak low. He then asked me to write out another invoice with the discount taken off - I had written the receipt for 625l., according to his direction, but did not give it to him. The piece he talked of returning had already been paid for, it was one of the two first parcels. He took me out of the counting-house into the parlour, which was next to it, to make out the invoice, and gave me pen, ink, and paper. I left the counting-house-door open. I do not know why I was to write it in the parlour; he took the pen and ink from the counting-house for me-the paper was in the desk in the parlour. The counting-house door was left open, I could see into it; there was plenty of paper in the counting-house-he gave no reason for taking me into the parlour. I wrote it out, and gave it to him; he said it would do, but he must trouble me to wait a moment, for his clerk had not come in from his banker's. In about two minutes a young man came in, I did not see him; I heard neither knock at the door or ring at the bell. The prisoner left me alone, as if to go into the counting-house for something; immediately as he got into the counting-house, he began talking to some person whom I did not see, calling him a blockhead, and appeared in a great rage; he then came into me again, and said "what stupid fellows I have got to deal with!" and that he had made it too late for the banker's. He said he had sent him to the banker's first, and then to Lloyd's afterwards, but that the boy had gone to Lloyd's first, and then made it too late for the banker's. He said he must trouble me to go to a neighbour's house to borrow the money - He said they were in the habit of lending each other money when they were too late to get to the banker's. I went with him. He had a piece of paper in his hand, folded up about the size of a check before we went out, it was then about half-past six o'clock. He took me to a house about a quarter of a mile from his house, the name of Davies was on the door, in the Commercial-road. He asked me to wait outside the door, which I did. He came out in two or three minutes, and said his friend, unfortunately, could only lend him 48l., and putting it into my hand, he asked me to count it, and said he would go into the city and borrow the remainder. I told him that was of no use at all to me, and I would not go without either the money or the goods. He said, he supposed three or four hundred pounds would do for me till the morning - I told him it would not. To urge it, I said I had a bill to pay-he wanted to know the amount of it; I told him it was more than his sum. He took me across the way to count the money. I went up a court, as the wind blew and it rained, and counted it by his desire. He pulled out his pencil, and desired me to write on the invoice, just to say, "cash 48l." I told him it was of no use to receive that trifle. He told me to take it, and he would borrow the rest in the city. I asked him to let me go with him - He said, No; he would not trouble me, as it was very wet, and he had to go to three or four places for the money, and if I would go to my warehouse he would be there in half an hour with the money; with that he ran off, and appeared in great haste - He seemed going while he was speaking. Finding myself left in this way, I went to Shadwell Office, and stated what had happened; from there I went to the prisoner's house, and got there about seven o'clock. The servant opened the door, and said Mr. Cohen was not at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you left the house with the prisoner, did you leave the porter behind you - A. No; he was gone; I did not tell him to go. I went into the passage, and said I would wait till he came in. I saw a man named Vandermulin in the parlour, whom I knew before-he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020045"/>asked me to walk in, which I did. Vandermeulin staid with me sometime, and then left. I tried the counting-house door and found it fast, the key-hole was darkened; I took my seat in the parlour. After sometime, the servant came up and sat with me, she did not speak to me. After she had been there sometime, Mrs. Cohen came in; I heard no noise before this - She spoke to me; it got towards dusk. I heard a rumbling noise like silk goods being removed; when I heard this, Mrs. Cohen got up and set a musical clock playing (the rest had left), which prevented my hearing the noise; it completely drowned it. When it ceased I heard the noise again-it was rainy, and very windy. I heard a noise like a back-door swinging backward and forward; Mrs. Cohen was coming in and out of the room. After this I heard a repeated bustle and moving, so that I thought they were removing my goods-it appeared to come from the counting-house and the yard; the clock played once or twice; the servant set it playing once, it played as long as it could go. I waited there till eleven o'clock, and then the prisoner made his appearance; he came in stamping his feet, as if he had been travelling a great deal, to beat the dirt and wet off his boots-Mrs. Cohen and servant were in the room at the time. I had heard a knock at the door; some person in the passage told him I was there. He came in and said, he was very sorry he had kept me waiting, and wanted to know what was my pleasure? I told him I wanted the money or goods; Deighton was setting by me at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. You said Deighton was gone away - A. Yes, but he came back to me at eight o'clock, and staid till the prisoner returned. Deighton got up, and told him that I must not leave the house without either the goods or money. The prisoner asked who he was? he said he was Mr. Foot's servant. The prisoner opened the door, and told him to walk out, or else he would put him in the watch-house, for he had no business there. Deighton said he would go, he did not want putting out. The prisoner said I hurt his feelings very much by such an untrades-man-like mode of dealing. He then said he had a check in his pocket for 1,700l., he did not produce it. I asked him to give it to me; he said No; he was not going to give me a 1,700 check for 600l. He complained very much, and said I might have the money as soon as I liked after nine o'clock in the morning. I told him I could not leave, and if he did not give me the money I must have the goods back-he said that was impossible, for the goods were sold and gone. He opened the counting-house door to shew me that they were gone, and said, "You see there are no goods." It was shut before this - I do not know how he opened it. I told him, if he would trust me with the check, I would give him respectable references that he might trust me with the balance. He said, "No; you would not trust me, and I will not trust you" - I am sure those were his words. He said he never had such behaviour from any person, and that his house was his castle, and that he would maintain it against any person. He appeared very angry; a great deal passed. I could neither get check, money, nor goods. I never saw the check. I stopped there till after eleven o'clock, and then told him that I was robbed of the goods, and he told me to use no insolence, and said I might have the money as soon as I liked in the morning, and he would pay it on no other consideration than mine; for if he had bought the goods of Mr. Foot instead of me, he would have kept him out of it as long as the law would allow; I told him I was a servant, and as such stood in Mr. Foot's behalf, and could not leave the house without the money or goods, and stuck to it to the last - He got into a passion; I thought I could do no good, and left the house at eleven o'clock, finding the goods were gone; it was a very wet night, when he came in he had no great-coat on, and when he went out he had none; and though he kept stamping his boots about, they were muddy, but the mud was quite dry; I took particular notice of it. I went home, taking the 48l. with me. The next day (which was Saturday, I went to his house again, with Mr. Jones and Deighton, we got there at nine o'clock, but did not find him at home-Mr. Jones and I went again in the evening, and found him at home, he asked who he was; I told him he was a friend of Mr. Foot's. He begged Mr. Jones to withdraw before he would speak a word-Mr. Jones left. I asked him for the money, when he said, if I would come in a peaceable manner on the Monday morning, and had no magistrate, or warrant, with me, he would pay me 100l.; but if I had any thing to do about magistrating, he knew the law as well as most men, and he would go to the extent of it; he said, if I came peaceably on the Monday, he would give me 100l., and ample security, in goods, for the remainder; he did not pretend that he was provided with money for the whole; but, he said, he would only treat with me, and not with a second person. I left the house, and could get nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any of these meetings tell you what became of the goods - A. On the Friday night he said they were at Limehouse; this was at eleven o'clock, after he returned. The goods have been since returned. The examination before the magistrate was on the following Tuesday; I left the office about three o'clock, the magistrate had adjourned the examination till the evening, and had refused to take bail; about six or half-past six o'clock, after the adjournment of the examination, somebody brought the goods to our warehouse; one of the men that came was a man that I had seen at his house, acting as a clerk; every piece was returned to me in the same state in which it went out of the house. I attended the examination in the evening; the 48l. was delivered to Mr. Isaacs - I had never passed the money from my own hands to my master's account.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you ever consented to receive it as any part of the payment - A. No; I told him at the time that nothing but the whole would satisfy me, and refused to receive it, it was forced upon me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not give the money to your master - A. No; I kept it separate; I wrapped it up in paper, and gave it to Mrs. Foot to keep separate.</p>
               <p>Q. We have given you notice to produce your books - A. I have the day-book they are entered there, the prisoner's name is not in our ledger; he dealt for ready-money; I marked the discount on the bills at the time I was paid.</p>
               <p>

            Was it not a matter of doubt whether he would pay you that night or at a future time - A. The last words before he left the warehouse were, that I was not to leave them without the money. I did not count them. I left the goods there because I could not help it. I was alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner told the porter to go away, why did you not tell him to stay - A. I did; he might not have heard me; I should not have let him go if I had not thought that the prisoner was going to pay me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the goods returned on the Friday - A. No; on the Tuesday; the prisoner was admitted to bail, and has now surrendered; the goods were returned between the first and second examination.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH DEIGHTON. I am Mr. Foot's porter, and carried the goods by Mr. Goulding's directions. On the 17th of June, I took twelve pieces of silk, the prisoner was not at home; we waited at a public-house, and in about an hour went again; the prisoner was then at home, and told me to put them down, which I did - He examined them; I heard him say Mr. Goulding should have the money before he left the house. The prisoner said I need not stay any longer, and he would give Mr. Goulding something for me. I went out, and waited at the door sometime; I returned again at eight o'clock, and found Mr. Goulding sitting in the parlour, the servant was there, and the clock playing-Mrs. Cohen came in also and played it. At ten o'clock, when the prisoner was talking to Mr. Goulding about distrusting him, I answered him; he asked who I was, and what business it was of mine, and opened the door, saying, if I did not walk out he would charge the watchman with me. I left, leaving Mr. Goulding there.</p>

            . On the 21st of May, I was a watchman in the Polygon, Mr. Essex's house was in my beat; in consequence of the lead being stolen I was suspended. Wishing to discover the thieves, I watched the next night, with Butler and Jefferson, in Clarendon-street, and between nine and ten o'clock at night, I saw three men in Mr. Johnston's field, which is about 150 yards from the place, they were running backwards and forwards about a hole of muddy water; I went over into another field, and got within forty yards of them - They made off, I suppose they saw me; I followed the prisoner, who was one of them, and never lost sight of him - I secured him; he struck me. I took him to the watch-house, returned to the ditch, and there found three pieces of lead; there was more found.</p>

On the 13th of June, I had occasion to go to the Theatre; every thing was in its usual state; I went again on the next day, which was Saturday, and close to the stage-door in Suffolk-street, I observed a doll which was used in the Theatre, and was kept in the ladies' wardrobe; it was not there on the 13th; and in the passage from Suffolk-street door to the stage, there was a quantity of black baize, and going towards the stage, I found a curtain was let down, and some scenes thrown across the stage; I found the things in a different state to what they were on the day before; there had been no performance-the pier-glass had been taken down in the green-room, and part of it taking away-there was writing on the wall-the door appeared to have been burst open-the whole seemed in the utmost confusion-the furniture of the King's box was taken out of the press, and put on a dresser, and appeared to have been packed up to be taken away; it was worth 50l. or 60l., the fringe was all of real silver - We found an iron crow-bar behind the dresser in the wardrobe - I compared it with the marks on the door-it fitted exactly. There was a box of beads opened, but none taken away - A candle had been left burning on the dresser-it was then out - I left every thing in the same state as I found it, and set persons to watch, in consequence of what I heard. On the Monday following, on the 16th, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I went again and saw the doll, which had been in the passage, was removed, I went to the ladies' wardrobe, it was shut and fastened inside; the watchman and patrols who were with me forced it open, and we found the four prisoners there; they were taken into custody, and searched at the watch-house. On Holmes we found some beads, which appeared to be what I had seen in the box on the 14th. On Davis was found a large skeleton key, and I believe twenty-five smaller keys, and on Holmes we found a dark lantborn, and on one of them was found a phosphorus box; I then returned to the Theatre and found a helmet in the pit, and part of the furniture of the King's box was on the ground; the fifty yards of drugget was in the ladies' wardrobe, which was on the stairs on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. There are only three proprietors of the Theatre, only we three are included in the licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Mr. Colman's interest in the house ceased - A. I understand he has mortgaged his interest.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Does Mr. Colman act as one of the joint owners - A. He does, he exercises his vote as a proprietor, and those votes are carried into effect; he acts as a proprietor in every description of the word-no other person attends the meetings, or acts in the arrangements.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Every thing appeared in the same state when I went on the Monday, except the furniture of the King's box; part of which was on the floor; the black baize was not in the wardrobe on the Saturday.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 1st of July, about half-past nine o'clock, I was going there to sleep, I met a man whom I suspected, when I got to the gate, I found the first floor-window open, I was alarmed, and stopped about seven or eight minutes. I saw a bundle thrown out of the window, I made an alarm when the patrol and several people came round. I do not know what became of the person. I did not see any body in the house.</p>
               <p>MATILDA PARKER. I am thirteen years old. I was going with my mother, and saw a man standing about, my mother said she did not like his looks. When we got to the gate, we found the window open, and the bundle thrown out.</p>
               <p>ELIAS TINKIN. I am a butcher. On the 1st of July, in the evening, I was walking along London-terrace, and saw the prisoner in company with two other men, standing opposite the garden-gate of No. 5, I looked very hard at the prisoner. I am certain that he is the man; I have known him these three years; I suspected him by his waiting about; I walked home, and had not been at home more than ten minutes, when I heard the cry of "Stop Thief!" I immediately ran out and pursued the prisoner, and overtook him at the corner of Coal Arbour-street, and with the assistance of Bailey, took him back to No. 3, London-terrace, and then to the watch-house. No. 3 had been robbed. The prisoner was running; it was a little after nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I running when you took me. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BATEMAN. I am a patrol; my box is opposite the house. About half-past nine o'clock Bailey came to me, and said he was fearful some person was robbing No. 3, and that he saw a man get into the house, by getting on the balcony, and through the window; I took my bayonet to go over and watch, when the woman called out that there was a bundle thrown out of the window; she unlocked the door, and I went in. The man got away, and in a few minutes Bailey brought the prisoner to me.</p>

            . I am thirteen years of age. My father is a print-cutter. As I was coming down Hackney-road last Tuesday was a week, I saw the prisoner, and two other men, stand at the corner of Caroline-street. I went home, and in about half an hour I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran out, and saw the people running at the corner of the next street, which is Coal Arbour-street; presently after I saw Bailey go up and lay hold of the prisoner. and Mr. Tinkin went up to help him I knew the prisoner, was one of the men I had seen at the corner of Caroline-street; it was about nine o'clock when I saw him there.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BAILEY. I had been out to take a walk on that evening, and on my return at half-past nine o'clock, I saw three men lurking about the front of my house, which is No. 6, on London-terrace; I took no notice, went in, and went up stairs to watch them, suspecting they wanted to injure the railing; I had not been there more than three minutes before I saw one of them get over Mr. Browell's gate, and stand at the front door two or three minutes - He then got over the rails into the area; he remained there about two minutes, came up again, and got upon the wall which separates the front courts, and got into the balcony in front of the drawing-room windows, he pushed the window open and got in. I went down stairs to see after and inform the watchman of it, but instead of which I walked about two doors farther, and saw a woman waiting at the gate, with a lanthorn in her hand, I took no notice of her, but told the watchman what I had seen, and desired him not to leave the spot. I heard the woman call "watch!" and the watchman left me; I turned round and saw the prisoner get over the front rails. I pursued and took him.</p>

On the 12th of June, about twenty minutes after two o'clock in the morning, I and Forbes saw the prisoner coming down Cow-cross, with a bag of halfpence on his shoulder - I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there? he said they were halfpence, that his name was Matthew Beadle, and that he was going from Mr. Turner's, of Spitalfields-market, to carry some halfpence to Covent-garden to give change. I told him that was the wrong way to Covent-garden - He said the cart was gone on with a load of potatoes, and there was not room in the cart for the bag. He said he was going to a coffee-house in Clerkenwell first to get some coffee. I told him he must go to the watch-house. He said Mr. Turner was a potatoe-dealer, and mentioned several potatoe-dealers in Cowcross. I went to the market, but could not find Mr. Turner's stall. I had a full opportunity of seeing the prisoner. I came back to the watch-house, found him gone, and the halfpence left behind him. On the 16th, I saw him at the watch-house again-Forbes had taken him. I have no doubt of his person.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer, and work for my father, in Paul-street. I remember the Monday that the prisoner was taken up, and the Wednesday before that, I lodged with the prisoner's father, in Clifton-street, Northgreen, Holywell-row, Curtain-road; he deals in asses-milk - I slept with the prisoner in the same bed. On the Wednesday night we went to bed together about eleven o'clock; the door was fastened inside. I got up between six and seven o'clock in the morning, he was still in bed. I awoke once in the night and found him in bed - I have no reason to think he was out of bed all night. In the morning, about six o'clock, a young man came into the room, he lodged up stairs, he is a japanner; he said he was going to work; the prisoner's father locks the door, and keeps the key. I remember his fastening the house that night, in the usual manner, atten o'clock, or a little before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What makes you remember that night - A. Because we all went to bed together; he did not go to bed generally till after me, we slept in the kitchen. The prisoner's brother slept in the same bed with us. I lodged with the prisoner since Whit-Monday; that was the first time I ever lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before this matter happened - A. I think about two, months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you lodged there more than one month before that happened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            Whit-Monday was the 26th of May, and this happened on the 12th of June - A. I think I had lodged there two months, but am quite sure it was one. His father and mother, two sisters, and three brothers, supped there. My father lives in Paul-street, he is a cabinet-maker, and pays 60l. a year for his house.</p>

            Instead of being at your father's house, you sleep three in a bed at another's - A. Yes; I have not paid any thing for my lodging yet.</p>

            Eighteen-pence per week. I do not know what I am to pay.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know that Wednesday was the day the prisoner was charged with the robbery - A. I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020052"/>sitting at my father's door on the Thursday morning, which was the next day after the robbery was committed. The prisoner's father came to me, and told me that he was taken up on suspicion. This was the next day after I had slept with him on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not taken up until the 16th. What reason have you to know that you slept with him on the Wednesday night - A. We all supped together that night. I removed somewhere else about a fortnight ago, but sleep there again now. I do not usually sup there, but was invited on that night, we sat down to supper, about nine o'clock - We had about a dozen boiled mackarel for supper; the prisoner's sister, who is married, was there, his grandmother, and the prisoner's brother's wife (twelve of us altogether). The prisoner's grand-mother and the married sister went home - I am certain the prisoner slept in the house.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. Snaith lodged at my father's house about Whitsuntide. I slept in the same bed with my brother and Snaith. I remember the Wednesday night before my brother was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you remember it by - A. There was a young man named Boston, that lodged in the house, came down when we were in bed, and talked to us. My three brothers, two sisters, and father and mother were at home. I have a married sister, and grandmother - They were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Snaith sup with you that night - A. I do not remember. My grandmother did not sup there that night. If there had been a dozen mackarel for supper I should have remembered it. I do not remember that any person came into the room before I got up.</p>

On the 31st of May, I was serving in my shop; I went into the parlour to get change, and found the prisoner's hand in my drawers, taking out the money. I asked her what she was doing? she said, "Nothing." She was a friend who called to see me. I found some 3s. pieces in her hand; my drawers were locked. I saw her put the money down her bosom. I am sure I missed seven 3s. pieces - They dropped from her bosom.</p>

               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner in charge. The prisoner said the keys belonged to her drawers at home. I tried the keys; they unlocked both her drawers and the prosecutor's.</p>

I asked her for a deposit - She said she had no money with her. The next day she left 10s. 6d. as a deposit. She came and tried it on, and desired it might be sent home any time on Saturday evening, and some lace with it for children's caps, as she wanted to consult her husband about them. On Saturday night, about six o'clock, I sent Mary Walker, and my boy, home with it, and the lace. She came back, saying, we were to take it again in an hour or less.

I said, if she would allow me, I would try it on as I should see if it wanted any alteration; she said she could try it on up stairs and come down in it, and would not detain me a minute. I had six cards of lace with me, she said she would take them up and shew them to her husband. I took them out of her hand and said, I would shew them there, as we never suffered our laces to go out of our sight. She picked out four pieces, saying she would take them to her husband, as he was engaged up stairs with a gentleman. I said I could not allow that - She immediately went up with them; Fitzgerald said she would not keep me many minutes; I said that I was in a hurry. She opened the door, and went out into the street, saying she was going to fetch her child. I saw no more of them, but am certain they are the women.</p>

I heard the cry of "stop thief! she has got my watch," I saw the prisoner run out of George-yard, across Golden-lane, into Cupid's-court, which has no thoroughfare, I followed and secured her - I charged her with stealing a watch, she said she had no watch - I found it in her hand - She wished to go back and give it to the man - I would not let her.

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of June, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was called by the servant of No. 36, Sloane-square, who said she was sure some persons were in the next house. I went into the area and found the door open; I then went up to the top floor, and heard some persons making their way out on to the roof. I found the lead in the garret. I went on to the roof, over three houses, and found the three prisoners concealed in a gutter, behind some chimneys - I tied them together, and brought them down; I met Maybank in the house coming to assist me. I found two knives and a screw-driver, with the lead. I saw the lead fitted afterwards.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MAYBANK. I went up and found the prisoners on the roof with Reynolds, we took them to the watch-house, and fitied the lead to the house-top-it exactly fitted.</p>

On the 25th of June, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at a house opposite to my own, and saw the prisoner, Bowyer, attempt to release a piece of print that was pinned to the iron, he could not get it off-he went a door or two farther to the other two prisoners, returned again and examined it, and went to them again, three times, and then came and released it from the pins; he then came with Wheeler, Bowyer took the print off, and put it into Wheeler's apron-Wilson waited at the corner (two doors off); I and Morgan came out and secured Wheeler, with the print in his apron. I secured Bowyer. Wilson attempted to run past us, and in endeavouring to take him Bowyer got away from me - I secured Wilson. Bowyer was taken again.</p>

            . I hired a coach of Mr. Paynter, on the 24th of June I left it quite safe within two yards of my door, in Bleeding Hart-yard, Charles-street, Hatton-garden, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; and about three o'clock in the morning the watchman called me, saying the glass was stolen, and he had one of the men. I got up, and he brought Norton to the watchhouse soon after. Hopkins was sometimes employed by me.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Bleeding Hart-yard, at a quarter after three o'clock in the morning, I saw the coach body moving, and the prisoner, Norton, handing the glass out to Hopkins; they saw me, and ran down Union-court - I sprung my rattle, and went down George-alley, they were there, and threw the glass down - I heard it break; I saw them turn into Field-lane, but then lost sight of them; I still pursued, another watchman pointed up Brewer's-yard - I found Hopkins there. I am certain he is the man. I secured him.</p>
               <p>RICHARD AYRES. I am a watchman. I was on Saffron-hill, heard the rattle sprung, and saw the prisoners running. Hopkins was taken in the yard, up two pair of stairs. I stopped Norton.</p>

Gregory and Leach were with me-Searles altered his mind and would not go - We went as far as Mile-end Turnpike. As we were returning down Brick-lane, five or six men crossed over from the other side - I am certain that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020059"/>the prisoner is one of them.

            gory; Linch and Searles were together. A young man stooped under my arm, and shoved me against them. In half a minute Searles said his watch was gone. The prisoner said, "Oh no, it is not." A man ran across the road with it, at the same time Gregory crossed the road after him-the prisoner held her, and would not let her go; the man ran down the street with the watch. The prisoner then let us go, and when we got to the street he drove us back-they all held us. The prisoner said the man had run another way. Gregory fainted. I called out stop thief! The prisoner was taken while he was attempting to stop her mouth, to hinder her calling out - She came to, and laid hold of him. When he got to the watch-house, I said his name was Greenwood; he said it was Greenlaw - He afterwards said it was Greenwood.</p>

            . I was with them. Five or six men came up together and hustled us; I am sure the prisoner was one of them. Searles's watch was taken. I saw the man run across the road-the prisoner ran after me, and held me tight round the neck to prevent my following him - I fainted. When I came to, Linch had hold of the prisoner, who was standing by me. I am certain he is the man. I am a weaver.</p>

            . I live in Long-alley, near the Tenter-ground. We were returning home-when we got to Brick-lane, five or six men ran up to us; one of them caught hold of Sinfield, and shoved against us. I laid hold of Searles's arm - They surrounded us-the prisoner held us close together. Searles said his watch was gone. My sister (Gregory) cried out, stop thief! they would not let us go after the man who took it. Gregory had nearly caught him, when the prisoner caught her by the neck-she fainted away. The prisoner said he was gone another way; the watchman came up, I seized the prisoner as one of them, and gave him in charge. I am sure he is the man who hustled us.</p>
               <p>RICHARD CLARK. I am a watchman. I heard the noise, went up, and found Gregory fainting. Linch said the prisoner had robbed the young man of his watch - I took him to the watch-house. He struck me in the face, and made my nose bleed.</p>

Hall had a great deal of meat in a basket-he asked me to buy the bacon; I knew him before. I bought the bacon and butter of him for 1s. 8d. - he put them in my handkerchief, and the watchman came up. All three ran away, leaving it with me. The other prisoners had some mutton or lamb in their aprons. I ran after them, with the watchman, and secured them.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 1st of June, about five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man near Burrows's; each of them had a bag - I watched them. They were driving poultry, and going into people's yards-they saw me. I went home, altered my dress, and went out again. I found the prisoner near Burrows's door, giving the poultry corn - I concealed myself, and saw both of them together again. I got assistance, and secured the prisoner, and found the poultry in a bag on his shoulder. He said, if I did not let him go, he would butcher me. He knocked me down - I kept fast hold of him, and found four ducks and one goose in the bag, dead, but quite warm.</p>

On the 30th of June, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my back room; the three prisoners came into my shop and asked if I sold nails - I looked very hard at them; Jackson was leaning over the counter, and drew himself back; I came in the front of Jackson - They all began laughing; I asked him where the knife was which laid on the counter? he said he had not got it. I said, before I served them with the nails, I would find the knife; I thought I had better serve them. I looked for the scales; Jackson drove towards the counter again; he suddenly stretched his arm over the counter, laid hold of my chain, and snatched my watch out. Walker ran out first, Jackson next, and Collinson remained behind, and then went out; I came round into the street and raised the cry of Stop thief! and ran up the street; about seven doors further on, Collinson ran against me, knocked me into the road, and threw me down, he gave me a violent push, which bruised my shoulder and side. I am certain the prisoners are the men.</p>
