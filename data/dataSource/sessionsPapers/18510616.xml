On 14th May, in consequence of information, I went to a loft belonging to Mr. Giddens, in the parish of South Mimms, and under a quantity of loose straw I found a bundle of rowen hay—I put some pieces of paper in it—I went back again the same evening expecting it would be removed, but it was not—I went again the following morning, and again on Friday evening, the 16th, about 10 o'clock, it was still there, and the paper that I had placed in it—I then went and examined a load of hay which stood in a cart in the yard, and under the cloth of it I found a bundle of rowen hay which I marked by tying two pieces of string round each band—I then put the cloth down as I found it, and went away for about an hour—I put on private clothes, returned to the premises and watched—about 1 in the morning, Taylor and Stokes came to the stable—I was concealed in a wheeler's workshop, about a dozen yards from the stable—it was a dull cloudy morning, but I saw Taylor and Stokes pass me, they were not three yards from me—I have known them three years—I have not the least doubt it was them—they went into the stable, and fed the horses—Taylor then went from the stable to the loft over the stable—Stokes called out, "Do you want me up there?"—I did not hear Taylor's reply, but Stokes went up; and in about a minute the hay was thrown through a hole in the loft floor into the stable</p>

               <p>—they then came down, and remained quiet in the stable for an hour or an hour and a half—Stokes then came out, and went up a ladder into the same loft, and threw down a sack containing chaff—he then returned into the stable, and remained there till about 4 in the morning, when they brought out the shaft horse, and put it into the cart—Stokes then returned into the stable, and during that time Taylor unfastened the cloth which covered the hay—he got on the hay, and Stokes brought out the bundle of hay which I had pre<lb/>viously marked; the same which fell from the loft—he took it to Taylor who was on the cart, who placed it on the hay—Stokes returned to the stable for the other horse, and during that time Taylor got off the hay and pulled the cloth down—the other horse was then hooked-to, and they both left the premises with the cart—I remained on the premises for a few minutes, as from where I stood I could not see whether both the men had left—I then went out—I could not see them nor the cart—I followed the cart, and after walking half a mile I got in sight of it—I only saw Stokes then, he was driving—I fol<lb/>lowed with an officer to the Swan with two Necks at Finchley—I had lost sight of Taylor from the time they turned out of the yard—when Stokes arrived within about four yards of the stable-door he struck the cloth that was over the hay several times with his whip, and in about a minute or so he walked round and undid the cloth, and Taylor who was under the cloth rose up and stood on the load of hay and looked round—I was within about forty yards of the house—Taylor then put the small bundle of hay which had been under the straw on Stokes's back, and Stokes carried it into the stable—Reynolds was in the doorway of the stable—he stepped back, to allow Stokes to past with the hay—Stokes put that hay down in the stable, and returned to the cart—Taylor put the other bundle of hay on his back, the one that I had marked with the strings—Stokes carried that into the stable—he then returned to the cart, and fed the horses with some chaff during that time Taylor got off the load of hay and fastened down the cloth—I passed by the stable where the hay was, and Reynolds, the ostler, had removed near to the first bundle of hay—I then returned, and met the constable whom I had placed to watch—I went to the stable, and found the door fastened—I looked through the hole, and saw a nail placed over the latch which fastened it down—I saw Reynolds standing by the large bundle of hay in the stable—I went into the tap-room, and saw Stokes and Taylor sitting down getting tome re<lb/>freshment—I passed out of the passage to a back-door, and as I opened the door I saw Reynolds with the large bundle of hay, in the act of placing it on two trusses of hay near the door, at the foot of a ladder leading to a loft—I told him I wanted him, for receiving hay knowing it to be stolen—I took him in the tap-room, and delivered him and the other two prisoners to the officer—I returned to the yard, and took the bundle of hay that I had seen with Reynolds; I gave that to the officer—I then went in the stable, and found the small bundle of hay; it weighed 33 lbs., and the larger one about 67 lbs.; I found on them the marks that I know them by—I told Taylor and Stokes that I took them for stealing hay.</p>

About 24th April, I missed this chimney-pot mould—the prisoner was about to leave me at the time—I might have seen it safe about a fortnight before—he had been using it to cast chimney-pots—I had two of these moulds—they were kept in the shop where the prisoner worked—I have examined this mould—I am positive it is mine—I did not speak to the prisoner about it when I missed it—I left in<lb/>structions</p>

Dikes and Wingall's nearly three weeks afterwards—in consequence of what Mr. Dike said, I went to the police, and had the pri<lb/>soner apprehended—I had two moulds—the prisoner provided one—he came to me for the express purpose of making some large pots, but one mould not being sufficient to keep him employed I desired him to make another.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you mean that it looks like your brother's writing, or do you mean to pledge your oath it is his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the knowledge I have of his writing, I should say it is his—our partnership was dissolved in 1846 by a deed; he came down again in 1849, and stayed about a year and a half—he came to assist in the business—he did not keep the books altoge<lb/>ther, I kept them principally—he was not allowed to give orders; he used to take orders—he did not give orders in my name except I gave him leave—I may have given him leave to give orders, but not to any extent—he was not in the habit of drawing bills, I swear that; not to my knowledge—I would not pledge my oath to it unless I was certain—my business is wholesale and retail—while my brother was with me, he received nothing specific for his services, not as a salary—I appeared as a witness to handwriting against him on two former trials—I came on subpoena then—after those prosecutions had failed, this bill was preferred—I have a partner; his name is Danger: he was sub<lb/>poenaed, but is not here—I was asked on the last occasion whether I had a partner.</p>

               <p>under the right-eye, about three-quarters of an inch long—I probed it—it was bleeding profusely—I stopped it, and sent him to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—this mallet would produce such a wound if thrown in the way described—on 18th April I was sent for about, 8 o'clock, and found him in bed, with typhoid symptoms, and suffering from extreme exhaustion—an abscess was forming in his neck—the wound was looking tolerably healthy; it bad not closed; the bone being denuded, it was nearly closed—I saw marks of leeches over the spot where the abscess afterwards formed—leeches would be employed to get rid of inflammatory action—I ordered him medicines—erysipelas came on three or four days afterwards, which formed an abscess on the arm—he went on from bad to worse, became delirious at night, diarrhoea set in, and he died on 7th May—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the brain and membranes were perfectly healthy, and so were the viscera of the chest and the heart—there was congestion of both lungs—the lifer was considerably enlarged—I do not think he had any disease which would have killed him—I attribute the enlargement of his liver to drinking; I do not think, that had anything to do with his death—the bowels were healthy—I examined the wound, and found the bone bare—in my judgment, the cause of death was the diarrhoea, which was produced by the typhoid fever, which was produced by the low state he got into through the loss of blood.</p>

               <p>serum on the brain—the symptoms in the stomach, liver, and kidneys, were indicative of habitual intoxication—that habit might account for the appear<lb/>ance of the serum which was the cause of her death, and it would account for the congestion of the brain—taking all the circumstances together, I think it probable that the blow on her forehead accelerated her death—such appearances of the brain might have followed an injury of this kind in a person given to those habits, and also in a person not given to those habits—it is impossible for me to say from what cause death took place, whether from the injury or the intoxication—if I had not heard of the injury, and had found her stomach, kidneys, and liver in the state I did, I should conclude that her habits were habitually intemperate, and that would account for the appearances I found on the brain—I could not say that the blow, if she received one, hastened her death—she may have died sooner from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to Mr. Blake. I was on his premises at Enfield on Saturday evening, 17th May—there is a stage in the brewery, and a hopper, where the malt is when it comes from the mill previous to its going into the mash-tub—I saw the hopper that night, between 8 and 9 o'clock—there was then about eight quarters of malt in it, and the surface of it was level—it was to be used in business on the Monday morning—on Sunday morning, between 11 and 12, I went with Collins to examine it, and about a bushel was gone, and the surface of the malt had a hole in it—it was not in the even state that it bad been before—the prisoner was in Mr. Blake's employ, as under-stage man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a joiner, and am employed at the Eastern Counties Railway. On 8th June, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I was coining over London-bridge—Johnson accosted me—I walked with her about ten minutes—by Hart-street, near Mark-lane, I stood in conversation with her, and felt her hand in my waistcoat pocket—I was quite sober—I instantly seized her hand, and found my watch in it—there was a silver guard-chain to it, which was broken—the chain was left round my neck—here is part of the handle of the watch, which was left in my pocket—while I was taking the watch from Johnson's hand, Burton came up behind me, and seized me by the throat—Johnson passed something to him—I bad not time to see what it was—Burton said to her, "<hi rend="italic">Cut</hi> on"—she ran away—Burton threw me down on my back—he had hold of my need, and I had not much power—I just caught the kerb-stone—foe started off—I jumped up, and pursued him—I called, "Stop thief!" and he was stopped by the officer—this is my watch—he ran fast, about 700 or 800 yards, and then doubled, and turned back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company. I work at the warehouse of the Company, in Jewry-street, Aldgate—it was part of my duty to hand trays of samples to brokers or their clerks who came to look at samples of indigo—there was a show of indigo there on Monday, 5th May, prior to the public sales—they generally came on after the show—I was employed on that day handing trays of samples to the different brokers who came to look at them—I knew the prisoner, as attending the shows for inspecting the indigo—I was placed there that day by the foreman, to watch him—he came about 9 o'clock that morning—three of us go round to one gentleman—I was selected by the foreman, to stand at the table, which is about two feet and a half wide, as near as I can guess—we generally work ten trays; four of them are at the table, three the men had got who draw the indigo from the chest, and three the men who bring them up to the table—one draws out of the chest, one takes them up to the table, and a man stands at the table, and hands them to the gentleman—about four trays are on the table at the same time, sometimes more—the end of the table comes against the window—there is a screen at the side of it, and there is a table to hold the trays, which are full, and hare not been seen, and the returns are placed on the same table—the party who comes to look at the samples of indigo sits at the table—I have a tray, which I hand to him—as soon as he has seen one tray, I pass that to the end of the table, and pass the other up which he has not seen; I pass that back, and hand him up another, which is one of the four or the six behind; some<lb/>times</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160034"/>
               <p>there are four, sometimes six—that is not the table where the broker sits, but another table by the side, on which the trays stand, a side table—I take a tray from it, and hand it <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the broker for inspection—there are some<lb/>times two, sometimes three trays at a time at the table where the broker sits; only one man hands trays to that table—when Mr. Curtis came on this day to examine the samples, he had a box and a paper parcel; they con<lb/>tained what are called guides—the custom is for the broker to compare the samples shown him from the chest, with his guides—the prisoner came at 9 o'clock, and I began to hand him trays of samples at about 20 minutes to 10—I handed him a tray of samples from chest 6009—the lot 6009 was marked on the tray—he took a piece out of it, and laid it on the window<lb/>ledge by his side—the table is near the window, for light—his guide-box and paper were then on the ledge of the window—he kept the piece of indigo there about an hour and a half or nearly two hours, till we went on to the first-floor; we were then on the second—he ordered me to take it down, with the other samples—he first went on the second-floor, and saw all he had to see by the catalogues—I showed him some other trays after 6009—he took a piece from lot 6029; that was on the second-floor—I went on showing him others, and he took a piece from lot 6050; I then carried his samples down to the first-floor—I took the pieces he had taken from the different trays, by his direction—on the first-floor I saw him take another piece from lot 95—he took no other pieces but what I have mentioned—be left somewhere, about 3 o'clock—when I brought down the three pieces to the first-floor, which he desired me to bring down from the second, I placed them on the window; he did not desire me to hide them—these are the four pieces he took (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is a washing-room, where the gentlemen wash their hands after looking at the indigo—before Mr. Curtis left to wash his hands, he put two of the pieces of indigo in the box, and two on the paper where his samples were lying; he ordered me then to tie the parcel up, and bring his box and the parcel to him in the washing-room; instead of doing that, I went down-stairs with it—Mr. Cooper, the foreman, was at the bottom of the steps—I communicated to him what had passed—one of these pieces has a brand, or mark, on it, "J. S. P."—some of the guides are larger, and some smaller than these pieces; some are about the same size—the prisoner was sent for by Mr. Cooper, and Mr. Williams sent for him from the refreshment-room, or he called him in—I took the box and parcel to Mr. Cooper—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were vacant spaces to put the lumps in—these are about the size of the pieces; some were a great deal smaller—all the guides have a price on them, but they are not all so in this box—I should say there were twenty here—all in this box have not a mark—the price is marked on the guides for the purpose of testing the indigo which is shown by me to the brokers—the price is not on all—it is convenient for a man to have the price on the sample he brings, to match against the other.</p>

               <p>handed samples in that way to others, but not very often, handing the trays to the table—the prisoner is the first person who has taken samples from trays, and desired me to bring them down to the floor beneath—I never saw it done before to my knowledge, and never knew it done—it did not surprise meat all—I have often worked for the prisoner before—he has attended the sales twelve months, or it might be more, I cannot say exactly—he was con<lb/>stantly attending them—neither with him or anybody else has this happened before to my knowledge—most of the brokers who come have a box of this kind, some larger and some smaller—I never saw one much smaller; they are generally larger—some brokers bring some samples in paper as well, and some do not—we bring out the samples on trays—the indigo is contained in chests in the warehouse—there are thousands of chests there—we do not count the samples we put into the trays to hand to the brokers, it is impos<lb/>sible—we do not count the number of samples in the box of the person who comes to sample—a tray contains about eight or nine squares of indigo—I did not count the number of samples the prisoner had in his box—for the purpose of trying the indigo, they have to take it up and break it—they break the samples in half, and are allowed to do so—indigo is discoloured outside by handling it—it is so coppery that, to know what it is, you must break it—the person sometimes breaks it to see the quality, but in general we get fresh pieces from the chest—we very seldom let the old pieces serve for anybody else—we have to go to the back of the chest to get fresh pieces out—when a clerk is there to examine samples, he takes out one of his own samples and examines it with the sample produced by us—the piece be takes from the trays he puts in again, and the piece he takes from the box he lays on the window along with the original piece—that is what ought to be done—in the general course, it would be his own piece which would be laid on the window—I do not know how many samples there were in tray 6009 when it was produced to him—I do not know bow many there were in the tray at the end of the show; I did not examine—I am able to say one of his samples did not get into the tray, because I was watching for the purpose, and was placed there by the foreman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having been put there to watch, do yon mean to say you did not examine the number of pieces before you showed it, and after you showed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I was present at the table the whole time, within a few minutes, while the prisoner went to lunch, at 12 o'clock—he was there without me for five minutes—when he went to lunch, the pieces were left in the window, without the least concealment—I did not point them out to any<lb/>body—I stopped on the floor while my two partners went to lunch—the prisoner went to lunch about 12 o'clock from the first-floor—he came down about a quarter to 12 from the second-floor—I did not call his attention to the samples—when I got them down to the first floor they were laid on the window again, the place where his own samples were usually put—he did not pay me for my trouble—he might have paid the man in the washing-room—I got my 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I believe the other people got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; each; that is usual from the brokers—the four pieces of indigo are worth about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner is the clerk to a respectable broker, a man who has been at the warehouse for years—I recollect him about twelve months—the weight of the indigo is 11 1/2 oz.—this box is not in the state it was when he brought it; it was full when he brought it—something happened to it on 3rd May—I suppose it to contain something which was received on 3rd May—he did not take the box away on that occasion—he left it there, with neither lock or key—it was in the washing-room—I do not think anybody could examine it—I cannot say</p>

               <p>what was to prevent them—the brokers go into the washing-room, and to do the workmen—I take the box in—it was not placed there by me that day, but by the man who was showing him that day—sometimes there are thirty Or forty boxes left there—I took the box to the second-floor warehouse for him, in the state in which I found it—it is left in the washing-room on the dock premises in the ordinary course of business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When do they take the box away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At different times; sometimes they have it away between one sale and another—there are other pieces besides guides in the box—it was left on the 3rd, and remained till the 5th—I took the means to be correct about the numbers of the trays—I put the lots from which he took a piece on the top of my cap—I was put there specially to watch Mr. Curtis, and acted according to the orders given to me by my foreman—if I see any broker take a piece from the tray, my duty is to tell him I cannot allow it; if I do, I shall get myself into trouble—I never allowed any of the brokers to take samples from the trays except on this occasion, then I had my orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Charing-cross Hospital. Mrs. Eaton was brought there, with a severe cut on the inside of the upper lip—the outer skin was not cut; the inner skin was—it was not a very deep wound—I recommended her to have it stitched up, but she refused, and went away—she was brought to the hospital again in about a week—she Was then suffering from erysipelas from the wound, and an abscess was formed in the cheek—that proceeded from the blow—erysipelas is a very frequent conse<lb/>quence of such a wound—her life was in danger—I took' her into the hos<lb/>pital, and she was there about a fortnight—it was such a wound as a blow,</p>

               <p>driving the lip on the teeth, would create—there was a severe contusion on her head, but no incised wound, and there was a severe contusion over the left eye—the face was very much swollen—I saw nothing to induce me to believe she was intoxicated.</p>

I was going into a public-house with a young woman, to whom I had been giving lodgings, on account of her husband turning her out; they wanted to say that I was living with her, which I was not; Caroline Eaton and another young woman were both standing at the corner of the public-house; this young woman with me had been having words with the woman who was with Eaton, and Eaton said, "There she is, the b—y cow;" I asked her directly if she was talking to her; Eaton said to me, "Yes, I am, you b—y <hi rend="italic">sod,</hi> and you are no man if you do not take it up;" I said, "If you were a man I would knock your b—y eye out," and as soon as I said the word she gave me a blow on the forehead with a key, which made a wound half an inch deep; she struck me again on the top of the head; I was in liquor, and, feeling exasperated, I struck again three or four times, and she fell down and struck her head against the post; I never kicked her; I was not aware that I hurt her so much as I did; the shoes I had on would not permit of my hurting her, they are country shoes; feeling sorry, I went to make an apology, but she would not receive it, but went and got a warrant for me; (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner's shoes were here produced</hi>).</p>

Cox, of Doddington, near Spalding, and some potatoes arrived by the Great Northern Railway—I told the prisoner, who was in my employ, to go and put the potatoes, which were loose in the trucks, into sacks, but he had no business to remove them off the railway premises—he never brought me any; if he took any away, they have not come to me—the potatoes are about 18 cwt. short by the bill of parcels.</p>

The prisoner is my wife—on 26th May I came home between I and 2 o'clock in the morning—I was not sober; I knew what I was about—when I got in, my wife was sitting on a chair in the centre of the room—I do not know whether she was asleep or not—that was the room where I was to sleep—I asked her to fix the bed for me to let me go to bed—she began abusing me; she said she would see me d—d first—I asked her repeatedly to fix the bed, and she said, "You w—son, go where you were all night"—she still kept abusing me, and I told her if she did not fix the bed for me I would turn her out of doors—she did not appear to me to be tipsy—I struck her, and turned her out on to the landing, not into the street—the boy then fixed the bed for me, and he and I went to bed—she burst the door in, and began</p>

I was lodging at 7, Mill-yard—on the last Monday in May I saw the prisoner there, about 12 o'clock at night, coming down-stairs from the top room with a young woman—I never saw either of them before—I saw the woman who keeps the house, in the middle room; and as the prisoner came down, she asked him if he was going to pay for the use of the room; he said, "No; I have got plenty of money, but I shan't give you any"—he then went down-stairs; the landlady followed him, said, "You had better pay me for the use of the place!" and he laid hold of her, and pushed her half-way down-stairs—that was upon the first-floor—Farrell then came out of the lower room, and asked the prisoner what he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> his wife down-stairs for—saw the prisoner put his hand to his pocket, and take out something, I cannot say what—Farrell <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to me, <hi rend="italic">"Fred,</hi> he has got a knife, I am stabbed!"—Farrell went outside the door, and <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out "Police!"—the prisoner then laid hold of the door by the bottom, lifted it right off the hinges, and ran away—before he went out, he tried to stab the prosecutor's wife—I went up, and knocked his hand on one side, he dropped something, <hi rend="italic">grappled</hi> it up again, and ran out directly—I saw something glitter in his hand—I and Farrell followed him; and when we came up, the policeman had him in charge; Farrell was bleeding, and was taken in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have followed the sea twelve years—I have not got a ship now—I am living at Woolwich, with my father—I have not been at Mill-yard since the prisoner was convicted—I was living with the girl there a fortnight—I sometimes go to a house, and live with a girl some time—I paid Farrell for my lodging—the girl lived there—I do not know Callaghan, who came there with the prisoner—I never saw either of them before—the girl was at the police-court, but I did not speak to her, and did not see Farrell speak to her—the prisoner was not drunk when he came to the house, but had bad a little to drink—I was perfectly sober—I have never been in trouble—Mr. Farrell has only two women lodgers—the house is up a court.</p>

On the night of 26th May I was on duty near Mill-yard, and heard a cry of "Police! stop him;" and I stopped the prisoner, who was running, followed by Farrell and Button—when Farrell came up, he said, "Hold him fast, for he has stabbed me"—I said to the prisoner, "Have you stabbed this man?"—he said, "No, I have not stabbeds any one, and have not got a knife about me"—while Farrell was showing me the place, the prisoner put his hand into his left-hand pocket, pulled out this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and flung it down just behind him—I picked it up, and there was a kind of little stain upon it—I said, "This is the knife you flung down"—he said nothing to that—he was not drunk—he did not complain of being ill<lb/>used—he said nothing—I took him to the station—Farrell was bleeding, but not much, and was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French-polisher—the prisoner was in my service. On 7th June I tent him to Mr. Cook's, in Oxford-street, to get some money owing to me, not any stated sum, but what he could get—when he came back, he told me that Mr. Cook had given him none, and did not know when he could—I paid him his wages that night, and he went away, and did not return—on the next Saturday, the 14th, I saw him, and asked him if he had any money belonging to me—he said, "No"—I said, "You have got some money you received from Mr. Cook"—he denied having any, and I gave him into custody.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that Howlett struck you first without any provocation, or without anything being said to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had not seen him before—I had been doing nothing but speaking to the crowd to disperse quietly—I was not attacking them; I bad not my staff out—I said nothing to Howlett; he was not one of the persons quarreling—I had known him before; we were not bad friends—I knew Sullivan before; I believe he and Howlett are brothers-in-law—Cockerell took Sullivan—I and Cockerell had not been together previously that evening—I had seen William Sullivan that evening, at the corner of Frederick-street; I had not been in his company—I believe the constable Paul was passing at the time; I have no doubt about it; be was close by me, but he might not have seen me; I was not with him—I should think he saw me with Sullivan; I would not swear he did—I swear that all I said was just to ask Sullivan and the others to go on—I only saw Sullivan a minute, and then passed on—it was not far from a beer-shop in High-street, just opposite—I did not ask Sullivan to treat me to something to drink, nor did Paul, that I am aware of—I had something to drink outside the Victoria public-house, at a quarter before 12; no one treated me, I paid for it myself—the landlord served me outside the door, not the potboy—I don't know whether Sullivan was in the public-house; I swear he did not pay for it—I believe there is a potboy here—I did not know him till I saw him here—I have heard he is a potboy; I have said nothing to him about keeping away from here, and I have not heard anybody speak to him—he did not serve me or Paul with beer; I am perfectly clear about that—I do not know whether I should be dismissed if the men had treated me with beer; I should not do such a thing; I am quite sure I did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I was on duty on this night, and saw the disturbance—I went into the crowd with Curtis—I saw Howlett step from the footpath and strike Curtis on the head—we were only telling the crowd to go away home—I had not spoken to Howlett—I was about three feet from him when he struck Curtis—I cannot say what he struck him with—as soon as he struck him he fell down, and the blood ran down his face—there was plenty of light, a great many shops were open—Curtis fell near the middle of the road—there was no kerb-stone where he fell—he got up and struck Howlett, and knocked him down—I went to lay hold of How<lb/>lett, and was knocked down by James Sullivan—I was held down by some other parties—James Sullivan wrenched the staff out of the sergeant's hand, struck him on the head with it, and be became senseless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Bromley, within twenty yards of where this disturbance took place. I heard it, and went into the street—I went into a house and found Curtis, partially insen<lb/>sible and covered with blood—I bad him removed to my place—I found a deep wound on his head, two inches long, on the frontal bone, the skin was torn from the skull—that wound might have been inflicted either by a severe blow from a blunt instrument, or from a sharp instrument; it was a clean cut—I do not think it could have been done by a man's fist; nor by the man falling on the ground, from the situation of it, and from the fact of the hair lying over it undisturbed—if he had fallen, his hair would have been torn away, and not beaten into it—my nephew, who is the divisional surgeon, attended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why should not it have been done by striking against the edge of a kerb-stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was too much on the top of the head; the way in which the man fell might regulate it—I could detect no fracture of the skull, there was concussion which he did not recover for an hour, or an hour and a half—that would be indicative of a fall as well as a blow—I know that by the intermittant pulse; I had to administer ammonia—I do not think Curtis was at all intoxicated—I smelt his breath, and could not tell that he had been drinking at all—he might have had a glass of wine or ale, but was not under the influence of liquor in any degree.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the divisional surgeon. I examined Curtis on the morning of 4th May; his wound was then dressed—I removed the straps three days afterwards, and found a deep scalp wound which might have been inflicted with a blunt or a sharp instrument, but not with a fist—it was nut from a fall, or it would have been a jagged wound, not so clean as it was—it was nearly on the top of the head—he was under my care three weeks, and has not been able to go on duty yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Park-street, Bromley. On 3rd May, about 12 o'clock at night, I was speaking to James Sullivan and James Nicholson in the road in High-street, when George Reading came from the direction of the Coventry Cross—James Sullivan is a brother of William—Reading put one hand in my neck, and the other in my backside, and said, "Go on"—I said, "All right, master; we are not drunk, and we are not kicking up any row"—he seized me by the handkerchief, and said, "If you don't go on, I will turn you over"—I said there was no cause for it, and we had not been there more than a minute—he left go of me, and I told him if he did it again, I would give him a smack on the nose—he walked four or five yards, came back, renewed his hold of my handkerchief, and we both fell into the road—I got up, and went away—Howlett was not there at the commencement of it—there had been no row before that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know where Mr. Gannan lives? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this happened higher up the street than his door; it was about half-way between the Victoria and the Mulberry-tree—I did not see William Sullivan—I saw Curtis and Paul—Curtis was with Reading—I did not notice that he had a bloody head—the surgeon's house is nearer than the place where the struggle took place to the Victoria.</p>

               <p>on 3rd May I had bolted my door, and closed my shatters—it was about 10 minutes to 12 o'clock—there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on then—I stood at the door smoking my pipe, and at 10 minutes past 12 I saw a mob coming from the Coventry-cross, and saw Curtis and Reading following three young men with smock-frocks on—when they came opposite my door, Reading pushed the middle man, who turned round, and said there was no occasion for it, for they were going home—they followed them twenty or twenty-five yards further, towards the Mulberry-tree, and used the same words again, "Go on"—they still walked on, and made no answer, and the two policemen turned back—I do not know the men, but I swear the policemen were Reading and Curtis—there is no light when my door is closed, for thirty-five yards from it—I saw James Sullivan, Thomas Carter, and a man named Nicholson, standing in the road, between the two kerbs—Reading pushed Carter, and said, "Move on"—Carter said, "All right, master; we are going directly"—Reading said, "If you don't go on, I shall turn you over"—Carter said, "There is no occasion for that, for we are going"—the sergeant and the other man caught Reading by the sleeve, and said, "Come along, let us <hi rend="italic">go</hi> further down"—during that time the mob were coming up from the Coventry-cross, from the Queen Victoria beer-shop, and from Bromley-locks—Reading turned back a second time, caught Carter by the collar of his frock, a scuffle <hi rend="italic">issued</hi> between them, and they fell—then the sergeant returned—I can take my oath neither William Sullivan Howlett were near the spot—I went into my house, and closed the door; I then heard a fall against my door, went up-stairs to see what was the matter, and saw a policeman lying against the stone at the step of my door—I do not know who it was; there was no light.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 9th May, I was walking with a friend in the neighbourhood of Spitalfields; at the corner of a street there were five or six persons standing, who had thrown a potato through a window, and they surrounded me and my friend, making gestures as if we had broken the window—the prisoner was one of them—he took me round the waist, and another person (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 77) took a watch out of my waistcoat pocket, and broke the guard—they both ran away—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I told the committing Magi<lb/>strate that I considered him insane—when he was charged before, he thanked me for my attention to him, and told me that he knew the Emperor of Russia and his brother, and all the Potentates of Europe, and he would better me, and take me out of the police; and that he was in communication with the secret police and the Queen—I called the attention of the Governor of the House of Correction to his state, to see if he was a fit object for a lunatic asylum—one of the turnkeys told me that he had on a straight jacket three parts of the time he was in prison.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, whose hands were restrained, addressed the Jury in broken English, stating that he was a political refugee of the Papal States; that he discovered a Papist conspiracy in London and Switzerland; and that at present he communicated to Government all conspiracies against Protestants; that the officers in the House of Correction sought to murder him by night; and that he was in his proper senses; that he had struck four officers, because they accused him of unnatural practices; and that if he was out of prison, his life was not in security, on account of the Catholics; that he was obliged to run all night through the streets, and never shut his eyes for twenty days; that he was at war with the Pope and the Jesuits, and wished to be sent to Hamburgh, where he would be in safety.</hi>)</p>

Last Tuesday I met a friend from Birmingham, was drinking with him, and got rather the worse for liquor—about 1 o'clock I changed a sovereign at the top of Sloan e-street, and received in change three half-crowns, ten shillings, and sixpence—I put it into my trowsers-pocket—I came to myself next day, and found I had no money.</p>

I have known Hurley sixteen months—he has visited in the house where I live—on 28th April, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I was with him and another man and woman at a public-house at the corner of Crown-street—Hurley left the public-house—I followed in about ten minutes, and saw him alone on the other side of the road, and I went after him down New Inn-passage, or yard—I saw Mr. Collins in the act of being picked up, and Hurley was at his right side, and Catton who had joined Hurley, at his left—I saw Hurley put his hand into Mr. Collins's pocket, but I cannot say whether it was his watch pocket, or hit waistcoat pocket, and I saw Catton hold Mr. Collins's left arm while Hurley twisted the watch off—Mr. Collins put his hand to his pocket, said, "I am not hurt," and then said, "You have got my watch!"—Hurley ran away instantly, Cat<lb/>ton after him, and another man who was there—about an hour afterwards I saw Hurley in Curtain-road, which is five minutes' walk from New Inn-pas<lb/>sage—he said to me, "Was not that a daring robbery"—I said, "Yes it</p>

               <p>was; he is a poor blind man, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves"—I said that he had lost his watch, and Hurley said, "Yes; I sold it to <hi rend="italic">big Mich</hi> in Petticoat-lane, for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave two of them 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and kept the remainder for myself"—I had known Catton six months—on 20th May, I went with a policeman to a beer-shop in Spitalfields, saw Catton out<lb/>side, and as soon as he saw me coming he went inside—I went in, <hi rend="italic">picked</hi> him out, and the officer took him—on 12th May Hurley assaulted me, and on 13th he was examined on that charge at Worship-street—after that exami<lb/>nation this charge was made against him, and he was remanded for a week—I do not know whether the case of assault on me has been determined.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband's name is Thomas—we live at Col<lb/>chester-terrace, Stratford New Town; I let a lodging to Isaac Mason and the prisoner, his wife. On 13th June I went into my parlour, of which I keep the key myself, to a drawer, where my husband's clothes were kept, and they were gone—among the things that were gone there was a handkerchief—I called the prisoner into the parlour, and said, "Mrs. Mason, my husband's clothes is all stolen out of that drawer"—no one else had been in the room since, I had seen them safe on the Friday, and this was Monday—on the Wednesday I followed her to Mr. Phillips's, a pawnbroker at Stratford, and saw her put a ticket for a ring on the counter—the foreman said to me, in the prisoner's presence, "Mrs. Calvert, have you found your husband's clothes? "—I said, "I have not, but I have lost a silk handkerchief also, an old-fashioned one, yellow, with white spots; has any one brought you anything of that sort in pledge?"—be said, in the prisoner's presence, "Mrs. Mason has pledged one of that description," and produced this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—It is my husband's—I know it by a stain on it—the prisoner said, "Yes, Mrs. Calvert, it is yours; and I will pay you the money to get it out"—I gave her into custody.</p>

I was paid off from the <hi rend="italic">Antelope</hi> at Woolwich, on 17th May, and went to the London Coffee-house there, where I met Elizabeth King—the prisoner was there, and I got into conversation with him, and had coffee and bread-and-butter—the conversation brought on that I had sailed with his father and brother-in-law, four years ago; and I told him I was going to Chatham by the 4 o'clock train, and if he liked to accom<lb/>pany me he should have plenty to eat and drink, and a suit of clothes—I saw Louisa Baker at the coffee-house, and we all came out together, and went to the Castle Inn, where we had some drink, and I changed a sovereign to pay for it—I took my watch and chain out of my pocket, in front of the bar, and gave them to the prisoner, and he put them on my neck—I then received the change, and while getting it, the prisoner said, "George, your watch wants winding up;" be took it off my neck again, and I have never seen it since—while getting the change it went <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> out of my mind—we all went out together, and when we got to the bottom of the street I found the prisoner was gone, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is in Woolwich Dock-yard. On 17th May I was with Oliver and Baker at the Castle, and saw the prisoner there—I saw Oliver pull out some silver and a sovereign, and a watch, and he asked the prisoner to put it round his neck, and that was done—while Oliver was getting change the prisoner said, "Your watch is not wound up"—Oliver took his hat off, and the prisoner took the watch off him—Oliver and the prisoner went out, and we followed them in a few minutes—I had not seen the prisoner give Oliver back the watch—at the bottom of Ayre-street the prisoner said he would be back again shortly—we went to the Crown and Anchor—Oliver went to see the time by his watch, and it was not there—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody—Oliver was perfectly sober.</p>

I said, "What money I have is my own; my sister gave it me to go home and see my mother;" I had told my mistress, months back, that I was going home in June to see my mother; I had in my pocket two sovereigns and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the two sovereigns were what my sister gave me to go home; the prosecutrix then went down-stairs, and showed my master my purse with the money in it, and my master gave me in charge; my mistress was not so friendly with me as usual, having had a quarrel with her nephew, and tearing the coat off his back; he summoned her, and she had no witnesses; she came to me, and asked me to be a witness against her nephew by saying that I saw the quarrel between them, when I had not, and I said I would not; and when I would not go, she promised her shop-boy a shilling if he would go with her; and when he would not go, she discharged him the next day, and after that she never liked me, and she used to leave money about in the chair-covers, and all parts of the house, and in the par<lb/>lour, where she says she missed the sovereign; I found a half-sovereign about a fortnight before be missed the sovereign, and I gave it up directly I found it; I found sixpences and shillings also in the chair-covers, and always gave them up; I humbly beg to throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

Last Wednesday three weeks, I saw the policeman with Bryant in custody—Adams came up, and threw the policeman down—I saw Fardell and Payne behind Bryant, and Bryant took something from his bosom, and passed his hand behind—their hands were all in motion—I did not see what became of it; but I heard Fardell say to Adams, "Is it right?" and he said, "A watch"—and he said either "Safe and gone," or "Passed and gone"—some woman then pulled Adams into a house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 219). On the morning of 5th May I was on duty with the deceased, Henry James Chaplen, at Vauxhall-walk—about 1 o'clock we heard a disturbance, close to the corner of Salamanca-street, at the lower end of Vauxhall-walk, near the Pheasant—we went there, and saw nine or ten men—the three prisoners were among them—they were hallooing and making a very great noise—Chaplen said to them, "If you don't go home quietly, I will lock one or two of you up"—upon that they hallooed louder—I then spoke to Hickey and M'Elligott, and said, "Go home, there's good men, and don't make such a noise at this time in the morning"—Hickey replied, "By Jesus, we know what the time is; we have it in our pocket"—I crossed over the road to speak to some men and a woman who were hallooing—four or five of them seemed to go on faster than the others towards the Queen's Head—I was not near enough to see who they were—I followed them, and when I got opposite Salamanca-street, they all appeared to rush out at once, from the opposite side of the street—Chaplen was then on the pavement, directly opposite the gate—I saw Hickey strike Chaplen on the side of the face with what appeared to me like a brickbat—Chaplen staggered against the window shutters, drew his staff, and struck at Hickey—I rushed across the road, and saw Cane strike Chaplen on the left<lb/>side of the head, about the temple; be fell down, and as he was falling, a person, who I could not recognise, gave him another blow on the left side of the head—there were four or five other persons round him at the time these blows were struck—I could not see whether Chaplen's head was bleeding at that time—the spot where the blow was struck was directly opposite Sala<lb/>manca-street—as Chaplen was falling I rushed at Cane, caught hold of the collar of his jacket, and struck him with my staff over the temple—at the same time I received a blow from a stone on my left shoulder, which knocked me down—I still had hold of Cane—I got up again, and received a blow in my breast, and went down again—I got up again, and ran up Salamanea-street, springing my rattle; I heard the prisoners run away when I sprung my rattle; Chaplen was then lying on the pavement—two constables came up, and I assisted them in taking Chaplen to the Queen's Head—after<lb/>wards, in consequence of information, I, and another constable, went to 49, Vauxhall-walk (that might have been about ten minutes or a quarter-of-an-hour after Chaplen had been knocked down)—it is only three doors from the Pheasant—I knocked at the door some time, and it was opened—I went in, and saw Hickey coming out of the kitchen, or wash-house door—he was bleeding from the right-side of the head—he had his clothes on—we took him into custody—my brother constable said to him, "I take you into custody for assaulting, or ill-treating, one of the constables"—he said he had not been out, or would not go out of the house, I do not know which—a constable, named Streems, said to him, "How came the blood on your hands?"—he said, "My nose has been bleeding"—we took him outside—he said at first that he would go, and then he began to kick and plunge about—when we got him into the street I saw M'Elligott close outside the garden railings of No. 49—I turned my lamp on him, and said, "Holloa, young fellow;" and said to my brother constable "Here is one of them;" and he was taken into custody by No. 113—I left Hickey in charge of two constables, who took him to the station, and came back to No. 49—I then saw Cane</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160121"/>
               <p>coming up from the cellar—he was dressed—he tried to get out at the back<lb/>door—his head was bleeding at the side—Streems went and stopped him, and said, "Surrender, or I will strike you down"—he said, Oh, he would go—Streems told him he took him for assaulting a constable; he said, Oh, he would go—he attempted to getaway, but was taken to the station, after a good deal of resistance—Chaplen was taken to his own house on the morning of 5th May—he was insensible all the time, a surgeon was brought to see him—when Chaplen struck at Hickey, the blow took effect on his head—when Hickey and Cane first came up, neither of them were bleeding—I did not see Cane there at first; I first saw him when I attempted to take him into custody—I had never seen him before—I mean that I first saw him directly opposite Salamanca-street, when he struck Chaplen—Cane's head was not bleeding at that time—Hickey and M'Elligott were together; they were the first two that I spoke to—Hickey's head was not bleeding when I first saw him.</p>

               <p>Chaplen about the side of the face—I saw something dark in his hand; it looked to me like a brickbat—when Chaplen struck at Hickey I heard the sound of the staff, and saw it go close to his head—there were two or three persons between us, which prevented ray seeing whether the blow reached him—I saw three blows given to Chaplen—I do not know whether there was a man named Clarey amongst the people—I do not know a person of that name—I have not, to my knowledge, been looking after a person of that name—a man named Burke was taken into custody that night—I do not know whether Thomas and William Burke were taken—I was called on to identify them, and was unable to do so—I attended all the examinations before the Magistrates—a person named Harrington was charged, and dis<lb/>charged by the Magistrate after being had up a second time—Ellen Dunn was examined as a witness for the prisoners—I believe Mr. Carter, the inspector, brought her forward—she was examined at his suggestion—I heard her give her evidence—he brought forward Mrs. Cole likewise—I do not recollect his bringing forward Mrs. Donahay—Mrs. Cole is the landlady of the house, and Ellen Dunn is the servant.</p>

On 5th May, I was on duty in Broad-street, Lambeth, and heard a rattle springing, about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock—I went to Vauxhall-walk, where the sound appeared to come from, and saw the deceased, Henry James Chaplen, lying on the footway—I assisted in taking him to the Queen's Head, and Newton called a surgeon—I went with Newton, Loney, and Curtis to No. 49—I knocked, the door was fastened—we got in by breaking open a side-door, leading to the back-front—I saw Hickey standing at the wash-house door; I saw some blood about his face—(Curtis came in behind me; he was then getting over the railing)—I asked him what blood that was on his hands—he put his hands behind him, and said he had no blood on them—I took hold of his hand, and showed him that there was blood on it—he then said his nose had been bleeding—other constables took him to the station—I then saw Cane come up out of a cellar, or coalhole (the kitchen is on the ground-floor)—he had a cut, I believe it was over the right eye—he asked me what I wanted of him—I said, "On a charge of assaulting a police-constable"—he said he knew nothing of it—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Cole, who keeps this lodging-house, 49, Vauxhall-walk—Cane and Hickey, and several others, lodged there. On Sunday night, 4th May, I went to the White Lion—I left Cane and the others there—I was not in their company, I was in the bar—I got home before 12 o'clock, and went to bed—when I had been to bed some little time I heard my girl's voice, and men's voices—I got oat of bed, went into the passage, and saw Cane and my girl—Cane's head was cut—I saw blood on his face—I spoke to him and went into my room, and he went out—I was disturbed again about a quarter-of-an-hour afterwards—I got op, went into the passage again, and saw Cane, Hickey, and Harrington, and almost at that minute the police came—I do not know whether Cane had a hat or a cap. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.
