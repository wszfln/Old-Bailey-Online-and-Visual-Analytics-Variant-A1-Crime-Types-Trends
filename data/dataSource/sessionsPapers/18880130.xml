On 21st December, about three a.m., I was in St. Peter Street, Mile End, and heard a dog barking—I went towards the noise, and saw the prisoner standing by the side front door of No. 53 in the same street—I asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing"—thinking something was wrong, I pushed the little gate open in front and went in—as soon as I did so the prisoner and another man who was standing behind him made a rush towards the gate—I caught hold of the prisoner, and we had a violent struggle for a minute or so, my helmet being knocked off in the struggle—whilst struggling with him the other man struck me with some sharp instrument at the back of the neck—he then got at the front of me and made a blow towards my face—I put up my left arm, and the instrument went through my coat tunic and shirt into my arm—I then let go the prisoner and struck that man with my truncheon—as I did so the prisoner dealt me a very heavy blow on the right side of the head, which felled me to the ground insensible—when I came to I was taken to the station and seen by the doctor, and I am now under his care—I next saw the prisoner at Bishops gate Station on 22nd January, and identified him from a number of others—he was then clean shaven, as he is now, but he was wearing full whiskers at the time—during the struggle three keys got knocked from the prisoner's hand, and I picked them up by the side of my helmet, which was lying on the ground, and handed them to the sergeant at the station—at the police-court, after I had given my evidence, the prisoner asked to be allowed to see these keys, and after examining them he said "They were taken from my room by the man who fetched me out there," meaning the detective who apprehended him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 29, Mitcham Street, Edgware Road—on Christmas Eve, about 12 o'clock, I was in Edgware Road, outside the Metropolitan Music Hall, when the prisoner came to me—I had had a few words with him two or three months previous, and had not spoken to him for three months—I was talking to two friends—he called me away and said "Here, I want you, <hi rend="italic">Mac;</hi> do you see this big fellow here? We are going to <hi rend="italic">out</hi> him and have his b——y lot"—that meant make him senseless and rob him—I said "Are you? Not whilst you are in my company you will not take any liberty with him"—he said "You are a b——y <hi rend="italic">nark</hi>"—that is one who stops a person from doing wrong by informing the police—I said "I am not a b——y <hi rend="italic">nark.</hi> If you will come up and ask him I will see that he gives you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but you shall take nothing from him"—he took me by the collar and said "You b—y s—, take that," and shoved a long Spanish knife into me—I had seen the knife previously—he said "That is how I serve all b——y <hi rend="italic">narks.</hi> I will put your b——y light out before I have done with you"—I said "I am stabbed"—a few people got round, and the two persons I was with put me in a cab and took me to the hospital—I did not see the prisoner again till his arrest—I have been convicted twice, and charged several times—these are my clothes; they show the place</p>

I am manageress to Mr. Samuel Lewis, of the Two Brewers, Shoe Lane—on 6th January, about 11.50 p.m., five men came in—I served them with a pot of ale—the prisoners are two of them—I left the bar in charge of a boy and went into the bar-parlour—I heard something on the stairs and opened the door—I saw a man—the boy made a communication, in consequence of which I went back to the bar, and missed a bowl of money which I had left there, with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in it and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of bronze, wrapped in paper—I sent the boy for a policeman—the man on the stairs was shorter than the others, but it was dark; I could not recognise him.</p>

Springfield, Mass., U. S., Jan. 24, 1868, and another of July 11th—it appears to be nearly new, it is No. 154, 146—there were also 10 loose cartridges in a parcel—I replaced in the portmanteau the wearing apparel, the revolver, and the cartridges, locked it and took it and the box to</p>

               <p>very short of money, and he might be leaving of me now any day—he then said that he had a tin box upstairs in his bedroom, which would be very useful to me, as I was in the habit of going into the country, and if I liked to buy it he would sell it—he only had one room, this conversation took place in our breakfast parlour on the basement floor—I asked him what he wanted for it; he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said that I would have it, but I could not pay him, because I had not change for a sovereign—he said "Never mind, let that stand over," and told, me to take the box out of the room as soon as I liked—he gave me the key—there were two keys he told me that it locked twice—he then went out, and I never saw him again till I saw him at Scotland Yard the next Saturday—he was then clean shaved—the police came on the Friday, and I told them all I knew, but I did not tell them on the Friday about the closet, not till they questioned me—next day, Saturday, the 19th, McIntyre examined the dustbin, and on the same day my daughter took in a post-letter for Mr. Scott; I did not see it—on the following Monday my daughter took in another letter, but I did not see it—Scott told me that he was a traveller in tea, but he never brought any in—no one ever came to see him.</p>

The man I saw on 10th September was quite a stranger to me—it was between 6 and 7 p.m., but it was very light—he had a long frock coat—I did not notice whether his hat was a high or a round one—it was a dark colour—I did not notice his face at all; I only noticed his shoulders and his back as he went down the steps—I was asked to pick him out at the station from 15 or 20 persons, 8 or 10 of whom were about his size and appearance, and they may have been about the same height, age, and general appearance—I looked at all of them; it was some little time before I picked Callan out; I looked at all their shoulders—the man had a frock coat on, the same as he had when he left my house—I did not see one with a coat so long as his—there was not one like this one among them—I cannot remember how many of them wore frock coats—I looked the men up and down for half a minute or a minute, and I never saw one of them before—I recognised his shoulders as soon as I went in, as I thought, but I was not certain then—Mr. Littlechild asked me if there was anybody there whom I knew, and I said "That is the most like it"—I told him I could only recognise him by the shoulders—I had remarked of him "What a square-built man"—I really tell you that I identify him by the shape of his shoulders, and I said at the time that he was the man—to the best of my knowledge he is the man, judging by his shoulders, but I cannot undertake to swear it.</p>

Majendie in my presence—on the 20th I went to the garden of 26, Baxter Road—I collected some more of the stuff, and some more was given to me by young Johns, and I gave it to Inspector Quin—the gardens of Nos. 24 and 26 adjoin, a small wall divides them—to get to Callan's room at 24, you go down to the basement and out into the garden to the yard; the closet is in the garden or yard—on Saturday, 19th November, I heard the postman at the door, and Mr. Bright gave me this letter, addressed "Mr. Thomas Scott, 24, Baxter Road, Essex Road, Islington," it had the London postmark of November 19th—it has been opened since; it contained the letter which is now in it—on Novem<lb/>ber</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Alfred Street, Colebrook Row, Islington—in June, 1887, I had a card in my window, of a room to let, and the prisoner Harkins came and looked at it one morning, and said he would let me know whether he would take it—that was on a Thursday, and on the following Monday he came and took the room at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he gave me no name at first—on the Monday afterwards he went away for about ten minutes, and came back with this portmanteau, and a man whom I recognised at Scotland Yard as Callan, and to the best of my belief he is the man; they both took it up, but I did not see them—next day, when I went to clean the room I tried to remove the portmanteau, but it was too heavy—the room is the top attic—Harkins said he should only want the room for a week or two—after he had been there a week I asked him if any letters would come for him, and he gave the name of Scott, but no Christian name—he gave me no reference, nor did he pay in advance—once or twice he went out with a small black bag, but I never saw it in his room—he never left it there when he went out, but it might have been locked in the portmanteau; I generally saw him go out—two or three weeks after he came I noticed that the portmanteau was lighter—no one came to see him, and he had no letters—he told me that he was a traveller in agricultural implements—when he first came he went out between 9 and 10 a.m. regularly, but afterwards he stopped in much later—when he had been with me three months he said that he should be leaving me next week, he was going to a job in Kent (that was about September), or that he should be leaving shortly as that job in Kent would be finished—shortly after that he was away for two separate nights—once he said that he had been to Wimbledon and could not catch the train, and another night he said he had been sitting up with a sick friend—when the police came to the house I saw the portmanteau opened and the revolver taken out—after the policeman had come Harkins did not come back that night, but he did the following night, and stayed—I found out he was with the police, and then he came back and stayed longer at my house—I heard Scott or Harkins speak of the inquest on Cohen—I had the paper in the evening especially to read Harkins's evidence at the inquest—I told</p>

               <p>Harkins I had not heard what the suspicion was on him, but now I had read for myself—I knew there was suspicion by the officers coming to my house—he said it was a lot of lies, he could clear himself if he chose by exposing his family affairs, but he did not mean to do so—I read the evening paper on the 26th, the day the inquest was held—from 20th October to 19th November the police officers were living in my house the whole of the time—Harkins knew there were policemen there—there were six policemen always living there; they took their turns—the prisoner knew it—that went on to 19th November, when they were finally arrested and taken to the police-station—on the 19th I was taken to King Street Police-station, Westminster—I saw a number of men there, strangers to me—I was asked to look and see if I could pick out the man who had come to my lodgings when Harkins took them, and I picked out Callan—I believed and still believe he is the man—he was very much changed when I saw him at the station—when he came with Harkins he had a very fresh colour and a moustache, a very fresh-looking man he looked—when I saw him at the police-station he had no moustache—I do not think he had any whiskers when he came to me, and I did not notice that he had any beard—he was much paler when at the police station, and I do not think he had any beard or moustache—I was able to the best of my judgment to pick him out as the same man—previous to the policemen coming to reside at my house on 20th October Harkins had always been able to pay me; the first week after that he was able to pay me, but not afterwards—Harkins told me once he travelled in tea; I cannot say how long that was after he first came, or at what date it was—we were having a conversation; he was down in my kitchen<lb/>he might have been with me seven or eight weeks; he had been with me some weeks—I think we were having tea that day, and that brought the conversation up that he used to travel in tea, that he used to be a traveller in tea, something of that sort—during the whole time he was there nobody ever came to call on him—he did no business at the house, not so far as I know of.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The noise were here read as follows:</hi> "Icarry on business in America as a grocer, and carried it on for two or three years. I got acquainted with the deceased at a public near the Obelisk about a month ago. I afterwards visited him at 42, Lambeth Road. I sat up with the deceased the night before his death. He looked very weakly. I suggested to him to have a doctor. He said he would rather get to the hospital. The deceased told me his name was Brown and he came from America; he did not tell me what part of America. The deceased never told me what his occupation was, or what he was over here for. He said he was about 33 years old. I left the deceased about 9 or 10 o'clock the night he died. When I came the evening he died I found a purse containing 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I know a Mr. Burchell, of Philadelphia, as a real estate agent. I have written a letter to Burchell; I ordered it at my residence; it was asking for money. The paper produced was found on me; it contains an address of Mr. Phillips. I saw Stack and O'Malley within the last week; they were strangers to me. I was sent by deceased to get a paper signed to get him into a hospital; the deceased gave me the address. Mr. Stack took me to a gentleman to get the certificate signed. I recognise the paper as having Mr. Balfour's name on it; I cannot read.

The member inquired for was Mr. Joseph Nolan, a Member of Parliament now and last Session—he is well known to me, a tall gentleman—Mr. Nolan came out—when a member comes out he comes along from the House of Commons side to where the policeman is standing, and then the policeman calls out "Who sends for Mr. Nolan?" or whoever the member is—that practice was followed on this occasion—Melville came forwards, and directly after Harkins—I did not know Melville by sight before that time—I knew Harkins by sight, and had seen him standing in the central hall, just by the strangers' gallery entrance—I had not seen Harkins there that day, but previous days—when Melville and Harkins came forwards Melville was on the watchman's side of the central hall and Harkins on the right-hand side, on the strangers' gallery side—members have to get a pink order to take strangers to view, and a white order to take them to the gallery of the house—on that occasion I saw them go towards the lower waiting hall, further on towards the river—there is a strangers' barrier there, and policemen are stationed to stop strangers; that is as far as strangers may go without orders—I can't say how long they were there—Mr. Nolan went with them towards the barrier, they all three went away together—on the next day, the 5th, I saw Melville and Harkins again about 6 p.m.; I did not exactly see them come in—a card was sent in again for Mr. Joseph Nolan—Mr. Nolan had a pink order in his hand on that occasion—that is to view the House only, and does not admit to the gallery while the House is sitting nor under the gallery, but it admits to the library, smoking-room, terrace, and strangers' dining-room, to enable people to walk round and see—I saw Mr. Nolan and Melville several times afterwards that night—they were sitting on a seat on the terrace—I cannot say I saw Harkins again that night—I saw Melville up to about 11 o'clock that night, to the best of my recollection—I remember Harkins on one previous day at the House of Commons; I have no recollection of seeing him since—I have seen Callan at times previously, not in the House of Commons, but in St. Stephen's Hall and the central hall—St. Stephen's Hall is the one with statues in it, going up to the central hall, where strangers sit waiting their turn to go up to the gallery, and I had also seen Callan in Bridge Street, where the members cross over—I cannot say how late in the year I saw Callan in the central hall, it may be the latter part of July or beginning of August, I cannot be positive on the matter—the name of Melville had been given to me by Chief Inspector Littlechild before it was on the card.</p>

               <p>from Downes, Callan's white portmanteau and the tin box, which I handed over to Dr. Dupre—on 19th November I received Harkins's portmanteau, which I also handed over to Colonel Majendie—I produce a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Penny Illustrated Paper</hi> of November—on 12th December Callan signed this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my presence—I have also seen him write on other occasions—on one or two occasions he wrote his name and address, and on two occasions he wrote his signature—this is a receipt for money, and a receipt for linen and clothes—I was present at the inquest on 26th October—Harkins's evidence was reported in the evening papers—I produce the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">St. James's</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Evening News</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall</hi>, of the 26th, all of which give an account of his evidence at the inquest—in the beginning of July instructions were given to the House of Commons' policemen as to a man named Joseph Melville—I knew Melville after that date—I saw him in London possibly a dozen times—I saw him staying at the Hotel Metropole on 30th August, and I saw him again two or three times up to 8th September—I do not think I saw him in London after that—I think I saw him going away from Victoria—he was watched and followed after the 4th and 5th August—on the 8th he went to Newhaven—he booked for Paris, and never returned—there is a warrant out for him—I did not see him leave for America—he has never been found.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I have had the conduct of this case all through—I was present at the first hearing before Sir James Ingham at Bow Street, when Mr. Poland first appeared; on that occasion the prisoners were not represented by a solicitor—there was then a remand until September 6th, and then Mr. O'Brien first represented both prisoners—before Mrs. Howitt was called Mr. O'Brien said that he had only just been instructed, and I don't think he cross-examined at all throughout the whole case—he said his duty was only watching the case—both prisoners had the opportunity of asking questions—I was present when Callan was confronted with Mr. Monro at Whitehall; he asked him certain questions—that was after he was in custody; he is the Assistant Commissioner of Police; he would not let Callan walk out of the room—Mr. Monro examined some persons at the inquest—he was asking Callan questions in the room for about half an hour, and then Mr. Monro reduced it into writing; he asked him how he became acquainted with Cohen—it was not read over to Callan, and I do not think he was cautioned, nor was he asked to sign it; it is at the office now; Mr. Williamson, the chief constable, occasionally came in—it was after Callan had been in the room for half an hour that he was formally charged—I signed the charge-sheet—Callan was brought there by Downes; there was not a warrant at that time; he was arrested on a warrant—I heard Mr. Monro ask Callan how he had become acquainted with Cohen, and heard him say that he had been to the Oratory at Brompton, and after praying there he went outside to a public-house and met Cohen there, who said "You look like an American," and he said he looked very delicate, and asked him to come and visit him at his lodgings—that was the purport of it—I think it also happened in the case of Burton and Cunningham that a prisoner was questioned for half an hour before he was charged—that is the only case I know—the conversation between Callan and Mr. Monro occurred on Friday evening, the 18th, and he was formally charged on the 19th.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. FRITH</hi>. I was present when Mrs. Bright picked out Harkins by his shoulders—among the persons whom he was placed with there were, I believe, none but police officers in plain clothes—the police have all gone through drilling and would present a more erect appearance than other people—when we are going to have an investigation, if we can get persons who are passing by to come in we do, but there is a difficulty about it—I did not try to get them on that occasion—there were about six policemen in plain clothes when Mrs. Bright picked out Harkins, and some of them had tolerably square shoulders—if you press me on that question, Harkins has remarkably square shoulders, and, knowing that, I abstained from following the ordinary course, and had only police officers; all the men were about his own height and stamp, and we gave him the advantage—she did not go three or four times up and down the line; she first of all saw them with their faces towards her, and she did not identify any of them; I requested the whole of them to turn round, and she immediately picked out Harkins—she said that he was the man—I did not say "Oh, it is him "or "That is him."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Callan was not formally charged till the 19th, because the suspicion was so strong, and the evidence did not appear so strong, and the men were detained pending inquiries, which resulted in their being charged—I had been looking for the people who had the bank-notes probably a month or more, and it was on Downes being summoned to the Bank of England that the inquiry began by Callan himself—Burton and Cunningham's charge was at the Court for causing explosions in the House of Commons.</p>

I have not seen Harry for a month. I do not know what has become of him. He promised to meet me the day after Joe died, and I went there three days; as I did not see him, I did not get any of the money that Joe had; I thought that Harry would get it, and that he would give we some of it, so you can't blame me for getting away with the tea, as I was here all alone, and did not know where to write to, and did not know anyone knew where I was. I thought it better to do away with it than to have them get it and see how it was done up. They have done you down fine; they have got your picture in most all the papers; they have got you in one paper where you are in</p>

                  </hi>. I have been Chief Inspector of Explosives for the Home Office since 1875, and have had considerable experience in examining explosives—I investigated the explosives in the various dynamite explosions which have taken place in London—on Sunday, November 20th, I was shown a white box at Whitehall by Inspector Littlechild, containing about 20 lb. of brownish white stuff like dirty mortar—it was dynamite mixed with paper, cinders, bits of string, and so forth—I left it in charge of Inspector Littlechild, and took a small portion of it to examine; the kind of earth which it was mixed is keisolgraph, which is very commonly and largely used to absorb the nitro-glycerine—when dynamite is intended to be used for industrial purposes it is usually made up in cylindrical cartridges either of parchment-paper or paraffin-paper, to resist moisture—paraffin is used when the cartridges have been filled; the complete cartridge would be dipped in some cases, not in all, in paraffin, to complete it, to prevent the water penetrating—among the dynamite in the box we found several flakes and lumps of paraffin, and some small fragments of paraffin-paper—on Monday, November 21st, I went with Dr. Dupre to 20, Baxter Road, Islington, and examined the back yard and the dustbin—Inspector Quinn was there—I went there again on the 22nd, and examined the same and other parts of the premises, and picked up these pieces of paraffin-paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are parts of a dynamite cartridge or cartridges—I got 2 lbs. 5 oz. of dynamite there, besides what was in the box—I examined No. 26, Baxter Road on the same day—I had given the order the previous day, and the dustbin was sifted by Quinn by my directions—on the. 22nd 51/2 lbs. were found there, of the same material which we had in the other cases—it was just beside the dustbin—there were two dustbins on the premises—I don't think we got any from any other part—I had the water-closet taken to pieces, but found nothing—the total quantity of dynamite which I had furnished to me or succeeded in getting was 27 lbs. 13 oz., exclusive of what I could not separate from the earth and cinders—the charge used in dynamite cartridges varios; ¼ lb. is not uncommon, but 2 oz., 4 oz., or 8 oz. are used, or larger—I have visited a very large number of dynamite factories on the Continent and in America, and I have no doubt that this dynamite was made in America—I am well acquainted with European and with English dynamite, and am confident that this is neither—this cartridge paper was made in America to the best of my belief—different makers have different papers—there is a variation in the marks on them—in my opinion it is American dynamite and American cartridges—I carefully examined the explosives at the House of Commons crypt in 1885, and had means of studying the quantity used there; it did not exceed 8 lbs.—the case was tried in this Court—it did very great damage to persons and property—this kind of dynamite is capable of doing very great damage indeed to persons and property—</p>

               <p>it has been used for charging bombs, find it is proposed to be used for military purposes—1/2 lb. is used in each bomb—on November 21st I examined Cailan's tin box—if it was full of dynamite, without cartridge paper, it would weigh about 90 lbs, in bulk, and probably about 70 lbs. if in cartridges—the cartridges do not fit into one another; they are cylindrical—on examining the box we found a number of small flakes or pieces of paraffin, and some particles adhering to the paint, which proved to be keisolgraph dynamite, the same as we found in the dustbin—in my judgment those were small particles of dynamite and paraffin from the cartridges—this would be the effect if cartridges or dynamite were carried in the box or moved about, or if a cartridge came to pieces, or the rubbing of the paper would have that effect—on December 3rd I examined Cailan's portmanteau, and found some particles of paraffin as before, and we found some keisolgraph, but the particles were not of sufficient size to see whether it was dynamite or not—I cannot tell you whether it was explosive—damp or moisture might wash the keisolgraph out—it was absolutely consistent with the portmanteau having carried cartridges or dynamite—on 21st November we examined Harkins's portmanteau very carefully, and found some small particles of keisolgraph dynamite; assuming that it had been filled with dynamite or dynamite cartridges that would have produced the traces we found—I also examined Cohen's portmanteau and found some flakes and pieces of paraffin, but no keisolgraph—we found paraffin in all four; keisolgraph dynamite in Cailan's tin box and portmanteau, and some dynamite in Cailan's bag—we did not find any cartridge paper in any of the portmanteaus—dynamite can be and is purchased in England for commercial purposes, for mining, for industrial work such as harbours, and for blasting rocks—if persons want it, foreign or English, there is no difficulty in getting it.</p>

Majendie's evidence as to that is quite correct—Callan's portmanteau contained only particles of keisolgraph; Harkins's contained dynamite and paraffin, and Cohen's only paraffin—I tested the paraffin in every case, to melting point, and in every case it was the same quality, both that which came from the trunk and the flakes and the paraffin paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master carman—I live at 4, Frederick Place, Mile End—on 26th December I left my house about 10 a.m., to go to the Thames Police Court to prosecute a woman—I re<lb/>turned about half-past 4—my house was then all right, as I had left it—I left it again before 5, having previously called next door and told them I was going away, and where I was going to—about 7 o'clock the police called at the address in Agnes Street I had given my neighbour, and made a communication to me—I came home and found the back bedroom upstairs had been turned out, the bed had been torn off, and all the things in the servant's box turned out on the floor—I had left the door shut, on the latch; it was as I had left it when I came back—I missed nothing—I found a silk handkerchief of mine on the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My household consists of my wife and servant—on Christmas Day we were all three out; we came home at 2 o'clock on Boxing morning—I then found my house had been broken into—my house was broken into on two consecutive days—the front door had been opened by a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and a quantity of property had been removed—I came home with my wife and servant—I at once left my wife and servant at my wife's father's, and went to the police—I then returned and remained in the house the remainder of Boxing night with a gentleman friend—my wife and servant remained at my wife's father's—next morning I went to the station to give evidence on the finding of the stolen property—I returned to my house after that about half-past 4—when I came home at 2 o'clock the whole house had been ransacked practically—the door when I came back was as when I left it—when I returned at 4 or 5 o'clock I found no additional marks on the door—when I came back at 7 o'clock the door was shut—I did not particularly notice it; it was seemingly in precisely the condition I had left it—there are steps up to the door, and an area in front—a blank wall goes from that house up towards the corner of the road, 50 or 60 yards—that leads into the Mile End Road, which is a very busy thoroughfare.</p>

I live at 2, Ewen Street, Marden Street, Burdett Road—on 26th December I was communicated with by the last witness, and about 6 o'clock I heard the door of 4, Frederick Place closed—I came out to the front with my father, who knocked at the door of No. 4, but he could make nobody hear—he then went to the back of the house, I stayed in the front—my wife was outside my door—there are no gardens in front of the houses, but the front kitchen is in the basement—the front door of No. 4 was opened by the prisoner and another man; they came out. and one said to the other "If we look sharp we shall catch them up"—I said "No, you don't; "they then pushed me on one side and ran away towards Bow Road—I followed them, and at the top of Frederick Place they separated, one going towards Bow Station and the prisoner towards Grove Road—I followed, calling out "Stop thief!" and he was stopped in the Grove Road by a policeman—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the gate of the house from which they came out—they came out very slowly, they sauntered gently out till they got to the gate—it is rather a dark spot there—I had seen neither of the two men before—they pushed me on one side and immediately ran off—I was standing by the gate, outside—there is a little railing between the houses—you must come outside the railings to get to the adjacent house—from that house to the Mile End Road there is about 50 or 60 yards of blank wall; there were only one or two lamps there—the prisoner did not get much ahead of me—I never lost sight of him, we went round the corner very nearly together; I saw him as he went round, and for half a second when he was round the corner—ordinarily that is a crowded road—there was nobody in the Mile End Road, not a soul from Frederick Place to the corner of Grove Road—the man turned round Grove Road, that was the second corner he turned round—he was round a couple of seconds before I was—there was a policeman in Grove Road—I was calling out "Stop thief!"—that attracted attention; I only saw the policeman run—when the prisoner was taken he said I had made a mistake, and he said immediately "Iheard you calling out stop thief, and I ran after"—I saw nobody running in front.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tie and scarf manufacturer, of 36, Wood Street, City—on 16th January Butler came to me, and showed me these samples of flannel, and said "I have them to sell for a friend of mine, who has bought them at an auction" or "under the hammer; there are 18 pieces of them; they are perfectly clean and papered, and the price is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard"—he showed me this billhead, with "Gorrange and Co., Chapel Street," on the top of it—I selected seven pieces, and told him that if when I saw the whole bulk in the daylight I thought well of it I would buy the whole parcels—he went away, and in the afternoon one of my employees named Oliver brought me this note on one of my billheads: "Mr. Harris. Dear Sir,—Have seen my friend, Mr. Gorrange, and he will let you have flannels any time you name to-morrow morning for cash, less 21/2 off, which is the best he can do. Please say if 9. 30 or 10 a.m. will suit you, and oblige yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">R. BUTLER</hi>. P. S.—Clean and perfect at 13 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per yard for cash, less 21/2 off"—I handed that back to Mr. Oliver after having read it—next morning Butler came again about 11 o'clock, and I looked at the pattern again—a van was with him, and Garnham stood outside by the horse's head, while Butler came into the warehouse—the goods were unloaded piece by piece, and I noticed that the paper around them was very much torn, and the things were very dirty, and altogether they had a very slovenly look about them—pieces of straw were hanging in the strings, and they looked more like dead pigs than rolls of flannel—they were all placed in my warehouse—by daylight I saw that they were very much better than I had imagined they were on the previous night; several of them had a silk stripe in them—they were worth considerably more than was asked for them—after they had been taken into my warehouse I called Butler into my counting-house and said "I must have an explanation of this; it does not look like a businesslike transaction; I must have some explanation of their being covered with straw and brought in such a dirty way"—he said "The straw was put there to keep them clean"—I simply laughed at that, and said it was too ridiculous to accept such an explanation as that, and said "It is my impression that these goods have been improperly obtained"—he seemed very much confused and he coloured—I said "I shall not either pay for the goods or part with them until you produce the owner and satisfy me how you obtained them"—I also asked him what auction rooms they had been bought at, and he mentioned Young and Lee, of Cherry Tree Court, Alders gate Street, and Burton's, of Ludgate Hill—he said "Last night, when you offered to buy the seven pieces, I suggested bringing the owner to see you; now it will make me look very foolish to have to bring him to confirm the sale when he thinks I have sold it"—I said "Foolish or not, you<lb/>will have to bring him, or you won't be paid for the goods"—he said "Well, I know nothing about their being stolen; I am an honest man"—I told him if he was an honest man he had better prove it by bringing the owner—he said "Very well, I shall take the goods away," and he went out into the warehouse, and looked out at the door, and then went away—the van had gone before that—11 pieces had been put back into it, and Garnham had gone away with them, leaving only seven pieces with me—directly Butler had gone I went and communicated with the police at Moor Lane Police-station—Butler had offered to bring the owner</p>

               <p>on the night before, as he was not sure whether he would part 7 pieces out of the lot—about two hours afterwards the prisoners came back again with the empty van, and I again called Butler into my counting house, Garnham still remaining outside—I said to Butler that I had sent for the detectives, and they were on the premises at that moment, and that I had discovered that the goods had been stolen from Messrs. Davies and Son—he said "I know nothing about their having been stolen; I merely had them given to me to sell, and all I shall get out of them will be my commission"—he did not mention who had given them to him—I said I would send out for the detectives—he said "Oh, don't do that; I will tell you all I know; I had them given to me by a man named William Garnham, whom I have met at my employer's, and at auction rooms"—I made an answer respecting the character of William Garnham—I knew Garnham by sight—Butler said he knew nothing at all about that; he had merely had the goods given to him in the ordinary way—I then sent across for Mr. Davies, and told Butler that he had better make a clean breast of it, as that was Mr. Davies, who owned the goods; and we had a general conversation—I also said "You had the other 11 pieces here recently; they are not very far away, you had better tell us where they are, "he then gave an address, which I wrote down and gave to the detective, and he went on and got the 11 pieces—Butler kept repeating that he knew nothing about it, that he was perfectly innocent of how they had been obtained, and said he was willing to give any information he could—I went out with the detective, and pointed out Garnham, and he was taken in custody.</p>

On Tuesday, 17th January, I was watching 36, Wood Street, and saw the two prisoners drive up with a horse and van, and saw Butler go into No. 36, while Garnham remained in charge of the horse and van—I followed Butler into the warehouse, and a few minutes afterwards Mr. Harris came and spoke to me, and I went with him into Wood Street—I said to Garnham "I am a police officer, who are you waiting for?"—I was in plain clothes—he said "I am waiting here for a friend of mine named Butler, but I don't know where he has gone"—I said "What is your name?"—he said "Johnson"—I took him into Mr. Harris's counting-house, and Butler said "That is the man I am selling these goods for, I never saw the bulk before this morning"—Garnham said "I know nothing about them"—with assistance I took them to the station, where Butler gave a correct address—Garnham was asked "What is your name and address?" and he said "I have no home"—I searched Butler and found on him this invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This was one of Mr. Gorrange's bill heads, filled up with particulars of this flannel.</hi>) The numbers tally with the numbers on the flannel—I searched Garnham and found on him one of Mr. Gorrange's blank billheads, and this piece of blue paper which contained numbers corresponding to those on this invoice found on Butler.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a land and estate agent, at 44, Ebury Street—on Tuesday, Dec. 27th, I was walking with my wife Elizabeth Gibbs down Grosvenor Place from Hyde Park Corner—she was 68 years of age—we had passed St. George's Hospital on our right hand going towards Victoria Station—we were walking near the kerb—we attempted to cross Halkin Street—I did not see any vehicles in Halkin Street; I don't think there were any there—I saw none in front of me as I was passing—I was just a trifle in front of my wife, and immediately I left the pavement and had gone perhaps two or three steps, I suddenly became aware of a two-horse van coming down upon me, so close that I had neither time to think or act—it came apparently from behind me as it were, but I could not say from which direction—apparently it came from the direction of Hyde Park Corner—I am under the impression that I tried to spring forward, but was instantly knocked down—I think I was about three paces from the kerb when I sprang forward—I was knocked down towards the middle of the street—I believe I came in contact with the pole—the moment I touched the ground I had presence of mind to swing myself round, and by that means I escaped the wheels; nothing went over me—the wheels were between me and the footpath nearest Hyde Park Corner—I escaped with a few cuts and bruises, nothing serious—I got up immediately, and found my wife lying in the direction that the van had just gone, about two yards from the pavement—she was a little behind me—I cannot say I noticed the van when I saw my wife lying in that way, because it had gone very quickly—she was lying apparently where the van had gone—the van was going down Halkin Street towards Belgrave Square, it appeared at a rapid pace—I heard no shout before the accident—my wife's hearing was very good—she was quite an active woman—Mr. Arnold came to my assistance—he was just a few steps before me as it were—I believe he was the only person who really witnessed the accident—I believe she was not insensible, and I took her to the hospital—on the following day the amputation of her left arm was performed—she received every attention there—she died on Sunday, 1st January, about 2 p.m.</p>

I am a clerk, of 98, Denley Street—on Tuesday, 27th December, about 1. 15, I was going down Grosvenor Place from Hyde Park Corner on the right-hand side—I proceeded to cross Halkin Street—I had come up behind Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs; they were on the kerb, walking slowly, and I fast—I ran across in front of them—I only noticed the van just as I crossed—when I had got three parts across the road I turned round, and saw the pole of the van strike Mr. Gibbs on the shoulder, I think, and they both fell—I think the wheel of the van was about a yard from the kerb coming round the corner—I cannot say what pace the van was going at; I am no judge—it appeared to me to be going at a fast trot—I heard no calling out before this occurred—it continued to drive on down Halkin Street—I went to Mrs. Gibbs's assistance, who was lying about 9 or 10 feet from the kerb—the near wheel had gone over her—the van was on the wrong side; it ought to have gone down on the other side of Halkin Street—I had not noticed it coming down Grosvenor Place—there is an incline at that part of Grosvenor Place—I assisted Mr. and Mrs. Gibbs to the hospital—I saw nothing more of the van.</p>

               <p>the matter—he told me he had run over a lady, and would not go to see what was done—I told the prisoner I thought it was a very serious case, that he ought to go and see what he had done—he said he had done nobody any harm—he struck Sant several times in the ribs, and threatened to fight—I had known the prisoner about eight months—his usual demeanour is very quiet as a rule; I never saw him like it before—he was most decidedly different on 27th December to what he had been on any previous occasions I had seen him—I thought he was in liquor and a little bit excited.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen him in a state of excitement before, or under any circumstances that would produce excitement—I only saw him when he came to take orders and money—he was always a quiet, steady, respectable man as you would expect of a man delivering goods—I expect a man delivering goods to be civil and quiet—he seemed very excitable on this occasion—I could not say his conduct was due to excitement alone; I think he had had a little drink as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know the neighbourhood well—there is a large refuge in Grosvenor Place about 50 yards above Halkin Street, opposite another turning—traffic going up Grosvenor Place towards Piccadilly, when it gets opposite Halkin Street, begins to diverge towards the refuge—I should think traffic coming down Grosvenor Place would not pass inside that going to Piccadilly—there is plenty of room there—before it gets to Halkin Street there is plenty of room for it to get on its right side, and when you get further up, the Grosvenor Crescent Road is something like 90 feet wide—the traffic going to Piccadilly bears to the right—there is plenty of room on each side of the refuge—I cannot say that traffic coming down from St. George's Hospital would have the traffic going towards Piccadilly on its left-hand side—if there are two streams of traffic, for each stream there is a right and wrong side—there is a policeman on duty at the refuge, and there is plenty of room for three or four lines—the two lines are bound to a certain extent to come together, but there is plenty of room for three or four to go abreast—they can go either the right or left side—vehicles coming down from St. George's Hospital would have the other traffic on their left at some yards above Halkin Street, not at Halkin Street—there is nothing whatever, either at Halkin Street or Grosvenor Place, to prevent anyone keeping on the proper side.</p>

I am butler to Lord Compton, of 51, Lennox Gardens—on Friday night, about 7. 40, I arrived at St. Pancras Station, and took a cab with the intention of going to Lennox Gardens—I had three portmanteaus, all of which I saw put on the cab before I started—at Regent Circus I missed one of them from the top of the cab—among the things that had been put into it was this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn to me or my order by Lord Compton, dated 6th January, on Messrs. Drummond—it was not endorsed then—the portmanteau also contained articles of wearing apparel, among them this coat and waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I at once gave information to the police at Tottenham Court Road, at from half-past 9 to 20 minutes to 10—the next morning, in consequence of a communication made to me, I went to Drummond's Bank about five minutes to 10—I received information which induced me to return to the police-station at Tottenham Court Road, and subsequently, about 3 o'clock p.m. on Saturday, I was summoned to Bow Street—the prisoner was there in custody—I then saw this cheque, which had been taken with the portmanteau, with this endorsement on it "A. Wilkins"—that was not written by me, nor with my authority—the prisoner had on in the dock a brown overcoat with the top button buttoned, his hands were in his pockets, and I recognised that he was wearing this coat and vest of mine—I have a special means of identifying the coat—I afterwards examined them more closely, and can positively say they are mine, and were part of the articles missing in the portmanteau.</p>

I brought it to the bank, but as it was not endorsed they gave it back to me, and I took it to Mr. Clements, who got it endorsed, and I brought it back to the bank"—I said "We will go and see Mr. Clements"—I went with him in a cab to 145, Barnsbury Road—a man answered the door; that man, whom I know now is Mr. Freeman the occupier—I asked him in the prisoner's hearing if Mr. Clements lived there—he said "No one of that name lives here, but I have a young man of that name working for me"—the prisoner said "The game is up"—Freeman said that some one had been about a cheque the previous week—the prisoner said "You make a note of that"—we went into the parlour, and I told the prisoner that I should take him in custody for forging and uttering a cheque—I took hold of his right arm and handed him down the passage, on to the doorstep, and into the Hansom's cab outside—he made a rush to get out on the opposite side, but I caught a firm grip on his coat behind with my left hand—he then put his right hand into the right coat pocket of his overcoat and pulled out this revolver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the muzzle of which he presented at my breast—he said "Let me go, or you are a dead man"—I heard a click as though the hammer fell—I caught hold of the muzzle and barrel of the revolver with my right hand, and just at that moment the trigger must have been pulled, because the hammer fell on to my thumb and cut it deeply, and it bled—we struggled from the footboard of the cab on to the road together—I kept hold of the revolver with my right hand, and of the prisoner with my left—we struggled for several minutes—several persons came round, and as soon as they saw the revolver they ran away, but almost immediately after, Wilson, the driver of a coal-van, passed—I called to nun, and he came and then Gleeson, the driver of my Hansom's cab, came to my assistance—with their aid I got the prisoner into the passage of 145, Barnsbury Road, sent for a constable, secured the prisoner, and he was given in custody—I got the revolver from him after the driver of the coalvan had secured him from behind—we took him to King's Cross Road Police-station, and he was afterwards charged at King Street—it was a six-chambered revolver, loaded with ball cartridges in five chambers, and the hammer had fallen in the first instance on the empty chamber—when the trigger is pulled the barrel revolves to the right, and the empty chamber was to the right of where the hammer was—the hammer was then down between the two chambers—the next chamber to the empty one was loaded—the hammer had fallen between the empty chamber and the next loaded one when it fell on my thumb—it was down over the spot between the empty chamber and the loaded chamber, to the left of it, it having fallen on the empty chamber; when it was pulled up again it would revolve, and before it had actually got to the next loaded one my thumb had got there; I had grasped it—I charged the prisoner at King Street Station with forging and uttering a cheque for 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and with attempting to shoot me—he refused his name and address, and when the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Bothwell Street, Fulham, and am 15 years of age—my father was a builder—on Saturday, 31st December, just after 5 o'clock, I was in Hawkesmere Street, Fulham, turning out of Delorme Street—I saw the deceased, Leggatt, on the box of his van driving two horses; they were trotting rather fast—I know whew this heap of dirt was, just outside the Board School gate—he passed over and then jerked down; the driver fell off, and the wheel passed over his stomach—I was five or six yards behind the van—he could not get up afterwards—it was dark; I could see the heap of dirt from where I was standing before I saw him go over it—there was no lantern or anything to mark it—I went and told his wife, and a policeman came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Leggatt lived in Delorme Street—Hawkesmere Street is in a very bad state; great ruts in it, not deep ones—there are no kerbs or paving—I saw the heap—there is a lamp at the corner of the end house—it is about 18 yards from there to the heap across—it is about 15 feet between the outside edge of the heap and the opposite footpath—there is a lamp at the corner of Delorme Street in such a position as to reflect on to the heap, and there is another lamp at the corner of Davis Road—I brought the wife to the place—the man was not quite dead—I had seen Leggatt passing up and down this road on several occasions before the accident—I live close by—he passed up and down almost every day with his van; that was the nearest way to the stables—I mean nearly every day after the heap was there—the heap had been there over three weeks—there was plenty of room to pass between the outside of the heap and the opposite side of the road—I had seen him passing there of a morning when it was light, and of an evening after dark—Beattey's stables are round in Munster Road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's deposition before the Coroner was read as follows:</hi> "Iam foreman of works at the Board School addition in Everington Street. They have excavated at the works and carted it out in the road ready for removal; it has been there about three weeks. It is not protected, fenced, or lighted at night; it is lying in the road trodden down a little by children. There is about three yards or three loads. It is in a thoroughfare, but with very little traffic in it; it is not a made road, kerbed only. There is a lamp within 40 feet of the road. There is 15 feet of clear roadway. There is another 2 feet of one heap only 10 inches high which has been trampled down by the children. The highest part of that heap is 1 foot 10 inches, and that is not where the wheel went over, but 10 inches from that. It was partly my work to see the heap of dirt removed, but I have had a very important job at Strerbrook Road Schools, and it has rather been neglected through that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The heap was all part of the original heap that Bagley contracted to</p>

               <p>remove with the exception of about one load. One day Bagley came back with a tale that the clerk of the works at the Sloane Square job would not have any more of the heap in there, and it came back again. He never took his horses and carts away. It was all grit that Bagley ought to have taken."</p>

Leggatt was pointed out to me lying in the road—I took him to the hospital—he was dead when we got there—I saw this heap of dirt—I have seen two or three different heaps of dirt there before this happened—it is not a new road; there is not much traffic, but vehicles pass and repass—there are three lights, one in the street and one at each corner of other streets—the nearest light to where the accident happened is 18 yards off—I could not see the heap if I were driving a van the way he went; it is a very dark street—the lamp does not throw a light over the street properly, not over that side; it confines itself to the footpath.</p>

               <p>of our foremen had been sending you goods that you should not have received, and I sent to your place to trace a load which I knew had been so sent, and the people in charge of your yard declined to give the Dock Company officers any information or allow them to see the goods, or to tell them where they have gone"—Cross said that he would make inquiries about it—I do not remember whether I named the foreman—I did not show Cross the anonymous letter or allude to it—I directed Cruse and Smithers to go to the yard again—when timber comes in there is sometimes an excess over the amount indicated by the shipping document, and sometimes less, but if there is an excess landed from the ship, above the merchant's specifications or orders to receive, that excess is always accounted for in the returns we make to the merchant—Cross is a timber dealer, and in buying timber through brokers or timber merchants he would in the ordinary course receive a delivery order, which he would lodge at our docks, transferring it into his name, and draw the timber as he required it by our orders—we grant timber warrants, if necessary—Ivimy and Perkins each had a yard—on an order being presented it comes into the hands of the foreman of the yard—there are two foremen to each yard; one takes one set of orders and one another—no foreman has a right to deliver timber without the production of a delivery order—no foreman has any right to deliver timber in excess of the quantity indicated by the order, or of a different quality or size, and if he finds the goods ordered do not correspond with the order in every detail, his duty is to bring the fact under the notice of the inspector of the district in the dock, and if there is anything wrong about it it is the inspector's duty to brine it to my notice—in July, 1887, the charge against Ivimy and Cross was heard at Greenwich Police-court, and they stood for trial here on, I think, May 23rd, 1887—in July, 1887, Ivimy called at my house at Rotherhithe, near the docks, and said "Perkins intends going over to the other side; he intends to say that the evidence he gave at Greenwich was got from him under pressure, and he will deny everything he said there, and he will do all he can on behalf of Cross and me"—I told him what a deplorable condition he had placed himself in, a young fellow in whom I had taken an interest, not only for his sake, but his father's, who had been in the service many years, and I asked him how he could possibly have been led away by Cross or anyone else to have done what he had—he said "I hardly know how it is myself; I have recently been married, and I find my money insufficient; I am sorry you did not take my evidence instead of Perkins's, I could put you in possession of facts that would incriminate Cross at once, and I am not sure yet before the trial but what I will do so"—his wages were 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—that was the only time I saw him to speak to, and I have not seen Cross to speak to—there was no right or authority on the part of any foreman or employee of the Dock Company to trade in timber; it was contrary to rule and regulation—in the course of business there would be no justification of the document alluded to, passing between a foreman of yards and a timber merchant—I knew Ivimy's writing; both the figures and writing in the first, second, and third columns of sheet A are his, and the whole of the writing in B, and the figures, except the pencil figures, are Ivimy's—the figures in C, the specifications of quantities, are in Perkins's writing—I do not know whose writing the moneying-out is—I cannot say whether there is any writing of Ivimy's on it or whose figures they are—the</p>

Perkins," to the cheque D is Perkins's writing; the other writing I do not know—it has been through the bankers and has been torn—we have mended it since we have had it—E is Ivimy's writing except the last paragraph—I do not know whose that is—the whole of F and G is in Ivimy's writing except the pencil figures—such documents as that are not issued by the Company, and Ivimy could not by any possibility issue them in the ordinary conduct of our business.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIS</hi>. I have held my present position 10 years—I have told the Jury about the difficulty of persons who purchase from brokers getting the goods to which they are entitled—the timber is in pieces—I have known of a case in which some of the goods which answered to the broker's order could not be found; there was a slight discrepancy—sometimes there would be no order answering to it at all—Cross would have to bring an order from a broker before he got goods, but not for sub-orders; he would sometimes have the whole of the goods delivered to him at the time he brought the order, and sometimes he would have portions—when the goods answering to the order could not be found, the Dock Company has had to pay for them very often—they have not very often delivered other goods in place of them, but they have sometimes; six or seven times to Mr. Cross alone—goods of a different character have been delivered out with my sanction, but only with the merchant's consent—I cannot give you the merchants' names to whom goods have been sent which did not answer to the marks in the order, but it has happened 10 or 12 times in about 30 years—that was the state of things when I first held my present position, and it always will be—goods leave either by cart or barge; there are several entrances for carts, and a person who comes in goes first to the principal office and lodges with the clerk whatever document he has, and it is the clerk's duty to see whether goods are in our possession answering to that document, and without some endorsement on the order by the clerk no one ought to get any goods out of my yard—if he was going to get the whole of the goods the clerk would merely put that upon it which would show that everything was in order, and if he wanted to take less, or the carman said "I shall take so many, I want to leave some," he would take what he wanted, and would have a delivery note from the foreman in the yard for the rest; no sub order is drawn out by the clerk in the principal office—the foreman has a book showing what goods are under his control, and there are men under a contractor who remove the timber into the cart or barge, and the contractor is paid for so much as he delivers; it is piece-work—it is the foreman's duty when he gets an order for a portion, to mark the place where the wood is to be given to—every pile is marked when it comes in, to show its contents, so many pieces and such lengths, but the pieces are not marked—staves are counted by tale as they are delivered into the cart or barge, and the contractor keeps an account of them—the foreman of the yard is the inspector; he watches to see what the contractor puts into the cart, and the same with the barges—Ivimy was in the Island Yard—after the goods are put into the cart the man must leave by one of the gates, and he has a ticket which he shows to the gatekeeper whose duty it is to see that he has the same number of pieces in his cart as are marked on the pass, but not the quality or dimensions; but when they are very short boards they are stowed in the cart in two or more lengths; it is impossible for him to count them,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801300091"/>
               <p>and he makes a mark on the pass that he cannot—with that exception, if the gatekeeper does his duty, the quantity of timber leaving the yard ought to correspond with the pass—the contractor and his men put the timber into the barges, but it is impossible for them to keep a correct account—if that was done we could get from the contractors' returns what had been put into the barge, but often and often it is not done; the contractor often cannot make entries in the book, and has to depend upon the foreman of the yard giving him the number—hundreds of times the contractor is not there; we trust to the Dock Company's own returns so far as delivery is concerned—the contractor is under a bond to supply sufficient men to do all work which the Company requires, if not, the Company put fresh relays on and charge the contractor with it—there are two foremen of the Island Yard, the other was Reest—there must be negociation with the merchant to see if he will take other goods—the foreman of the yard has often, against all orders, carried on negociations with a merchant for the purpose of getting other goods, and getting somebody else to buy his cargo—if there was any error or mistake, the foreman would not communicate with the merchant, I should conduct the correspondence—I don't know that I have any of my correspondence here, I have to give directions to my inspector or to the fore<lb/>men—I have no letter which I have written; I should send it to the merchant—Ivimy would not write to the merchant respecting any error in the delivery of the goods—I don't know Ford and Sons having business at our yard—I have no idea whether Ford and Sons had orders in October, 1885, they are carriers or contractors—Mr. Sutton is a delivery clerk in our employ—letters on the Company's business would not come to him—I know nothing about this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Mr. Sutton from Ford and Sons—Ivimy left our service on 17th August, 1886, and Perkins was discharged on January 12th, 1887; he had been foreman of the stave yard, he occupied another place before that—I don't remember when he shifted, we often shifted our officers—I complained to Perkins about some goods going out which ought not to have gone, while he was foreman—I had him up before the directors—he told me before he went in, something about it having arisen from one person's goods being substituted for the other—I did not call him an internal rogue or a thief—I called him a rogue—he had not threatened an action against the Company—I did not tell him when he was before the Commissioners not to say anything about the system of shortage which existed in the yard, nor did he put a paper into my hands as to shortage of goods and give me the names of people—he denied that there had been anything wrong, except the substituting one person's goods for anothers—that was January 18th, 1887, the day that he was dismissed—I think he said that the people had not received more than they were entitled to—he came into our employ again after he had made his deposition at Greenwich Police-court, after he came to give evidence against Cross and Ivimy; he was put into the warehouse department at 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages—he stayed three or four weeks in that service—I cannot tell you the exact time—he left of himself—he was overlooking no man; he did not give as a reason for leaving that we paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week while he was overlooking a man with a much larger salary; nothing of the sort—he gave a reason to Inspector Cruse, not to me—he was paid his wages—he was paid wages a week before be went into the warehouse office—I think he had one week's wages between January, 1887, and his going into the office—I</p>

               <p>don't know that he had more than that; he had one week at all events before he came there—I don't know if that was the week he was giving evidence at Greenwich—he had a week's wages without being at the warehouse while coming backwards and forwards to Greenwich Police-court—I don't know if Inspector Cruse paid him at the Swedish Yard gate, certainly not by my direction—I believe Inspector Cruse paid the money—Inspector Cruse pays his proportional wages; he pays the constables, gate<lb/>keepers, and some extra men—he was told to pay this man who was in the warehouse 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think Inspector Cruse paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the week he went to the police-court—I took Perkins to the solicitor's office, and before he went I gave him a sovereign out of my own pocket, but whether it was two or three days before I do not know—that was as well as his 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wages—I gave him another sovereign in my office some time in June; that was after he had been discharged—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. going to the police-court—that was before he was receiving the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about a week after Perkins left, Ivimy came to me the first or second week in July—I did not keep the date—I did not request Perkins to tell Ivimy that I should like to see him, nothing of the kind—I have not seen Perkins since he left about the end of July—he went before the directors in January, 1887—I had seen Cross in August, 1886—my suspicions were aroused in 1886—Perkins went on till June, 1887—directly he left the Dock Company Ivimy went into the service of Mr. Cross—when I saw Cross in August, 1886, he did not tell me he had not received any timber more than he was entitled to receive—he did not deny it—he told me he knew nothing about it—he said he had been to Scotland and heard that I had been to his place about some timber, but that he knew nothing about any timber having gone wrong, and that I could send the inspector to his place of business—they went the day afterwards to Mr. Cross's yard and reported that they had not found any timber there—I telegraphed, about the close of the year, complaining about our own timber not being sent in conformity with his order. (<hi rend="italic">A letter was here put in from the defendant Cross to the superintendent of the Dock Company. "Ex tempo Soderan, Station Yard," stating that they sent yesterday for</hi> 104 <hi rend="italic">pieces of timber, and had received other goods instead of them.</hi>) I think Mr. Glassborough was foreman of Station Yard—I inquired into the case, and learned that the foreman of the yard was supposed to have sent back other goods in lieu of those on the order—he ought to have done that if he had reported it to his inspector, Mr. Monk, and I think he did; I will not swear it—if a foreman cannot find the goods he may send others, if the inspector instructs him to do so; we do not inform the merchant, but we inform the person to whom the goods are sent—I knew we were sending him some one else's goods, and I did not tell the other person—that is the system at our docks; I must be allowed to explain how that took place; in sending cargoes some<lb/>times 30, 000 or 40, 000 pieces are lying alongside each other, the delivery ranges from 1, 000 to 10, 000; sometimes breakages happen, they get mixed up, and discrepancies of that nature are liable to take place, and they are put to rights by the merchants' leave; the goods are not sometimes sent out knowing actually to what cargo they belong; we don't knowingly, when one man's order is wanting, fill it up with another man's goods, and so on from year to year—probably I sent an answer to this letter, but I can't find it; I took some action in the matter, and probably I should</p>

               <p>tell the foreman and inspector to bring the goods back—more goods of a different quality were not sent to induce the merchant to take what we were sending him, an equivalent was sent—I have not seen these documents before (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they have come from the Surrey Commercial Docks—they show 53, 51, and 104 pieces leaving our yard, the printed form and the orders seem to be in exact compliance with something—here is a paper pasted on this other document; I think it is in the writing of Jones's clerk—it is not an account of goods sent not answering to the 51 or 53—it is usual to send a piece of paper like this when the goods do not agree with the printed document, and so to advise the person of what he is receiving; we send this without asking his consent, it is so trivial, so trifling, that it makes no difference to a timber merchant—the 52 feet of deals are run over in red ink, that looks like the clerk's writing; that means that they are not sending him the things, but sending him 52 feet over to induce him to take them—the value of them was about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.(Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here read other letters from Cross complaining of short delivery and wrong delivery of timber by the Company and delay in loading.</hi>) I gave instructions to have the timber fetched back—there was a load at Mr. Cross's warehouse which I had notice to take back; we could not tell whose goods they were—we have millions of pounds of timber, and I could not tell without referring to the books. (<hi rend="italic">Another letter from Cross Brothers to the Superintendent, dated January</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1887, <hi rend="italic">making a similar complaint as to timber</hi>,"Ex Nilo," <hi rend="italic">and enclosing documents, was here put in</hi>). I think Hearn was foreman at the Brunswick Yard at that time—these documents are from our dock—these are not the foreman's instructions at the back,—I think the writing is that of some of Cross's people; I do not know it. (<hi rend="italic">Press copies of other letters were here sent for</hi>). We settled two or three of Cross's claims—I don't think think he has two or three actions against us waiting for trial—different foremen have charge of the upper Quebec Shed.

               <p>thinking of another transaction, but they had similar marks and similar character—I think I bought them of Breezman, but am not sure; they were in our yard; I had bought goods before that for the Company's use, and two or three times since we have had this difficulty with Cross Brothers it was Burton whom we bought the goods of—I merely mention Breezman's name—I have bought goods more than three times since I have been in the service; I think this was the first time; it was last year—I think we have bought a few other pieces to meet Cross Brothers' complaints, but I can't say of whom; it is not since I was at the police court; they may have been bought by myself, but not in writing—there are two, three, four, or five persons to whom we have paid money by reason of short delivery to Cross Brothers—Wilkinson Brothers is one—Ivimy was the foreman I mentioned who had lately left our service; he was not in Cross's employ when I wrote "If you send in your claim for the missing pieces I will take care it is properly met; he left next day—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), refers to the delivery by mistake by Ivimy; it relates to the ship <hi rend="italic">Friar</hi>, and I think I saw the load which was sent to the <hi rend="italic">Friar</hi> leave the docks—Mr. Zachari has timber at our docks—I don't remember that when he wanted to have it in July, 1886, there was none answering to it; if it had been so I should have heard of it; we had a claim from Zachari, and we could not find the goods—I don't know that Ivimy was sent down to see them for the purpose of getting Mr. Cross to buy the goods from him, with a view of sending substituted goods, but I believe Cross purchased Zachari's goods; there was no timber in our yard answering the exact description of Zachari's; I can't say there was not one piece—I think Zachari sold his interest to Cross; I enquired into the way by which substituted goods were sent to Cross, but I did not see him upon it, nor do I know who did—if he got substituted goods some one must see him upon it and make arrangements—I don't know that Ivimy was to call on Zachari, and say that Cross would pay cash against that order—I don't know that that was how it was done—I don't re<lb/>member taking any steps in it—I do not know of any ends being out off substituted goods when they were supplied—as far as I know they were sent out, bearing a wrong mark—the marks were not removed when sent out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILBRICK</hi>. The writing on these documents A, B, C, and D, is Ivimy's—I know of no books which show that every bit of timber mentioned in Ivimy's writing was not sent out of the dock instead of timber which ought to have gone out, on the delivery orders; there ought to be a book to show it—if there is any substituted timber it is entered; there is no book which shows where one man's goods are sent instead of another's—no such thing happens except irregularly, and there is no record—I have been through these papers; every delivery order contains the right goods, but if they are not found the order is sent away short, and the merchant sends in a claim for what is short, and if other goods are sent, the delivery book shows what is sent—there would be no record in the delivery book, but an entry on the order—a delivery note is attached to the delivery book—when timber is substituted it is shown on the note, but not in the book—I can't show you any document which shows where we delivered one man's goods for another's—there is no record of every time the Company have delivered one man's goods for another's; we never had such transactions knowingly—if either</p>

               <p>accidentally or from a benevolent motive we don't deliver what we ought there is no record of it—if a foreman takes an order for 150 pieces of boarding, and gets the contractor's men to put in 150 boards of a superior quality, neither the gatekeeper or any one else can tell, but if he takes out 200 instead of 150 the gatekeeper ought to detect it; the inspector would not be there—the contractors are illiterate men, and are paid by the piece, and they take the scale which they are to be paid at from our office—if they did more than was specified on the delivery order they would, as a rule, want to be paid for it, but if a foreman liked to be dishonest he could be so; it would go to the same merchant—Ivimy came to me after the committal, and told me what Perkins had told him about what was stated at the police-court about him was untrue—he said that Perkins said he had been bribed by me under a promise that he should be taken back into the Dock Company's service—I said "It is all bosh or nonsense"—he said that Perkins said that when the trial came on he should correct his evidence, and give it right—I think Ivimy told me that Perkins said that he had been to their solicitors—I think I told Ivimy that I had great respect for his father, who had been there many years—I said that Cross's had been giving great trouble with their claims lately—I did not say that the directors had made unpleasant remarks about the number of small claims, I said that it caused me unpleasantness and annoyance, but the directors' names were not mentioned—Ivimy did not say that he had never been a party to any dishonest act—he did not say that all that happened under him or with him had been the sending away one timber for another, or that to his knowledge Cross never received more than he ought to on the whole—no one else was present at the interview; it was in my dining-room in the evening—he came round to my house unexpected, and called on me—I made no minute of the con<lb/>versation—I saw a letter from Perkins; this is it—it is addressed to "Lewis and Lewis, December 24th, 1887."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> These claims made by Cross began directly after Ivimy entered their service—the foreman of the yard would have some know<lb/>ledge of what goods had been delivered, if there had been any—after these complaints were made to the Dock Company we had some stock books taken, showing what goods were missing—some of those books were stolen from the office of the Island Yard soon after Ivimy left the service—some of them were returned to me by Perkins, I do not know the date, some months afterwards—I do not know when they were taken—I knew they were missing—the whole of Cross Brothers' claim as to mistaken deliveries and shortages amounted to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., extend<lb/>ing over from the time Ivimy first joined Cross till the case came on—that included the claim for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the action which the Company are defending—besides that it was between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; some of those the Company settled rather than fight—there is no system in the docks of delivering other people's goods to merchants who require timber—it does not happen to any appreciable extent—I should say the value of timber delivered from the docks in the course of a year is roughly about a million and a half—taking one year with another the shortage claims amount to not 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the claims made by Mr. Cross while Ivimy has been in his employment are larger than have ever been made in the same length of time—when delivery orders are sent for particular goods, and there is some slight variation in the quantity delivered, that is sometimes appended</p>

               <p>truth in this "I sawmyself then in a very awkward position, and at once accepted the second bribe off him on the distinct understanding that I should not appear on the trial, or, in fact, again at all, and he then supplied me with sufficient money to go where I could not be fetched back, and I deny any one living soul, save Samuel Brownfield, knowing that I was not going to be present at the trial, the less Inspeotor Cruse says about me the better, as for Mr. O'Halleran, he had better say nothing more, or I shall say something more; he does not state in his sworn evidence what he himself said to me at the public-house named; you may not see the importance of Brownfield sending me away, but he knows if I had stayed and given my evidence, and the other servants of the Dock Company who are subpœnaed for the defence, that a large number of cases where he, Brownfield, has given direct orders for goods to be taken away whilst they were lying on the quays before being touched, belonging to the various merchants, I may here mention a few of them, Hook, Fowler, Bryan, Powis, Shooter, Churchill, and so forth, and lots of others, all these can be proved by myself and the Dock Company's men and books, and it can be proved what was done with them, and who reaped the benefit, and also to his ordering goods to be re-branded, ends cut off, goods cut in two, &amp;c."—there is not the slightest foundation for saying I have been a party, or having anything to do with such proceedings; it is utterly untrue—"To defy detection, that is why I am sent away, and it is for him to endeavour to squash the case, and save his position, and to keep back the putting in of one of the Company's overstock books, which Brownfield knows is in the possession of the defendants, and the timber in the book is stolen by Brownfield's orders. In conclusion, allow me to say that this prosecution was begun and continued until now by malice, bribery, corruption, and perjury, done and caused to be done by Samuel Brownfield, all because the defendant Cross refused to take any more goods other than his own, but brought actions to recover the same or their value"—he never did that to my knowledge before these cases with which we are now dealing in this prosecution arose—I never heard of inquiries asked for from Cross as early as August last year—"Had he not done this there would have been no prosecution. I wrote this purely and simply in the interests of justice, and to save two innocent men"—the man writing that is the man who had given evidence on oath before." (<hi rend="italic">The letter contained a postscript stating that a copy of a letter had been sent to the defendant's solicitors, so that it should be suppressed.</hi>) There is not the slightest foundation for the suggestion that I got Perkins away; the Company have taken every means in their power for the purpose of having him here—we have advertised, and a warrant has been issued.</p>

The deposition of Thomas Perkins was here read as follows:</hi> "Thomas Perkins, on oath, saith as follows: I live at 41, Algar Street, Rotherhithe; no occupation. Up to January last I'd been for about nine years in the employ of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company at Rotherhithe. I was assistant foreman in several of the yards, one being the * * * Yard. It would be part of my duty to see that the timber was delivered into barges of the timber merchants. In April, 1886, Prisoner Ivimy introduced Prisoner Cross to me. Ivimy said to me 'If you have any overstock send them up in addition to what you have orders for, and Cross will pay you or allow you something for them' Cross was there when Ivimy said that, and Cross said he would do so. Cross was in the habit of sending orders to the Company for timber; the orders are in writing, and, according to the timber in and the orders, I used to deliver it in Cross's barges; in addition to what was mentioned in Cross's orders I delivered timber in his barge. I did so many times between April, 1886, and January, 1887. After delivering the extra stock I and Ivimy went to Cross's place at Chelsea to have a reckoning up of the stuff he'd received in addition. At Cross's place an agreement was made for Cross to pay one-third of the value of the timber delivered in addition, to me and Ivimy. He had the benefit of the difference between one-third of the price and the whole price. The timber he so paid us for was stolen by me and Ivimy from the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, and Cross knew it. I never accounted to the Company for the money so paid in by Cross. The three papers produced marked 'A,' 'B,' and 'C': in paper 'A' the description of goods I delivered over and above what was mentioned in the order, the goods we stole, is in Ivimy's writing. In paper 'B,' the description of goods we stole is also Ivimy's writing. In paper 'C' the description is in my writing. All three papers were sent to Cross, and subsequently Ivimy and I went through them with Cross, and arrived at the prices to be paid by him. In each of the three papers there are pencil alterations in quantities and prices, and prices carried out, all in Cross's writing, and they were worked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188801300101"/>
               <p>out when Ivimy and I went to Cross to settle the amounts to be paid, and it was on the basis of the figures he wrote we received one-third. The cheque produced marked 'D 'came into my possession at Cross's house. He handed it to me soon after it was found out. In July last a complaint was made to me by an officer of the Company as to irregularities. I then went to Cross's house at Chelsea; Ivimy went with me, and I said to Cross, the taking away, the stealing the timber from the Company's yard without the purchasing it, was found out. Ivimy heard that. About the papers 'A,' 'B,' and 'C,' we told Cross he ought to be more careful; thereupon he handed me the cheque marked 'D,' saying 'You will see the last piece of this evidence. 'I'd seen goods received unlawfully. Ivimy and I were present when he gave the cheque. It it for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was for goods Ivimy and I had stolen and delivered to Cross. I handed it to Ivimy, and he cashed it, and we each took half the amount. I've received other cheques for goods stolen; the majority of them were made payable to Howard. The papers produced, 'E,' 'F,' and 'G,' are lists of stolen goods sent to Cross; they are in Ivimy's writing, and Cross paid us one-third of the value. The note 'H' I received. It is in Cross's writing; I can't say to what letter it refers. The lists were sent by post to Cross, and generally a few lines were sent with the lists. The note 'H' is an acknowledgment of lists, and the request to see us is to settle up for payment of goods. The letter marked 'I' is in the writing of Worrell, in Cross's employ. I don't remember if ever I spoke to Cross about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined:</hi> I was apprenticed to the Company; my father was in their employ. The stealing began as far as I'm concerned in April last. I know Messrs. Cross received goods from the Company while I was with them. I've heard of complaints by them that goods purchased by them couldn't be obtained from the Company. Messrs. Cross bought goods of brokers which was in charge of the Company, and they sent their barges to the docks for their goods. A delivery note would be given. To my knowledge, when those goods have been sent for, they could not at times be found. I don't know that other goods were supplied to make up for the deficiency. I made out a list of goods missing at the docks; the lists were produced marked 'K,' 'L,' and 'M. 'These lists assist my memory only as to goods delivered to Cross unlawfully, and were missing. I handed to Mr. Brownfield these three lists, and he gave them back to me. Messrs. Cross might have complained three or four times as to the non delivery of goods. I didn't know anything about Cross, except seeing their barges there, till April, 1886. I left the Company' service last January, and am not in their service now. The cheque marked 'D 'was given to Ivimy and me for what we'd stolen. It wasn't a cheque for money lent to me to get married. I was about to get married in April, 1886. I saw a part of the goods mentioned in lists 'A,' 'B,' and' C 'delivered into craft; Salter was the lighterman. Some of the goods were sent by van, and I can't say which were sent by craft and which by van. I can swear the goods were stolen by Ivimy and me.</p>

                  </hi>, on oath, saith as follows: I am a merchant, 34, Great St. Helen's, and am summoned by the prosecution. In 1886 I was with Messrs. Cross as manager; our offices were at Chelsea. I left Cross early part of August, 1886. I was paid by part profit, one-sixth of the profits. I was to draw a certain amount during the year, and if I left before the end of the year that was to be treated as salary, and I had no further claim. That agreement was not signed; the agreement last year was simply verbal. The papers 'A,' *B,' and 'C' I have seen before at the offices at Chelsea. I was taking a salary at that time. I should have had an interest in the things if I had remained till the end of the year. I can't remember how these lists came to the office of Cross. The pencil amendments as to quantities and prices are in Cross's writing. I did not see him write them. The lists related to deliveries by the Company in the way described by Perkins. The papers 'E,' 'F,' and 'G 'I have seen before in our office. The pencil marks are in my writing, measurements and prices. I can't say if Cross or his foreman gave me them. I carried out the prices with Cross. The cheque produced, 'D,' is signed in Cross's writing. The letter 'H' is in his writing. The letter 'I' was written by me by Cross's directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was there in May, June, and July, to early part of August, and previously. I know I should see all Cross's customers at Chelsea. I know Howard, of Covent Garden, and a foreman named Howard, at St. Mark's College, Chelsea. We generally had large business every month with the Chelsea people. I received all the cash. I did not make payments to Howard. Some of the books were kept by me, some by Cross. I could not say what was the extent of our business with Howard's in May, June, and July. I only once received a share of the profits. The pencilling in 'E,' 'F,' and 'G,' is the value of the goods. I could not by that pencilling arrive at the profits till the end of the year. I was not to have a share of the profits on the goods in 'E,' 'F,' and 'G,'as I have already given notice to leave before the end of the year, in which case I should have no part of the profits. The pencilling was not done with a view to ascertain the profits. I had a quarrel with Cross. He did not complain of my neglecting my work. The complaint was that last summer, when this nearly came out, they accused me with having something to do with bringing it about. Cross did not accuse me of committing the irregularities in stealing these articles. He did not attempt to charge me with receiving this property unknown to him. My notice was given six weeks prior to any disagreement.</p>

I am chief clerk at the principal office of the Surrey Commercial Docks—I am familiar with the course of business at the docks, with the way the delivery orders are delivered—when this matter was first brought before the Dock Company, I went through the whole of the orders that relate to the yards where Ivimy or Perkins were employed, every order from 1st January, 1886, to 31st July, and the first week in August, when the discoveries were made, every order—in the whole of the orders no goods were identical with the documents A, B, C, E, F, and G, with the exception of one order for boards five-eighths of an inch thick and 51/2 inches wide, 100 pieces from 14 feet to 17 feet long, and in the legitimate order there are 48 pieces answering to that description—the value of that would be a few shillings—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the copies of those lists marked A, B, C, and D, of goods which it is alleged were stolen, and in these lists there are 100 such pieces, as against the 48 in the order; that is the only item which is identical with any order at all—there was nothing at all in the course of business</p>

               <p>which would in any way have rendered it necessary for Ivimy and Perkins to deliver such lists as these by a timber merchant dealing with the docks—I have taken out the value of goods delivered from those two yards in 1886—the total value is 1, 404, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 1887 balance<lb/>sheet is not yet made out, nor have I the year before—I have only got 1886—that represents rather less than the ordinary amount of business during the last few years at the docks; it was a slack year—speaking generally, and taking one year with another, I should think, from the claims I have seen in my experience of four years at the docks, the amount claimed by customers in respect of goods that get mixed, and some sent in the wrong parcel, would run to between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of that 1, 500, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. delivery—that would be made at the office, and not at the yard where Mr. Brownfield is.</p>

I did not know it was"—I said "Have you any more of them by you?"—he said "No"—I said "Where did you get it?"—he said "I do not know, I have had it three or four days"—I gave him in custody with these two pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he was brought up at Guild hall, and discharged.</p>
