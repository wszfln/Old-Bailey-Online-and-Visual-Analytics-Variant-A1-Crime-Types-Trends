White, of Great Portland Street, and recovered a portion of my property from them—I asked her questions with regard to the bills, but I don't remember how the questions were put, she offered some explanation about them—she mentioned the name of Mills, of Oxford Street, to me; he is a jeweller, but she had no transactions with him, except leaving a brooch with him, which was not sold, and was returned to her—she made her statement perfectly voluntarily—she made a compendious statement with reference to these bills; if it was in reply to a question, it was not a direct question—she was given into custody, but not by me—I think the conversation was on 18th or 19th December, 1872; at that time there was a warrant out against Montague—I should think it had been out three or four days; it was three or four days after I had seen Montague for the last time.</p>

I and my brother Montague were present, and Rebecca, who was in bed—Montague lived in the house in Colville Terrace—I think we had lived there four years, and Rebecca and Michael, and myself also—Montague and Rebecca very often went out in the morning together; they sometimes returned together in a cab, and some<lb/>times they walked—this was at Bayswater—Rebecca used not to wear jewellery, only a watch and chain—I think she had one ring; I mean that she wore it to see how it looked; I have often done that myself—I have not seen her do it with a good deal of the jewellery; it was very rarely she had any occasion to do so—Montague sometimes used to bring anything to me, but not Michael—I have seen Montague with articles of jewellery, but not often—one morning, when we were going to the Baroness Lionel de Rothschild, I had some—I very frequently went into the shop—the jewellery was in the safe; both Montague and Michael had keys—Rebecca had no key—I was present when some jewellery was brought in, which I subsequently heard was intended for someone—Rebecca may have looked at it, but she did not ask to—I looked at it, and was very much pleased—I said, in Rebecca's presence, that my brother did not allow me to look at it—I saw books in the office, and sometimes I saw my brother writing in them; they had lines in them, and some red lines—I did not know anything about these transactions—I went with my mother to Maldon, and was called Miss Ward for the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carter, in the service of Mr. Johnson, of the Rectory Farm, Heston—I know John Humphreys, he was also a carter in Mr. Johnson's service—he and I lived on the farm, in a cottage adjoining the stables—on Sunday, 25th May, Humphreys breakfasted with me a little after 9 o'clock; we stayed together till about 11 o'clock, and then went into Cranford Lane to get some cabbages that I had had given me; that is about a mile from the farm—I got the cabbages, and at 12.30 we went into the Rising Sun public-house, in Cranford Lane, with Horton, the man who gave me the cabbages—there might have been a dozen persons there—I did not notice the prisoner there—Humphreys and I sat together the best part of the time—we stayed there till about 2.30—I paid 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for beer, which would be three pints, and the other man, I suppose, spent about the same; I don't know that he spent any more—I did not notice whether Horton paid for anything; he drank some of my beer—at 2.30 the house was cleared—Horton went indoors to his own house, and I saw nothing more of him that day—I bought some periwinkles—Humphreys did not like to see anybody eat winkles; he went on the road home, a little distance in front of me—he started three or four minutes before I did—I did not take any notice of him till I overtook him, which was about 200 yards from the public-house—there were some men standing against the railings which join the public-house—I don't know who they were—I heard no words pass between them and Humphreys—I did not notice the prisoner until he over<lb/>took us—I was then walking with Humphreys; he came behind us—I did not notice his state; he could walk very well—I and Humphreys were sober—the prisoner had his jacket on his left arm when he came up—the prisoner said something to Humphreys about a pretty shirt; that was all I heard—Humphreys said it was a pretty one, or some such words; I heard nothing else—the prisoner then knocked Humphreys down; he struck him in the face, in front of him; it was a blow that knocked him down, it was a blew between the eyes; he fell backwards—I might have been three or four yards away from Humphreys at the time—after striking Humphreys, the prisoner came and struck me—I had not said anything to him; he struck me under the eye, and again on the nose—at the time he struck me I had one hand in my pocket—I had not known the prisoner before; I am a stranger about there—when he struck me something fell from his hands, but the blood was running fast, and I never stopped to see what it was—it might have been a stone; it cut two places here, and one on the nose—I got over the gate, and walked across the field, wiping the blood off—Humphreys was lying in the road, where he was knocked down—he after<lb/>wards overtook me, and we walked across together—I dare say he overtook me in five or ten minutes, because he did not get over the same way that I did, he came over another gate—I saw blood running down from his nose and eye—we then walked home together—on arriving at the farm I did my horses, and I believe Humphreys did his—I did not see him again till between 5 and 6 o'clock on Monday night, when they came home with the horses—he was then in the stable—he was going to do his horses, but he was sitting down on the chaff-box, resting his arm on the corn bin—I and Cook spoke to him, but he never spoke to us—I could see he looked bad—I</p>

Harrison, brick-makers—I knew the deceased man, Humphreys, since I was a child, I also know the prisoner—I live about 200 yards from the Rising Sun—on 25th May, a little before 3 o'clock, I was on my door step, reading a paper—I saw Humphreys and Parrant, who, I knew only by sight, going in the direction of Cranford, from the Rising Sun—Humphreys halloaed to me as he passed, "What cheer, mate?" and I replied "Hoy, boy!" he went on and I kept my place reading—they were not drunk, they were sober—after they passed I saw the prisoner following them, walking, and a little time after that Charles Church, young Robert Cordery and Thomas Meads passed in the same direction—a few minutes after that, in consequence of something my wife said to me, I went in the same direction and I saw the prisoner and Humphreys, they were standing almost face to face when I first saw them, I saw the prisoner hit Humphreys on the nose; that was where the blood was coming from—I could not tell where he hit him till I got close to him, I saw him hit him in the face, he fell</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187307070029"/>
               <p>down—the prisoner had his jacket off at the time—after he had done this he turned round and came back towards home—I did not see him strike Parrant—I met the prisoner and told him he was a b----coward, and that for two pins I should slip into him for being such a coward—he did not say anything that I heard; I went on to Humphreys, he was lying on the ground, on the flat of his back—when I picked him up he did not know me for a second or two—Meads helped me pick him up, and then he turned round and said "Is that you <hi rend="italic">Nat</hi>" I said "It is me, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, my boy"—he turned round towards Church as he was going away and said "That man with the red shirt on has hit me"—I said "Never mind, go straight on home and I will see that no one interferes with you," and as he went on home he over<lb/>took Parrant and they went home together—when the prisoner struck Humphreys he did not strike back again, he fell and there he laid—I never saw him again after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner passed within about 5 yards of me, in the road; I had a full opportunity of seeing him, he was not carrying anything that I saw, he had nothing in his hand—Humphreys was not in my sight then, he had gone round the corner of the hedge—at the time I first caught sight of Humphreys, the prisoner was not a yard from him—Parrant was then over in the field, going towards the farm where he lived—I was not near enough to hear anything pass between the prisoner and Humphreys; after the prisoner struck Humphreys, he turned back to meet me and passed me—Humphreys was then lying on his back, on the ground—I am certain that the prisoner never went back to him or to Parrant—Humphreys was a large-framed man, but not over and above powerful; he was apparently much stronger than the prisoner—I have known the prisoner eleven years, he is about twenty or twenty-one—his father and mother live near me, he works in a brickfield at Heston—I don't know that he is in the habit of coming over on a Sunday to see his parents, I had not seen him over there all the summer till this Sunday; every other summer he has been at home; he worked with his father for several years—I know the landlord of the. Rising Sun; I am not aware that he is here, or anyone from the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was about 150 yards from Humphreys when I saw the prisoner strike him—there was nothing between us, it is a straight road from where I stood—I did not see him strike Parrant; after I saw Hum<lb/>phreys struck I ran—I came up to the prisoner in a minute or a minute and a half—I am certain I only saw one blow, and that knocked him down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live in Cranford Lane—on Sunday, 25th May, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I was standing at my door, close to the highway, and saw Humphreys and Parrant pass; and after that I saw the prisoner following them sharply, with his two hands in his pockets—he said to them "Now then, old <hi rend="italic">butts</hi>, what have you got to say about me? what you have got to say you had better come and do it"—one of them said "Oh, come on, we won't have no words with him," and they walked along—he was about ten yards away when he called out this—I had not heard them say anything to him—lie then threw off his jacket, stepped up before Humphreys and hit him in the face and knocked him down: he fell on his back—then he stepped from him and went and hit Parrant in the face—he then turned back to see whether Humphreys was getting up; he found he was not, so he walked after Parrant and got on the top of the gate as Parrant got over it—all this time Humphreys was in the road—I believe the prisoner's brother was the next that came up, and then Cordery and Watson, who picked Humphreys up—the prisoner walked back by Hum<lb/>phreys' feet as he lay, and passed Watson—I did not see any kick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It might have been three minutes after one of the men said "Come on, we won't have no words with him," that the prisoner struck Humphreys—Humphreys and Parrant were close together—I did not see Humphreys turn round to face the prisoner; he walked round to Humphreys and hit him in the face—he went and got before him and struck him, and then he immediately struck Parrant—he did not knock Parrant down; he did not fall or stagger; he walked away and got over the gate—I saw Humphreys afterwards walk away across the field—I am a brickmaker—I don't work with the prisoner; I have known him several years, and his brother these ten years—I did not give evidence before the Coroner; I was before the Magistrate—Mr. Thompson, the policeman, took me there—I had not been talking of this to people—I told my <hi rend="italic">missis</hi> and my father-in-law what I had seen—I heard of the evidence given before the Coroner—I did not read it; I can't read—I heard people talk about it—I don't frequent the Rising Sun—I have been there, but not to make a practice of it—I have not heard this talked of there—I have only been there once since,</p>

I am a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, and live at Spring Grove, Isleworth—on 27th May I was requested to make <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body of the deceased—he appeared to have been a healthy man—I examined the head—exter<lb/>nally I found an extravasated wound, extending about 3 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187307070033"/>
               <p>above and rather behind the ear—there was no contusion, simply a bruise—on opening the head I found blood extravasated beneath the cellular tissues—I found a fracture of the skull, extending from the petrous portion of the temporal bone, just above the external meatus, corresponding with the external injury—blood was extensively extravasated in the interstices of the bone, and also within the skull, pressing on the brain—the piece of skull was not knocked out, but the fracture had a triangular form, so that the piece of bone was, as it were, tesselated; although it was detached it could not be moved or shaken, it was tight—the injuries I discovered in the head were sufficient to cause death—I should say the fracture was caused by a blow inflicted by some blunt instrument, probably by a kick; a kick would do it, but whatever it was it must have been a very powerful blow—that portion of the skull is one of the thickest and hardest, a little above that it is thinnest—if a man received such a blow he would not necessarily feel the consequences directly, he might go about for some time afterwards—I think he might go about his work, and be in the condition that the witnesses have described on the Monday—the way in which I should explain it would be thus: in all probability the injury ruptured a vessel slightly, but that that dosed up again, and, owing to the motion, whether it was by working or jolting, or some other cause, the vessel re<lb/>opened, and after a time blood was poured out in a sufficient quantity to press upon the brain, and so cause death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The skull was extensively fractured; not all round the head, it did not go to the back part of the skull—the fracture was only just where the injury was inflicted—I had not heard any account of the transac<lb/>tion before I gave my evidence—I had heard some of the witnesses say he was kicked—I should scarcely say a simple fall was sufficient to have caused such an extensive fracture—it might have been caused by his falling on some hard substance, but less likely than a kick—I think he might go about his work after receiving the injury—I have known a case of the kind—I remember one when I was a student in the hospital, the man had sustained fracture of the skull, and had gone about his work for some hours afterwards—that is some years ago—that is the only case that has come under my personal treatment—I should not think it unlikely or improbable that a man could go about his work without complaining for hours after the injury—it would be an exceptional case, I admit, because, as a general rule, blood would be poured out immediately, in a sufficient quantity to cause death, but in this case it was not so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If the man was struck violently, or fell heavily against a stone, that might cause the injury, but until the blood began to press on the brain he might go about—I observed some marks on the bridge of his nose, as if from a blow—it was not an injury of much moment; the bones were not injured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am an M. D.—I was called in on Monday night by Mr. John<lb/>son's foreman, about 8 o'clock—I saw the deceased; he was propped up in bed, and dying—I ordered something for him, but before the messenger arrived he was dead—I at once saw that he was suffering from effusion on</p>

               <p>the brain, through blood or serum, but it was impossible to decide without a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I was present at the examination—I saw the fracture—I am in partnership with Dr. Granville, and I agree with his evidence that the fracture caused death, and it is distinctly laid down that you may fracture your skull and go about for two days, unless there is injury to the brain itself—it may not be detected even for five mouths afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The way in which I explain it is this: that the man, when he fractured his skull, also ruptured a small vessel, that nature caused that small vessel to retract, and only a very small portion of blood was thrown out; if a larger quantity had been thrown out insensibility would have come on at once, but there being only a small quantity effused he was able to go about his ordinary duty; having had no contusion, he was perfectly sensible; but I imagine that the exertion of getting up in the morning and going out with the horses caused the little clot in the vessel, which nature had supplied to close it up, to be disturbed—if that had con<lb/>tinued he would probably have been alive now—I agree with Mr. Glanville that a man may fracture his skull and go about his ordinary duty, provided there is no effusion—if a large vessel had been ruptured, probably he would have died in ten minutes, but this was a minute vessel—I had heard an account of the case when the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made—if I had heard nothing about it I should have considered that the injury had been inflicted some twenty-four hours before, or something of that sort—I believe it might have been caused by a kick, and quite as likely by a fall—there must have been very great violence—I should say a violent kick would stun the man—I should say it would be very unlikely that he would be able to walk away in ten minutes, as if nothing had happened—it would all depend on the amount of concussion—I should not necessarily expect a longer interval—I should in the majority of cases, but this was an exceptional one, and we are surprised at so many things now-a-days.</p>

On the evening of Whit Monday, about 10. 30, I was on duty in Newton Terrace, Westbourne Grove—I heard a noise and a shout from people, and on looking round I saw a Hansom cab coming at a very furious rate, and several persons running—the cab was about five or six yards from me when it passed me—the driver was whip<lb/>ping the horse when he passed me—it was going at about twelve or fourteen miles an hour, galloping, coming from London and going towards Bayswater—the accident had occurred about ten or twelve yards before he got to me—I had been standing there for about ten minutes—I had not seen any other cab pass just about that time—I ran after the cab and halloaed, and asked him to stop—I came up to him at the corner of Rich<lb/>mond Road, where he was stopped—I told him he had run over some one in Westbourne Grove—he said "I don't know whether I have or not"—it was the prisoner—he was drunk.</p>

On the evening of Whit Monday, I was on duty at the bottom of Norfolk Terrace, Westbourne Grove, at a special point—I had been there about half an hour previous to this, and hearing a great noise down Westbourne Grove, I looked that way, and saw a Hansom cab coming at a most terrific rate, galloping up Westbourne Grove, towards me—I rushed across the road—there are about three or four lamps at that point, and as the driver saw me coming across, he pulled the horse and cab up Richmond Road—that slackened the pace of the horse, and I rushed forward and caught hold of it as he turned; at the same time three or four men jumped on to the cab to help me stop it—when it was stopped a lady and gentleman got out of the cab—they seemed very excited—I told the cabman to get down, he got down directly and came to the near side of his fare on the pavement, and said "Will you please give me your name and address, Mr. Cuff"—Mr. Cuff then helped the lady out, and said "I shall pay you your fare, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I shall have no more to do with you"—the prisoner said "Mr. Cuff, will you give me your name and address, I have got into some trouble, and I hope you will help me out of it"—Mr. Cuff said "I shall do nothing of the kind, I shall pay you your fare, and if the police want my name and address they shall have it," and he gave it to the last witness, at the same time remarking to the driver "Whatever punishment you get you richly deserve, even if it is six months'; it is a mercy that me and my wife were not dashed to pieces, as the cabman almost dashed into a carriage in Oxford Street, near Great Portland Street; we were coming at a terrific rate and almost came into a carriage, and also into an omnibus in Westbourne Grove"—the prisoner was under the influence of liquor at the time—a gentleman came up and said "That is the cabman who has knocked down a man and a child in Westbourne Grove, I have put them in a four-wheeled cab and sent them to the hospital"—I Said to the prisoner "You hear what that gentleman says?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I shall have to take you to Paddington Police Station, and charge you"—which I did—I charged him with being drunk, furiously driving, and also knocking down two persons in Westbourne Grove and running over them—he replied "I lost all control over the horse"—I took the number of the cab; it was 2, 591.</p>

               <p>and the shaft, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> himself down over the near shaft, and there he lay—I got him up and took him to Mr. Allen's, in Liquorpond Street, and there I left him—I told my master of that; I told him the first time he bolted from me—I am satisfied if a man was to whip him they would not stop him in no distance—his horses never do want any whip, and as to whipping him, no man has no business to whip him, they could not do any<lb/>thing at all with him if they did.</p>

I asked her if she would do me the favour to go and fetch a policeman—she said that she would not, and the prisoner told me to go and fetch one—I said that I would not go before daybreak, when I could identify where I was—the other woman was there all the while, and she was there when I left to find a policeman—I saw my watch at the station, also my handkerchief—I had not given them to the prisoner.</p>

I am the wife of James Knight, of 266, South Lambeth Road—on 3rd April the prisoner came to our house and asked for board and residence—I asked him for a reference; he gave me two, but begged me not to go about them, and I did not—he said that he had an appointment in the Post Office, which induced me to receive him—he after<lb/>wards said that he had an appointment at the East India Office, 20, Great George Street, that he had just come from the country and would not receive his money for a few days—I asked him for a week in advance, and he said that I should have it in the course of a few days—the terms were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—at the end of the week I sent in my account, and he said that I should have it the following Saturday—I applied on Saturday, and he said that I should have it on Monday, and on Monday he said that I should have it the following Saturday—on Saturday I applied again; he did not pay, and I turned him out.</p>

H. Hooper, at Great Suffolk Street, Borough, and told him he was charged with aiding and abetting and inciting Charles Hooper to fight with Rowland, whereby Rowland came by his death—he said "All right, I will go with you; it is a bad job"—I afterwards took J. E. Hooper, and said the same to him—he said "All I did in the matter was, I said 'Give it to him, Charley'"—I took Cecilia Rowland next day, Wednesday; she was the deceased's wife—he was then dead—I told her she would be charged with the same offence as her two brothers, namely, aiding and abetting them to fight—she said "There has been a deal of false swearing in the matter"—I believe the male prisoners are brothers—two of them had been before the Magistrate; Cecilia might have been present.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Osborne Buildings, and am assistant to a hop merchant—I know the prisoner Joseph by sight, and have seen Cecilia once or twice—I know that two or three of them lived in Osborne Buildings, but I did not know what their names were—I had seen the deceased, but did not know his name—he lived at 8, Osborne Buildings—about 11.30 on Sunday night, I heard shouts and scuffling of feet outside No. 6, where I live, on the first floor—my brother-in-law lives below—I ran out, and heard Cecilia screaming out "Pay him, Charlie! give it to him! give it to the b----! murder him, he deserves it! the b—told me to go and f—myself!"—I saw Charles Hooper fighting with the deceased; they seemed to be struggling together, and the deceased fell on the back of his head, and lay there—it was a severe fall; you could hear it at the top of the buildings, I should think—when Cecilia said "Give it to him! pay him!" Charles Hooper said "Yes, I mean paying him," or some expression like that, and Joseph and Harry were then shouting out "Pay him," and "Give it to him"—I went and helped the poor fellow up, and put him against a fence; and Mr. Turpin, who knew him, said, "Rowland, you are not fit to fight that man; go indoors"—Rowland made a sort of murmuring noise—I believe it would have been all over then, but Cecilia began inciting the men again—she said "Pay him!" and "Murder him! he has wanted it for seven years; give it to him!"—that called my attention off, and when I looked round again, I saw the deceased and Charles Hooper struggling to<lb/>gether again—they both fell together, the deceased underneath—Hooper</p>

               <p>was lifted off him by, I think, A. H.

H. Hooper was urging it on; I believe he said "Give it to him, Charley! pay him I"—some of the people cried "Shame!"—Joseph was saying "Go it!" and "Give it to him!"—I heard Cecilia shouting before I went out; the window was open—I believe there was another round before that, before he got the death-blow on his head—I most decidedly swear that another round took place after I heard Cecilia scream out what I have said!</p>

I am a packing-case maker, of Bermondsey—on Satur<lb/>day, 7th June, I was at the Rose public-house, and I saw the prisoner there—Collins came in, and spoke to the prisoner—they seemed the worse for liquor—they left almost immediately, and I saw them go down the street side by side, and go under the railway arch—I saw them opposite each other, looking at each other for a couple of minutes—the prisoner pulled his coat off; then he put it on again, then pulled it off again, and handed it to a lad who was standing by—I saw Collins button his coat up—they went into the middle of the road, and sparred together—the deceased's cap</p>
