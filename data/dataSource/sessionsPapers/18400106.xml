                  </hi>I am a shoemaker, and lodge in Poole-terrace, City<lb/>Road. On the evening of the 1st of December the prisoner came into my house, and brought a sailor with him—they were introduced to me by a young man named Davis, who lodges in the house—they went up stairs, and after a few minutes' conversation I was called up—Young produced this paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) and said, this John Freeman had 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. price<lb/>money to receive—he read the paper to me, and asked me whether I would oblige the sailor with the loan of a sovereign until the 12th of De<lb/>cember, when he was going to receive his money, and he would be sure to return it to me again, and he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan of it until the 12th—he told me the sailor's name was John Freeman, which was on the paper—he read the paper over to me, and told me it was quite right, for he (Young) had been to Mr. Goode's, No. 15, Surrey-street, to see the books, and it was quite right—I gave Young a sovereign, which he passed to the sailor—I parted with it, believing the account which he gave me to be true—he said he had to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to see the books—the paper was left with me—I saw Young two or three times in the course of the week, and he said it was quite right—I have never got my sovereign—the sailor came afterwards, and drew 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more on the same paper—I made inquiry, and caused the prisoner to be apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q</hi>. Previous to the 1st of December, had anybody asked you to advance anybody a sovereign? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—Davis told me the sailor wanted to borrow some money on a paper, and that he had some price<lb/>money to receive—he did not ask me to lend any one a sovereign—I had seen you two or three days before—I did not send Davis to you to say I wished to advance money on the paper—Davis told me you said the sailor did not want to borrow money on the paper, but that you were very much in want of money, and if the sailor would borrow it you would be very glad, as you could have it then—he told me the sailor was in work, and did not want any money—you did not come to me about it before the 1st of December.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Who did you lend the money to? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. I gave it into your hands, and you passed it to the sailor—I first put it on the shop-board—</p>

I never saw him but once, and we were separated for twelve months. When we last met we saw each other a day or two, and he told me he had a certificate of prize-money to receive. I asked him what the money was he was en<lb/>titled to; he said, from 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I saw him a few days afterwards in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060008"/>
               <p>company with Davis, who was present when the sailor produced the certi<lb/>ficate out of his hat, and asked me if I knew any respectable person who he could leave the certificate with, and would lend him a few shillings to maintain himself, till he could get his money. I said I did not, unless my own father would. Davis said, "Well, you can go and ask your father, and I will ask my landlord if he will lend the sailor a sovereign." The sailor accompanied me up to my father's, and I only ask, if it is at all likely that I should be such an ungrateful scoundrel, as to go and ask my father to lend a sovereign on it, if I meant to rob him. I had not the slightest idea the certificate was not good. I had never seen such a thing in my life. I had no object whatever in serving the man, further than considering he was in difficulties, and to advance a trifle if it would help him. As to my saying I searched the books, and paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Mole and Davis well knew that I had not a shilling to bless myself with. I had been from home twelve months. I had been in trouble that twelve months, and it is not likely I could go and pay that money to search the books. I have a witness to prove I never saw the man till that time. I never asked Mole to advance him the money, but Davis came to me and said, "Have you done any thing with that certificate? " I said, "No, my father will not advance the money." He said, "I have asked my landlord, and he made me no reply." I said, "I shall not trouble further about it; " but in the evening the sailor asked me to mind the certificate for him, as he was going out. Next day Davis came and asked me if I had done any thing with it; I said I had not, and could not; he said, "There is a young man in our house to whom I have named it, he says he shall be glad to lend the sailor a sovereign or two, if he would give him interest; " I said if I saw the sailor I would let him know. Davis came to me next day; I said in all probability the sailor had got work, and if so, to let it rest. Next day I saw the sailor, who had been at work down at Shadwell, and I said nothing to him about Davis having offered to lend the money. He went away, and on Saturday Davis came to me again; I told him the sailor had got work. On Sunday, the 1st of December, Davis came to me again, and asked me the same thing; I told him, very likely I should see the sailor that day, and if he chose to lend him money he could. I saw the sailor in the evening, and told him a person in Davis's house would lend him money; he said, "Well, I only earned 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. yesterday, and I will go to him." He asked me to accompany him. I handed the certificate to him, and we went to Davis's house, into a front room on the third floor; Mole was called up. Davis said, "This man wishes you to lend him a small sum of money, and he will lay in your hands a certificate entitling him to prize-money." He asked him if he knew what sum it was; he said he did not, and asked me the same. I said, "I tell you what would be your best plan; it would be, to go down to the office where he says the certificate is payable, and ascertain if it is correct; " he said, "There is no occasion for that, " and immediately laid a sovereign on the shop-board,; whether I touched it I cannot say, but I know I never had any money out of it. I saw Mole frequently afterwards; and so depressed was I in circumstances, that I asked him to purchase a du<lb/>plicate of a brooch of me, which he did; and I believe, on the following day, I asked him to buy the duplicate of a gown-piece. I do not deny accom<lb/>panying the sailor to his house, but I did not make any false representation about the certificate.</p>

                  </hi>I am foreman to John Louch and his brother, rope<lb/>makers. They have a rope-walk which runs from Love-lane to King David-lane, Shadwell. On the 21st of December I saw the prisoner and the policeman at the side of my masters' premises, at the time he was exa<lb/>mining the bundle—I afterwards examined it at the station-house, and found it corresponded with a haul of yarn on our premises, which was cut—we have seven other pieces similar to this—it is a peculiar quality—it is what we term inferior yarn—there are 218 threads in the haul I found cut, and the same number in that found on the prisoner—I am quite sure it is a portion of that haul—three of the prisoner's brothers were employed on the premises, and she herself bad been occasionally, but had been discharged two or three weeks—she bad no opportunity of taking this while she worked there—she had no communication with the part where it is kept, neither do I think she could have cut this herself—it would be very difficult for a female to cut—I think some one else must have cut it, and given it to her to carry—she was stopped close to the premises, and about fifty or sixty yards from where this yarn was kept—a person might stand inside, and give it to her outside to take away—our people leave off work at five o'clock at this time of year—she was stopped at half-past eight o'clock.</p>

About eight o'clock at night, on Friday, the 20th of December, I was looking through my window—I saw two men, and a young man in a butcher's frock, who had an umbrella, looking at it, un<lb/>der the gas, about two doors from the prosecutor's shop—the two men went back to Mr. Green's shop, and the butcher went on to White lion-street, with the umbrella up—a man came out of Mr. Green's shop, who disturbed the two men, who were lurking about the door—I went out and told Mrs. Green—on Sunday the prosecutor sent for me, and said he had lost an umbrella—I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person I saw with, the umbrella.</p>

On the 30th of De<lb/>cember, at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to a house in Church-street, St. Giles's, with Scotchmen and Fink, two other, police<lb/>men—we found the outer door open, and three females in the passage—we passed them—one of them cried out, <hi rend="italic">"Bill, Bill"</hi>, look out, <hi rend="italic">Bill"</hi>—there was a door on the right hand side of the passage leading into a room which was fastened—persons inside that room could hear that call of "Look out, <hi rend="italic">Bill"</hi>—we broke open the door, and found it had been fast<lb/>ened by a bed-screw in the floor, about eighteen inches from the bottom of the door, and a piece of wood put up against it—on entering the room I found the three prisoners there, standing by a large clear fire—Holliday had a blue coat on—I believe the others were in their shirt sleeves—there was a table behind them—I handcuffed Holliday—he was the first that was secured—the other constables had a scuffle with the other two men, and during that time I saw something thrown towards the fire—it came from that part of the room where they were scuffling—it fell on tie hob—I took ii up, and found it was a counterfeit sixpence, so hot that I could not hold it, and it had a <hi rend="italic">get</hi>attached to it—I produce it—I then proceeded to search the room—I found on the hob, by the side of the fire-place, this pipkin, with a quantity of hot metal in it, in a liquid state—the pipkin was very hot—the metal is in it now—I found two pieces of metal spoon, and a pair of scissors on the mantel-piece, and under the ashes this piece of metal—I saw Scotchmer take an iron spoon off the fire with fluid metal in it—the prisoners were secured, and taken away—Holliday's hands were white—I did not notice the others' hands.</p>

                  </hi>I am a labourer. I have been committed by the Magistrate, and come from gaol to give evidence-el know the prisoners—Morgan is a baker, and I believe Smith is a biscuit baker—in November last I was in the habit of seeing the prisoners at the Hampshire Hog pub<lb/>lic-house, in Rosemary-lane, which is about half a mile from the prosecu<lb/>tor's premises—I was there on Friday morning, the 22nd of November, and saw both the prisoners there—Morgan asked me if I would go and ask Mr. Smith, a potato-merchant and corn-chandler in the neighbourhood, if he would buy two sacks of middling—I agreed to do so, and went—the prisoners went there with me—they went on down North-street, and I went into Mr. Smith's by myself—I came out, and told them Mr. Smith wanted to see a sample—Morgan said he would give me a sample, and he went home and got one—Smith stopped with me till he came back—I took the sample into Mr. Smith's shop, leaving the prisoners—I bargained with Mr. Smith for it for 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a sack, if it was like the sample—next night (Saturday) I saw them again at the Hampshire Hog public-house, about six o'clock—I think Morgan told me he was going to get two sacks of middlings, and if I would go with him and push behind the truck, he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Smith was present, and heard what was said—I agreed to do it—we were standing outside the Hampshire Hog public-house door at the time—Smith left us, and Morgan and I went to get a truck at Mr. Hurst's, in Cannon-street-road, or New-road—I stopped across the road, while Morgan went into Hurst's for the truck—he brought it, and I wheeled it a little way down into the highway, and Morgan took it the rest of the way, down to Mr. Hullah's place, at Wapping—Morgan said the men bad not done work, and we had to wait at a public-house for the best part of an hour, leaving the truck outside the public-house door—it was Mr. Hall's public-house, I believe, not exactly opposite the prosecutor's pre<lb/>mises, but not far from them, in the same road—while I was in the public<lb/>house Morgan went out, and said he was going out to see if the men had done work, that he might get the sacks—he went out two or three times—the last time he cane back, and said, "It is all right, we can get them now, come along"—he wheeled the truck over, and I followed him—the gates were shut—they were opened by Smith, I believe, from the inside.</p>

               <p>as I saw him come out after the two sacks were brought out, and shut the door—when the gates were open Morgan went in—I did not see Smith before Morgan went in—the door opened, and Morgan immediately went in—he was not five minutes getting the two sacks—he carried one out at a time—when he brought out the first sack I held the truck while he put it in—he then went back, and brought another, which we put into the truck, and then Smith came out and shut the door—he did not come out till both the sacks were put into the truck—they were taken to Mr. Smith's, in Back Church-lane—Morgan held the handle of the truck, and I helped to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi>it—Smith ran on first, and I saw no more of him till ten o'clock that night—when we got to Mr. Smith the baker's, we did not find him at home—his sister was managing his business—Morgan and I both went into the shop—I went in first—we told Mr. Smith's sister we had brought two sacks of middlings—she said she knew nothing about them, and could not have them left there, because her brother had not said any thing about them—we took them away to Morgan's house in Thomas<lb/>street, Commercial-road, which was about a quarter of a mile off—they were put into a cupboard there—they were not taken away from there till Monday morning—I went to Mr. Smith's again about ten o'clock—Morgan and Smith accompanied me, but they did not go in—I found Mr. Smith at home—something passed between me and him—I afterwards saw the two prisoners, and told them that Mr. Smith said it was too late to have them in that night, but to bring them as soon as I liked on Monday morn<lb/>ing, and he would have them—it was arranged that I should take them on the Monday—when 1 first saw Mr. Smith on the Friday, he said he should like a sample of them, so that he could go and see if he could find a shop to put them away at—I told Morgan and Smith that—he also asked if I knew where they came from, and told me I need not be afraid of his saying any<lb/>thing—on Monday morning, before I was up, Morgan came to my father's house, and I went with him up to Mr. Smith's—he was at home—Morgan went in with me that morning, and Mr. Smith said he would rather have nothing to do with them, that he had been offered a good price, but not so much as we said they were worth—I said they came from down Wrapping—Morgan was present—on the same morning I went with Morgan to try to sell them—he went home, got a sample, and took it to a person in a street opposite the George, Commercial-road—he is a bread baker—Morgan went into the shop first with the sample—I stopped outside, a long way from the shop—Morgan came to me again, and said the man had offered him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the two sacks, and he would go back and tell him he should have them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he went back, and told me he was to have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—Morgan then went and borrowed a truck at the first turning in the Commercial-road, past the turnpike—I went with him to the turnpike, and waited there while he went—he did not say where he was going to get it—I saw him go down the first turning past the Commercial-road turnpike—he returned with the truck in about five minutes—we then went to Morgan's house and got the two sacks of flour—he carried one out, and I the other—I put them into the truck, and we took them to Davis—I went with him—the truck was backed up close to the door, and the sacks shot up on the pavement, and Mor<lb/>gan and the master of the shop pulled them in—Davis gave two sovereigns a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paper of coppers, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Morgan—I believe one of the sacks had a back ring on it, but I did not notice it parti<lb/>

                  </hi>I am gardener to the Rev. Frederick Sandys Wall, of East Acton. On the morning of the 31st of December I saw the prisoner with a person named Thomas Bailey loitering about in East Acton, near Mr. Young's—five geese, the property of Mr. Lovell, were feeding on the green—they drove them about—I went out and followed them—they drove them more than three hundred yards, and drove them down a lane, and the prisoner kicked one of the geese as he drove them down the lane—I told Lovell, and went through my master's premises, as a near way, to stop them, but when I came I found Lovell had got them both—I took one to the officer, but Bailey has since escaped, I understand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was never near the geese, only one flew at me, and I kicked it. I went down the lane to see if it was a thoroughfare. I am innocent of driving them—they were not ten yards from the top of the lane.</p>

A distraint was put into my house for rent, in September last, by Mr. Gingell—the prisoner was the man in possession—after the first day or two I found him at my drawers, rifling them—I thought it was an act he had not any business to do, and I remonstrated with him—I did not miss any thing at that time—I afterwards paid the rent, and after I paid it, I missed a variety of books, two gold rings, a silk pocket-handkerchief, and other things—I applied for a warrant, and went to search the prisoner's lodg<lb/>ing, and found some books and other things at Mr. Gingell's house in Barrett's-court—the prisoner resided with him, but had absconded—I went a second time—he was not there—I found a variety of articles, which are here—Roche and Pitt went with me.</p>

There was a confusion about taking some part of the premises off the hands of Mr. Hunt—I was over the house about two months ago, and missed some marble chimney-pieces from the room where they bad been, but they were not removed from the premises—they had been in the front and back rooms on the first floor, which rooms were in the possession of Mr. Hunt, who kept billiard-tables there, and I found the marble in the back room on the third floor, where it had been stowed away—when fixed they were worth six or seven guineas—I afterwards saw a part of them in the possession of a man named Prestage, in Husband-street, I think, on the 4th of December—in order to increase the confusion going on at the house in Piccadilly, a great many people attended there to buy greens and turnips—the ground-floor is partly occupied by Mr. Newson, and the persons who went up had to pass through his shop.</p>

                  </hi>I am a police-constable of the Great Western Rail<lb/>way. On the 26th of December, I went to the building which Mr. Col<lb/>lard has mentioned, and saw the handkerchief rolled up and thrust in between the wood work of the roof—it was so fixed in that it could not fall—I fixed myself in the adjoining water-closet—several persons came to the urinal while I was there, and after every one I went out to see that the handkerchief was safe—at last I heard some footsteps, and saw it was the prisoner—he went in the place, and returned again—he did not stop—I saw him come out—he was going into the second class booking-office, but as soon as I came out of the water-closet he went in—I went and saw the handkerchief was gone—I then went to the door of the water-closet, I knocked, and called "Mayhew"—he said what did I want with him—I said I wanted to speak to him, and asked him to open the door—he refused, and I looked in at the top where there had been glass, but it was broken—I saw he was stooping down, busy with his hands in his trowsers—I thrust open the door, and told him a handkerchief was missing, and I believed he had it—I asked him for it—he denied any knowledge of it, and said he knew nothing about it—I told him I knew he had it in his trowsers, and wished him to give it out—he would not—a scuffle ensued between us, and in the scuffle I got it from inside his trowsers—he said, "D——it, how is this? "—his trowsers were not undone.</p>

Since the commencement of it—I was before that in the metropolitan polite—I was two or three years in the service of Mr. Gill, at Galway, in Ireland—when I desired the prisoner to open the door of the water-closet he was not doing it, and I considered that a refusal—I waited about a minute and a half—he had the handkerchief in his trowsers, where it could not be seen—I put my hand in and got it—I will not swear it was not in his pocket—his trowsers open in front—I think it was about half-past six o'clock in the evening—some of the men go to tea at four o'clock, and some later.</p>

I was out on the 24th of December with my master's cart, which contained the articles stated, delivering goods at Mr. Walter's, in Fore-street, about six o'clock in the evening"—I was not absent ten minutes, and when. I was returning to my cart I heard the pully rattle—I turned my head, and saw the prisoner going away with this basket and bottle on his shoulder—I ran to him, and asked what he was going to do with it—he said a man gave it him to carry—another man came up, and took him, and he threw the basket off his shoulder, broke the bottle, and spilt all the vinegar.</p>

                  </hi>I am bailiff to Jane Gammon, a farmer at Staines—she had a turkey that used to roost on some pales—it was very large, and in good condition—I missed it on the morning of the 1st of January—I then traced foot-marks to the prisoner's house, he lives adjoining our premises—he is a sawyer—he had seen the turkey every day, I dare say—the feet-marks had nails and tips on the heels, and a plate on the toes—I traced them to the prisoner's house, from the place where the turkey used to roost—when the prisoner was taken I saw his shoes, and they tallied exactly with the marks on the road—he said he had no such thing as a turkey in the house—I found several parts of turkey meat cut up, and it had been skinned, not plucked—all the feathers were gone but one—I could not swear to the marks of his shoes, but they were very much like them.</p>

"—he said, "About two months"—I said, "Did any body know you had such a thing in your pos<lb/>session? "—he said no, but he had pawned it several times—I said, "Where? "—he said he did not know, but if I thought it was not his I might go and find an owner, for he knew I could not find one—I asked who that was he was with—he said he did not know, he had merely met him there—I said, "I saw you speak to him"—he said he did not, he knew nothing of him—I took them both to the station-house—Mr. Scanes had given information at the station-house of his robbery.</p>

                  </hi>I am a surgeon, and live at Hounslow. On Sunday morning, the 21st of December, I saw Savage at two o'clock—I examined his right cheek, and found a triangular wound just over the cheek-bone—I did not probe it—I examined it care<lb/>fully—it appeared to have been inflicted by a sharp instrument—the knife produced is very capable of inflicting such a wound—it appeared to go down to the bone—the triangular shape must have been caused by the knife striking against the bone, and glancing—there was no con<lb/>tusion.</p>

On Friday morn<lb/>ing, the 13th of December, about seven o'clock, I was in the road, and saw a grey pony staggering about the road bleeding, but being dusk I could not see where the blood came from—it staggered across the road, his hind legs fell under him, he then fell down, and soon died—I examined it, and saw it had been stuck at the bottom of the throat, and to the chest I consider—that was all the marks I observed at that time—I returned to the nursery about my business, and in about half<lb/> an-hour I saw two men approach the horse—I was in sight of where it lay—one was a tall man in a fustian jacket—the other a shortish man wore a darkish coloured coat—I cannot say whether it was black or blue—I cannot swear to the men—I have no doubt the prisoner was one of them, but would not undertake to swear it positively—they were trying to push the blood about to hide it, by placing mud on the blood that was about the road—I went up to the tall man in the fustian jacket, and asked if it was his horse—he said, "Yes"—I asked how he came to stick the poor thing, and go away and leave it in that manner—he said, "It was no use after"—that was all he said—I went to the other roan who stood by the horse, and asked him if any thing was the matter with the horse—they were both together, and in hearing—all he said was, "I don't know, master"—I went away directly to the nursery—I came back in about two minutes, and they were gone—the horse laid in the road, and was fetched away in the after<lb/>noon by somebody, but I never saw it after—it was a grey pony, and a gelding—the last time I saw it was in the road, between Isleworth and Brentford, by the side of the road, just at the corner of the Duke of Nor<lb/>thumberland's wall—it was not above three or four yards from the ditch—</p>

                  </hi>I am an upholsterer, and live in my father's house, No. 20, Old-street-road, Shoreditch. On the 26th of December I missed a coat, which I bad seen safe the evening before when I undressed my<lb/>self, I took it off, and placed it on a chair—there was a silk handkerchief in the pocket—I missed it at ten o'clock next morning—I saw the coat the same morning on the prisoner's back, in Church-street, Shoreditch—I first saw him coming towards Shoreditch—he turned off, to go to a public<lb/>house—I was about fourteen doors from him, then only just across the road—I did not know him before—I saw another person, whom I was watch<lb/>ing, run against him, and make a slight halt, and then the prisoner turned off to go into the public-house—I immediately stepped off the curb to follow him into the public-house—the person who made the halt then gave a whistle, on hearing which the prisoner immediately left the public<lb/>house—he had only just stepped in—he came out and walked fast to the corner of the first turning—I was immediately opposite him—he went from me—he walked eight or nine yards—I immediately followed him, and when he came to the corner of the street he began to run—he ran about three paces, when I caught him by the collar, and took him to the opposite corner of the street—he then turned round and looked me in the face, and I told him he bad my coat on—he said he had not, for he had just bought it—I told him if he had bought it, to come with me to Shoreditch to a policeman, and we would see about it—he then scuffled and tried to get away, and caught hold of the post—I pulled him away—he then caught hold of the railing of a window—then two or three young persons came up, and one of them told the prisoner to <hi rend="italic">dowse</hi>me; on which he tried to put his leg between mine, and throw me down, but did not succeed—during the scuffle there was a whistle, and imme<lb/>diately about twenty persons came to his assistance from a public-house and a coffee-shop close by—on seeing them I became alarmed, and tried to pull him into Mr. Golding's shop, one door of which was open and the other closed—we both fell into the shop together, and I, falling on the pri<lb/>soner, made his nose bleed—I immediately got up with him under me, endeavouring to pull him into the shop, his legs being outside, and the persons outside pulled him by the legs, and pulled him outside, me and all—when we got outside he said he would go with me to the person he bought the coat of—I said be should not go any farther till I had the coat off his back—he tried to take it off, but one or two round him persuaded him not—I said I would go no farther till he took it off—he then took it off, and I took it from him—he then said he would go with me to the person he bought it of—on getting possession of the coat, I was in the act of putting it across my arm, when he ran away—a path was imme<lb/>diately cleared by those around him for him to effect his escape—I was immediately knocked down, that I should not run after him—while down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060072"/>
               <p>I felt somebody pulling at the coat—I got up and endeavoured to run after him again—I did not run far before I was tripped up—I got up again, and ran a little way—my hat was knocked off, und a silk handker<lb/>chief and gloves in it—I took up my hat and handkerchief, but not my gloves—I was completely hemmed in by a round ring, and could not get out—I darted at last through their legs—I was again tripped up, and by that time I lost sight of the prisoner—I ran in the direction he went, and saw him running up what, I believe, was Nichol-street—I ran after him, and heard footsteps behind me again—I turned round, and saw a young man in a smock-frock, and a person behind him told him to trip me up—I kept before him, and overtook the prisoner turning into a court—in the middle of the court a gentleman, coming in the opposite direction, caught him by the collar—I came up and told the gentleman to hold him fast—he said he would—that it was all right, he was a headborough—the prisoner said he was not the person that was wanted—I am sure he is the person I took the coat from—his nose was bleeding at the time—the headborough tried to get him into Shoreditch, but he laid down and would not come—one young man in the court told me I had got my coat, what did I want more—I told the headborough to hold him while I ran for a policeman—when I returned within a hundred yards of where I left him, I saw him running again, having got away from the headborough—I, the policeman, and others pursued him—he turned up a street, and was ultimately secured by the policeman—we had lost sight of him in the pursuit—I saw him next at the station-house in about half-an-hour—I am sure he is the person from whom I took the coat—the policeman has the coat.</p>

                  </hi>I am shopman to Mr. John Crowther Drew, of Bur<lb/>lington Arcade. On the 28th of December, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop accompanied by a young man, who asked for some silk handkerchiefs—I showed them some—I had reason to suspect the young man from his coming to the shop before—he held up one of the handkerchiefs, and I observed him move some handker<lb/>chiefs towards the prisoner, and she put them under her clothes—my em<lb/>ployer then came into the shop, and I requested him to c✗l an officer—the prisoner and the young man were given in charge, but the man got away—I never lost sight of the prisoner—she tried to get away, but I pre<lb/>vented her, and she went back to the counter, dropped the handkerchiefs, and said, "There are the handkerchiefs"—I had not then said any thing about handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi>I am a grocer, and live in Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner was in my service—in consequence of some circumstances I marked several penny-pieces, and some farthings which were in packets, and placed the packets where they were before, on a shelf behind the counter—on the 23rd of December I missed some of them, as I had done before, but I let things remain as they were till the 28th of December, when I called the prisoner up stairs and told him I had an unpleasant business to per<lb/>form, that I had been missing some coppers from the shop, and if he was an honest man he would have no objection to let me see what was in his box—he said, "Certainly not"—I said, "Open the box"—I believe it</p>

               <p>was not locked—he did so, and pulled out several articles of wearing appa<lb/>rel—at last, as he took out one waistcoat, it knocked heavy against the side of the box—I took hold of it, and took out of the pocket of it 48 farthings, wrapped in this blue paper, which has my private mark on it—I had lost a great many such blue packets, containing 48 farthings, and two of the farthings in it have the private mark which I put on them—I can swear these two are part of mine—I asked the prisoner how they came there—he said he knew not—he knew nothing about them—I said, "I can swear to the paper and to two of the farthings inside"—he said he took the waistcoat down stairs a day or two before Christmas-day to ask the servant to mend it for him, and he supposed some one had put the farthings into his pocket—I said he knew the servant had no access to the coppers, and I did not see how she could do it—I then told him I missed some 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers of cop<lb/>pers—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "Be cautious what you say, I know more than you are are aware of—where are my half<lb/>pence? "—he said he knew nothing about them—I said, "I don't believe that, because several packets are gone"—he said, "There is only one gone"—I said, "Yes, I know more are gone"—he then said, "There were but two"—I said again, "Where are my halfpence? "—he said, "There were not three, for one was not full"—I said, "Where are they? "—he said, "I spent them on Christmas-day to buy things for use"—(I had before that spoken to a policeman, who was opposite in the road)—I said it was my duty to put him in charge—he said he would forfeit his wages if I would not put him in charge—I said I considered it my duty so to do, and by a signal the officer came in and took him.</p>

On the 30th of December I was in the yard, and saw a man in the shop, but as I knew my sister was in the parlour, I did not interfere—I then saw the prisoner walking out with a basket of biscuit and two loaves, which were my father's—I followed, and as I got outside I saw two young men with the prisoner—they covered the basket over with a dirty cloth, and the prisoner put it down—I took hold of him, and he said, "What do you lay hold of me for? "—I told him I knew what for, and I took him to the shop—I called my sister to take care of the biscuits—I am sure he is the person who took them out.</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of John Wells, a pawnbroker, in London, and live in Upper Phillimore-place, Kensington. On Monday, the 23rd of December, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I was with my husband in Piccadilly—I had received a cheque from him, and I had in exchange for it at the bankers a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.in gold, and eight shillings and two sixpences in silver—the gold consisted of so<lb/>vereigns and half-sovereigns—I placed the note with the gold in my purse in the front part of my pocket, which hung by my side—it forms a part of my under petticoat—there is a pocket-hole in the pocket, and also in my top petticoat, which is over the petticoat of which the pocket forms a part—I had the same gown on as I have now—it has a pocket-hole in it near the opening of my petticoat, but rather more forward—I had a large shawl on—it was a dirty day—I got into Hardwick's omnibus—I went with my husband from the bankers to Piccadilly—the omnibus overtook us—we required seats, and there was only one—I got in, and I was told my hus<lb/>band might be accommodated if he would walk on to Bond-street—when I got in the two prisoners were there—there was a vacancy between them, which I occupied—I rode on to Bond-street—two persons there got out, and my husband was taken up at the White Horse Cellar, and also a lad—my husband made an observation, and said, "Am I to sit here? " which was a place between the prisoner on my left hand and the door—the prisoner Jones said, "There is no other place"—Thompson was on my right, and Jones on my left—on my husband getting in, the conductor asked if any one wished to get out before we got to Kensington—no answer was gives—the conductor got on the box, and the omnibus went on—between Hyde<lb/>park-corner and Knightsbridge I felt my pocket move—I looked at the pri<lb/>soner on my right hand, putting my hand down towards my pocket—(as I came from the bankers I took my dress and my pocket, which had my purse in, in my hand, and when I got in the omnibus I took up the other side of my dress, but still having my gown and purse in my hand—I am quite positive I had my purse when I got in)—when I looked round st✗d fastly at Thompson, he was looking straight forwards—I thought from his appearance I might be mistaken, and that the jolting of the omnibus moved him against me—we went on to Sloane-street, and there Jones called to the conductor to get out, and at the same time Thompson got up, and went out—I thought that he had picked my pocket—I felt in my pocket, and my purse was gone—no one could have got at my pocket but the person on my right—I looked which way Thompson went—I said to my husband, "My pocket is picked"—he said, "Be sure"—I said, "I am robbed my purse is gone"—we stopped the omnibus, jumped out instantly, and went in the direction I had seen Thompson go, which was towards the corner of Charles-street, which runs towards Belgrave-square—my husband followed immediately, and a policeman came up to me—I told him what had hap<lb/>pened—he went the way I told him—he returned, and could see nobody—I was looking about there for a very short time—I walked towards London with my husband, and determined on going to the bankers-after walking some distance we crossed the road to make further inquiries, and I had scarcely set my foot on the pavement, before I saw Thompson getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>opposite the Fox and Bull public-house—the horse's head was to<lb/>wards London—I said, "There is the man that robbed me, " and we stop<lb/>ped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my husband went to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>door, and both the prisoners</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060088"/>
               <p>were seated in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—my husband said, "You got out of the omnibus just now"—Thompson replied, "What if I did? " in a hesitating and con<lb/>fused voice—my husband said, "You have robbed my wife"—Jones opened the other <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>door, ran out, and my husband after him, crying "Stop thief "—Thompson came out, and I followed him, crying "Stop thief"—he ran into Lowndes-square—I ran, and never lost sight of him till we got to the farther end of the square, and he was taken I think in not more than a minute—on seeing him I had no doubt of him—I saw Jones in custody of a policeman at the corner of Sloane-street, and I had no doubt of him.</p>

I was in my master's counting-house on the afternoon of the 23rd of December, and I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I looked out and saw Jones running up the street, followed by Mr. Wells—I ran and took him—he had crossed Sloane-street, and got into Ann's-place—he had a Macintosh cloak hanging on his arm—I brought him back, and he was given in charge.</p>

                  </hi>I live with Mr. Peter Brandon, a surgeon, in Tavistock-square. On the evening of the 31st of December, the prisoner came to the house, and said he came for a lady's bonnet from Mrs. Allen, of Regent-street—I told him no such article had been ordered—he desired me to inquire, and having received orders not to leave the street-door, I called another servant and she went to inquire—he asked me after she was gone to go up stairs too, but I would not quit the door—he then snatched the coat off the hall-stand and ran off—I pursued him directly, and never lost sight of him—I gave him into custody—this is the coat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is my master's.</p>

Yes—I worked for the prisoner till within a day or so, for about three years, at jobs, mending shoes and boots—he lived in Pitt-street, Blackfriars-road—I cannot say when he left there—I sent the work home which I did last week, to St. Ann's-place, St George's—he began to live there about a month ago, I suppose—I do not know where he lived before, as I had not done basinets for him for the last six months, except last week—I was walking in High-street, Borough, on business, on the 10th of December, and met Boddy at the corner of King<lb/>street—he walked with me—we met a man, not quite so tall as Boddy, I think, but I cannot particularly say, as I did not measure him—he was a dark man, and had black whiskers—he called Boddy by the name of Boddy, as if he knew him well—he said, "I have got some goods will suit you"—I walked on, and left the two together—I heard no more said—about three years ago the prisoner lodged somewhere in the New-cut, I think—it was a private house—I cannot recollect where he lived when I did business with him before the last week—I have not worked for him since he has kept a public-house—I made him a pair of shoes or boots about two years or two years and a half ago—I cannot recollect where I sent them home, but I</p>

                  </hi>M.D. I live in Curzon-street, May Fair. On the 3rd of December, I read this advertisement in the "Times" newspaper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—in consequence of which I proceeded to the stables in Welbeck-street, and saw a stable boy—I then saw a man named Jem, who was dressed as a groom in mourning, all in black—I asked to look at the horse which was advertised in the "Times" of that morning, the bay gelding by Waterloo—he showed me the horse—I asked its age—he said he was six years old, that it was the property of Mrs. Brown, the widow of the late J. Brown, who resided at the Crescent, Leamington—the prisoner was not present at this conversation—I saw him very shortly after—I asked the price of the horse, and Jem pointed to Mowatt, who was close at hand, and said, "This is the man who is commissioned to sell the horse"—Mowatt said a gentleman had offered him 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it that morning, but that was too low a price, he could not let it go at that—that forty gui<lb/>neas was the lowest he would take for it—that he had received a note from the gentleman who offered the 35/. the day before, that morning, to say he would give 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he bad a note in his hand, which he said the gentleman had written to him, and he showed it to me—I looked at it, but did not read it—he said be could not let it go for 40<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, but if I liked to give forty guineas I might have it—I looked at the horse and said, "I do not altogether dislike the look of the horse, but I must try him, " and asked to see him out—I saw him out, and then asked leave to ride him to try him—Mowatt said I could not ride him that day, nor could he keep him for me till the next day without my giving a deposit—I said, "What deposit did he want, and that I had not got much money about me"—I left 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and he gave me a receipt for it, which I read—it was a memorandum—I gave it back to Mowatt the following morning—it was "Received of Dr. Brown, the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, a deposit for the horse to be kept for trial to-morrow"—I believe those were the words—I went next day at eleven o'clock to try the horse by agreement—I found <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>and the prisoner there—I sent my saddle and bridle there, and in a few minutes the horse was saddled, and I got on—before that, Mowatt gave me back the 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, and I gave him back the memorandum—he said, "Are you prepared to deposit the price of the horse? "—I said, "Yes, and you must give me a receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060103"/>
               <p>for it"—I gave him four 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and two sovereigns, and he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note he returned to me was the same I had given him—(<hi rend="italic">receipt read</hi>)—"London, 4th of December, 1839. Re<lb/>ceived of Dr. C. B Brown, the sum of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a bay gelding, warranted sound, free from vice, and a good hunter; if not approved of in two days to be returned"—(<hi rend="italic">signed by the prisoner</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did any thing further pass than what he said that you were to deposit that sum before you could try the horse? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>was pre<lb/>sent, and he said it was the favourite horse of his old master, J. Brown, of Leamington, and that Mowatt had brought it into harness, and if it could get into good hands, he had no objection to part with it at the low price of forty guineas, and he hoped it would have a good situation—I said, "Yes it would, it was going into the neighbourhood of Northampton"—he said, "Oh, very well, it would be near its own place of living"—I had given him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the day before, as he had said in the prisoner's presence, that he was going back to his mistress that night, and as he was sure I should like the horse and would purchase it, he hoped I would give him some money—upon which I gave him the 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi>, and he said he would give it back if I did not buy the horse, and he said to Mowatt, "Of course you will give Dr. Brown the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back if he does not purchase the horse"—Mowatt said, "Of course I will"—I got on the horse, and shortly after I began to ride, I found he pulled so hard I could hardly hold him—I took him into Hyde-Park, and the first thing he did was to kick violently—I kept him out better than an hour—I then returned to the stable and saw <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I do not recollect seeing Mowatt at that time—in consequence of what <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>said I was induced to go there again the same day, at two o'clock, to try the horse again—I went, and again tried it—I found it more vicious than before, and more difficult to ride—after having shown him to one or two people, I returned to the stable a little before four o'clock, and found <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>and Mowatt there—Mowatt was showing a horse to a gentle<lb/>man—I said, "The horse won't suit me at all; it does not answer the description; it is much older than you say it is, and I won't have any thing more to do with it"—"Oh, " said Mowatt, "I don't wish you to keep the horse if you don't like it; I will give you back your money"—I said, "Very well then, give it to me"—he said, " I have not got it here; it is at my banker's"—I said, "Give me back my money, and I will give you the shilling for the stamp receipt"—he said, "Never mind the stamp"—he said the money was at his banker's, and he would go and get it—I said, "Very well, I will go with you"—upon this <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>came up, and begged I would write a note to Mrs. Brown to say I had tried the horse, or she would think Mowatt had not taken any pains to sell it—I told him I had no paper—he took me up a small staircase to where he got paper, pen, and ink—I wrote a note, which he did not approve of, and at his dictation I wrote another, and gave it to him—I then looked out for Mowatt, but he was gone—I made inquiry of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>about him—I never saw him again for some time—he never came to my house at all—I went to the stable the first thing on the morning of the 5th—I only found a stable-man there—neither <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, Mowatt, nor the horse—on the 11th I saw another advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, in consequence of which I proceeded with Hooker the officer to a stable in Thomas-street, Brook-street, Gros<lb/>venor-square, and saw Mowatt come out—he did not see me at first—I got behind a cart—directly he saw me, he turned into the stable he came</p>

               <p>out of, and slammed the door—the officer came up—he was obliged to force the door, and took him in the loft—Mowatt said to me, "You have got the receipt."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you at any time give the prisoner your address? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes, the first day, on a card—I am sure of that—the first time I rode the horse in the Park and I tried it in the road—I rode it to the house of a roan named Holliday, a dealer in horses, and another man, named Webb, a dealer in horses—they told me the horse was much older than I had been told—<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>and Mowatt both said it was six years old—if I had looked in its mouth I could satisfy myself of that, which I did—I took it on the word of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>as to the age, without exami<lb/>nation—it was in the last ride I went to the two horse-dealers—I have not bought a horse of either of them since—my brother has bought one—I was looking out a horse for him, and he came to town and bought one—I did not buy it of either of those persons, but of a man in the Edgeware-road.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. When you took this horse, did you buy it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Did you expect to have that very identical money back again? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. The same as I expected, and did receive the very 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I expected he would not part with the notes, just the same as if I had given him a cheque I should expect he would not have received it—there was no agreement that he should return to me the very notes and sovereigns—I should know my marks on those notes—I do not know their numbers—neither of the notes were found by the officer—I should have taken other money, if he had given me forty guineas at the banker's—I would have taken any money—if the horse had suited me I should not have asked for any money back—I am sure the horse was not of the age they said, from my own observation, but I did not look at it till after I took it out, not in the mouth—I took the age on <hi rend="italic">Jem's</hi>word.</p>

                  </hi>I am the wife of Robert Lloyd, and live in Rose-street, Long-acre. On the 1st of January I met the prisoner in Seven-dials, and we had two quarterns of rum together—I thought my husband would be angry with me for staying out, and find out that I had been drinking, and I took the prisoner home to pacify him—when we got there my hus<lb/>band was not at home—I said I would go to bed, and told the prisoner to make my boy's bed, which she did, and went away, bidding me good night—I had two shirts in my room, one was ironed, and hanging on my line—when my boy came in I missed that shirt and another—I got up, and went, in the middle of the night, to the prisoner's lodging, in Little Short's<lb/>gardens—I found her there, and she gave the shirts to the policeman—they are the property of my nephew, Edward Webb—I had not given her permission to make use of them.</p>

I was not the worse for liquor, but I took her home to pacify my husband, as I knew he could tell, if I drank the least—we had two quarterns of rum, but there were three persons to drink it—I did not suggest that the prisoner might take the shirts to pawn—it is not likely I would give my nephew's shirts to pawn, when I had other things—I had not borrowed any thing of her—I had 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when I met her—she put 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one time, and I 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the next time we paid 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—my husband did not come home till after I had been to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>I keep the King's Arms public-house, Kent<lb/>street, in the Borough. On the 25th of December the prisoner came to my house between eight and nine o'clock—there was another woman in the house, but I do not know her name—the prisoner was quarrelling with a man named Reuben Walker, about a quarter of an hour after she came in—I went into the tap-room, and desired her to be peaceable, or I would put her out of the house—I put her back from Walker for a few minutes—I had only put her back to another part of the tap-room—I re<lb/>turned to the bar—she began quarrelling again with the same person—I went into the tap-room, and desired her to be quiet—she would not—she was quarrelling and abusing the people—I said I would not have anybody in the place interrupted, and told her to be quiet—she was rather abusive</p>

               <p>then—I did not particularly hear what she was saying—I then put her out of the house—I went in behind her, put my arms round her, lifted her off the ground, and carried her out at the door, and when she got out<lb/>side she stabbed me on the arm—I was just that instant letting go of her—I cannot say what she struck me with—I did not see any thing in her hand—I felt a blow, but could not feel that I was cut at the time—when I held my arm down I felt something running very warm down my hand, and saw it was blood—I had not struck her at all before she struck me—when I saw the blood I said, "Stop her, she has cut me, " and gave her in charge of the policeman, who was just coming towards the house on his duty—I do not know whether she said any thing, for I went to a chemist's shop close by—my arm was bleeding very fast—it was cut about an inch in length, just above the wrist—I saw her afterwards at the station-house.</p>

On the 25th of December I went into Kings<lb/>bury's public-house between eight and nine o'clock—the prisoner followed me in—I did not know her before—I was lighting my pipe at the gas over my head, and she threw an old bonnet at it, which caused the pipe to break, and the lighted paper to fall on my head—she began to swear and quarrel—I had done nothing to her—she immediately struck me two or three times—I told her to be quiet and to sit down, or to go out of the house—she would not—the landlord came and caught hold of her, and put her out of the house—immediately after he got into the bar, she re<lb/>turned, and struck me as many as half-a-dozen times—she stood before me, and said she had not had a fair cut at me yet—she stood with her right hand in her bosom—the landlord tame and caught hold of her round the waist—his catching hold of her drew her hand out, and I saw a small penknife open—I could see no handle at all, only the blade—she had it between her thumb and finger—I did not see any more—I did not follow them out of the tap-room—I had not struck her at all, nor held up my arm to strike her, nor did any other person in my presence.</p>

"—she said, "My young mistress's cloak, her dress, her snow-boots, and soled boots, " the story was so straight<lb/>forward, that I let her go, thinking it might be so, it being Christmas night—she said her young mistress was dancing in pumps—I turned my light</p>

               <p>on the articles, and found they were what she had described—I then went on, and went down William-street, and heard the cry of "Police"—I saw Mrs. Soulby crying "Police"—I called an officer, and we got into the house, and found the place ransacked—the door of the servant's bed-room was locked—we broke it open, and there was a candle burning in the fire-place—in searching the prisoner's bed I found this pocket, concealed between the bed and the mattress, it contained the purse, which had been taken out of Mrs. Soulby's bed-room.</p>
