In the Orchard they found   Instruments to mill the Edges of Milled money, and divers other Dyes. The Evidence further declared, that they were seen to coin several times at Hornsey new milled shillings, and King Charles the First Shillings: That his Wife put the Pieces under the Mill whilst they were coined, and that they had seen him coin several false Guinea's of a course sort of Gold, and that each of those Guinea's was worth 20s. as Guinea's go now.

That his Wife did file it, and   she would allow for 21s. of broad money, 32s. of false. That the Brass costs him  l. and the other instrument for milling the money cost 3l. That he had followed this Trade for several years; and that formerly when he coined money he struck it with a Hammer. The Prisoner said that he did never clip nor coin, and that the Mills and the other Instruments were none of his; but he could not prove it, nor give any good account of his life.

Were the virtue of this Water generally known, never a Family in England would be without some of it by them; for washing with it twice or thrice in a week, preserves the Sight, and prevents the settling any humor in the Eyes, proceeding from what cause soever. It is sealed up in Twelve penny, Halfcrown, and Crown Bottles. She hath likewise a very useful Water for either Man or Woman, that keeps the Hair from falling, and makes it grow where it is thin.

She is to be Spoken with every Morning till Ten, and Tuesday and Thursday all the day.</p>
