                  </hi>. I am the wife of Arthur Rayson, the landlord of the Globe, Cross Street, Chelsea—on 13th February I was in the bar and heard the prisoner ask the barmaid for some drink—I did not see what coin she gave, but as soon as she got her change she left all her drink on the counter and went out; that aroused my suspicions, and I went to the till and found a bad half-crown, which was the only one there—I took it out and showed it to the barmaid, and then put it away in a cupboard by itself, and left it there till 18th March, when I saw the prisoner again and recognised her—I took the half-crown out of the cupboard and gave it to a policeman, and at the station I marked it—the gin had been served and the barmaid showed me a florin—I put it between my teeth and found it was soft, and bent it—I then went round to the prisoner by another door, and said to her "You have given my barmaid a bad two-shilling piece, and you also gave her a bad half-crown five weeks ago"—she said "I will speak to my superiors, not to a thing like you"—I then sent for a constable and gave her in custody—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two coins; the one passed on the 13th has my mark on it.</p>

On 13th April about 8.30 p.m. I was with detectives Nichols and Banwell in Clare Market and saw the prisoners together; they went into the Rose and Crown public-house and came out, and Haley handed something to Stevens—a boy came up and Stevens handed him something; the boy ran away and the men returned to the public-house—they all three came out shortly afterwards and went into Clare Market to another public-house and eventually to 37, Colonnade, Russell Square, where they went in and we waited and watched, and about 11.30 a woman gave three knocks at the door, Stevens opened it and I heard something fall which sounded like coin—I ran to the door, caught hold of Stevens' right hand and took from it this packet containing eleven counterfeit shillings wrapped separately in paper—the woman ran away—I told Nichols to seize Stevens' left hand as he had something in it, and I saw Nichols take a coin from his left hand—two other constables came; I left the house in their charge and took Stevens to the station, where I found on him a good florin and shilling and five pence—I went back to the house and found Haley there dressed, and Mary Stevens in charge of two officers—one room leads into another, one is a bedroom and the other a workshop in which I found a quantity of plaster of Paris strewed about—there was no table or furniture of any kind—I found in the bedroom a quantity of white metal, some plaster of Paris, some used, and some not, and some in a basin ready for use, a plumber's ladle, some blocks, a number of broken blocks, and a pane of glass which has since been broken—Mary Stevens and Haley were then taken to the station.</p>

I live at 11, Artillery Lane, Bishopsgate Street—up to Christmas last I was employed as potman at the Two Brewers public-house, of which the prisoner was manager—I left the service three days after Christmas—shortly after I was taken before a Magistrate and committed to this Court for an indecent atsault upon the prisoner's daughter. aged 14—I was tried here on 31st January on that charge, and acquitted—that was about 12 o'clock in the day—about 8 that same evening I went to the Two Brewers with Thomas Ginn and Neale—we went to the private bar—the prisoner was standing behind the bar, and ho served me—a man named Benzing was there, he was not a friend, I knew him by his using the house; he was standing by the counter in a different compartment—I nodded and smiled at him—the prisoner was between me and Benzing—he said "Who are you laughing at?"—I said "I have nothing to cry for"—with that he produced a revolver from behind, pointed it at me and fired, it hit me in the stomach; I ran out, he fired again, that hit me in the buttock—I ran immediately to Dr. Duke's, and he attended to me, and from there I was taken to the London Hospital, where I remained for ten weeks and three days.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They had been living in the house some months—somebody in the street fetched the constable; he came in three or four minutes—the prisoner was in the room and called me to fetch a doctor—I could not tell whether the prisoner was the worse for drink when I let him in—Gow was very excited when she said "He has cut my throat," and so was I—I don't know what was said—she told me to get a cab and take her to the hospital.</p>

About 9.45 a.m. on Easter Monday I was called to the house—I saw the prisoner at the top of the first-floor landing—Gow was in the front room, partly dressed, supported by the last witness; she was smothered in blood—she said "I shall lock him up, he has cut my throat with a razor"—I saw a wound in her throat, and blood—she was taken to the hospital—I took the prisoner into custody and took him to Bow Station—he there produced this razor from his pocket and gave it to me; it was covered with fresh blood—he was under the influence of drink and smelt strongly of spirits.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 24, Bainbridge Street—I was living there with the prisoner down to five or six months ago, he then enlisted as a soldier—on the morning of Easter Monday, a little before 9, he came to my room—we had a quarrel and a desperate row, and some minutes after I found I was bleeding from somewhere I did not know where at the time—I don't remember anything till my landlady came in and put a towel round my neck—I lifted up the window and called out murder—I have not the slightest idea how it happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I dont remember his using any threatening words to me—I do not believe when he came into the room that he had any tention to inflict any injury upon me—I remember putting my hands on a chair and threatening to strike him with it—I don't remember picking up any other weapon and threatening to strike him—I did not pick up one of his razors—he had two or three razors there, and his shaving tackle—I was in a very excited state—I lifted up the chair—I had nothing else in my hand—I did not strike him with the chain</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on Easter Monday the prosecutrix was admitted a little after 10—she was suffering from a wound in her throat, it extended down to the windpipe—it was about three inches in length—she also had a jagged wound on the inner side of the right arm—I formed the opinion that the wounds were not self-inflicted—the woman knew what she was speaking about; she was not intoxicated, she may have been drinking, but she Knew what she was saying. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound in the neck was not in itself very dangerous; it was not deep; it came from left to right—that wound might have been self-inflicted—looking at the wound itself one could not say whether it was self-inflicted or not; the other could not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman of 106, Richmond Road, Dalston—on 16th March, about midnight, I was going home, and in Baker's Row I suddenly found a leg across my legs, and received a severe blow on my mouth, which felled me to the ground, face downwards, cutting my mouth and nose severely and rendering me senseless—Maidment picked me up—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody and missed my watch and chain.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188804230031"/>
               <p>fetch him—he said "You will do just as wells"—I said "What for?"—he said "I mean doing for you"—I said "What for?"—he took off his coat and vest and hit me with his fist on my head, and knocked me down, and when I was rising up two of his friends came in who I did not know; one of them seized me by my collar, and he hit me again and knocked me down in the same way—when I was getting up I saw the prisoner go and get a knife, and he struck me on my ear with it and took about an inch off it—this is sticking plaster on it—the prisoner was very drunk—I took the knife from him, and the landlady and one of his friends took it from me and said I should not have it to take to the police-court—I fell down, losing such a lot of blood, and Mr. O'Leary led me home—I came back with my sister, and when I got in I saw the man behind a ladder In the back yard trying to hide himself behind some sacks—my sister brought him from there—he was standing up, and had a sack right across him—he was behind a ladder with a sack round him—we had a lamp, and saw his feet—I had not struck him at all, or given him any provocation—I knew him, but had never been in his company—I had seen him in the morning—this was the first time I had seen him in the evening—he was not in the public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was Bank-holiday—I had been photographing at Kew, but was not very busy on account of its being bad weather; very likely it drove people into public-houses—I went into three, four, or five public-houses—I stopped a little longer than a minute in each of them, and had something to drink—all I had was four glasses of ale all day—I went home about 8.15 and washed myself—I remained indoors about half an hour, and then walked about a mile and a half with a friend, and came back—I had nothing to drink till I met Mr. O'Leary, and went into the Lamb at 10.60—it was not wet that evening—we stopped in there seven or eight minutes, because the landlady said it was time, and they brought the beer outside and we drank it; they close at 11 o'clock—when I got to 0'Leary's no one but the prisoner and Mr. O'Leary were in the house—Mrs. Kate O'Leary came in just after me—there were no other ladies—I am quite certain I did not begin when I got in by taking off my coat; if Kate O'Leary says I did that is wrong—my mind is quite clear as to what happened on this day—I did not knock him down, nor did I then go to the drawer and take out a knife—I did not say "If any one comes in front of me I will stick him"—if Kate O'Leary says that, it is a wicked lie; she was quite intoxicated at the time, and knows nothing about the affair—she took the knife away from me—I and the prisoner had a scuffle while I had the knife in my hand till I got it from him—we never got on the ground at all—Kate O'Leary did not turn me out of the house and bar the door to prevent my coming in again—I did not return with my brother, and my brother did not hold the prisoner while I beat him—if Kate O'Leary swears that it is a wicked invention—I have never been in any assault matter before—I was summoned for breaking a window when I went to school, and fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; nothing besides that—my real work is stoking at the Brentford Gas Works—I was out of employment on Bank-holiday, and went out with a photographer—I am a native of Brentford—I lived at Greenwich three or four years—I have never been in prison—I saw the prisoner at Kew at 2 o'clock—nothing passed then only that he said good morning</p>

I am the wife of Jeremiah O'Leary, and live at Old Brentford—on 2nd April, Bank Holiday, the prisoner came in about 11.10, my husband, Thomas Fitzpatrick and myself came in ten minutes afterwards—Fitzpatrick took off his coat and hit the prisoner and flung him against the fireplace—then he went to my table-drawer and took out a dinner knife and said, "Anyone who comes before me I will stick him"—I went over to him and said, "You will stick no one here," taking the knife out of his hand—the prisoner was near him—I put the knife into the drawer again—the prisoner and Fitzpatrick had a scuffle, and Fitzpatrick fell down on the stairs on some nails and said "Oh dear, my ear"—the prisoner did not have the knife in his hand at all—Fitzpatrick went out in about a quarter of an hour—he came back and my door was then locked, and he fetched his sister and brother; I would not open the door, and he smashed one of my windows—I opened my door then, because I thought he would smash all the windows—the prisoner was at the back then, he went there before Fitzpatrick came back—they fetched him in and Thomas Fitzpatrick or his brother held my brother while the other one whacked him—I did not say he was not in when my sister and two brothers came and wanted to see him—they took the lamp and found him—Fitzpatrick was not quite sober.</p>

I am in the employ of Stephen Noakes, a cooper, of 12, Queen Street, Tower Hill—I was with Hodge, a fellow-servant, about 2 p.m. on 26th March—we had a barrow with a quantity of empty bottles, value about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which we were going to take to Mr. Welsh, of Thames Street—we went into the Crooked Billet on Tower Hill to have some refreshment, leaving the barrow outside—we were in two or three minutes and when we came out it had gone—Hodge went one way and I another, to look for it—I went to Mr. Wines's premises at Shadwell—knowing him as a buyer of bottles, I considered that a likely place to go to—I spoke to him and he told me to fetch a constable—just as I turned in at one end of the street the three prisoners came in at the other end with the barrow-load, one pulling and the other two shoving it—they</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital Square—on Sunday, 1st April, I was called to the station about 1 a.m., where I saw the prosecutrix; she had an incised wound on the right cheek, extending outwards in a slanting direction—it was three-quarters of an inch in the deepest part, it gaped about three-quarters of an inch—I stitched it up—it could have been caused by some fairly sharp instrument—it might have been caused by an instrument of this description—these are blood-stains on this knife; I have examined it—I cannot say whether they are human or not—the wound is healed now; there will always be a scar, but it will not always be as prominent as it is now—I only saw her on the one occasion; my impression is, there were more than six stitches.</p>

I am a messenger, and live at 36, Moorgate Street—on 27th March, about 2 or 3 o'clock, I was coming by this newspaper-shop when I heard the prosecutor say he had lost his watch—I saw the two prisoners and a lad together—Gibbons was on the left-hand side of the prosecutor; Roberts was standing with his back against the shop window looking on when the prosecutor spoke about his watch—they were looking towards prosecutor, who was looking towards the shop—I went to Mark Lane and fetched two constables, and spoke to them—I saw Roberts begin to run away; I apprehended him, and the other constable got hold of him and took him to Seething Lane—I saw the two prisoners and another man talking together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 13, Rising Hill Street, Islington—on this night I was walking with Mr. Hardy in Bernard Street, when I saw a man rush and take the watch from Mr. Hardy's pocket, the man bent forward—Mr. Hardy went to rush after the thief, and the prisoner tripped him up, and another man came behind and took hold of his feet when he was down, and the prisoner put his hand over Mr. Hardy's mouth—when Mr. Hardy got up he called out "Stop thief," and the detective came, and the prisoner tripped him up when he was going to take him—I saw the prisoner rush towards Mr. Hardy to trip him up the moment the watch was taken.</p>

On this night I was in plain clothes in this street—I heard a shout of "Stop thief," from the direction of Park field Street—I had just turned the top of King Edward Street and saw a man running up towards me—when he got close to me I attempted to stop him, he turned short round and ran down King Edward Street in the direction he had come—I pursued him—I got within 6 yards of him, when the prisoner put out his right foot and tripped me up, sending me head first along the path—I went back and took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutor then came up and said "This is one of them; that is the man that threw me down—the prisoner made no reply—I took him to the station—he made no reply to the charge—another policeman followed the man who had the watch and chain, but lost him in Chapel Street in a crowd of people.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, of 85, George Street—prior to October, 1885, I occupied a flat consisting of six rooms, at 4, Museum Chambers, which I wanted to dispose of with the furniture—on 14th October the prisoner called on me there about taking the rooms furnished, and a valuer was called in—he said he was in a good way of business in theatrical printing—I pointed out a few trifling articles which I would not sell, which were not put in the inventory—I saw him again the next morning, and 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was agreed upon as the price at which the goods should be sold—I wrote out these two papers <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he signed one, and I the other. (<hi rend="italic">Agreeing to buy the furniture for</hi> 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid down, and the rest by monthly instalments in advance</hi>). He also gave me the acceptance—his brother Mr. Cannot was with him and read both papers, and suggested a discount of 71/2 for cash, and five or six minutes after the first paper was written, this was written: "Dear Sir,—I agree to your terms, and provided you pay me the balance next week, instead of by instalments, I will allow you 71/2 discount"—they left me after those papers were signed—I had communicated with Mr. Claxton, my solicitor, who came to me later in the day, and we went to the Holborn Restaurant and lunched with Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain and Mr. Claxton—35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid then in coin and notes, but I gave no receipt—another brother of Mr. Cannot was there—I left the matter to Mr. Claxton, and it was agreed that he was to draw up a hiring agreement</p>

               <p>Mrs. Chamberlain's name to be signed by her—her name was introduced first at the Holborn—on 9th October I received this letter from Mr. Chamberlain, enclosing one from his brother, and on 22nd October this letter from Mr. Chamberlain, saying "I am not inclined to advise my wife to sign a hiring agreement, or to be a party to a bill of sale"—I also received this other letter from him; I stamped it, November 9th, when I received it. (<hi rend="italic">This proposed that Mrs.Chamberlain should sign a hiring agreement paying</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a month, the</hi> 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">already paid to be counted as part of the instalments.</hi>) On 15th November a cheque for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent me in accordance with that arrangement, and on 16th December I received this letter from Chamberlain in answer to mine asking for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due for hire of furniture—he says in that letter that he owed nothing for hire—I then wrote "Please and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent due, or I shall be compelled to write to my solicitor"—I than got this letter of December 19th: "I am surprised at your writing as you have; I do not owe you any rent; I certainly owe you an instalment on purchase of the furniture, as that furniture was undoubtedly purchased by me; if you are inclined to accept a lump sum let us settle the matter, and I will try and meet you"—on 22nd December my solicitor sent me a copy of this letter. (<hi rend="italic">From to prisoner, stating that he was willing to give Mr. Fuller</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in full discharge.</hi>) I got nothing in respect of the December 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 14th January I wrote to the prisoner: "I beg to remaind you that the instalment of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is due, and unless the same is paid by Monday I shall place the matter in the hands of my solicitor"—he sent me this reply next day: "I have received your letter of 14th January threatening proceedings even before the money is due. This is the second time you have done this. I have given Mrs. Chamberlian you letter, and have advised her not to pay more till you send a proper receipt"—on 25th January I got this letter from Hill and Co., the prisoner's solicitors. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they would send to the witness's office</hi>, 2, <hi rend="italic">Gresham Street, and tender</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">purchase-money for furniture, and would require receipt for</hi> 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on account of purchase-money</hi>). I then got this letter (<hi rend="italic">From Hill and Co., stating that they had been unable to see the witness, and could not attend again</hi>). My solicitors then took out process in the Country Court—these are the particulars of the action <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the defendant gave evidence, and stated that he was an undischarged bankrupt, which I had not heard till that moment—I produce the judgment of the County Court. (<hi rend="italic">Judgement given for plaintiff for</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) On 17th February I swore an information at Bow Street, and a summons was granted returnable on the 24th, and on the 23rd Mrs. Chamberlain came to the office and paid one of my clerks 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I gave no receipt for that, I told my solicitor, and I did not attend at Bow Street on 24th—I was required to attend there on March 17th, which I did, and the defendant was here—there was another hearing on March 24th, and again on the 31st, and the matter was sent for trial.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my letter to Chamberlain I alluded to the agreement for hire and purchase, and he said that it was an absoluted purchase—Mr. Flagg was my solicitor at the County Court—I sued for hire and purchase, and recovered Judgment—I saw him at 11 o'clock on October 15, and I saw Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlain at 2 o'clock the same day—possession of the furniture was taken after the lunch at the Holborn at 3 o'clock, and at the lunch my solicitor suggested that hire and?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188804230056"/>
               <p>purchase agreement should be drawn up—I swore at the police-court "The hiring agreement was with Mrs. Chamberlain; when she refused to sign the agreement I considered I had sold to the defendant"—I understood that Mrs. Chamberlain was the person I was to look to—I knew that she was an actress at Winchester, and in the receipt of a very good salary—my solicitor produced this book at the Holborn—it is his writing—he read out to me "May Chamberlain, Museum Chambers, or Cannot"—in addition to the furniture, the arrangement was for a leasehold interest in the premises—I make no allusion to that in these letters—there is a condition that the contract is not absolutely certain because of some rebate which I allow—I do not know by whom the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid—the instalments of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were paid by cheque, signed by Mr. Hill, of Chancery Lane—I did not know at that time that he was Mrs. Chamberlain's solicitor.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shepton Mallett, Somersetshire, and am a corn and cheesefactor there, in partnership with three other gentlemen—I received this letter, signed G. Mortimer. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated from</hi> 127, <hi rend="italic">Fulham Palace Road, and stated that they were in want of prime ripe cheese, and had taken his name as maker, and requested particulars and price, as they wanted supply for 10 shops</hi>). I replied in a letter dated 14th March, addressed to G. Mortimer, 127, Fulham Palace Road—it was written by one of my partners with my consent—the letter was copied in our press copy letter-book, this is a copy. (<hi rend="italic">This letter contained particulars of cheeses and prices.</hi>) I then received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">Ordering cheeses to be sent to order to Paddington, for their vans to collect and deliver at nine shops. This letter added that any leading London house would answer inquiries, or they could be made through the bankers</hi>). We inquired through our county bankers, and they reported favourably, and I sent those goods—this is a copy of the invoice which I sent to G.

We received the baskets, the first lot were all cheeses—when I sent those first cheeses, I believed business was carried on at all those places, including the Fulham Palace Road, and that it was a good and genuine business, and I believed I was communicating with G. Mortimer, or a person who had a right to use that name, and that the bankers were Williams, Deacon and Co.—I sent some more goods on 23rd March—this is a copy of the invoice.

I am going to"—I said "You can, if you like; be quick about it"—I then put the two prisoners in a cab; a constable in uniform close by assisted me; I took them to Fulham police-station, where I asked their names and addresses—they each said "I decline to give either my name or address"—Long then said if I went to Butler's, Church Street, Chelsea, and told him that Charley was at the station, he would know all about it—Hubbard said nothing to that—his name is Charles Hubbard—I then went to No. 1, Poulton Street, Church Street, Chelsea, a small greengrocer's shop kept by Butler—I there found a constable in charge of 15 baskets of cheese in the cellar or kitchen under the shop—I gave directions for the cheese to be taken to the station from the Butlers'—they were 15 baskets identified by Mr. Allan as his third lot—that was what I had seen in the van—the cart was outside a butcher's shop, and was taken to the station by a constable—these fifteen were taken in the van—I lost sight of the cart by St. Mark's, Notting Hill for a time—Long did not abondon it, he went round a corner rather faster than I—it was taken to the police station—it contained eight baskets of cheese, the remainder of Mr. Allen's third consignment—they were shown to to Allen and he identified them—I found no cheeses at James's butcher's shop in the Uxbridge Road; I found four baskets of Stilton cheese at James's shop, 16, George Street, Kichmond, less five that had been sold—there were forty-five of Mr. Bason's Stilton cheeses there; I have shown them to Mr. Bason and he has identified them—Beard found five other cheeses at James's other shop—at 85, Leather Lane, Mr. Herring's place, I found twenty of the second lot of Mr. Allen's cheeses—I called at Mr. Whittington's shop and received two letters addressed to Mortimer—I found this document on Hubbard when he was taken into custody ("22 cheeses 150.17.63 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.")</p>

I was with the last witness on April 3rd, and saw the cart and van, and I followed the younger Butler in the van he was driving to Poulton Street, Chelsea—he drew up in Church Street, at back of 1, Poulton Street, a small greengrocer's shop—that picture (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a good representation of the premises—the back of No. 1 is in Church Street—the baskets were taken out of the van by the two Butlers and placed in an underground kitchen or cellar; the elder Butler came out and helped—there is the ordinary entrance to the shop—you can communicate by the shop-door to all parts of the house; this is the only other entrance—after the last cheeses were Unloaded into the cellar I went into the cellar behind him, and I said to the elder Butler "I am a police-officer, I want you to give an account of how you got these cheeses in your possession"—he said "I know nothing about them, I am only going to mind them for Mr. Dickson"—I said to the younger Butler "What do you know about them?"—he said "I don't know nothing about them, I have only just fetched them from Paddington"—I said I did not believe their statement, and should have to take them into custody for fraudulently stealing and receiving—the elder Butler said "All right, we will go with you"—I conveyed them in a cab to Fulham Police-station.</p>

I was outside the shop at half-past 11 a.m.—it was half-past 10 when the cheeses were at Paddington—it would take pretty well an hour, to come down to here—when the lad brought the van to a stand I was within 20 or 30 yards—what was done was done in my sight—I did not hear the lad speak to his father—the cheeses were in baskets, and were taken in in baskets—they were not touched except to take them in—it was easier to carry them in on the level than up the stairs to the shop—there was nothing in the way when they were taken in; it was impossible to conceal them—I told them I did not believe but that they knew something about it, I did not believe the father—I did not believe the father had heard Long speak of him self as Dickson, I don't question that statement—I knew the lad had brought them from Paddington; he said he knew nothing about it except that he had taken his father's van to Paddington and come back again—the van was standing there a quarter of an hour before anything was taken out of it, and before Butler senior appeared at all.</p>

I saw Meredith four times altogether; the 6th, 7th, and 11th, and after that I served on him the notice to produce the various articles—he offered to give me any information—he said "My connection with Cross was the unfortunate result of public-house acquaintance; I only knew him before as belonging to the one in Kingsland"—he meant the volunteer fire brigade—they have an engine and appliances there—Meredith said "Gross said 'This will turn out all right, and got me to join it. From what I have since heard of him and all the others whom he took on, I admit I have been a fool and nothing else, and that I deserve 20 lashes with the cat; I am quite innocent of knowing what the others were doing, Cross took all the money and had the whole management of it up till the end of January. I am £30 out of pocket over it, and have lost £50 in contracts where I work"—Meredith was alone at that time; he gave me every facility for investigating—on 11th February Meredith refused to snow me the books; he said "No, they will be produced"—after he said that, I told the Magistrate he gave me every facility for investigating; he has done so all through—possibly a jumping-net is an appliance for saving life—I never saw Zazel at the Westminster Aquarium—I have heard she was shot out of a cannon and landed in a net—I have known sheets and blankets used—a net is better adapted—on the lamp was the word "Fire," and over the door the word "Station"—there is just room for the hose-barrow they have, to enter—I was satisfied with the quantity of hose.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DUKE</hi>. I found out that these people had started a brigade, which they called the North London Fire Brigade, on the 1st November—I thought it was partly taking my title—I hare no station in Hoxton—ours is 54, Blackstock Road, Finsbury Park—we have two stations—we began in 1870—at that time we had 16 men, I suppose, in our brigade—we had all necessary plant—my station was then in Penton Street, Pentonville—we receive nothing from the public funds, only from voluntary subscriptions—I am paid as manager—I send collectors, who collect money, and I appropriate part of it as manager's salary—I issue a balance-sheet to let the public know what I do with the money—I am not sure whether I have issued a balance-sheet for 10 years; I began 18 years ago—the brigade was partly formed in 1870—we began in 1871; it was mooted in December, 1870, and the station was taken in 1870—we began to collect in 1871, and we opened in January or February, 1871—we had then six lengths of hose, a stand-pipe, a branch, a felling axe and hand-pump; but previous to that there was an engine ordered of Shand and Mason—I was not superintendent at that time—we had all the necessary appliances for extinguishing fires—we also had two lengths of ladder, 13 feet in all, 6 feet each; a long line, uniform helmets, belts, axes; I cannot enumerate all—we had the gear sent on, while we were getting the engine, for us to open the station—we got the engine in March, 1871—I have been informed that the water company's hydrants in Hoxton district are high-pressure—if you put a hose on the hydrant I should say the water would carry to a height of 70 or 80 feet, with the pressure in the main—if the fire were less than 70 or 80 feet high you would not need an engine, I should say—there are more fires extinguished now with a stand pipe than there were originally, because we get a better supply of water—the manual is more useful to carry the men than anything else, and a speedy way of getting gear to the fire—whether a fire may be put out with the pressure of water from the main depends on if you have sufficient hose—300 feet of hose is very useful; we have 1,000 feet—we began with six lengths of 40 feet each—40 feet is a length of hose in leather—eight lengths would be 320 feet—our brigade has been growing; it has been a great deal of trouble, but I manage to keep it growing—I have expended over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own money on it, and now it is in a great state of efficiency—for the last six months, since I broke my arm, I have spent all my time on it; at first I did not—this place was large enough for a fire engine if you enlarged the door—I have not seen this brigade and its appliances since that time—our brigade attends chimney fires—we are sent for and we attend—it is certainly a useful purpose to the public to put out a chimney fire; sometimes it is a serious matter—I have known cases where it has become a very serious thing—from June, 1876, to June, 1877, we had 16 chimney-fire calls; that is a small number—I should think 20 chimney fires in the course of two or three months would be a large number—for the purpose of putting out a chimney fire a hand-pump is a proper appliance—a man who knew his business would not turn all the force of the main up the chimney—the prisoners had such</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188804230071"/>
               <p>a pump—for a more serious call some yards of hose and a hydrant would be very useful till the fire engine came with a person that understood it—I think Cross was in the Metropolitan Fire Brigade for about five weeks—for the first few weeks men are drilled; they don't turn them out from the drill-class for about three months in the Metropolitan Brigade.</p>

Our nearest station on the other side is about the same distance off—there is about a mile and a half between our two stations—it is a very poor neighbourhood, with a great number of little houses—the appliances of our street-stations are ordinarily a hose-cart, three 100-feet lengths of hose, a stand pipe, delivery elbows for connecting on to the hydrant, a hand-pump, 3 nozzles, 2 branches, a set of turncock's tools, 6 wedges, 6 lapping-lines and lapping leathers—all those are carried in the hose cart—we do not have a jumping net—we have ladders and an escape, at night-time—I should think this photograph represented a hose-cart, with proper fittings and appliances—we have no engines at the street-stations, but they are in communication with the main station by telegraph, and there we have manual and steam engines—there are telegraphs at the corners of the streets to communicate with the stations—the street-stations are between two main-stations, with the object that we can be in prompt attendance at small fires—we attend</p>

I am a greengrocer—on Thursday, 5th April, between 1 and 1.30 a. m., I was in a lodging-house at Pitfield Street, at the back of the Variety Theatre, Hoxton—I saw the prisoners there—Horrigan took me outside, and put a handkerchief over my mouth, and one of the others held me down—another put his hand in my pocket—I had nine shillings—when I got up I had a punch on the note from a stranger, and my money was gone—I had not conversed with the prisoners—one had asked me if I had twopence for a lodging before I was attacked—I had no coppers, and I put my hand in my pocket, and pulled out my money, and put it back again—the prisoners saw me, and they took me</p>

I am deputy lodging-house keeper at 6, Pitfield Street, Hoxton—on 5th April the prosecutor was in the lodging-house, and the prisoners and two others, one not in custody, assisted in robbing the prosecutor—Rider had stopped there about a week before—Horrigan came to the gate and knocked at the window, and said "Open the door"—I went out to the gate, and he said "Open the gate," and I said "I will open it for you, but I don't want the other four," and he said "No, they ain't coming in"—the men outside were Horrigan, Burke, Mahoney, Palmer, and another—I saw the prisoners drag the prosecutor out—I mean Horrigan and Burke—Mahoney was there, and assisted in laying him down, and dragging him out in the passage—I opened the door—Horrigan pushed a red handkerchief in the prosecutor's mouth—Horrigan was at his head, Burke was on his left side, and Mahoney on his right—the man not in custody was at his feet—Burke and Mahoney appeared to be rifling his pockets in the passage, just outside the kitchen-door—I have no doubt the prisoners are the men.</p>

Palmer"—Palmer punched me—I was not fighting Palmer when the policeman came in—the policeman did not ask me to pick out the man who did it—Rider accused the wrong man—when the policeman came one of the men said "Nobody has done the robbery," and: a man picked up the form and hit him on the head with it—he did not say "Nobody in the room has done the robbery"—I did not give you in charge nor want to—Rider said it was a militiaman—the militia <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> had gone to bed—Burke and Mahoney tried to rob me, only I had put the money away, and I told the inspector.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David White, living at 36, Ives Street, Chelsea—the prisoner is my father-in-law—he is about 65 years old—his wife, Margaret White, was about 67 years old—they lived together at 1, Eden Place, Chelsea—the prisoner worked there as a shoemaker, and occupied the front parlour on the ground floor—on Saturday, 3rd March, I went with the prisoner's wife with some boots to Balham, to leave them with some customers—on leaving them 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid for them by the customers—we got back to Eden Place about half-past 12 in the middle of the day—just before we got back to Eden Place, we went into the Star and Garter public-house—the wife had half-a-quartern of gin and some bread and cheese there—that was the first drink she had had that morning so far as I know—then we got back to Eden Place—the prisoner was sitting on his bench—he was not working at that moment—after we had been in the room a minute or two he said he should like a pint of beer—the wife said "James, I think you have had enough already, where did you get it?"—he said "I have taken a little job home, and I spent the money"—his wife began to cry, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.to get a pint of beer—he went to fetch it—I saw him come back with the beer—his wife was then sorting the boots out of a sack, about 18 pairs—she showed him the boots, there were some to mend and some to cut up—the prisoner said' "Never mind those, I will see to those afterwards"—he gave the wife a glass of beer first, and he drank the remainder—none was given to me then—shortly after, the prisoner said he felt very bad, he did not know what was the matter, he said he felt so bad he must go and lie down—I said "Do, Dad, and I will cover you up"—I took his arm and led him to the bed, he lay down, and I covered him up with a great coat—at that time the wife was still occupied with the boots: she was crying very much—she gave, as a reason, that the work in the house would not go home to-night; that was the first week they had had any work for several weeks—I said "Don't fret, Mother, let him sleep a little while, and when he wakes up he will go to work, don't disturb him"—when the prisoner went to lay down on the bed, he seemed ill or strange—his eyes were very large, and his face very pale, his eyes were bloodshot—I thought he had been having something to drink, a good drop—shortly after he lay down I left the house to pay Mrs. Mayhew a shilling—I only had to cross the road—I went back to Mother</p>

               <p>and said good-bye—she was sitting in the same chair—I was only two or three minutes out—she was quite sober then; that was about a quarter past 1—after saying good-bye I left* saying I would come back directly my husband had had his tea—about 5 o'clock that afternoon Mrs. Spinks came and said something to me, and from what she said, I and she went back to the house—when I got into the room, I saw the wife was lying on the bed on her left side—I tried to speak to her, to rouse her—she had a dreadful blow round the eye on the right side of her head—I touched her face and found it very cold—the prisoner was sitting on his seat where he works—he had some work in his hand, a boot—after trying to rouse the wife, I said "Father, what has happened between you and mother?"—he said "She aggravated me, and I paid her"—he seemed very wild at the time, dreadfully wild—he was raving and stamping about, and roaring very much—stamping his foot and roaring out very loud; he did not roar anything particular, only making a noise, no words—I said "I think Mother has had a fit, we had better have a doctor"—he said "No, she is only shamming, she can speak if she likes"—after that he said "Aren't you going to give me a pint of beer now you are come?"—I said "Yes, Father"—I took the can to get the beer, but instead of getting the beer, I wont for Dr. Lehaine—he came and attended to the deceased—after I had touched her face I did not notice her move at any time—I was in the room when Dr. Lehaine came—when the prisoner saw the doctor and me he became very violent; he threatened to brain the doctor with the poker, and me for fetching him—he said his wife was only shamming, she could speak if she liked; and I went and hid all the fireirons in the cupboard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I married the prisoner's son David—I have known the prisoner about 16 years—most part of the time X have lived near him, and have seen him almost every day, every week at any rate—he has frequently complained of pains in his head, and suffered with very profuse bleeding at the nose—I have often noticed a strange wildness in the prisoner's eyes before, when he was sober, particularly when he was in a temper—he has very frequently threatened to cut his threat—my husband also suffers from the How of blood to the head, and both my children suffer the same—one is eight-and-a-half and the other five-and-a-half years old—both the father and mother of the prisoner died from that, and the prisoner's brothers are the same, both suffer from it; one is dead, the other is in America; I don't know if he is dead—two or three weeks before 3rd March the prisoner threatened to cut his throat—that was at a time when he was quite sober—he sometimes broke out into violent fits of passion, with very little reason, if his tea was not ready; he then said he would cut his throat and have done with it—his general demeanour was that of a kind, affectionate husband and father—when I last saw the woman alive, about 1, she was perfectly sober—she suffered very much with her eyes all her life; she was almost blind—she had only once taken a little refreshment when out with me—when I came back at 5 the prisoner knew he had beaten her, but did not know he had injured her so far—I did not know she was dead; I thought she was in a fit till the doctor came—there were no signs of breathing in her; she was on her side on the bed—I could only see the side face—he was dreadfully violent and raving at that time—after the doctor came he continued raving, and his daughter, my sister-in-law, had to hold him—the doctor declared after a while that</p>

               <p>she was dead—he had to get the prisoner quiet, and after he got him quiet he told him his wife was dead—he appeared to disbelieve that, and said she was shamming; he knew her long enough; she was only obstinate—I was only away from the house a few minutes before I came back with the doctor—I pretended to go for the beer, but really meant to go for the doctor—when first I got back at 5 the prisoner was repairing a boot in the same room as the woman was, and when I got back with the doctor he was still doing so, and said "Where is the beer?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> Now and again the prisoner would have a drop of beer—sometimes he would get the worse for liquor—he used to work very hard as a shoemaker—he carried on that trade from a boy; he was apprenticed; he was a good workman—that was the way his living was made, and he was well able to do it—the last year he only mended boots—he was a dreadfully passionate man; it was soon over ordinarily—I have never known him actually attempt to do anything to himself—his stamping and raging lasted about half an hour; that was a long time, an unusual time for him; he was unusually angry that afternoon—he was apt to get passionate after drink—if he slept after drink he was very passionate when he woke—he was able to repair the boot; he had one tip nearly done—the old <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> would have a drop with her husband now and again, but she was a sober woman ordinarily; she would have what she had with the prisoner—she was a very quiet woman as a rule.</p>

If I hear any more of this I must take you into custody"—the constable went away after saying that—later in the afternoon (I could not say the time, I was very ill at the time) I saw the prisoner going up the court carrying a can; I did not speak to him—I saw him again that afternoon in the passage of our house; nobody was with him; he was going out into the back yard—I did not see him come in from the back yard; I saw Mrs. White go across and fetch Mrs. Mayhew, she came back with her—later in the evening some other constables came.</p>

I keep a fishmonger's and poulterer's shop in the Park Road, Leyton—about 3 a. m. on 2nd April I was aroused by a knock at the door—I went down and saw a constable, who made a communication to me, in consequence of which I inspected my shop—I found two of my shutters were taken down, and were lying against the others—I missed 16 pairs of kippers in a box from the shop—they had been on the counter, about four feet from the window—I went to Mr. Shenstone's premises with a policeman, where I found about 15 pairs of kippers on the floor, and no box—I last saw my kippers safe on Sunday night at 12 o'clock—before I went to bed that night I saw my house was properly closed, and that the shutters were up; I always do—my man put the shutters up, I am certain—I identified the kippers as mine at the station and at the police-court—I have not recovered the box.</p>

About a quarter to 1 on Monday morning, 2nd April, I was on duty in Manor Road, Leyton; I saw the three prisoners coming towards me from the direction of the prosecutor's shop, towards Lea Bridge Road—they passed by me; I took no notice of them except to notice their appearance—about half-an-hour</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188804230100"/>
               <p>afterwards I passed the prosecutor's shop—I was trying the doors and windows of the shops—I found two shutters down and up against the others—with those shutters down they could get the kippers, for the window was not fastened, it was open, with the shutters up outside—I went to the corner of Manor Road, came back to the shop and saw another policeman, who made a communication to me—I went to the hoarding outside Mr. Shenstone's lawn tennis ground, and in a pavillion there I could hear talking—I went up to the road, through some unfinished buildings, and got over a fence about 11 feet high, with the help of Lee, into the grounds—we both got over—I opened the door of the pavilion and saw the three prisoners—I asked them what they were doing there—Harvey said they had only come there to sleep—I said to Wright "What is your name?"—he said "Wright"—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "Walthamstow"—I said to the other two prisoners "Where do you come from?"—they said "Woolwich"—I said "Whereabouts?"—they refused to give me any further address—I said "I should take them into custody for being on these premises for the purpose of committing a felony"—on looking round the pavilion I saw a number of kippers lying where Harvey had got up from—I got the assistance of another constable in Lea Bridge Road by blowing my whistle, and I took them to the station—on the way there I had hold of Harvey; I said to him "What about this fish?"—he said "I don't know, it will take you all your time to find the box"—I took them to Harrow Green Police-station, and searched Wright—in his coat-pocket I found one of the herrings—I then told the inspector in their presence that most likely there would be a charge of house-breaking against them as I had found the shutters down at the shop—I had not told them that before—they made no reply—I went to Blackwell's shop, and then we went to where we took the prisoners from about 150 yards away—we found there sixteen pairs of kippers, which the prosecutor identified.</p>

I am stationed at West Ham Lane—on 20th March, at 6.45 p. m., I was in Stratford Broadway, where I saw the prisoner with two other men—I watched them; they went along the High Street, to Mr. Wayland's jeweller's shop—the prisoner went into the shop on tiptoe, one of the other men went into the doorway, and the third one stood outside looking in the window—the prisoner suddenly left the shop, and the three men crossed the road, went down the mews, and were down there a few minutes; they came out, loitered about, and then the prisoner went in the shop again, while one of the men stood in the doorway, and the other looked in at the window; suddenly the prisoner left, carrying something in a handkerchief—I ran across and seized two of them; I was tripped up—the third man ran round to the back and took the articles under the handkerchief—I got off the ground and ran after the prisoner, who was running away—I called out "Stop thief"—Constable 533 ran after him about 600 yards, and he was stopped in Angel Lane by a private individual—I said to Constable 533 "Tate the man to the station"—I went back to Mr. Wayland's shop, and he came to the station—I was watching the prisoner and the other men a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes before I pounced on them.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is Sydney Barratt, and the prisoner is my stepmother—I lived with them at 106, Court Hill Road Lewisham, until I was taken to the infirmary—on the morning of the day Mrs. Munyard took me to the police-station I got up at 6 o'clock and lit the fire—after that the prisoner came downstairs and told me to go out in the street—before that she slapped me on the face with her hand; I don't know what that was for—when she turned me into the street she gave me a piece of bread—I had not these clothes on then; I had no petticoats on; I don't know what had become of them—I 1st saw them a long time before—I used to wear them—my stepmother took them away after I left going to school; that was before Good Friday; I don't know when—my petticoats were not given back to me—I had on on this morning my chemise, stays, drawers, and frock—I was met by a girl, Rose Munyard, who took me to Mrs. Munyard, and she took me to the police-station, where I was examined, by a doctor, and then I was taken to the Infirmary and examined by another doctor—I pointed out to those gentlemen some marks on my tongue—they were caused by my mother shutting my mouth upon my tongue—she told me to put my tongue out, and when it was out she shut my mouth—that happened three times, on different days, a long time before I was taken to the station by Mrs. Munyard—it was more than a week—I also pointed out to the doctors some marks on my legs—they were done by my mother with the poker after she had put it in the fire—that happened at different times—she did not make more than one mark on the same day—those marks are on my legs here. (<hi rend="italic">Pointing to just below her knees.</hi>) I have those marks still—once I went to bed for this burn on the side of my leg—that was worse than they usually were—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon to the police of Lee and Blackheath—on Thursday, 5th April, I saw the child Barratt at the Lee police Station—I examined her—I noticed a faint and yellow bruise, as if it had been done some time, across her shoulder, round the ribs you could hardly trace it—it was as if the child had had a blow from an instru<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188804230112"/>
               <p>—I don't think it could have been caused by a fall—I saw no other bruise—I did not strip her, but I drew down her stockings, and found about 11 marks on both legs; some of them looked as if they were marks or scars of old burns—there were three I have no doubt about—I should say they were caused by some instrument—I doubt if they could have been caused by falling on a grate—I cannot say about the others, they were very faint; they were scars—I could hardly say whether they were the scars of what had been open wounds, I did not examine the child very much then—if they were burns they must have been caused by some hot instrument—I could not see any marks of any boils—I sent the child to the infirmary—her condition was not good for a child of that age as far as I could tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see her for very long—boils are rare on the legs—we don't consider boils come so much on that part of the body—to the best of my belief I can only say three were burns—I don't know what the others were; I had no opportunity of examining them—a boil leaves a wound, and the wound leaves a mark—I doubt these being boils—I would not swear whether the slight mark was the result of a burn, boil, or stab—I would not swear these on the leg, with the exception of three, were not boils—if she had fallen against the hot bars of the fire, such wounds would not have been caused, because one is more indented, and a larger surface—I did not measure the wound on the shin bone; if that had been from the fire-bar, in my opinion there would have been a breach of the surface, and not such a scar—I doubt if the bar would have made such a mark as a poker, if she had been against the bar, and the bar was very hot, because she would have had other wounds elsewhere, and the wound I saw seemed to be a punctured wound, and if she had fallen against the bar it would have been a longer wound—I cannot swear to the length of this wound, I remember it was small—I have seen burns from molten lead, which burns into the skin; and scalds I have seen—I cannot now remember having seen burns from a poker or hot iron before—these are the first I have seen as far as I remember—this wound was just at the side of the leg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> It was at the side of the calf, a little more towards the front than towards the back—if the child had fallen against a bar, the wound would have been a long-shaped wound—this is not long-shaped, it is more like a puncture—I did not see another burn behind the leg. Louis <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBINSON</hi>. I live at 162, High Street, Lewisham, and am surgeon to the Lewisham Infirmary—on 5th April, the child was brought to the infirmary—I first saw her on the 6th—I stripped her and made a thorough examination—on the right shoulder and over the whole right shoulder-blade was a large bruise; beneath the right shoulder-blade there was a smaller bruise—there were bruises on both arms, and also faint marks of bruising on the back, below the other bruise—there were scars on both legs; I counted 11, which I should think were caused by burns, some were more severe than others, and I should think they were of different date—I have no doubt whatever that some of them were burns—the more pronounced were four, one on each knee, one on the right shin, and the other on the external side of the left leg, about half-way down, on the side of the calf—the largest was on the right shin—I have no doubt whatever those were scars from burning; I am of opinion that the others were all from the same cause—I have had very large experience</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188804230113"/>
               <p>in burns; I have seen them daily for the last two years—the very faintest of the scars might have been from boils—I could not tell what was the cause of the very faint ones, because they had been there a considerable time, and were not very severe—I should think there were three or four others, besides the four, that one could be almost certain were caused by burns and nothing else—I do not think the burns I saw could be caused by falling on the hot bars of a fire-grate, because they were a circular shape, as if some hot point had been put against the skin, not as if a bar were put against the skin—the bruises on the shoulder and ribs might have been caused at the same time—I could not say how, but by great violence—it could not have been caused by an ordinary fall against something—it is consistent with having been caused by a poker—I examined the child's tongue, and found a very deep scar across the care of the dorsum, I mean the part of the tongue seen when the tongue is put out; the scar was jagged, and I think had been caused by cuts from teeth at several times—it was not the kind of scar you would expect to find if a child fell—the tongue must have protruded very far to have been bitten through, and it must have protruded at the time the child fell, if it was caused so—it was quite half-way along the visible point of the tongue—I saw no kind of poisoning from dye in these wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cut in the tongue was made by the teeth; it was the position in which the teeth would cut if the tongue was protruded about as far as a child could protrude it—the cuts were on the top of the tongue—there was one jagged, very deep mark, but I should think they were caused on more than one day, the tongue must have been almost bitten through—if the child had its tongue cut and had fallen it would not have been cut to such an extent—if the tongue protruded as far as it could it might be caused with very great violence to the chin—I counted eleven scars altogether, I think—two were specially vivid on the front of the right leg—I should think they were caused three to five weeks before; they were the most recent wounds—I think there was no stocking between the instrument that caused them and the flesh—it was done on the bare flesh, or else the stocking was burnt; I should think the child had no stocking on—I think a sharp point caused it—the corner of a bar would be a line, not the corner of an oven—the point must have been red hot, I think, because it would not have destroyed the skin unless it was—if hot enough to destroy the skin it would be nearly red-hot; then there would be no difference—if a pointed bar came across the bars it would be sufficient—some of the marks are very faint, it would be impossible to tell what they came from, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> At the time I examined the child she was very badly-nourished; she weighed only 43lbs. on the 6th, and in the week she was in the workhouse she increased to 48lbs., and on the 8th she weighed 50lbs.—I was present when she was weighed—I have seen her this morning; she looks very much better, she has gained flesh and is better nourished—either she had no stockings on, or the instrument burnt right through them—the appearance is consistent with that—I think she had no stockings on, and that there was nothing between the instrument and the skin—I could not dispute it if the child says that on some occasions the stockings were burnt through—that might be with reference to the fainter marks—the tongue, when it was bitten through, must have</p>

               <p>been out as far as the child could protrude it—I do not think the child could carry her tongue out as far as possible when walking or running downstairs. <hi rend="italic">By</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUTTON</hi>. I would not call her exceedingly well nourished now—her face does not correspond with the rest of her body—she has improved in appearance—she has not much superficial fat on her body—she is with the other children in the workhouse and is treated in the same way exactly—they simply play about; I do not think they work—they have pretty good treatment, I think—she would look after another child there—whether the treatment affected the child much would depend entirely on how hard the work she had done before had been.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mean scars of sores that had existed some time previously—they looked very like cicatrices of boils, all except the long one on the shin of the right leg—the one below the knee is distinctly a burn; the one above, in my opinion, is not caused by a burn—I did not see the bruise on the back; I was not asked to look at it—I saw three scars on the tongue, made at three different times, I should think; the one in the centre must have been caused by considerable direct violence, it was a deep scar—very likely by biting with the teeth—the farther one was far back—they were not all in a line straight across.</p>

               <p>to the proprietors, and asked me to let him have them for three days to take away and show them to the Committee, and if they were approved of he would get the money at once from the Committee and pay me for them, and if they were not approved of they were to be returned—I sent them to 4, Charlotte Street on the same day—I saw him again, I believe, on the next day—he said "They have been approved of by the Committee, and I shall get the money very shortly, and I will pay you in a few days"—I saw him frequently at my office—he said that the Committee would not meet for a month—he said early in October, "I cannot pay you before because the Committee do not meet so soon"—I also saw Emile Katz at my office and pressed him for the account, because I had suspicion that the goods were not honestly got—he called first a few days after the first transaction, and after I had parted with the goods, it was early in September—he said that he had received a telegram which he showed me, saying that the money would be sent by the next post; I told him if it was not paid at once I should put it into the hands of the police, because a good many gentlemen had called for references which I did not like, as it looked very suspicious—he told me if I did not get the money the next morning to send for the goods, and I sent for them but did not get them—in the early part of November, when the month had expired, I called at 4, Charlotte Street, and found the place closed—I saw Mrs. Shepherd—I did not see the prisoners again till I saw them in custody—I have seen a bronze bust of Diana in the possession of Mr. James Smith, a pawnbroker. That was in the second lot of goods which I had sent on approval—I have seen the candelabra and the large vases in the possession of Mr. Jay, and the bronze jugs in the possession of Mr. Clark, of Hampstead Road; they were part of the first lot—all I have seen of the first lot is the bronze bust of Diana and the candelabra.</p>

               <p>law before going over the water—I found two pawn tickets in the same pocket, and these two gold seals—he said "Well, I bought them along with other things; the two tickets I bought this morning from a man in the Strand for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said "<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you know him?"—he said "No, he was a stranger to me"—this gold seal has been identified by William Fox Batley—I found these two ladies' cloth cloaks, one trimmed with fur, hung up in a cupboard in the adjoining room—I asked Chandler if he knew to whom they belonged—he said "Yes, that belongs to my wife"—I called Mrs. Chandler up; she said "Yes, that is mine; he bought that some time ago for me"—the other one trimmed with fur Chandler and his wife said belonged to their daughter—I called up the daughter—she said in the prisoner's presence "Yes, that is mine; I bought it at Spurgeon's, on the Causeway, some time ago"—I asked her what she gave for it; she said she was not sure; she thought about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked her if she had the bill for it; she said "No, they don't give bills there"—I took possession of the cloaks on the 19th, not then—the prisoner did not contradict or say anything; he made no reference to it at all—while I was upstairs Bradford came up and said "While you have been upstairs Woodford went out, saying he wanted to go to the w. c, and while at the back I saw him, instead of going <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the w. c, go up to a pail, and in the act of covering something up in the ashes; I went out, caught him by the shoulder, and turned out a cigar-case containing four pins, and a pocket-book"—these are the cigar-case and the pins; the pins have not been identified—Chandler said nothing—Bradford produced the pocket-book and said "I find, looking over it, an entry corresponding with—the articles stolen from Spa Road"—here is the entry—Chandler said "The book is mine, but I never made the entry"—I asked him if he had any objection to writing a similar one—I read out several of the items, and he wrote them down in pencil—in my opinion that is the same handwriting as the other—I said to Chandler "That is the same writing, but in larger characters"—he said "Well, I don't know how it got there"—he said the book was his: he lent the coat to his brother-in-law, meaning Woodford, and that he took the uniform coat off and put the plain one on—none of this jewellery has been identified—I found these six new suits of clothes—these two pawn-tickets were in the pocket of the coat he was wearing, along with this seal and these two gold pencil-cases—I took Chandler into custody and charged him; he made no reply. (<hi rend="italic">One of the pawn-tickets was for a gold watch, Albert chain, and two coins, pledged on 10th March with Hawes and Son, and the other or a pin, pledged on 10th March with Beaumont.</hi>

I am a shipping clerk, and live at 55, Solan Street, New Road, Clapham—at 1 o'clock on early morning of 17th April I was with my wife in the Westminster Bridge Road, on my way home; we called at a coffee-stall, and had a cup of tea—whilst drinking it, Thompson came up against me, and pushed me roughly against my wife, which upset her tea—I asked him what he meant by such conduct—Thompson answered that with a blow in the eve; at the same time he took out of my hand a brown paper-parcel containing three sheep tongues and five sausages, and he handed it over to Smith—I do not know what became of it—there were five of them altogether—I saw nothing of it afterwards—Smith then struck me on the ear, and then I was dealt simultaneous blows and knocked down in the road and tramped on, and then I was kicked when on the ground; all five were engaged in kicking me, I suppose—the prisoners were the ringleaders—I was knocked on the ribs and over my body, and there are stains on my coat of the blood that came from my mouth—there was no constable; we could not get one, but I found I was getting kicked almost to death, and asked them if they would put an end to this, there was nothing in five of them kicking me, and let the matter rest, and come and have a cup of coffee—when I was getting so kicked the coffee-stall man came and took one or two of them off me—they accepted my invitation, and went to the coffee-stall and had coffee, which I paid for—while they were having it I saw a constable und went over for him, brought him over and charged the men with assault and theft of the parcel—I lost about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as well—I did not find that out till I left the police-station—I had the money in this pocket—I could not connect any of the prisoners with it—I knew none of these men before; it was the first time I had seen them.</p>

               <p>of 17th April I was with him, and we went to a coffee stall and while waiting there for some tea the two prisoners with three or four others came behind us—Thompson was in front with his hands in his pockets; he pushed against me and then against my husband with his shoulders—my husband turned and asked him what that was about, and one of them (I don't think it was either of the prisoners) said "We will show you"—then Thompson struck the right side of my husband's face, and at the same time Smith and another man pushed me against a gate near the stall—I tried to get to my husband's assistance, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> saw his hat had been knocked off and that two or three men were striking him; he was pushed away on the road—I saw Thompson strike him; I never saw Smith strike him, he was round my side—I said I should call for police or some protection and I was pushed about from one to the other, and Smith brought his arm down over my face and brought my straw hat down over my face, and in the struggle my fur cape was taken off—I became very much excited and a young man present told me he should help me all he could and get some assistance—at that moment I felt a hand in my pocket—I lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not discover that then, but I put my hand in my pocket to get my handkerchief, as my nose was bleeding, and the handkerchief was gone—I had used it a minute or two before—I saw the coffee-stall keeper coming out—I saw my husband on the ground, five of them were kicking them, two were stooping or kneeling, and three standing—I did not see either of the prisoners kick, but Thompson was there kneeling down I think—a young man got my cape—I was too exhausted to go for a constable—I saw my husband return from the road: the coffee-stall man went to his assistance, and helped him up—my husband came round to me, and Smith and Thompson came—Thompson's language was very abusive about having lost his hat, and he said it would have to be made good—my husband took him to the coffee-stall, and as soon as he had ordered coffee he took my arm, and we went up the street, because he saw a constable coming I suppose—we met the constable—my husband charged Thompson—I told the policeman there were two others; he took Thompson, and Smith and another came to the station to hear the charge against Thompson—I was pushed about roughly, but not struck; I have not been well' since—I identified Smith, and charged him with being concerned with Thompson in pushing me about, and likewise in the loss of my handkerchief.</p>

On 23rd March I went with Sergeants Jupe and Williams to 11, Leopold Street, Vauxhall, and found Turner and Griffin in the act of making counterfeit coin—each had a florin in his hand, and these two moulds were on the table with hot metal coins in them—there were three other moulds on the table, and one under the mattress in the front parlour—16 florins partly finished, were on the table, and 10 half-crowns, and in a cupboard was this galvanic battery—Newson was there—she dropped down at my feet as I took Griffin and Turner in custody, and said "Oh, my God, my poor children"—I placed her in a chair, and said •' "Don't you move, sit still," but she jumped up, reached across the table, took up this knife, and said "This is my knife"—I said "Put it down, give it to me," but before I could reach her she wiped it on her dress and on a towel—I took the knife and towel from her and said "You seem to know something of the business, you have not wiped it all off now, there is still some on it"—that was plaster-of-Paris—she said "I know nothing about it; my husband and 1 do not know anything of this, he goes to work early in the morning, 6 o'clock, and does not return till 8 p. m."—Turner then said "My father and mother do not know anything of what is going on here; my father is away all day, my mother is in, and out, she does not understand it"—the sergeant found this piece of glass in the kitchen, and showed it to Newson—it has the print of a mould on it—I said "You say you know nothing about it; that was in your kitchen just where you were working up some things, you could not be off seeing it"—Wilson brought some portions of moulds and clamps out of the kitchen, and Newson said "I don't know, my son may have put them there"—the kitchen is downstairs—a bag of plaster-of-Paris and a bag of mixture was brought from the kitchen; she said she did not know what it was, she did not understand it—she also said "This is my son; he is a child before marriage, and this (<hi rend="italic">Griffin</hi>) is the young woman who comes to see him"—I said to Newson "You may as well tell me who is the landlord"—she produced this rent-book of the whole house, and said "I am the</p>

I keep the Albert Arms, Gladstone Street, Borough Road—on 12th April, between 8 and 9, I saw Edginagton serve Grant with some half-and-half—he gave him a florin, which he gave to me—I found it bad, and held him till a constable came—he gave his name George Smith—he was discharged by the Magistrate the next morning.</p>
