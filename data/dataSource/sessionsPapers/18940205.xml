                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no evidence of the previous conviction. The full Court of Common Pleas, in 1844, decided that the word "conviction" was a verbum equivocum, and in common parlance meant "verdict," but in strict legal sense should be used to denote the judgment of the Court.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Burgess v. Boetefeur and Brown</hi>, 13 <hi rend="italic">L. J. M. C, p.</hi> 122.) <hi rend="italic">A verdict therefore, in strict law, was merely the basis on which conviction was to be founded, and, until judgment was passed, there was no conviction In the present case no judgment had been passed upon the prisoner on the previous occasion, but merely an order that she should come up for judgment when called upon, and, therefore, interpreting the word "conviction" in its strict legal sense, she had not been convicted. As the word was ambigu<lb/>ous and bore two senses, that most favourable to the prisoner must be taken, in construing this highly penal statute, especially as the latter was the strict sense. In support of his contention, he instanced the fact that it was the immemorial practice of Clerks of Assize and of Clerks of the Peace to set out the judgment as the material part of the conviction in certificates of conviction. Mr. Justice Stephen, it was true, in the case of Jephson v. Barker</hi> (3 <hi rend="italic">Times Law Reports, p</hi> 40) <hi rend="italic">had distinguished the case of Burgess v. Boetefeur and Brown by the dictum that, when there was an order to enter into Recognizances to come up for judgement when called on, there was a conviction; but</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BURNIE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">urged, that case was not reported in any of the authorised Law Reports, and, moreover, an order to come up for judgment when called on was not a judgment of the Court, but only an order as to judg<lb/>ment. At Common Law there was only one judgment, in criminal cases the final judgment or sentence. In the cane of convictions under the Summary Jurisdiction Act and the Probation of First Offenders' Act, where prisoners were bound over to be of good behaviour there were by statute completed judgments</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Q. v. Miles</hi>, 24 <hi rend="italic">Q. B. D., p.</hi> 423).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARTRIDGE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that in Stephen's Blackstone, in Chitty's Criminal Law</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Vol. I., p.</hi> 725), <hi rend="italic">and in the Coinage Act</hi> (<hi rend="italic">under which this Indictment was framed</hi>), <hi rend="italic">the Probation of First Offenders' Act, and the Prevention of Crimes Act, the meaning of the word "conviction" was clearly "Found Guilty," and that that interpretation was to be applied in the present case.</hi>

Criminal Law showed that until judgment a man was not field to be a felon, and did not forfeit his property, and therefore he was not convicted until judgment had passed, otherwise the verdict of the Jury would at once constitute an attainder of blood.

I am the wife of Charles Deane, a salesman, of 21, North Street, Marylebone?—I am a monthly nurse—I attended the prisoner when she was confined of a female child on 28th September last—I remained with her for nine days afterwards—it was a nice little plump baby, small, but healthy—when I left it was going on favourably, and the mother as well—I saw the prisoner again about a fortnight afterwards; she had a bad bosom, but was suckling the child; it was not so big as it was—I washed and dressed it; it was dirty and not thriving—the prisoner was all right—I did not see her again for some time after, wards—I saw the baby, I sent for it some weeks after; it then looked very ill, and much smaller; it only had on a little nightgown, that was clean, and a shawl round its head; I sent the baby back—I remember going one Sunday night to attend to the prisoner's breast; I took a breast-glass to her; she was then in bed intoxicated—her little boy, seven years old, was in the same bed—I did not see her again until the 28th December, when she fetched me between twelve and one in the day, to come and see her baby, as it looked so funny—I went and saw it; it was on the bed, not dressed—it was in a dirty blanket, with a little bit of rag around its loins; there was no fire in the room—I picked</p>

               <p>the baby up; it was a living skeleton—I don't know what I said to her, beyond "Good God!"—I took the baby into my room, warmed it, and put a little nightgown on it, and put it on my sofa; it was composed; and went off into a slumber—I had it in my room about an hour and a half—the prisoner came and fetched it—she asked me what I thought of it—I said I did not think it would live twenty-four hours—she asked me not to ask anybody to see it; but she did not give me a chance, she took it—he was then sober—she called me again between three and four in the morning—I went at once, it was in the bed; it had on the same night gown I had put on it—there was no fire in the room, or any light—I procured a light from the top floor, and stayed with it till the day—there was a little cow's milk in the room, and I set light to a wheel—I saw no food there; I never looked for food—the child died about half-past seven in the morning—the prisoner went out twice while it was dying, to see the time, she said; about six in the morning was the last time, and had a drink—she brought no brandy or anything for the child—when it died she said she would be <hi rend="italic">pulled</hi> for it, that she would get eighteen months—I told her if she had two years she would have none too much—I saw a feeding bottle there the day before.</p>

I am employed by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children—on 15th December, in consequence of an intimation received from the prisoner's husband, I went to the prisoner's rooms; she occupied two rooms on the top floor, but only occupied one at that time—I saw the prisoner with the baby in her arms, and a little boy—I asked to see the child; she showed it to me—it was wrapped in a blanket, and had a small towel round its loins; with that exception it was naked—it was very emaciated, and very dirty, and smelt very strongly of urine—I asked her how she fed it—she said she had fed it on Mellins' food and condensed milk—I saw a small tin of condensed milk in the room, unopened—there was no Mellins' food, or any other food; I looked to see—I asked her where the feeding bottle was—she said she had broken it the previous day—I told her she would have to be more careful with the child, and to see that it was properly fed and clothed—she said, "All right"—she was partly muddled with drink I then left on the 16th I went between twelve and one with Dr. Thomas—on that occasion I saw no feeding bottle or any food—on the 27th I went again; I knocked at the door three times, but</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, of 102, Marylebone Road—I attended the prisoner on 28th September last, when she was confined of a female child, which died on the early morning of 29th December, and of which Dr. Pepper made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in my presence—the child was small when born, but fat and healthy, free from all disease—I attended her for nine days; the child continued to thrive the whole of that time—as far as I remember it was properly fed—I saw the prisoner next on 25th October—she came to me about her breast—she had an abscess that would prevent her suckling from that one breast, and it would have been undesirable to suckle it at all—I told her she ought not to suckle it at all; she ought to feed it suitably from a feeding bottle—I did not see the child then; she came to my surgery—I next saw her with the child on 24th November, at her home—I was sent for, I think, by the husband—the child was then thinner than it was at birth, but I put that down chiefly to the fact that it had to have the breast stopped, and artificial food was not so for it—I saw it again on the 30th November, and I believe it was getting accustomed to the artificial food—it was dirty—I told her she must clothe it better, give it warmer clothing, or else it would catch cold, and get bronchitis or some chest disease, and would most likely die; and she must go on feeding it well—I saw a bottle; it looked like a breast glass, with a tube put in—I saw her again shortly after—the child was still improving a little, but was still dirty; the clothing was about the same—the prisoner was muddled with drink—I saw her again on 4th December; the child was still apparently thriving a little, but just as dirty, and had the same clothing—from 24th November till 4th December there was no improvement in its clothing, but there was in flesh; it was capable of taking its food, and keeping it down—I was present when it was taking food from the breast on one occasion during the time when it was thriving, and it could keep it down perfectly well—I went again on 13th December; the child was then beginning to lose flesh gain; the clothing and cleanliness was just the same—the prisoner's condition was the same, more or lass muddled with drink—I told her</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050022"/>
               <p>that the child was not getting on so well as it should, and warned her she must stick to feeding it thoroughly well, and also told her it ought to have warmer clothing—on the 14th I went again, at her request: the child was still losing flesh; the clothing was about the same—she had not taken much notice of my warning; it was just as dirty, and her own con<lb/>dition was muddled—on the 16th I went with Inspector Buckley; I then weighed the child, it weighed 5lbs. 6oz.—the normal weight would be about 9lbs. 6oz.—it was then just as dirty, and the clothing much about the same—I saw no food on that occasion—during the time it began to thrive a bit I saw a bottle of Mellins' food and a tin of Nestles' milk—I asked why she had not more of Nestles—she gave no intelligible answer; she could not get it, or something of that sort—on the 28th, about midday, she brought the child to me; it was then dying; it had some kind of nightgown on, but, as far as I could see, no flannel—I told her I thought it was dying, and the only chance was to get some raw meat and squeeze the juice out and put five drops of brandy to it, and get us much of it down as she could—I did not see it again till I saw it at Professor Pepper's—in my opinion it died from insufficient food—I saw no organic disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The dirty condition was not the cause of death, or insufficient clothing, but it was not sufficiently clothed; the cause was want of food—the prisoner did not seem to take any trouble about he breast: it must have been bad for some days, perhaps a week—suckling the child from the bad breast would be poison to it—the want of the mother's milk would be prejudicial—I knew that her husband had left her—she sometimes appeared anxious about the child—the day before its death she said it had been vomiting, and I could see that it had—I was not told of vomiting or diarrhea until then—I think she had every opportunity of feeding it, as far as her position went.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> For the first nine days it was going on very well—the prisoner was quite sober the whole of that time—I thought the vomiting arose from being without food for some time, and what little there was would come up again from the critical state of the stomach—it could take artificial food, and it did take it.</p>

I live at 13, Wimpole Street—on January 3rd, in company of Dr. Thomas, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of a female child, apparently about fourteen weeks old—I weighed it, it weighed 4lbs. 8oz.—the normal weight of a child of that age would be quite double that—there was no organic disease, all the organs were perfectly healthy—the stomach and intestines were empty, except a little mucus—there was one slight flake of milk, a very small curd; it was quite clear that it died from insufficient food—I saw no reason why it should be incapable of taking artificial food.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The weight of a child fourteen weeks old would not be much more than at birth—a small child does not necessarily mean an unhealthy or undeveloped child—the mother having a bad breast would not tell against it, if the supply from it was stopped in time and artificial food resorted to—if the mother had not sufficient milk for it, that would tell against it—it would be very improper to suckle it at all if the mother had a bad breast—it would tend to check the child if it had had a good start—I should say it had not vomited much—I only saw it on 3rd</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horsekeeper, of 7. Farrady Road, Kensington—on 14th January, about 12.30 a.m., I left a friend at the corner of Talbot Road, Notting Hill, and was going along Portobello Road—I crossed the road, and had just got off the pavement, when three young <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> got hold of me—two held me down, while the third rifled my pockets, and took 3s. 6d. in silver, and a ring, key, and knife—I was not hurt—the prisoners are two of them—they ran away; I ran after them, but lost them, and went back with a constable, and saw some men coining—I said, "Here they are," and they ran round the square—we ran after them, and overtook Neal—I told him I should charge him with being concerned with two others in robbing me—I have no doubt he is one of the men—there is a lamp six or seven yards from where I was pulled down—on January 15th I went to the station, and saw some men standing in a row, and picked out Atkinson—I have no doubt whatever about him—another man, named Griffin, was charged, but I could not swear to him, and the Magistrate discharged him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is a market on Saturday evenings adjacent to Portobello Road—I had not been shopping or marketing: I was coming from Pembridge Square, and met a man who had hurt his ankle, and asked me to assist him home—the prisoners are two of the three men who I saw coming towards the constable and me—the place where I spoke to Neal was not more than a minute's walk from where I was assaulted; about 100 yards—that was a quarter of an hour afterwards—I don't think it was twenty minutes—when I came upon Neal he was walking—I said that the third man was the man to the best of my belief, and I am still of that opinion, but the Magistrate discharged him.</p>

I did not see the barge first; I rowed up to her. It was at the Middle Hole, the Church tier. I got on board. The barge was not made fast to another barge. There was no one on board. I did not ask two men to let go of the barge. I was with my co-plaintiff Robinson, who remained in the skiff; I had a conversation with a man there. There was no one in charge of the barge. It was 500 yards off where. I fastened her. I was on board one and a-half hours. I called on Mr. Francis. I know a man named Millan, I did not know he was in the employ of Francis. I saw Millan in the evening. I told him where the barge was. I did say I saved a barge. I made a claim through my solicitors.

                  </hi>. I live at 40, North Bank—I have known the prisoner ten or eleven years—I have been convicted more than once—in 1888 I as sentenced to five years' penal servitude at Middlesex Sessions—that was since I have known the prisoner—I shall have been out of prison two years next month—I have seen the prisoner in London, and at race meetings generally—about 13th or 14th December, I met him in Endell Street; we went and had a drink, and some conversation passed—he said times were very bad, and he had been doing very bad—I told him I would give him a bit of gold for Christmas—I don't think he knew my address then; I did not tell it to him—I next saw him on Thursday night, 21st December, at 7.30 or 7.40, at the comer of North Bank and Park Road—I was waiting to go for the doctor, walking up and down North Bank; my wife was expecting to be confined; there was a nurse in the house—the prisoner was with Steve McShon, whom I had known for some time; I had seen him at race meetings—the prisoner said, "Give us that fiver you promised me"—I said, "I have no fivers to</p>

               <p>give away; they are hard enough to get now, and I have domestic affliction in the house too"—he said, "Well, I am going to have some-thing; you had better treat us"—we went to the Red House Hotel, fifty or sixty yards off, and into the private bar, which has a glass partition all round, except where they put the glasses on the counter—I paid for cigars and drinks for them two or three times—the prisoner said he was going to have money—I said, "It is no good you asking me for a fiver; I have no fivers to give away. If you had come and asked me for the gold I promised you in Endell Street you should have had it; now you shall have nothing"—he said, "You are money and misery"—when paying for the drink I put down coppers on the bar and retained the silver in my hand—the prisoner said, "You had better put down some gold to pay for it," and swept the coppers from the bar—I did not put down any gold—he took this pearl pin, which I was wearing, from my scarf and said, "Is this good" or "right"? and hit the water-jug with it, and put it in the muffler he was wearing, and kept it—then I took this watch out of my pocket to look at the time—he snatched it, and broke the chain, taking the watch and about two inches of chain, from me—he struck me on my right ear with his fist, and on my private parts with his knee, saying, "If you open your mouth I will dash in your brains with this," meaning the glass he had in his hand—I was in fear of him—McShon was sitting on a stool all this time; he took no part in the matter, only laughing at what the prisoner did; he could have stopped it if he wished—I was in pain from the blow on the ear; it did not hurt me particularly; I felt more pain from the blow with his knee—he put my watch in his left-hand coat pocket—I said, "If that is your game I will be back in ten minutes," and left the house—I was wearing a cap and an Irish frieze coat—I went home, about 120 yards off, exchanged my cap for a hat, and took a cab and drove to Molyneux Street Police-station—I made a statement which the inspector took in writing—I described the loss of my watch and pin—my ear was then swollen—a sergeant and constable were sent with me—we went back to the public-house, but could not see the prisoner or McShon there—I had bought the watch from Mr. Parr, a pawnbroker in Great College Street—on Saturday night, 23rd December, I was sent for, and went to Molyneux Street Station, where I saw the prisoner in custody, and I charged him with stealing my watch and pin—he said, "Why don't you charge the other man with me?"—he said I was a b—bastard, and that he would have his own back—he used other language like that—he was detained in custody—next day, Sunday, a party of three or five men came and had some conversation with me—on the morning of 25th McShon spoke to me in Lisson Grove, and the same day the men who had been the day before came again—three of them came into the house—next morning I found my pin in the carpet in the room into which they had been—it was stuck through a piece of paper—Windsor Races were on Thursday and Friday, the 21st and 22nd, I think—my watch is in the same condition as it was when it left me—it had a swivel, to which the chain was attached—I had not recovered it on the morning of Boxing Day—on Boxing Day morning I went to Marylebone Police-court, and made a statement before Mr. Newton, the Magistrate, with regard to the charge, in the prisoner's presence—that statement was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050032"/>
               <p>not true—I made it because my windows had been broken, and my brass bell-pulls had been thrown through the windows, and I had received threats—I said that I had lost nothing, and had found my watch and pin at home in the drawer, and it was all through drink, and I wished to withdraw the charge—Mr. Newton heard some further evidence, and then remanded the case, so that the prosecution was taken out of my hands—I have not seen McShon since the matter was taken up by the authorities—I last saw him on Boxing Day outside the Court; I never saw him at the Court—some of the people were there who had been to my house on Christmas Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have lent and given the prisoner money on several occasions: he never repaid me a farthing—when I met him on the Thurs<lb/>day he referred to the money I had promised to give him—he mentioned the conversation of ten days before—his first words were, "Where is the fiver you promised me?"—I might have told the Magistrate that when he asked for the fiver he never referred to the previous conversation, but I know it was mentioned during the evening—I went to the Red House through his invitation—if I said before "Sadler said, 'Come and treat us;' I might have said, 'Come and drink;' it was a mutual desire," it is correct—a barmaid served us—I believe two people were serving in the public-house; I did not take particular notice—there are five or six different bars; it is a large house—no one was in the compartment we were in but McShon, the prisoner, and I—I could hear sounds of people in the next bar but one, not the next one—it is a horse-shoe shaped bar—when he asked for the fiver in the road I said, "I am not going to give you any fiver," and afterwards I said, "You will get nothing from me"—I went to the divisional Police-station half a mile away—I did not go to the other station 150 yards from my house; it would have been no use going there—when I was talking to the prisoner and McShon in the road a constable passed and stopped, and saw us standing there; nothing had hap<lb/>pened then to make me afraid—I was not really in fear then; I was when he asked me for the £5 in the public-house—I showed my bruised ear at the Police-station; I mentioned the name of McShon there—I told the Magistrate on the Tuesday morning: "This morning I found my watch and pin in a drawer in my own house; I have lost nothing. When I went home on Thursday last I hid my jewellery and since then I have found it"—that was false; I made the statement on oath—Mr. Newton bound me over to prosecute on the next occasion—I might have told Drew that if he came home with me I would give him the watch—that was a lie; I had no watch to give him—he told the Magistrate he was going with me to see if it were true—he did not go home with me—a week afterwards I told Mr. Plowden that I desired to charge the prisoner; that was in consequence of my bell-pulls being torn off and my windows broken—I told Mr. Plowden a man was present who saw all of it, and there was; I meant McShon—I said, "He is here close to the Court '—I had just left him outside—when I left the witness box Drew gave evidence, and then asked for a remand—I cannot say if McShon is here to-day—on the second occasion Drew applied to Mr. Plowden to certify for legal aid; on the third occasion he asked for further time—since this matter was committed for trial—I appeared at Marylebone Police-court as prosecutor upon a charge against</p>

               <p>two young women for larceny—I swore I had seen them robbing me, and my property was found on them—the Magistrate said he had very great doubt about the case, considering the very trivial nature of the charge—if I had asked for a conviction I should have got it—he said he was clearly of opinion that no jury would convict—the two ladies had been to my house to see Colonel Buller, who had half my house—neither of the ladies had lodged with him—I told the Magistrate that one of them had been robbing the Colonel; they went to the house, and took his cheque-book—Colonel Buller was my only lodger—Miss Fenton was there formerly—Colonel Buller had only recently come home from a sea voyage—I cannot say if he was a customer of Leroy et Fils, jewellers, of Bond Street—I do not know Edward Thomas, or any man who passed by that name, who was sentenced at the North London Sessions to three years' penal servitude not a month ago—I do not know that he obtained a ring from Leroy et Fils by saying he was introduced by their customer, Colonel Buller—I do not know Norton, who was sentenced here to ten years' penal servitude for forgeries two sessions ago—I never heard of a lady in my house receiving a cheque which got to Norton, who imitated it, and perpetrated a forgery on Cox and Co.—I know nothing about it—I was suspected of a jewel robbery at the Grand Hotel—I was placed among a number of other men and the cabman could not recognise me—I had nothing to do with it—I had five years' penal servitude in connection with the attempted robbery of Mr. Wilson Barrett's furniture—I and another man were charged with stealing, and an auctioneer with receiving it—we were all convicted—before that I had undergone five years' penal servitude—very soon after I came out of prison I began to go to racecourses—I might have been two or three days a week at race meetings, and hard at work the rest of the week, or I might be at race meetings all the days of a week—I am a bookmaker—I was dealing in stuff goods last week and this morning; there is no racing now—I have not been on a racecourse for six months—I deal with twenty of the largest houses in London in stuff goods—I have bought two hundred yards this morning—I often buy jewellery; I ask questions about it, and get receipts—when I have made bets on a racecourse I have always been there to pay—I don't know Mr. Buckley. (<hi rend="italic">A man was called into Court</hi>)—I know that man—I made a bet with him, and paid him £15 out of £20 after a dispute, and he was glad to take it—I know Brewster—he never supplied me with money; it is the other way—I had money before I went into penal servitude, and I have got it now—I only go to those races where I think I can earn anything.</p>

               <p>22nd December I noticed among descriptions of persons wanted that Frederick Sadler was wanted for stealing a watch and scarf-pin from the person—I had no knowledge of whom the larceny was from—about five p.m. on Saturday, 23rd December, I went into a public-house in Oxford Street, where I saw the prisoner, whom I knew previously—I said, "Sadler, I am going to take you into custody for stealing a watch and pearl scarf pin from a person on Thursday last"—he said, "Which person?"—I said, I don't know"—he said, "You are a f—you do know"—I said, "I don't know"—he said, "Where is your warrant?"—I said, "There is no warrant required; it is a case of felony"—he said, "Let me go into the next bar and tell my brother"—there were a number of persons in the bar, and I allowed him to do so, and he said, "This is b—fine. I am <hi rend="italic">pinched</hi>"—one of the men said, "What for?"—the prisoner said, "Oh, it is that f—darky, Kemp"—one of the men said to me, "Is that who it is?"—I said, "I don't know who the person is"—the prisoner said, "You are a f—liar. You know that is who it is, and if he <hi rend="italic">prosses</hi> me I will put a knife into him when I come out"—I persuaded him to come with me quietly to the station, and he said he would—walking along Oxford Street, followed by his companions, he commenced to be violent—I got the assistance of several constables, but he got more violent still—he was sober—I took out the handcuffs, and got one on his left wrist, but he prevented me from handcuffing him properly—we took him to Marlborough Mews, where, after some difficulty, he was handcuffed—he was then taken in a cab with another officer to Molyneux Police-station, where he was detained till Kemp came and charged him—the prisoner was very violent, made use of most violent language, and plunged at Kemp to try and use violence to him—he was still handcuffed; he was restrained by a number of constables and myself—after he was charged we went to search him—it took three men to hold him down, while he kicked—we had to cut the laces of his boots to get his boots off to prevent his injuring anyone—Kemp, in the prisoner's presence, described how the prisoner had come to him when he was waiting to go for the doctor, and demanded money; that he was afraid of him, and persuaded him to go to the Red House; that while there he continued to demand money; that he (Kemp) refused to give him any, but called for drink and put down coppers, which the prisoner swept off the counter, saying he wanted something better than that; that he struck him in the face, snatched the pin out of his necktie, and wrenched the watch from the chain, and threatened to put a glass in his face if he said anything or made any alarm—Kemp said he promised he would go home to get some money for the prisoner, but instead of that he went to the Police-station and got some officers and scoured the neighbourhood to try and find the prisoner, but could not do so—the prisoner, when charged, refused to give his address or occupation—when he was in the dock he was quiet, but when we took him out four or five constables were holding him; he was very violent—he was most boisterous in manner and language, and all he said in reply to the charge was calling the prosecutor a "dirty f—convict," and what he had done for Wilson Barrett's furniture—he was more like a raving lunatic—I was at the Police-court on the Boxing Day morning—previous to that I had seen Kemp with the prisoner's companions, and called him away from them; then Kemp handed me the pin and told</p>

               <p>me something—I heard what he said to the Magistrate, and I described to the Magistrate exactly what took place, and my reason for believing why Kemp had adopted the course he took—previous to remanding the case the Magistrate bound over the prosecutor in £25 to appear on the remand—afterwards the Treasury took the matter up—I saw the broken bell-knobs; the windows had been repaired—we cannot find McShon; he has absconded from the neighbourhood; I have tried to find him—I took proceedings against two of the other men with regard to the damage to the windows and bell-knobs, but I have not been able to find them since—the Magistrate granted summonses against them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, living at 53, Amherst Road, Hackney—Ray Maud was my youngest child—she was ten months old—my family consisted of my wife and five children: Harry a boy of eight, Jonas six, Esther four and a half, Solomon a year and ten months, and the deceased—on 8th December last I had three servants, Lottie Bethel, as nursery governess, Beatrice Clark, general servant, and the prisoner, acting as nurse to the three younger children—the prisoner came into the service on Saturday, 3rd December up to that time Beatrice Clark had been in charge of the children, and from that time the prisoner took charge of the younger children—I and my wife slept in a room on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050037"/>
               <p>first floor, and on the same floor my two older boys, Harry and Jonas, slept—the third and top floor consists of three rooms: one, a day nursery, used by the children as a play-room; another a bedroom, slept in by Beatrice Clark; and the third a night nursery, in which the prisoner and the three younger children slept—on the night of 8th December I saw something wrong with the baby's face; its lips were very much swollen, its eyes were swollen, and there were one or two scratches about its face—it looked at first as if it had had a fall—Lottie Bethel brought the child down into the dining-room—my wife was present—next day, Saturday, the 9th, I spoke to the servants about it—the prisoner was one of them—I asked how she could account for the marks on the baby's face—she said, "I don't know; I don't know anything about it; I never did it"—when I came home that afternoon I found that my wife had given her notice—next day, Sunday, I was at home most of the afternoon and evening—I remember Lottie Bethel leaving the house about twenty minutes to six—she returned at ten; I let her in—about eight that evening I heard my little boy who was sleeping on the first floor call out "Mummy, mummy, baby"—my wife, who was in the dining-room with me, ran upstairs—she screamed, and I walked into the passage to see what was the matter—I saw my wife there with the baby—I took it from her—the prisoner was standing on about the third stair—the baby appeared to be choking—I turned up the gas and looked at its lips, and I could smell a kind of vinegary smell, and after smelling the mouth and looking at it I had no doubt it had been poisoned—there was nothing in its throat—I at once accused the prisoner of poisoning the child—I said, "What have you been doing to this baby again?"—she said, "Nothing, sir"—I said, "Go at once and get me the feeding bottle, or any other bottles you have in that room"—she ran upstairs and brought down a feeding bottle, and a bottle labelled "spasmodic mixture," these are the bottles (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I put them in my pocket, took the baby from her, and ran to the doctor's—Clark also ran off to the doctor's at once, and I and my wife followed with the child, leaving the prisoner in the house with the other four children—it was about twenty minutes past eight, as near as I can recollect, when I got to the doctor's—he saw the baby, and smelt it and administered an emetic; it was sick after it—he told me to take it home—I did so, and it had a bath—when we got back the prisoner said there was some white stuff on the pillow—my wife said she would have the pillow—the prisoner went upstairs to look for it, and then opened the landing window, to make one believe that it might be on the tiles somewhere; she afterwards said she could not find it—I heard the window opened, but I was not up there—search was made in the gardens—my wife went up directly, and came down and told me something, and produced this bottle labelled "Poison"; there was a very small drop of liquid in it—later on that evening, more towards morning, I received a communication from Clark—the child was taken to the hospital under the doctor's orders; he went with me, and <hi rend="italic">tracheotomy</hi> had to be performed, and it was after my return home that the communication was made to me—I sent for the police, and about one in the morning Sergeant Childs came—after he had left, about two in the morning, I had a conversation with the prisoner—but previous to that she stated to me, and repeated it then, that as she went upstairs she saw Lottie sitting in the nursery</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050038"/>
               <p>crying, and that she said to her, "What are you crying about?" and Lottie replied, "It might be my last Sunday out"—she told me that about twenty minutes to ten in the first instance, after I returned from the doctor, before I went to the hospital—she said that happened just before Lottie was going out—I said to the prisoner, "What do you mean by telling me that Lottie was crying?" and she said, "I don't know"—I said, "You had better tell me what you know about this matter; I am determined to find out the truth"—she replied, "I know nothing about it, sir; I never did it"—that was the conversation, and that was repeated about two in the morning—after I returned from the hospital I questioned the three servants, and they all seemed to say they knew nothing about it—on Monday afternoon, about three, after receiving the communication from Clark, I called the prisoner and Clark into the drawing-room, and said to both of them, looking at Newber, "There have been so many lies told yesterday; here are two pieces of paper; if you want to say anything further about the case you can write it down, and, you quite understand, after you have done so I shall hand them over to the police. Please yourselves whether you will do so or not," and I left them—just before that the prisoner had said to me, "I want to tell you something. I did punch the baby about on the night of the 8th; I did punch it in the face and eyes, but I am sure I did not give it the poison"—Clark was standing there; I said to the prisoner, "What did you mean by telling Beatrice that you saw little Solomon with a bottle in his hand labelled poison"—she said, "Yes, sir, that was a lie, I know; I knew that was a lie when I said it"—before she wrote her statement she stated that she saw Beatrice Clark standing between the bedstead and the cradle, giving baby something out of a cup—I am not sure whether Clark was present then—she said she had undressed Esther and put her to bed, and the baby began to cry after she had been in the room a few minutes, and she hushed it to sleep, and the next she taw was, it was choking, and froth was coming from its mouth—after that it was that I told them to write statements; they went into different rooms to do so—when the prisoner had written hers, she said, "There it is, sir; that is all I know about it."(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Baby was so cross that I slapped it on the face, but I can't say how the scratches came on her face. I got her to sleep, and came downstairs, and stayed in the kitchen till it was time to go to bed; and then, when Lottie saw the baby's face, she brought her downstairs to you. I had been playing in the front room with the children until mistress came up and looked at them, and then told me to get the water and wash them. I did so; I had washed Esther and started oil Harry when mistress called me, and told me she wanted me to go on an errand, and I left the children and came downstairs. I went on the errand, and before I went up again nurse came down and went into the baby's room. I went up, and had hardly been upstairs three or four minutes when baby cried as usual, and then I heard mistress call me, and I went to the top of the staircase, and mistress asked me if I was up there, and I answered yes, and ran back to the baby, and found her as if she could not get her breath, and from her mouth came white stuff. I picked her up, and went to the top of the stairs and called mistress twice, and then Harry called, and then mistress called up to me, 'Bring her down,' and I done so; but as to anything else, I know nothing. That is all the truth")—after hearing</p>

               <p>that, I said to her, "Is that all?"—the police were then sent for, and after they arrived, she said, "I have forgotten something! I have forgotten something!" I said, What do you mean?"—she said, "About Beatrice Clark"—then I think I threw the paper down, and she picked it up, and wrote this at the back: "I went into the bedroom to get Esther the chamber, and I saw nurse giving the baby something out of a cup. I asked nurse what it was, and she said "milk"—Clark was the nurse up to the time the prisoner was engaged—it was between three and four in the afternoon when she made that addition—the police left, and returned about seven or eight, when the prisoner was charged and taken to the station—she was first charged with assault and administering poison with intent to do grievous bodily harm—the baby died on the 12th at the hospital, and the charge was then altered to the present.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would be impossible to say how many statements the prisoner made to me, five or six or more; she kept running up and making statements and saying all manner of things—I have only this one in writing; for the others I have to depend on my memory—I don't think she has cleared the character of Beatrice Clark—I don't think she said that what she had said about her was a lie—she said that she saw Clark giving something to the baby at seven, and baby was not taken seriously ill till about eight—I don't know the prisoner's age; I have heard that she is fourteen—I hope I and my wife treated her kindly—I had very grave suspicions that she had inflicted the bruises on the baby on the 8th—a little more care was taken afterwards—she was alone with the child at that time—she has always denied administering anything to it; she has never wavered from that in all her statements—the child was taken ill at eight, or a little after—when my wife screamed Clark ran from the area steps to the doctor's—my wife ran from the top of the steps, and gave me this bottle—the prisoner would know that we were going for the doctor; she was left in the house alone—we were gone very likely half-an-hour—if she had wished to get rid of the bottle of poison she had ample opportunity of doing so—I did not charge her at eight o'clock with poisoning the baby—I can hardly say that I suspected her then—it was on the Monday after twelve when I noticed the froth from the month—I asked her what she had done immediately she brought it down—I don't know whether I have men<lb/>tioned the word "again" before to-day, when I said, "What have you been doing to this baby?" I daresay I did—I think I said it at the Police-court—no doubt my memory was more clear then than now—I don't know how I came to omit the word before the Magistrate—it referred to the ill-usage—the marks began to show very plainly on the 10th—we were rather upset at the time, and it is very difficult to know what I did say—so far as I believe I did use the word "again"—I think the baby was a good, quiet child, and gave no trouble.</p>

Has the baby had a fall? Has she knocked herself?"—she said, No; she knew nothing of it—next day, Saturday, I discharged her—she had only come for a week on trial—she was very distressed; she cried bitterly, and begged of me to allow her to remain; she was terrified at going home; in fact, she said she could not go home, she had nowhere to go to—I said she might get a situation, but I could not keep her beyond the week, and on those conditions she stayed on—on the Sunday I was at home the whole afternoon and evening—I remember Lottie Bethell going out about twenty minutes to six; I don't know who let her out; I was in the breakfast parlour—about seven I went upstairs to see if the children were all right—I found Solomon in his cot, and baby in her cradle, both asleep—baby was in her usual attitude, and quite quiet—the prisoner and the three elder children were in the day nursery—Clark had just given us our tea in the breakfast parlour, and I left her downstairs—after seeing that the children were all right, I came down into my bedroom—I called the prisoner down and sent her on an errand, for some bread; she was not absent more than five or six minutes, she left Esther with me; when she came back she came into my bedroom, and took Esther in her arms—Clark came into my room with the children and put the two boys to bed in the room adjoining mine, and the prisoner went upstairs with the baby; that was about twenty minutes past seven, as near as I could tell—about five or six minutes after she had gone up I heard baby cry—I was coming out of my bedroom, coming upstairs—I called up "Emily, are you there?"—she replied, "Yes, ma'am"—I begged her to try and keep baby quiet—I said, "Whatever made you leave baby, why not keep in your bedroom?"—she was out of the night nursery at the time—baby stopped crying almost directly, and I went down to my husband in the dining-room—I remained there between twenty minutes and half-an-hour—I heard Harry call, "Mamma!"—I went out of the room; he said something to me—I was going upstairs and called, "Emily, what is the matter with baby?"—she called out, "Baby is choking; there is some white froth on the pillow"—I said, "Oh, bring her down quickly"—she brought her down, and I saw that the child was frothing at the mouth, and the lips Mere swollen, and she had great difficulty in breath<lb/>ing—my husband spoke to the prisoner, and took the baby from me—I shrieked, and I said to the prisoner, "What is this again? I thought we had sufficient on Friday night"—I called down to Clark in the kitchen, "Run for the doctor, quickly," and she went; and I and my husband also went with the baby, leaving the prisoner behind with the other children—we got to the doctor's about twenty minutes or half-past eight—I afterwards went home with the baby—I said to the prisoner, "Where is the pillow? Baby has been poisoned; you must find it"—I sent her up to get it—she said she could not find it; upon that I went up to the night nursery, to the baby's cot, and found the pillow there all right, and no sign on it of anything white; it was in the same condition as in it had been in the evening—I intended going into the day nursery, but Clark's room being directly opposite, I saw that her room was in con<lb/>fusion, and things lying about, which caused me to go into her room, and</p>

I entered the service of Mr. Myers last October as nursemaid—on 2nd December, when the prisoner came, I became general servant—I remained there down to Sunday, 10th December—I took a box with me to the house in October—I slept at the top of the house in a room by myself—I placed the box in my bedroom—there was a work-basket and a work-box in it; the basket had no lid to it, the box had—the basket contained needles and cotton, and a bottle of poison—this is the bottle—I bought it about a year and eighteen months before October—I had a wart on my face, and I used this to remove the wart—I bought two pennyworth, I used about half of it, up to the red mark, up to the label; I then put it back in the work-basket in the box, and there it was, as far as I know, down to Friday, 8th December—on that day the prisoner asked me to lend her an apron—I told her she would find one in my box; I had half-a-dozen there, which I had given her—the box was unfastened, not locked—I did not see her go to the box; she must have done so, for I saw her afterwards wearing one of the aprons—one evening during the week she asked me for a reel of cotton; I am not sure whether that was before or after the apron; I did not go with her to look for it; I know she brought it down, she was doing some work with one of the reels that had been in the work-basket—there was some phosphorous paste in the house for killing rats or mice—one evening when we were working to<lb/>gether</p>

               <p>in the kitchen, the prisoner was cleaning down a shelf, she got down this paste, it had a label on it; she asked me what it was, I told her it was phosphorous paste—she asked me if it would poison anybody—I said I thought it would, as far as I knew—I believe she put it back again—on Sunday, the 10th, I was in the house in the afternoon—it was Lottie's evening out, and she was going to take a letter for me to the post, and it wanted a stamp, I went up to my room between five and half-past to look for one, I turned out the things from my box on to the floor, but could not find one—the prisoner and the three elder children were in the room—Lottie came in, and asked me for the letter; I said I could not find a stamp, and she gave me one, and I went down with her, and let her out at the front door—I had left my things on the floor—the prisoner followed us down the stairs, and the children as well; I left them on the landing, and I and Lottie went down, and I let her out about twenty minutes to six—I did not see her again till ten that night, when she came back—after letting her out I returned to my room upstairs; nobody was there at that time—the things were still on the floor in the same condition as I had left them; I left them there, and went upstairs to wash and dress myself—I then came down, leaving the things still on the floor, in disorder—that was about half-past six—I went into the dining-room to put things straight, and then went into the kitchen—I remained there for about a quarter of an hour, and I was called up by Mrs. Myers to her bedroom to wash <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, while the prisoner went out on an errand—that was between a quarter to seven and seven—I washed the boys, and put them to bed in the room next to Mrs. Myers' bedroom—that took a little time—after that I went straight down into the kitchen—I met the prisoner coming up the stairs to Mrs. Myers' bedroom, as I came down from washing my hands at the top of the house—I did not go to the top floor at all after washing the children—I washed them in the day nursery, and brought them down, and put them to bed—when I met the prisoner I came down as far as the hall, and mistress called me to take up a brush and comb, and then I went back to the kitchen, and remained there till the prisoner called out about the baby, and something on the pillow, and Mrs. Myers called out to me to go to the doctor—I went to Dr. Gimblet, and after that returned home—later in the evening or early morning I saw Mr. Myers, and he told me he wished to find out the truth—the prisoner was there at the time, we were together—during the night I told the prisoner that she must have done something to the child, or it never could have been found like that—she replied she knew nothing about it—when Mrs. Myers brought the bottle into the room, and showed it me, I said it was mine, and the prisoner told me that she saw Solomon running about in the nursery with one in his hand, with a red label on it, and she described the bottle to me accurately—as far as I know, it had not been shown to me at that time—next day I heard that she had said that she saw me give the child something in a cup—I heard that on the Monday, I don't know whether it was about twelve, or in the afternoon—after that I was called up by the master, and asked to write something—the prisoner and I were there together, and we each wrote a statement and handed them to the master—after that Sergeant Nursey came, and in his presence the prisoner said she saw me give the child something out of a cup—I said</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the R. C. P., practising at 34, Pembury Road, Clapton—on Sunday, 10th December, about 10.30 p.m., the deceased child was brought to my surgery by Mr. and Mrs. Myers and a servant—I examined the child and found it suffering from shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, and there were marks of redness about the side of the mouth—I clearly saw that it was suffer<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>from some pain, some injury done to the lips and mouth by some corro<lb/>sive poison; there was a strong smell of acetic acid, and I noticed a strong smell of it about the chemise, and there was contraction of the pupils—since the examination I came to the conclusion that it was consistent with the administration of acetic acid—at the time I was doubtful whether some morphia had not been administered in that mixture, but there was nothing in it—I was shown the feeding bottle—I gave the child an emetic, and also something to neutralise the effect of the acid; it was sick freely—I then gave it back to the parents, with certain directions—about eleven I went to their house and saw the child again—I examined the lips and the tongue and found marks of corrosion very evident—I attended to it till one in the morning—I then saw there was a probability of tracheotomy being necessary, and I advised them to take it to the hospital, that the operation might be performed at the proper time—I accompanied them there—I saw the house surgeon, and called his attention to the con<lb/>tracted pupils, the smell of the breath, and other things—at the time I went to the hospital two bottles were brought, and subsequently a third bottle, which contained strong acetic acid—this is it, labelled "Poison"—tracheotomy was performed about three in the morning—it died on Tuesday evening, the 13th, at six—on the 14th I attended the post<lb/>mortem with the house surgeon—the tongue, the palate, and the tonsils were corroded with acid, and inflamed; also the stomach—the cause of death was bronchial pneumonia, caused by strong acetic acid as that in the bottle—the effect would be to cause great pain—the child would cry out directly it was administered—it must have been administered quite recently; within half-an-hour—the amount of burning would show approximately the time at which the acid had been given—it was brought to me about half-past ten—in my opinion it had been just given, and sub<lb/>sequently the teat of the bottle had been put into the mouth—there was a slight smell of acid on the teat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A very small quantity of this acid, a teaspoonful, or probably less, would be enough to cause death—assuming it had been poured into the mouth, it would make the child cough and sick almost instantaneously—if it was coughing the teat would not remain in the mouth—assuming that the child had the bottle in its hand, it might possibly be able to put it to its mouth, and if so, precisely the same symptoms would be found—there was excoriation on the neck—if the acid had been poured into the mouth, it might cause corrosive marks on the neck, because it would dribble, and there was evidence of its running down the left side of the mouth—there were marks on the face and on the lips, from the dribble from the mouth—girls between thirteen and fourteen frequently have their periods, more often later—they are then frequently given to hysteria, and might have hallucinations; it in part of the disease.</p>

Baby was in the cot in the next room, on the top floor, when mistress called me down, and sent me on an errand. I was gone about a quarter of an hour. When I returned mistress told me to take Esther to bed. I did so, to the same room where baby was lying. I was in the room about four minutes before the child made any noise. It first commenced to cry, and then appeared to be choking. I then called mistress, and a doctor was sent for. Beatrice was sent to the nursery to wash Joey, when I went on the errand, and on my return, as I was going upstairs, I saw her entering the first floor bed-room with him, taking him to bed. I believe she had just brought him from the nursery"—That was all she said then—about four that afternoon I called again at Amherst Road—I was sent for by Mr. Myers, and he handed me the paper written in pencil by the prisoner and signed by her—I at once sent for the prisoner and Clark; I saw them together—I said to the prisoner, "I understand you have something you wish to say to me"—she said, "Yes, when I saw Beatrice giving the baby something out of a cup"—I said, "When was that?"—she said, "Last night, about seven o'clock, she was standing by the side of the cot, with her back towards the door—Clark said, "I never gave the child anything out of a cup; I never went near the cot, it is a lie"—she seemed very indignant at the accusa<lb/>tion—later in the day I went to the house again—I had a conversation with Dr. Gimblet first, about seven or half-past)—I saw the prisoner and told her I should arrest her, and she was charged with violently assau<lb/>lting the child, Ray Maud Myers, on the 8th, and that she would be further charged with administering poison to it on the 10th, with intent to murder it—she said, "I did not do it"—I took her to the station, where she was charged, and when the charge was read over to her she said, "I never, I never, I never done such a thing"—I was present at the inquest, the prisoner was there; she was asked if she wished to give evidence, she declined.</p>

It is very difficult to say how many women out of a hundred would have hysteria at that period—it depends upon the climate and the circumstances—there are very isolated forms of hysteria which would not bring on such signs, perhaps not one in a thousand—if they do suffer from it there would be outward and visible signs of it—telling a lie would not be one—if a doctor examined the patient several times he might find it out: seeing her once would not be sufficient—if a servant in your own home had hysteria you would notice it—a master or a mistress would see something of it from her appearance or manner.</p>

Anchor, Drummond Street, and Mr. Acton handed me this document, No. 4, which I took to my solicitor—I subse<lb/>quently received a communication from Messrs. Ralph, Stacey and Carter, Mr. Acton's solicitors—I did not give the prisoner any other bills than the two I gave him at Mr. Sowden's office.</p>

               <p>money on mortgages—it is not the case that the Magistrate, in dis<lb/>missing the charge against the prisoner, addressed very strong remarks to me—he in the first instance refused the warrant which I applied for—my solicitor applied for the warrant—I do not recollect saying before the Magistrate, "I do not know that the Magistrate dismissed the warrant"—before I obtained the warrant I had sworn an information by my solicitor's advice—I believe I swore at the Police-court that the Magistrate said he refused to grant a warrant unless I satisfied him that I could not find Mr. Barrington Nichols, and upon that he granted his warrant—on May 12th, 1892, I appeared at Maryle<lb/>bone Police-court with my solicitor, to prosecute the defendant—I do not remember that the Magistrate said that gross deceit had been practised in obtaining the warrant, or that he said anything about being deceived; I do not believe he did—he dismissed my case, but I do not know whether he did so before Mr. Palmer's cross-examination had concluded—I will not take my oath that I was re-examined by my solicitor, but I think I was—I swore, "The said Barrington Nichols has also stolen the license of the said premises, and taken it away with him"—that was true, and I told the Magistrate so the next day, and after I had given my evidence he dismissed the charge—on the following day I applied for a summons, which was refused—I subsequently applied with Counsel and it was refused, as before—it was then that the action was brought against me, in which I made a counter claim for £1,316 10s. 6d., and judgment was obtained against me for £75, but I believe the costs were reserved—I do not recollect that the Jury found me guilty of malice towards the prisoner—the £1,316 was not a fictitious claim on my part; it was a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> claim, which was gone into by the accountant, which I was in a position to establish, and yet I settled the plaintiffs claim for £60 and two bills; I had so much worry, and it appeared that the prisoner was a man of straw—Mr. Sowden advised me to settle the matter—he had known me six or eight months—I do not know whether he knew that I had a counter claim for £1,316—after the verdict I met Mr. Sowden, and asked him to settle it, but did not employ him as my agent—I was present at the action, and Mr. Von Sanden, a friend of mine; he was not a witness in the case—the prisoner was present—Mr. Sowden drew up this receipt in my presence; he advised me to drop my claim altogether, and to pay my own costs—I became acquainted with Mr. Sowden by his selling the public-house, before the prisoner came into my employ—he has not done other business for me—I wanted to sell the public-house shortly after the prisoner came in—I was at Mr. Sowden's office three or four times between June 9th and October 9th; he said that the prisoner wanted more money as compensation—I applied by Counsel for a warrant, and the Magistrate said it was not required; if he had been guilty of felony, give him in custody—he deposited £75 when he first went into my employ<lb/>ment, and afterwards said that it belonged to his mother-in-law—instead of handing it over, he handed me a receipt for the amount—I do not think the prisoner swore at the trial that he gave me notice to leave; I gave him notice—the money he handed over to me on the day he left my service was the alleged balance after deducting the deposit—I applied for a warrant after the money had been handed over to Mr. Payne—I have</p>

               <p>never lent Sowden money; I went to his office two or three times between May and October, because he wanted to know how the case was settled—I just called in as I was passing, and he said that Nichols wanted £100 more—I know nothing about Mr. Sowden's financial position—I heard him gave evidence at the Police-court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a public-house broker, at 30, Great James Street—I know the prisoner and prosecutor—I had a meeting at which they, were both present with Mr. Hoppy—a receipt was given which was drawn up in my writing, and signed by the prisoner—Mr. Bernstein had paid the prisoner £60—except the two promissory notes which are filled up in my writing, I did not give him, or see Nicholls give him, any pro<lb/>missory note whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never gave Nichols but these two promissory notes, and I never told him that Mr. Bernstein was hard up, and I would try and get him some more afterwards—I said that Bernstein had had such serious losses at the Prince of Wales that I should have great difficulty to get the money—I did not tell him I would try and get some more afterwards; I thought I did very well for him—the prisoner did not call on me afterwards, and clamour for more money—I have not seen Bernstein three times since—I think he called at my office once or twice—I went through my call-book—I never called on him—he promised me an honorarium for settling these things, and I wrote to him—he has not paid it in full—I have not borrowed money from Nichols—I said at the Police-court that two £5 cheques were returned—I said, "I have never borrowed money from Nichols. I never gave him cheques that were returned through the bank; I gave him two cheques, and they were returned dishonoured"—he had the money given to him to buy a public-house, and the transaction was delayed a long time—he came to me afterwards, and said, "I have got a house in Bartholomew Close, but I have no money"—I said, "I have no money I can give you"—he said, "If you will give me a cheque, I will take it to a friend, and he will hold it till I can take it up," and I gave him the cheque—he came to me a week afterwards, and said that the cheque had been paid—I said, "It is very unfortunate; what shall I do?" and I gave him a fresh cheque—he said that Mr. Plater had arranged the whole thing; the two cheques were pinned together, and he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050052"/>
               <p>would bring them to me; but after that I found that he had never been to Mr. Plater at all, but he went to someone else and got the money, and put it in his pocket; and as to the £100 he had to buy the public house, he put that in his pocket, and I never had a halfpenny of it—I did not intend that he should obtain money on the cheques at the time I gave them, but he told me he could get money on them, and he did—I never borrowed money of Nichols—he has not lent me small sums, nor did I give him the cheque for £5 and ask him to get it cashed, and give me £2 10s. of it, nor did he give me the £2 10s. outside Mr. Plater's house, the Chester Arms, Albany Street, nor did I give him the other £5 cheque to settle it—I never saw Nichols after I gave him the cheques at the end of September or the beginning of October—he was not trying about that time to get me to get money from Bernstein—I never saw this cheque till it was put into my hands at the Police-court, and there is an alteration in the date—Nicholls did not tell me that if I could get a further sum from Mr. Bernstein he would give me some of it—Nichols has paid me £10; I have not been paid very much by Mr. Bernstein yet, he agreed to give me four guineas, and said that that was all he could afford, but he has only paid me £1 Is, and if I had been paid £50 it would not have been enough for the trouble I have had—Nichols did not say that he would give me more money if I could get him more money; they walked up the street, and I had hard work to get him £100; he only offered £70—he offered £150 originally—no solicitor appeared in connection with the settlement—I was asked to mediate between the two; they were equally anxious to get the matter settled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting—I have compared this document with Mr. Bernstein's writing, and I say that it is not his signature; there is no attempt to imitate it—I have compared Nichols' writing with the writing on No. 4, and I believe the person who wrote this "G.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050053"/>
               <p>Bernstein" on No. 4 is the same person who wrote the body of the bill, because the initial "J" agrees with the "J" in "July" in document No. 8—the "B" in "Bernstein" I take to be a disguised form of the "B" in "Barry" in the same document, and the "r" in "Bernstein" agrees with the first "r" in "Barry" in the same document—the "s" in "Bernstein" is round and agrees with the "s" in "Lordship" on the same document—there is a dash under the name Bernstein, with a dot under the end of it and on the same document there are two dashes and a single dot underneath; there are two dots after the initial "J," and two after the initial "B" on No. 9; there are also two dots in this one, but they are horizontal and the others are vertical—it is a most uncommon thing for a man to make dots after his name—in this blotting-book, found on the prisoner, No. 7, there are blottings of the name "B. Nicholls"; they do not show the two dots—the blottings are similar to the prisoner's signature—it is the reverse way, and not so easy to see without a looking-glass—there is also on the blotting-paper" £"for pounds and some figures, and "value received" under" £20."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That has no connection with value received on that bill—there are no dots on the blotter, only one after "B.," not after Barry—I do not remember ever seeing two dots after an initial before, and it struck me as very singular—there is one dot after "Barry" in No. 8, but none after Nicholls—it is within my experience that a person may write his signature in various ways—there would be nothing singular in a man writing "B. Nicholls," joining the B on to the N—the figures 2 and 0 did not strike me as singular, as a bill had been written for £20—the two "r's" in the same document are imperfectly formed; there is no shoulder to them—I suggest that there is such a similarity that the same hand wrote both—there is a dash under "Bernstein," and I connect that with a similar dash on the same document after "value received"—I call a dash writing—the two dashes look as if they were made at the same time—there is a distinct difference in the quantity of ink, but not in the colour—so far as the depth of colour is concerned, both the dash in the body of the bill and under the signature were made at the same time, but very likely with a different pen—I think the "J" in "J. Bernstein" agrees wonderfully with the "J" in "July"—No. 4, the alleged forged bill, is in a common style of writing—I say that "Bernstein" is in a slightly disguised writing—it might be written by any person, but I have compared it with the admitted writing of the prisoner—if I could not find any similarities, I did not look for dissimilarities—I will not say that I am infallible—I was called and sworn in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and Parnell commission, and then asked to retire—I was called on behalf of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I was concerned for the prosecution in the case of Dring, before Commissioner Kerr, and there was an acquittal, although the documents were forged—I had a great many reasons, more than I have to-day—the only document I have compared the writings with is one admitted to be in the defendant's writing—in this D all the up stroke is on this side of the down stroke.</p>

Nichols," and a dot under it, and on July 18th here is a curved dash, with a dot hanging from it, like a pendant—on this sheet (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>), here are two dots horizontal between the "B" and the "Nichols," and the next is the same, a simple dash underneath—in No. 4, the alleged forged bill, the indorsement is "Barry Nichols," with a dash underneath, and a dot horizontal.</p>

                  </hi>. I and Francis Parloski are partners in the firm of Braun and Francis, manufacturers of bamboo furniture, 92 and 94, Tabernacle Street, Finsbury—Mr. Francis is unable to write—in December the prisoner had been in our service for about ten months—his duties were to take out goods, sell them, and receive the money, which he was to give to me on the same day, as soon as he arrived back at the warehouse—we waited till he came back—the goods he did not sell he would replace in the warehouse—I opened a banking account in May, 1893—the prisoner knew of that—before I opened it the prisoner would endorse cheques in my absence from town—since May Mr. Francis has received the cheques and kept them till my return, except on one occasion from the 1st to the 4th August, when the prisoner had permission to endorse, as I was away—I was in town on 24th August; between 4th and 24th August, I had received cheques which I had endorsed myself—I do not remember receiving any through the prisoner between those dates—the prisoner knew I was in town on 24th August; he saw me and paid cash over to me—Edward Gregg, of Fulham Road, is one of my customers—this cheque is endorsed in the prisoner's writing—this is my invoice book; it contains the entry of goods sold to Mr. Gregg to the amount of £3 5s. 6d.—the prisoner paid me £3 4s. 6d. in cash; 1s. was discount to Gregg—the prisoner would enter his sales in the invoice book—no one checked the goods the prisoner took out; we had full confidence in him; no one could say the amount of goods he took out—he never told me he had received a cheque for £3 15s. from Gregg—I have never received from him the difference between £3 5s. 6d. and £3 15s.; he never accounted for it—he had no authority from me to endorse Braun and Francis on this cheque on 24th August—I am a foreigner.</p>

I should enter in my private book—if the prisoner's wages were not paid on the Saturday they would be on the following Monday; they were never overdue—I am sure I was</p>

I am living at a home at Battersea Rise—at six or 6.30 p.m., on 15th November, I was with Elizabeth Proud, and we met the prisoner at the Royal Oak Station, by appointment—we walked in the direction of Leinster Place—on the way he gave me a cheque for £6 in an envelope, and asked me to go into a milk shop and ask them if they would change a cheque for Miss Farwell, of 60, Inverness Terrace—he promised to give me 10s.—I went to the shop, and asked Mr. Stoat to cash the cheque—he gave me a £5 note and a sovereign—I came out; the prisoner and Proud were about twenty yards off; they had waited outside—I gave the prisoner £1, but I did not give him the £5, because it had got to the bottom of my pocket—we had not walked very far before Mr. Stoat came after us—he asked me if I was the girl who changed the cheque—the prisoner told me to say I had not; and he said to Mr. Stoat that it was very funny—the prisoner tried to get me into a cab, but the cabs were all engaged—Stoat continued to follow me, and soon after the prisoner ran away, and then I ran away, and was caught; the prisoner was not caught—I don't know what became of Proud; I did not see her again—I was taken to the station, where I gave the £5 up to the policeman, with the 10s. which the prisoner had given me when I gave him the £1—I was committed for trial, and tried here at the December Sessions (<hi rend="italic">Seepage</hi> 145)—I pleaded guilty to changing the cheque—I was released on recognizances—I have cashed other cheques for the prisoner—Proud pointed him out to the police; I did not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a divisional surgeon of police, of 129, Camberwell Road—on the morning of 25th December last, at a quarter to eight, I was called to 4, The Albany—I saw Mr. Ellingham in bed—as I went into the premises I saw blood on the handle of the front door of the caretaker's house, and there was a track of blood leading through the common passage and then through the passage of the prose<lb/>cutor's house into his bedroom, and there was blood on the bed, the floor, and the walls near the bed, and on the prosecutor—I examined him, and found ten separate scalp wounds, a contused wound on the upper lip, four of the teeth having been knocked out, a bruise on the left fore-arm, bruises on the back of both scapulae, the points of both shoulders con<lb/>siderable bruised, bruises on the left buttock and thigh, and one bruise on the back, being an imprint of the head of this poker—the wounds on the head were very dangerous: I thought it very likely he might die—he appears fairly well now, as well as he was before the injuries—I knew him before; I had examined him once with a view of giving him a certificate for the Home for Incurables; that was the only knowledge I had of him—I saw these two pokers in the room at the time; one is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189402050066"/>
               <p>broken—there was no blood on this broken poker, except one small spot on the handle; on the other one there was blood over the whole of the square part, also small pieces of hair—the wounds on the head might have been produced by that poker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is very difficult to say whether more serious in<lb/>juries might have been done if the prisoner had used the poker with his fall force; so much depends on the mode in which they were delivered, and also on the amount of movement of the prosecutor—one blow on the arm I think was caused by the arm being raised to protect the head—I should think it very likely that the skull would have been fractured if the poker had been used with full force, but not necessarily—the poker bends easily; it is of soft iron.</p>

Cornelius Martin Ellingham, at 4, The Albany, Albany Road; you need not say anything unless you like; if you do, it will be used in evidence whether for or against you"—he said, "Yes, I did it; I was not the only one there"—I took him to Rodney Road Station, and there he said, "I did not do it; I know nothing about it"—I took him to St. Thomas's Hospital, in a cab, with another officer, where he was seen by the prosecutor, who said, "Yes, that is the man; you tried to kill me with a poker"—he also identified the frock coat which the prisoner was wearing—when we got outside the hospital I said to the prisoner, "You will also be charged with stealing a gold watch, coat, and vest"—he made no reply to that—I found at the Albany this grey coat and brown tweed vest, which have been identified as the prisoner's; this large brown-handled knife, and this key of the door where the pri<lb/>soner was lodging with Baker, and this letter, which appears to have come from the prisoner's brother—when the prisoner was searched I found this latch-key in his trousers' pocket; it fits the lock of Mr. Ellingham's door—there was no mark of blood on the prisoner or his clothes that we could discover at the time—I afterwards saw blood on this collar, which he was wearing, and on the tie, and a quantity of blood on the coat, on the right sleeve, and here—every possible inquiry has been made for the gold watch, but it has not been found—I found the case belonging to it at the Albany, with this on it: "Rev. Ellingham, 243,000, 29th July, 1881, Manufacturer, 24, Cheapside"—I also found two of the prosecutor's teeth in the room.</p>
