On the morning of the 24th of May, by his direction, I watched, and saw his wagon at Briggs's cow-yard, Hackney-road, loading—I watched the prisoner from there to Cam<lb/>bridge-heath-road—the nosebags appeared to have been emptied into another bag—there was one bag containing something—I watched him down to the premises of Chadwick, a green-grocer, in Cambridge-heath-road—when he got near there the wagon stopped, and the prisoner took a bag from the fore part of it, and went up a passage behind the man's premises, and shot it into the bin in the stable—I got a policeman, went with him, showed him the bin, and it turned out to be the horses provender—the policeman took possession of it put it into a sack, and brought it to the station—the policeman and I followed the prisoner—I came up with him in Bow-road, and gave him in charge.</p>

I am a labourer in the service of Mr. Curtis, a builder; they call me <hi rend="italic">Long Jack.</hi> On the 4th of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the Grave Maurice public-house in Whitechapel-road—the two prisoners were there, and other persons—I knew them before—I sat down, and was drinking a pint of beer—one prisoner sat on one side of me, and one on the other—after about an hour or more, I missed about half-a-crown out of my breeches pocket—I said I had missed a half-crown—M'Nally said, "Who do you think has got it?"—I said, "I don't know who has got it, it is as likely to be you as any one else"—on that M'Nally jumped up and hit me with his fist on the cheek—I did not return it, but came out of the public-house—the prisoners both came out afterme—I went towards North-street, and when I got near Gillass's butter-shop one of the prisoners struck me a severe blow on the side of the head, which knocked me down at-once senseless, and while I was down I received a kick in the jaw—I cannot say from whom—I do not think there were any persons near me but the prisoners—I did not ob<lb/>serve any—they followed me from the public-house to the spot where I re<lb/>ceived the blow—I do not know what happened afterwards till I found my<lb/>self in the hospital—they kept me there a week, I then came out, and in four days was obliged to go back again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am dresser under Mr. Andrews, a surgeon at the London Hospital. Hatfield was under Mr. Andrews' care—I attended to him—he was brought in early on Sunday morning, the 5th of May—I found a lacerated wound at the back of the scalp, about an inch long—his face was very much swollen, and had a small wound—the laceration on the head might very likely have been produced by a kick—his mouth was full of blood—I afterwards discovered that a small artery had been ruptured—I was called up about an hour after I had been in bed, to stop the hemorrhage—he remained there at least a week, then left, and returned for another week—I think the brain had sustained some injury in consequence of the violence—I think there was con<lb/>cussion—we had to rouse him before he could answer the questions I put to him—the lacerated wound was torn, and a portion of it smashed, about one-eighth of an inch wide—a common shoe might possibly make the wound—it was in the hairy part of the head—it was caused by some blunt instrument—it might have been a stone, or a kick with a heavy shoe, or falling against a step, or anything of that sort—I attribute the rupture of the small artery to the wound in the face—that was a much cleaner cut than the one at the back of the head—that might have been done with the fist—the cleanness of the cut was owing to its having caught against the tooth—the man is not well now—it has given him a general shock, and done him a deal of harm—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100018"/>
               <p>had lost a great deal of blood—a fall without bending the body would be of much greater weight than if the body yielded.</p>

I was in the shoe shop on the 16th of May, and heard somebody in the tobacco shop—I looked through the glass door, and saw the prisoner go round behind the counter, take a jar of tobacco off the shelf, put it under his arm, and walk to the door, where I stopped him and took the jar from him.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether Elizabeth's mother had preceded her in any employment in the palace? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was before my time if she did—I never knew it—she was not in the Lord Chamberlain's department—there is probably more linen at Buckingham palace than at Windsor, but there is no allowance for either—it has often hap<lb/>pened that Elizabeth has applied for linen at Buckingham palace, being short—she has not obtained new, but linen has been borrowed from other places, Brighton or Windsor, to make it up—I never heard of the linen belonging to Elizabeth, or her friends, being used to meet any exigency—I have not ex<lb/>amined the stock of linen to see that it corresponds with the account—it would be my duty to do so if I had a doubt—if a complaint was made that linen was wanted, we should trust to the party who had it—nobody filled a situation above Elizabeth—the written account of the linen is kept in the Lord Chamber<lb/>lain's office—no accurate stock has been taken—it is difficult to do so without seeing the linen, which you cannot while the Court reside there—she would re<lb/>ceive the new linen from the seamstress, and deliver it to the different servants below her as they required it—she would receive the old linen from the parties in charge of the palace—that which was worn out would be delivered by her to me or somebody connected with the office—it would wait the Lord Chamber<lb/>lain's direction as to its ultimate disposal—the greater part of the condemned linen is in boxes—in some instances it is sent to the hospitals, and in others it waits the direction of his lordship—Sir Thomas Marsh was the deputy-chamberlain—he would have authority to act for his lordship—I do not know that there would be anything unusual in his allowing Elisabeth any old linen unfit for use—I do not know the fact that it was so—I know nothing about it—Sir Thomas Marsh has been dead, I think, five or six years—he acted in the reign of William IV., and has not held office in the present reign—some of the blankets are powdering ones, and some bed blan<lb/>kets—I never heard any complaint of either of the prisoners—it was reported within the last six weeks that Elizabeth was about to be married.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 25, Upper Eaton-street, and am a servant out of employ. The male prisoner Dr. Lindsay lodged at my house upwards of five months—I have seen both the females visiting him there at times; not all the time he was there, but between two and three months—Ellen visited him more frequently than Elizabeth—they usually came in the evening, except on Sundays; they sometimes then came to tea with their brother—I never observed them bring anything—I have been in James Lind<lb/>say's room when he was away—when he first came he had a very small quan<lb/>tity of linen, no more than a gentleman would usually have—after he had been there some time I observed a great change; he had new linen, such as sheeting, towelling, and things of that description—I had observed nothing but gentlemen's linen previously—the only thing I particularly noticed was</p>

               <p>a counterpane marked "V. R., 1840"—I saw a corded box brought by a carrier—I saw the counterpane marked "V. R." after that box was brought—an intimation was given that Dr. Lindsay was about to leave, about three weeks previous to his leaving, but no regular notice; it was that he would leave at the latter end of May, or beginning of June—on the 21st of May I saw a cart stop at my house, and two large boxes were taken away-Dr. Lindsay was present when they were put in—I was coming down stairs, and he was on the stairs seeing the boxes put into the cart—he said he was taking the boxes away out of our way—the cart went to Mr. M'Nair's, No. 9, Bel<lb/>grave-street South—it stopped previously at No. 17, Lower Eaton-street, and left two smaller boxes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been out of place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between two and three years—I was last in the service of the Earl of Gains borough—I was only a month with him—I left him because I found there was a practice of robbery going on—I made it known to his lordship, and have every reason to believe the housekeeper was connected—she re<lb/>futed everything I stated, in consequence of which I gave his lordship notice to leave—I was butler and steward—before that I was in the service of Sir Roger Gresley for three years, up to his death—I was out of service nearly twelve months before going to Lord Gainsborough—I was in the house I now have, doing nothing but letting lodgings—Dr. Lindsay intimated about leav<lb/>ing about three weeks before he went—I understood he was going to Scot<lb/>land—I had agreed with another lodger on the 21st of May, who was not coming for nearly a fortnight—he sent the boxes away the same day that I knew the lodger was coming, or the day after—I had an opportunity of see<lb/>ing what linen was in his chest of drawers—I walked into his rooms frequently to see that everything was in its proper place—I opened his drawers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they locked or unlocked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unlocked when I saw them—I opened the drawers, as I had suspicion things were being carried into the house clandestinely—the drawers were the only place the linen was in—I first looked into his drawers about two months back, or between two and three months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that at first he had but little linen, and that belonging to himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was marked with his initials—I saw it in his drawers—I looked into them before there was an increase—it might be curiosity induced me to look into the drawers—they were fre<lb/>quently open, left ajar, and I had an opportunity of looking into them, going into the room—I first opened the drawers between two and three months ago—I might have looked in once or twice before—there was an increase—I will not swear it was not six times—I saw the drawers seve<lb/>ral times left open, and had an opportunity of looking into them, without pulling them open at all—I never told him I had looked into his drawers—I found, on opening them, more linen than there was before—it was folded—I did not unfold it to examine it—I saw the counterpane in a large square box on the 20th of May, the day before the boxes were taken a way—that was the first time I saw it—the box was in his bed-room—it was open when I saw it—it had a lock, but was not locked, or corded—I only looked into the box that once, about twelve o'clock in the day—Dr. Lindsay was out at the time—there were some blankets at the top of the box, and the counterpane under them—they were all folded—I did not unfold them—I saw the mark on the counterpane without unfolding it—I took out the blankets—there were two—I think there were other things in the box which I did not touch—the "V. R." was a large stamp in the corner—I had seen the box arrive about</p>

               <p>the 7th of May—it was empty, and was put into his bed-room—I had been into the bed-room between the 7th and the 20th, and looked into the drawers, but not the box—the only thing I saw marked was the counterpane—I knew of some boxes with something in them, going to Mr. Graham's—I was not aware that Dr. Lindsay had any books—those boxes were invariably locked—I am not aware that he had any fossils—I knew nothing of Dr. Lindsay before he came—I heard he had served in the Navy—my wife saw the things in the drawers only once, to my knowledge—there are three large and two small drawers—they were mine, and were part of the furniture—both his rooms were on the second floor—there is a passage between them—there were no drawers in the sitting-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's wife. The prisoner James lodged on our second floor—I was in the habit of seeing both his sisters there, separately—Ellen came most frequently—they sometimes came to him at five o'clock, but more generally between eight and nine in the evening—they at times brought things—I never saw but one bring anything, that was Ellen—I saw her bring a brown paper parcel about the middle of March—I have seen her bring brown paper parcels on several occasions—the last time was about a week before Dr. Lindsay was apprehended—I have at times gone into his room, and observed the drawers—when I at first saw them they contained his wearing apparel, and nothing else—I afterwards saw, from time to time, the things in the drawers increased, and saw towels, and new linen, I suppose for sheeting, but not made up—I remember about the middle of March a box being brought to the lodgings—a small hat-box was brought a few days after the large box—another large box was brought on the 7th of May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After the last large box came, did you go into the prisoner's room, and notice anything there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No more than I have seen before in the drawers—there was a large brown paper parcel, which contained two blankets—I be<lb/>lieve I saw a counterpane, sewed up in some flannel, and laid in a drawer—I never saw it open—it was wrapped in flannel—when Ellen came she generally went first into the sitting-room, and afterwards into the bed-room—I have heard them lock the bed-room door when Dr. Lindsay and Ellen have been in the bed-room—I remember the day Dr. Lindsay removed the boxes—Ellen came to the house the evening before that, and they were very busy in the bed-room that night—I saw the bed-room door was shut—I cannot say whether it was locked—I could hear paper, and hear them very busy about in the room—Ellen remained about an hour, I think—I saw the boxes put into the van next day—Dr. Lindsay was coming in and out up to the time of his apprehension,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever open the drawers with a key, or see it done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only with my husband—the bed-room door was never locked, it was always left open—at the time I heard them lock the bed-room door I was on the flight above, listening—I am quite sure it was the bed-room door I heard locked—Dr. Lindsay had named several times that he should go into the North, but I think he first intimated he was going to leave about three weeks or a month before—I believe it was on the 20th of May we engaged another lodger—it was a lady going to take the sitting-room—I mentioned it to him on the 20th—he told me he should keep his bed-room on till the 3rd of this month, but I might let in the lady—the two large boxes were packed up before the 20th—it was a hat-box, and large brown paper parcel, and some small boxes of his own they packed after the 20th—I was never present at any packing—he paid 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his sisters frequently passed the evening with him, and sometimes took tea—I did not know them before he became my lodger—I never told him I had searched his drawers—I have borrowed a sovereign of him several times, when my husband has been out—never more than a sove<lb/>reign—I do not know the contents of the small boxes which went to Mr. Graham's.</p>

R." and a crown, a blanket with "W. R." and a crown, and a linen duster marked "V. R., 1839"—it appeared to have been marked with blue thread and picked out—the stain only is left—after con<lb/>veying the boxes to Mr. Saunders' I apprehended James Lindsay—he was about to say something—I cautioned him, and told him the charge—and he said he must communicate with his sisters—he said there Iras no pro<lb/>perty there belonging to the Queen—I told him there was a blanket, marked "W. R." and a crown—he then said he had charge of them for his sisters, whose perquisites they were, that he had nothing more to do with them—I searched his lodgings, and found a common plate, which I brought away—the words "Buckingham palace" are on it—I took him to the station-house, and had the plate with me—as I was conveying him there, he laid it was a paltry thing, could not I hide it—I afterwards apprehended the female prisoners—Elizabeth said, "What shall I do, can you give me any advice?"—which I declined—that is all she said—I produce the boxes—the counterpane appears new—the blanket has "W. R." and a crown on it—here is the duster, which has had "W. R." on it, but picked out—the blanket is an old one—here are other dusters and sheeting—there are eight blankets, five quilts, seven dozen and eight towels, four dozen and a half duster, and forty-two yards of sheeting—that is all that was in the boxes—the sheeting and dusters appear to be new, and some of the towels—on the 11th of May, when I went to Lindsay's lodgings, I saw articles of this description in the drawers—these appear to be the same—there were no fossils or books in the boxes at Mr. M'Nair's.</p>

I had occasion to resort to that linen from time to time to use when pressed for linen for the household; with respect to the four blankets now produced, they were given to me by the late Sir Thomas Marsh during the time of his late Majesty, they had been condemned as unfit for use; I told Sir Thomas Marsh they were little fit for use, that they might be used for ironing blankets, and he told me I might do with them what I pleased; with respect to the new linen produced, I took that to re-place the linen belonging to my sister which I had used at the palace. The counterpane marked "V. R." I know nothing of, I suppose my sister does; I was not aware that the duster which has been produced was among the linen. My mother died about fourteen years ago. When I speak of the need of linen, I mean that observa<lb/>tion to apply to Buckingham palace as well as St. James's palace, until the present time—I never mentioned to Mr. Saunders about using my own linen at any time.—The prisoner Ellen Lindsay says, 'I confirm what my sister has Said; the counterpane marked "V. R." I must have taken by mistake for my own counterpane. I know nothing about the duster. The plate I took to my brother's with a piece of pudding, and he has asked me once or twice to take it back, and I have neglected it.'—The prisoner James Lindsay says,' I always considered that the property which they brought to me was theirs; they told me so, and I took charge of it for a time for them. I never received it under any other impression than that; that observation applies to every article spoken of.'"</p>

On the night of the 6th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prosecutor was brought to the hospital with an incised wound in the cheek, about two inches long, completely through into the mouth—it appeared to have been inflicted by some sharp instrument, such a knife as this would do it, used with force—he lost a considerable quantity of blood from the wound, which might be dangerous considering his usual habits—the wound itself was not danger<lb/>ous, but I feared erysipel as from the excitement of the system.</p>

"—I do not know his reply, but she went towards the door, and <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> came in—Mr. Williams said, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, where is the half-sovereign?"—he accused him of taking it—that led to quarrel—a scuffle took place between him and Richard Bragger—Mr. Williams called him a b——rogue, and offered to fight him—Bragger got out, and held him by the coat, and said, "I do not wish to strike you"—Williams offered to strike him—Bragger let go of his coat, and they struck each other—Bragger struck him on the left eye, which bled—I said he ought not to strike an old man—he afterwards assisted in washing the eye—after that they appeared on friendly terms again—Mary Ann went away about half-past nine, and Bragger and Nicholson also—Williams took what appeared to be two notes out of his pocket, and some silver and gold—Nicholson picked them up, laid them on the counter, wrapped them up, and gave them to him—Williams left our house at twenty minutes to twelve, rather in liquor—the others had left a considerable time before—Williams fell from his chair, on his right side, in the course of the evening, about half-past eleven—shortly after he got up, he put his hand to his head—I asked if his head was bad—he said, "Yes, very bad"—my house is about five minutes' walk from Brunswick-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, and live at No. 4, Brunswick-place—on Sunday, 19th of May, about ten minutes to four, I was in No. 5, the adjoining house to Nicholson's, and heard a smash of a window—when I got to the door I heard the cries of murder in a man's voice, two or three times—I went and looked in at the window where the smash was, it was No. 6—I saw Mr. Williams lying on his back, and Horstead had hold of him—he was in a fustian coat—I knew him before—Mr. Williams had hold of him by his hand<lb/>kerchief, in the attitude of a scuffle—Horstead was standing over him—Mr. Williams said, "Do not murder me, let me go"—there was blood from each of their faces—I do not think I remained at the window above a minute and a half or two minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shadwell—I was called to see the deceased on Sunday night, 19th May, about ten o'clock—he was sitting in an arm-chair in the kitchen quite insensible, his head inclin<lb/>ing on his breast—I noticed his face more particularly on the following morn<lb/>ing—I then noticed a bruise under the left eye, and a cut on the internal part of the lower lip—he was quite insensible then—at that time I saw no other marks—his face was swollen on the left side—I noticed a small quantity of blood on the front of his shirt—I visited him several times during the Monday, he was insensible the whole day—he died about eleven o'clock at night—as<lb/>sisted by Dr. Pereira, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the external marks of violence were, a bruise under the lower part of the left eye, a cut on the inter<lb/>nal part of the lower lip, and a bruise on the scrotum—we opened the head, and on reflecting the anterior part of the scalp, and examining as far as the orbit, we found no internal injury corresponding with the blow on the eye—the skull was then removed, and on cutting into the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, a large quantity of dark coagulated blood oozed out—that was more particularly on the left side of the head—there was also a quantity of extravasated blood on the under surface of the anterior part of the left hemisphere of the brain—the escape of blood on the brain was the cause of death—that was caused, I should say, by external violence, a blow or a fall—a blow on the mouth which knocked him backwards with his head on the fender, causing a dent on the fender, might produce it—I should say the blow or fall on the Saturday night could not possibly have caused the effects produced—supposing the blow or fall on the Saturday night to have caused extravasation of blood, insensibility would have come on in a short space of time, I should say half an hour, but I cannot positively say—I should say that the blow had been inflicted a very short time before he complained that the pain in his head was making him mad, and his becoming insensible—I should say perhaps half an hour, or not so long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you pronounce any opinion on such a question as that, with any degree of certainty whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I can—I found one bruise on the scrotum—I carefully examined internally, and found no</p>

               <p>injury corresponding which could produce death, it was quite superficial—the blow that inflicted the injury on the lip might produce the extravasated blood on the brain—it was not a very severe cut—it had bled—there were, pos<lb/>sibly, half-a-dozen drops of blood on his shirt, or more—I cannot positively say—if the man was in an excited state on the Saturday, I should say a slight blow or fall would be very likely to produce such appearances, as I saw—my opinion is, that the blow given on the Saturday had nothing to do with the cause of death—I found no mark on any part of his person that would denote he had fallen on a fender—if he had fallen with any violence on a fender I should have expected to find some external appearance—it is not necessary there should have been a wound—this was a case of compression, not concussion—we could not trace out which vessel it was that had been ruptured—there was a large quantity of blood extravasated—I cannot swear positively as to in how long or short a period the extravasated blood would make its appearance, but certainly within two hours, if the hemorr<lb/>hage was going on—the only blow indicating violence to any extent was the one on the under lip—I think that blow might produce compression of the brain in a man of his age, with the vessels in a brittle state—he was fifty-eight years of age—at that period of life the vessels of the brain are more liable to give way—I was not in the least puzzled to find a cause for the extrava<lb/>sation—I cannot swear whether the violence was caused by a blow or fall—it was either one or the other—the shock from a blow or fall would cause the concussion and rupture of the vessels—when I say concussion, I mean the shaking—the shaking of the brain would account for the rupture—that might have happened from an accidental fall—even in temperate persons, the vessels are much more brittle in the decline of life—it would be more so with a person of intemperate habits—a blow then would be more likely to lead to compression, which would be followed by stupor and death.</p>

I heard a noise in the passage; I had lived in the house a fortnight before this happened, and had moved three doors away. I went in, and a female told me there was a Frenchman had got Sarah Bennett's little sister, and wished * * * I instantly went to the room; Bennett said, "For God's sake go in, and get him out." I went in, and he was in the room with his trowsers down, and the little girl sitting on the bed crying. I asked what he was doing; she said he wanted * * * He said, "Me will pay the girl." I said, "You had better go out of the place, or I will fetch a policeman." The candle went out, and he went to the window, and smashed both his hands through it, and by that means I suppose he cut his hands. I laid hold of him by the throat, and said "Come out, I will show you the way." I took him down, and he stood on the step of the door, talking to me some moments. I told him to be off about his business, and he got off the pavement. I stood at the door about five minutes, and then went home and went to bed.</p>

I was tipsy, and did not notice it. He gave her three halfpence more, and on coming out, I saw him near the bottom of Ox<lb/>ford-street, with my sister in his arms; when I got in-doors she was crying, and Curtis came in at the time.</p>

I am a surgeon, attached to the infirmary of the workhouse of this parish—I first saw the deceased on the Monday, between one and two, in her own room—she was perfectly sober—she was in a state of great prostration—I understood that she had received some blows on the Sun<lb/>day morning, and that she had vomited large quantities of blood—I found considerable contusion round the left eye—the symptoms were principally those of stomach disease, and I treated her for hæmatemesis—I found a wound on the head which had been dressed—she never mentioned any head symptoms to me—she always directed my attention to the region about the stomach—her expression was that her heart was burst, which is a very com<lb/>mon expression among that class of people—I saw hex on Tuesday—the symptoms were rather improved, but still the same—on the Wednesday I found her in a state of complete collapse, in fact evidently dying—she died within an hour after my seeing her—on the Friday following I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found undoubted acute inflammation of the stomach—the head presented very slight appearances of congestion, nothing more than I should expect to find in almost all cases where no blow had been given—in my judgment the cause of death was acute inflammation of the stomach, occurring on a state of chronic inflammation—there was a large patch of co<lb/>agulated blood on the stomach, from which part, no doubt, the blood which she vomited had come—in my judgment the blow on the head had nothing to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher, and live at No. 6, Queen-street, Pimlico. On Sunday evening, the 9th of June, about half-past nine or a quarter to ten o'clock, I was opposite my shop, and saw the prisoner and another go against Mr. Hartley's door, which is next to mine, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—Bryant knocked at Mr. Hartley's door twice, and put his ear down to listen both times—I thought they were friends of Mr. Hartley, and did not take any particular notice of them at the time—I then saw Bryant lay hold of the handle, and put his other hand down, as if trying the door, to see if it would open—that occupied about two minutes—they all three then walked away together—in about two minutes the two pri<lb/>soners came back—Bryant took hold of the handle of the door, and opened it, he put Johnson in, and followed in himself, and shut the door after him—I said something to a person I was talking to, and went over with him, and knocked at Mr. Hartley's door—I told him to stand at the private door, and I would stand at the shop door—I knocked twice, the last time very loud—receiving no answer, I went to the private door, and knocked there—the lodgers came down—I spoke to them—they knocked at the parlour door, and said Mr. Hartley was not at home—I then stood between Hartley's shop door and my own, and had not been there two minutes before I saw the prisoners coming along my passage—they had climbed the wall between Mr. Hartley's passage and mine—I asked what business they had in that shop—Bryant said he had been to make water—I told him a grocer's shop was a <hi rend="italic">devilish rum</hi> place, he had been there for some other purpose—he said, "Me, me, Sir, me?"—I said, "You"—I called another man, and told him to lay hold of that boy—I went to lay hold of Bryant—he ran away—I ran after him and brought him back, called a policeman, and gave him into custody—I afterwards came back with the police to Mr. Hartley's premises, and there saw a towel, a plate, and fork, lying on the ground—there are some rabbit-hutches in that part of the yard where they had got over, and they were broken down fresh, and two bricks on the wall had been partially removed—the top of the wall is protected by a piece of wood going across—I am sure the two persons I saw come out of my passage are the two persons that had entered the prosecutor's</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Kelly, a labourer, and live in Sun-court, Milton-street—in March last I lived in Pump-court, Golden-lane, On the 20th of May I was confined—on the Monday following, the 25th, the pri<lb/>soner came to see me—I had a half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and the dupli<lb/>cate of a counterpane, on my table—the prisoner noticed them to me—I wanted to send for my mother to go to the pawnbroker's for the counterpane—the pri<lb/>soner said she would bring it; that she was going with her husband's dinner to the Curtain-road, and the pawnbroker's was quite handy to it—I said I would rather not trouble her—she said she would go—she took up the money and ticket, and went—she never returned with the money or counterpane, but next day she gave the ticket to my little girl in the street—I did not per<lb/>severe very hard against her taking it, as she was a neighbour, and thinking her an honest woman that would not take advantage of me—a fortnight after<lb/>wards I went to her, and asked her for the money—she said she had had the misfortune to spend it, and she had nothing to give me that Saturday night—she has never come to me with any since—I thought when she took it that she intended to take the counterpane out, but she told me she fell into some company, and spent the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I did live in Vine-street, Pimlico. I now live in Albion-place, Hyde-park-square, and am clerk to a solicitor. I have known the prisoner twelve or thirteen years—in the early part of last year he called on me—he said he had been left guardian to an infant girl—I understood from him that she was between twelve and thirteen years of age—he said she had some considerable, property, which she took under a settlement—I am quite sure he said he was appointed guardian—I saw him again in October last—he said, "I have been to Gretna Green and got married"—I said "Well, to whom, and how old is she?"—after some conversation regarding her age, I said "Surely it is not the girl you mentioned to me some months ago"—he said, "Yes it is"—he said she had a mother—I had heard previously that she had no father.</p>

They came on the Friday, two or three days before the 13th of Oct.—in the after<lb/>noon of the 13th, the prisoner, Mrs. Wortham, and her daughter were to<lb/>gether in Mrs. Wortham's apartments—Mrs. Wortham went out, and left the prisoner and Miss Wortham together—I never saw them again.</p>

               <p>"Mrs. Wortham, 39, Gerard-street, Islington.—In this instance to call you my dear beloved mother would be more than I could do. It was not my inten<lb/>tion to have addressed you again until all matters were settled by the attorneys engaged in our affairs; but the uncalled for insult you have offered me by your scandalous advertisement, demands the remarks I make. What feeling can you have to proclaim (as you wish and intend) my supposed shame and dishonour to the world, as if I were a harlot? Am I not now a married woman? Our union took place within 40 hours after I left the house, where I spent the last few previous days in real wretchedness and misery. My mar<lb/>riage certificate I have in my possession. Have you no shame left, no regard for the virtuous character of an only daughter? My poor dear father, alas! now no more, often said your heart was one of adamant. I was then too young to know how truly he spoke—time has shown me his sentence was right—the deep and lasting disgrace you have put upon me shall never be effaced from my memory, but am willing to attribute your conduct to your ungovernable temper, goaded on by an unprincipled low-bred attorney, of the name of Hammond, who has no other object in view than to rob either you or my</p>

               <p>property, Mr. Pemberton declares he was an unfit person for him to commu<lb/>nicate with; all the man's business lies among a set of Hampstead omnibus drivers, stage-coach proprietors, and butchers. Had you employed Mr. J. Hawkins there would have been respectability on your solicitor's side as well as a friendly feeling. Your obtaining an order to prevent the cohabitation of my husband and myself was perfectly ridiculous, also illegal; and you may rest assured, though the Vice-Chancellor has heard your story, mine, accom<lb/>panied by affidavits, stating many particulars of your private conduct (your cruelty to me shall not be forgotten,) will most materially alter his judgment; it is not necessary for me to allude more circumstantially to what I mean. Every inducement which I could hold out to you has been tried in vain to prevent your bringing ruin on yourself as well as misery to me. You were always deaf to every argument which was founded on reason; the narrowness of your education shows itself. Had my friends been consulted by you they would have told you no good could possibly result from your proceedings. My husband, thank God, is quite independent of my property—(you have experienced his bounty and generosity too freely; this is the return he meets with from an ungrateful woman;) we shall, therefore, let mine accumulate until I am of age, and then, in spite of you and your dishonest cunning attorney, we shall come into quiet possession of Connington. I trust you are not carrying on the intrigue my dear father had such cause to complain of; and so satisfied was he of your guilt, that he threatened to leave you, and most certainly would have kicked that fellow (for whom you professed such love) down stairs; he went by the name of M'Donald. In a few days I shall be far distant from you, quite out of the reach of those myrmidons as well as yours. You may probably hear from me after the birth of my child, which event I expect in about four months. One of my sisters-in-law, I am happy to say, will be with me during my confinement. In again alluding to your advertisement,—the morning it appeared it was placed in our hands; we smiled contemptuously at the puny efforts of you and your treacherous abettor, the snake in the grass. Our secret is in the hands of a friend who will not, betray us for so small a sum. He tells us we were worth at least 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In<lb/>crease your reward to that sum, we may then talk to that devil incarnate your attorney; the reward of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said, bespeaks the littleness of his mind. I was not aware my nose was aquiline until the public papers told me of the fact; a phrenologist says (to whom I have shown it in order to satisfy you) it does not even approach such a designation. In your next public announcement state some more decidedly conspicuous or hidden features by which so young a wife as I am may be known. You are well versed in English history, and can easily call to mind what raised What Tyler's rebellion in the reign of Richard. It will not be difficult for you to understand the difference between a chesnut horse and a horse chesnut. My husband at present walks with his hands behind him, wears gloves, and no neckcloth. You said his hands were in his pockets (why not in that of other people? but that would be libellous, your hands have been rather deep in those pockets of my dear William,) "no gloves," Scotch blunder! how could people tell whether he had gloves or not, if his hands were always concealed? What a heartless mother, to use her best and well-directed endeavours to have her daughter's husband immured within the walls of a prison, the very man who saved you from the fate my poor dear father said you wished him to meet with. There is no doubt your desire was to see me there also; you would have had your wishes, for had he gone there I never would have forsaken him; gratitude, (you do not understand the term,) if no other feeling influenced me, would have prompted me to follow him to the miserable abode you wished to consign him to. In the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100072"/>
               <p>name of God what injury have either of us done you. In a few years I would have been my own mistress, and, beyond all doubt, would then have taken the step I did on the 15th Oct. I have the same natural rights to choose a husband for myself as you had; you were four or five years older at that period than I am now; there is all the difference. Jealousy prompts you on. It is true you begged of my dear William to marry you, but it is not usual for such a question to proceed from the lady. You have taken a step you can never recall. The time may come when I can call you as you ought to have been to me—a dear mother.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday, the 4th of May, I left town with Mrs. Driver—I returned on Monday, about nine o'clock in the evening—I was sent for express—I got to my office about nine—when I went out of town these papers were left in a canvas bag, in a drawer in my library—on Mon<lb/>day night I went to that drawer before I went to bed, and missed that canvas bag, and all the money that was in it—there were five 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, several sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and a few shillings, making to<lb/>gether 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, besides the Bank notes, two double sovereigns, nine golden guineas, four seven-shilling pieces, and these papers—these notes of hand, of trifling sums I had advanced to persons, were in the same bag, and had been for years—I left that drawer in the library, also locked—I could not discover any difference in it on the Monday—I unlocked it as usual—I keep a mahogany box in my room, in which I have duplicate keys of the drawers—I examined that next morning, I think—it presented the appear<lb/>ance of security in which I had left it at first, but, on turning it round, I found the bottom falling out, and the interior of it entirely dismantled and destroyed—it had in it, among other keys, a key which would open the drawer where the money was—on looking into the mahogany box, I found this small piece of paper, marked "Baby"—this is the box—it is all broken to pieces—I had not the least idea of Cotton leaving my service—I did not find him there when I returned to town—I found the pantry very much burnt, and all the woodwork in it entirely charred—the window burned out, and the door burnt—there was an iron bedstead in his room, with no hangings—there were no window curtains in the room—I saw no more of him till I found him in the custody of the police—I have a memorandum-book here which was found by Mrs. Driver, with this little paper, in the mahogany key-box.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cotton's Defence.</hi> Three weeks or a month before I went away from my place, my master and mistress went to an evening party; when he came home he went to the sideboard, got one of the glasses off the liquor-stand, and emptied all the brandy that was in it; I took it down to wash in the pantry, and there it remained ever since, in the cupboard nearest the window—when I went into the pantry I took the glass off the lamp, and lighted the gas which is alight every night when I am at home, and it is never turned off from the meter. About twelve o'clock I lighted a fire in the pantry; I left the glass off the lamp; I did not happen to put it on again. When I went out in the evening I locked the pantry door, so that nobody should go in to take the plate; I cannot say whether I put out the light or not; I had had a little drop to drink; I went out about half-past one; and the reason I did not re<lb/>turn was, I missed two or three spoons, and was afraid to go back, as I knew I should have to replace them, and I could not afford that. I took these cloths to this young woman with my dirty things; I meant to have taken them back; the decanter I took with a pint and a-half of gin, as she was not very well; the lamp I took as she said she was very poorly of a night, with a pint of oil to burn, in case she should be taken ill; I meant to take it back as soon as she got better; I took some dripping in the butter-dish; the glass I bought for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the wine-glass I took with the decanter, because we had not one then; the robbery I know nothing about; I have had the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces some time, and I gave them to her; she knew nothing about it; I went to her place, and asked if she had a mind to go into the country with me for a little while; she said no twice, and then she said she would go; I lived with Mr. Driver's mother two years before I lived with him, and she can give me a very good character.</p>

I know Chandler, and have seen him in company with Cotton—the first time is more than three or four months ago—I have seen them a great many times together in the pantry—after the fire I was engaged in sifting the refuse out of the pantry—I afterwards found a pair of breeches which had been worn by Cotton, and in the pocket I found some duplicates which I took to my master, who gave them to the officer.</p>

(that was the name he had given me)—he said, "Yes, sir"—I said, "What in the name of God are you doing?"—he said, "Nothing, sir"—I said, "What a deplorable state you are in," and when he got up he was in such a state I was surprised how he could enter the gardens—the whole of his trowsers behind were completely gone—I took off my coat, and said, "Take this, I will, forgive you"—he said, "I have been among the soldiers, and pawned my things"—I told him to go to my tailor and get his clothes mended, and call on me for work—he got them mended—but never called for work—he came to me another day—he said he was starving—I said he was a vagabond, but I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said if he would go to a house in the city I would put him there till it was let—he went—I said, "You must be there to-morrow morning from nine till five"—I went there in the morn<lb/>ing, and the woman said he had left with a bundle—I missed a new shirt, a pair of stockings, some wash-leather, and a few articles I had bought the day before to give to another poor man—I did not see him again till the Sunday after, when I met him in the street—I collared him and said, "You infernal rascal, I will give you in charge"—I got a crowd round me, and seeing no policeman I let him go—he acknowledged he had got the things—he said, "I have the leather at home"—I said, "Where is your home?"—he made no answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixty-two years old—I am not in business, and live in Bartholomew-terrace, Essex-street, Bethnal<lb/>green—the prisoner is my nephew. On Sunday, the 21st of April, I had in a cupboard in my bed-room up stairs a tin cash-box, about fourteen inches long, about eight wide, and about six deep—I saw it last about eleven o'clock on Sunday morning before I went to church—the prisoner knew I kept it there, for when I was ill he has been to see me several times, when I have taken it out and put it in that place—when I went to church I left my wife at home to cook the dinner—I returned about five or ten minutes after one o'clock—after dinner I sat reading the Bible for an hour or an hour and a half—I remained in the house till about a quarter to five—the cash-box contained two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, one 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., eight sovereigns, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, some bonds and shares, a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill of exchange, another for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which the prisoner was the acceptor; also some leases and deeds—we keep no servant, and no one lives in the house but my<lb/>self and wife—the prisoner and his wife came to visit us that afternoon, about five o'clock I believe—I was out at the time, and found them there when I I came in—I did not exactly expect him—after tea, my wife and the prisoner's wife went to chapel, about half-past six o'clock—there are two keys to my front door, one kept by my wife, and one by myself—hers hung on the screw of the knocker, and mine on the bolt of the door—after our wives had gone to chapel we sat and talked a little, and he pressed me very much to go out—I wished not to go, but by his wish I went—it was about twenty minutes to seven o'clock—we went across by Robinson's house, up Coven<lb/>try-street, up Pitt-street, into Bethnal-green-road, and to the Sun brewery beer-shop—we stayed there about half an hour, and then left together—I turned to go the same way, down Pitt-street, and be wished not, because it was a drearisome road, and he wished to go round the Cambridge road—I directly consented—we went along Bethnal<lb/>green-road, and a little way down the Kingsland-road—I walk very slow—I was very lame that day—just after we got round the Salmon and Ball, by the trees, he said he wanted to go into Cleveland-street—I said, "Well, you go if you wish," and he put his hands to his coat, and set off at full run-away from me—I continued my way home very gently, because the crowd was very great in the Cambridge-road—when I got home I did not find any one in—the front door was locked—I unlocked it with my key, and went in—it took me from ten to twelve minutes to walk from the trees, where I parted with the prisoner, to my house—I did not make any discovery at first when I got in—when I had been in a short time, the prisoner came to the window, stood before it, and looked in at me—I went and let him in—he said "What, are they not come from chapel"—I said, "No, they will not come from chapel till half-past eight o'clock"—he then sat down—but previous to that,</p>

               <p>almost immediately, on coming in, I had been out in the yard, and saw that the back door was open, which I had left fastened by two bolts inside—I was in the yard when he came and looked in at the window—opposite the back door there is a little sort of wicket-gate, that was fastened with a bolt and a string—I found that string broken, and the bolt was open—when he came in he seemed very trembling and very queer, but I did not take any notice—we sat for ten minutes or so, and he said he wished they would come home from chapel—I said, "They will not come home just yet, you will take some supper before you go"—he said, "No, I should wish to go home as soon as they come in"—I said, "Well take this pot, and go to the corner, and get some ale or porter; you will take some refreshment before you go"—he went, and I was out in the yard, putting the shutters to, when he came back—he knocked, I said, "I am coming directly"—he gave a very loud knock, as if he was going to knock the door down—I was very cross with him, and said, "What did you knock so very loud for?"—he seemed very much agitated, and said he wished they would come home—he constantly repeated that—my wife and his came home, I think, about twenty-five mi<lb/>nutes after eight—as soon as they came in, he jumped up, and said, "We will be off home"—my wife said, "Do take something before you go home, you have got far to go"—he said, "O no, we don't want anything at all"—my wife said his wife should have something if he did not, and she said she would take a little—she took a glass of half-and-half, or something, and a crust of bread and cheese, and he took some himself; but he got up twice during the time, he was so agitated and wishing to go—my wife pressed him, and said, "Do have it comfortably"—they went soon afterwards, I think, from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour after they returned from chapel—I went up to bed about a quarter to ten—directly I got up into my bed-room, I noticed that the cupboard was burst open, and my cash-box gone—I had been into my bed-room about six that afternoon, and the cupboard door was then shut and safe—in the course of the evening I saw the prisoner with his hand on two spoons, a silver one and a plated salt-spoon, on the mantel<lb/>piece—I looked at him, and he said, "Here are two spoons here"—I said, "How came they there? my mistress never put them on the mantel-piece, I am sure;" and he took his hand off them—previous to our going out, he said he had taken some goods home to Osborne-street, to the amount of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the gentleman was gone into the country that was to have written the check, and had forgotten it; and he was very short of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "If you are very short of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will lend you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for to-morrow, if it is sure"—he said, "No, no, don't go up stairs for it, if I want it, I will come for it to-morrow"—he never came.</p>

               <p>I left home—he looked very pale, and never looked at me at the time he was addressing me, and his wife remarked to him, "What are you staring at me so for? what are you looking so pale for?"—I said, "Yes, he does look very pale she said, "I suppose it is for what he said to me when he was coming here"—he was then present—I did not notice that manner about him previous to going to chapel—when he shook hands with me his hand appeared like ice, and it dropped from me in the most extraordinary way—after he was gone, I sat down and read to my husband for some time—and when he was preparing to go up stairs I went into the kitchen and missed my silver tea-spoons that I had used for tea—my husband kept the key of the cash-box, and the key of the cupboard—the prisoner was married from our house about June or July last—I asked his wife in his presence to go to chapel—she rather refused, say<lb/>ing, it would be rather late to go home, and he jumped up, and said, "Oh, no; go to chapel; by all means go to chapel"—after my husband had gone up to bed, he called out to me that he was robbed—I immediately ran up and saw that the cupboard door had been burst open, and the cash-box taken—I had one key to the street door, and my husband another—I had a difficulty in making use of my key to open the door—I never can open it without two or three attempts—I have never used my husband's key.</p>

On Sunday after<lb/>noon, the 21st of April, I was at the window of our room on the first floor—I know the prisoner by sight—the first time I saw him was about ten or or eleven months since, at the time of his wedding, which took place from Mr. Dearlove's house—I have seen him three or four times since then, four I believe—I saw him about half-past six o'clock on the Sunday evening, come out with Mr. Dearlove, and go by, as I supposed, to chapel—about three quarters of an hour, or it might be an hour after, I saw the prisoner return alone—he came past our window, and went to Mr. Dearlove's door—he made two attempts to open it, with a key I suppose, and with the third attempt he got in and shut the door after him—I am quite certain he is the man—I had noticed a woman that afternoon walking to and fro, and round the church di<lb/>rectly opposite our house—when the prisoner went into the house I lost sight of the woman, and saw no more of her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on Saffron-hill. On the 17th of May I met the prisoner in Farringdon-street—I treated him—I had a sovereign and a half and a half-crown, in a silk handkerchief—I told him I should go and buy a hat, he said he had one to dispose of—I said, "Fetch it;" he did so, and it was split across the top—I said I did not like it—he asked 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I gave him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I took a half-crown out of the handkerchief, and gave it to him, and said, "Go, and get change for this, and bring it back"—he did so—the rest of the money was then in the handkerchief, and I put it and the rest of the money into my trowsers-pocket—he accompanied me to the Not<lb/>tingham Arms beer-shop, and treated me there—I was rather the worse for liquor—I knew what I was doing when I gave him the half-crown—I had the money when I went to the Nottingham Arms—after that I went home and missed my handkerchief from my pocket—I have never seen it since.</p>

He has a great deal of building going on—in Feb. the prisoner applied for a house at Fulham—I was not present when he referred my uncle to any one—I never saw White—there was an agreement written out about the house, and the prisoner came to me and signed it—he was to take it on lease, and it was sent over to Scott, who the house belonged to—the prisoner came to reside in the house, and it was opened as a grocer's—I, by the desire of my uncle, made inquiries about the prisoner—he referred me to Mr. White—I did not go to White—I did not hear the prisoner say any-thing about White—the prisoner stayed there about six or eight weeks—the last time I saw him was about a fortnight after he had been there—the shop was shut up about the beginning of April—I had notice that it was going to close, but no notice from the prisoner that he was going away—he left, and we got no rent—the key was sent, about a week or a fortnight after he left, by an omnibus-conductor—I have not seen the prisoner since till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">grocer, Red Lion-street, Holborn.</hi> I had some transactions with Mr. Kemp, in Albany-street, Regent's-park—in the beginning of March White called on me—he was quite a stranger till then—he said he was going to lend Kemp a large sum of money, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was anxious to know the state of the account between me and Mr. Kemp before he advanced the money—I declined it till I saw Mr. Kemp—White told me that he was a builder in Queen-street, City—he said, if I would not let him see the accounts, would I meet him at Mr. Kemp's—it was at last agreed that White should see the ac<lb/>counts—he came to my place in Red Lion-street, and was shown into the parlour at the back of the shop—he looked over the accounts—he said he had a great deal of money that he wanted to lend, as he got such small interest for it in the funds; that he was building eighty houses at Dalston, and had 120 men at work—he said he had a great many houses in the New-road; he had been buying some that day, and he was going to put shop-fronts in them—he said he had a sister in Westmorland, and he owned a mill there—while White was with me in the parlour, my shopman, Hanson, came and made a communication to me—White got up to go away, saying he would see me at some future time, as I was being called away—he went into the shop as if he was going away—I went into the shop and saw the prisoner there—he made a bow to White as White was going out, and White slightly returned it—I then called White back again, and he went into the parlour—I said, "I see you know that person who wants credit in the shop, what do you know of him?"—he said he was a very respectable young man—White then went away, and I went into the shop—the prisoner said, "Good God, is not that old White?"—I said yes, his name was White—the prisoner said it was strange that they should happen to meet there, for he had not seen him before for four years—he said, "No one would take him to be a rich man to look at him, would they? he is one of the richest men in London; he has houses all over London"—the prisoner asked for credit, and referred me to a man named Wilkin, living in Provost-street, City-road—he said he him<lb/>self lived at Fulham, that he was in some other line of business, and he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100154"/>
               <p>going to open a grocer's shop for his wife to attend to—he then left, and I went to Wilkin's house, but he was out—I then wrote to the prisoner saying I was not satisfied with the reference, and I declined the order—I did not sup<lb/>ply him with the goods—on the following day White called again, and I asked what he knew of the prisoner—he said he had not seen him for four years, but he had formerly been a tenant of his, and his father was a clergyman in Wales—I told him the prisoner had ordered goods of me, and that he was going to open a grocer's shop at Fulham—White said he hoped he would be a good customer to me—I said I was not going to serve him, I was not satisfied with his reference—he said, "Poor fellow, it is a pity he should go to ruin for such a trifle as that," asking me at the same time what was the amount of the goods Atkins had ordered—I told him between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Knowing his father and family so well so many years I will be answerable for him to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said if I would draw up a guarantee he would call in a day or two and sign it—this hap<lb/>pened on a Thursday in the middle of March—I then wrote this letter to Atkins—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>/)—"Sir, Since you were here this morning I have seen Mr. White, his reference, together with Mr. Wilkin's, is to me quite satisfactory. I shall therefore be happy to do business with you, if you please, on the usual terms; one month's credit; an answer will oblige. Your obedient ser<lb/>vant, <hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD DEAR. TO</hi> Mr. Atkins.") Atkins called the next day and said he had a cart outside, and he would take the goods to save me the trouble of sending them—I said they were not ready, and I would send them—White came to me again the same day—(there had been no appointment for him to come, but he was a frequent visitor about that time)—he said he had re<lb/>ceived an order from his sister in Westmoreland for some tea and grocery—he gave me the order, which amounted to about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he received such an order about every half-year to send to his sister, and he promised to favour me with his custom—he first said he would take the goods with him in a cab to the railway, and then he said, "Let them be strongly packed, and send them to Kemp's, in Albany-street. I am going to send some fish, and they can go together"—I sent that order which amounted to between 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—White came again the same day and gave me another order for goods to be sent to his own house in Queen-street—I went with my man with the last order to Queen-street and saw the goods delivered to some female—when White had called on the Friday he said he was going to advance Kemp 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would call the next day and pay me a check for the money for his goods—I afterwards went to the house in Queen-street, found White was gone, and a man named Wilson was there in possession—there was nothing but rubbish found there—I could get no money—I went to Fulham, and could not find the prisoner there—the house was not shut up, and I do not think he was gone—I could not get any money from him or from White—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in cu<lb/>tody—I saw White in Old-street one night when I was in company with the inspector, and he ran away.</p>

I have not seen him before for four years"—I am positive he said that—he said White was the richest man in London; he was building houses at Dalston then, and he had houses all over London—White came again the next day—I overheard him say that he would be accountable for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Atkins, net more—I sent the goods to Fulham, by direction of my master, by the carman, William Hunt—they amounted to about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some goods were ordered for White—the first parcel was sent to Mr. Kemp's, by White's order—White returned, and ordered another parcel of goods, which were to be sent to Queen-street—he said he would get a check the following morning—Mr. Dear went with the last goods—White never called to give me a check, or the money.</p>

Thomas has lodged with me since last August—I saw her come from the Prince George of Cum<lb/>berland, on Easter Monday, and knock at my door at a quarter before twelve o'clock—it is two miles from my house to New St. Pancras church—a young person who was with me let her in—she went in, and went to her own room, and left the door open—soon afterwards a man came in—I had a great deal of linen in the house—he was a very dirty man, and had a kind of shooting jacket on—he was standing against the pales, and she beckoned him in—she went into her own room with him, and was shut is about a quarter of an hour—I got into a desperate quarrel with her about her bringing that man—she abused me, and struck my mother, and at six o'clock in the evening, she was taken to Salisbury-street station—I am sure it was a quarter before twelve when she came to the house, because I wanted my dinner, and I looked at the clock, and said, "We don't dine till twelve"—I am quite certain about the time—the man who came always went by the name of Shehan—in the letter that came from the House of Correction it was Sheene—he had a very dirty appearance, and dark clothes on, a white cravat, and a very shabby hat on—the prisoner was acquainted with Thomas, and repeatedly came to my house—I had found him there all night—his mother never slept in my house but once when they had been to Cato-street dance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, in partnership with James M'Gill, at No. 1, Bread-street, Cheapside, in the dwelling-house of Mr. Thomas Nutting. On the 10th of June, about half-past one o'clock, I saw Runxtmann and Loenthall at our warehouse, which is on the first floor—they inquired the price of various goods there, silk goods chiefly—Loenthall spoke to me as well as he could in English, and said it was difficult to buy a large parcel of goods, not understanding the English—he said he had got a carpenter at home who spoke English and German well, but he was sick—he laid his head on his hand and made all manner of motions—I showed him the commoner sort of goods—he objected to them as not being good, and required them to be weighed, and the boy was sent down into the shop to weigh them—he then inquired the length and breadth of the goods—he gave me his address, and I wrote it down, and required him to write his name himself—he told me his name, but I could not understand what he meant—he agreed about the discount, and kept me in conversation along time, during which Runxtmann went down stairs—when Loenthall went, I put on my hat and followed him—when I got out I saw Loenthall going up Bread-street to Cheapside—I then saw him cross and join Guttschalk, about seventy feet from the warehouse—they walked towards Lawrence-lane—Runxtmann crossed over and joined the other two—they had some conversation at the corner of Trump-street—by the time I got to the corner of Trump-street, they had got down King-street, and were on the cab-stand—Runxtmann got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Loenthall went up King-street towards Cheapside—at that</p>

               <p>moment a policeman was passing—(I had lost sight of Guttschalk then)—I told the policeman to stop the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, as I believed there was a man in it who had robbed me—I went after Loenthall to Ironmonger-lane, and stopped him—I rubbed my hands down his pockets and about him—he exclaimed, "Me no thief"—I did not detain him—I followed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and saw the policeman had stopped it—I went up and told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to the station—the policeman and Runxtmann were in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I got on the box, and saw Runxt<lb/>mann turning these goods out of his pocket on his right-hand side, as the policeman sat on his left—these are gentlemen's silk handkerchiefs—they were on our counter the moment before the prisoners came in—we had only had three dozen of them in, about two hours before—I went to the sta<lb/>tion, and saw Runxtmann searched—I saw a piece of paper taken from him, on which was an address written in pencil—we went first to an address which Loenthall had given me, in Osborn-street, Whitechapel, and no such person was known there—we then went to the address which was found on Runxt<lb/>mann, at No. 5, William-street, Cannon-street-road, St. George's—when we got there I saw Loenthall coming round the corner of the street, and, of course, I seized him—he had got a large bag with him, as much as he could drag—I gave him in charge to the policeman, and we took him to the same station where Runxtmann was—I gave a description of Guttschalk, and at eleven o'clock at night I saw him at the station—he asked if I knew him before—I said no, I did not—he said, "I will prove to you that you do know me; I have been to your warehouse to sell pens"—I said I thought that accounted for how the other prisoners found out our warehouse—he said he had met these prisoners; that they came with a recommendation from Hamburg, and he bad introduced them to different places, that it was not likely that he should in<lb/>produce them to persons who had been customers to him, and who knew him, if he thought anything wrong of them; and be likewise said he could prove he was at home at his dinner at half past one that day.</p>

The prisoner called several times—he said he was a dealer in different articles, and he came on the 1st of June and wished me to let him have some shawls to show to some customer—I went out with him to show these shawls to his customer—he wished me to go on and said he would overtake me—he told me to go next door to Mr. Batton's, a pawnbroker, in John-street, Edgeware-road—I went, and found it was a rag and bottle-shop on one side, and a chemist's on the other—he did not overtake me, but I went and inquired if any one there wanted any shawls, and there was no one wanted any—I went back to my shop and missed these articles—I did not see the prisoner again till he was at the Police Court, but I had seen him several times before that day.</p>

The prisoner was in his service—on the 25th of May, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, on Saturday night, he came to the mill, and said he wanted to come in after the engine shut down to catch some rats, would I give him a call—I said I would—at twelve I went to the gate and found him there—as I was going to lock the gate, he said, "Don't lock the gate"—I said, "Why?"—he said, "There was no necessity for it, it is not customary"—I did not at that time suspect anything was wrong—I went down to the mill with him and got a light—he asked me to go round to the fly-wheel of my engine, and hold a light there, and not to make a noise lest it should disturb the rats—my going round would get me out of the way so as to prevent my seeing what he was doing—he said he wanted to get a live rat if he could—I went as far as my engine-house window—I then suspected something, and went to the mill door—I found it was shut—I opened the outer door, and found the inner door half open—I went up stairs on to the first floor, and saw the prisoner coming from a place where we sack flour, and where the bulk of flour was—he had something under his arm—when he saw me he went to the pollard-bin, and I there saw him drop in a bag which I suspected contained flour—I went up to him—before I got close to him, I said, "What do you do here, Read?"—he said, "I thought you were <hi rend="italic">going</hi> round to the bin'—by that time I had got to the bin and took the bag, which had got from 8lbs. to 10lbs. of flour in it—I said, "You villain, what do you mean by this?"—he said, "Don't Graves, don't"—I was going to the super-intendent of the mill—when I got to the door the prisoner knocked the light out of my hand, and seized the bag—we had a scuffle, and he got it from my hand—I made towards the gate, and took out a lucifer match to get a light—he knocked it out of my hand—there is a timber yard close to my em<lb/>ployer's premises—the prisoner had an opportunity of throwing the bag there—there was a bag found there with a small dust of flour in it—the policeman took the bag and the flour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith, and live at No. 8, Albion-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea. On Monday, the 29th of April, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was going across Battersea-bridge, from the Surrey, to the Chelsea side—there is a toll-house at each end—I passed through that on the Surrey side, and immediately after I crossed the road, about twenty paces from the toll-house, and looked over the balustrades into the water, I heard a cry from the other side of the bridge, as if somebody was hurt—it was, "Oh dear, oh my!"—I looked in the direction from whence the cry came, and saw a woman coming over the bridge, towards the Surrey-side, not di<lb/>rectly towards me, but towards the end I was standing on—she ran on the op<lb/>posite side of the road to me, but on seeing me, she crossed directly to me, and laid hold of my hand—she was exclaiming then, "Oh dear, oh dear!"—she said, "Will you be kind enough, Sir, to take me to the toll-house?"—I said, "What for, my good woman, what is your object in going to the toll-house?" for she was very unsteady, and reeled as if she was tipsy—I thought she was tipsy at the time—she said, "Oh dear, oh dear!" and said, "some<lb/>body has cut me, Sir"—I held her hands firm, for she felt as if she was fell<lb/>ing—she turned round, saw the toll-collector, and ran from me direct to him, which was about twenty paces—it was the toll-collector on the Surrey<lb/>side, from which I had come—I looked at my hand, and by the light saw that it was covered with blood—I immediately went to the collector, where the woman was then standing, and said to him, "What is the matter with this woman; she says somebody has cut her, and look at my hand?"—at that time she was falling, and she was laid down on the ground—there were two women there—I stood looking at her, and perceived a great quantity of blood close to her shoulder—I knelt down, looked at her, and saw the back part of her neck was cut—during that time the alarm had been given, and several persons had come around me—I was kneeling down at that time—when I saw the wound, I said, "Good God, the woman's throat is cut"—a person said, "It is Mrs. M'Farlane"—I do not know who it was—it was some person in the crowd at the back of me, and I heard another voice say, "Then Dalmas has done it"—some gentlemen came round from the Swan Tavern, and Mr. Freeman and Mr. Mullens each said he would go for a doctor—they ran away for the doctor—two policemen came up, and I said to one of them, who was leaning over me, "Why don't you go and give information on the other side of the bridge?"—he replied he could not leave till the doc<lb/>tor came—I saw another policeman, and said, "It is no use two of you being here"—I said, "My God, the woman will bleed to death before assistance</p>

               <p>comes"—I said that so as to be heard by her—she was then removed to the passage of the Swan Tavern, which was close by, and while lying there, I said again, that she would bleed to death, that she was dying—she appeared to me to be dying—I saw Langton, the officer, there then, and Mr. Gosling stooping over her—he is the landlord of the tavern—Langton knelt down and addressed some question to her—she was then lying on her back, bleeding profusely—before that I had heard her say nothing but "Oh dear"—I can<lb/>not say positively how long she lived after the question was put to her, but I should think about five minutes, not more than that—Mr. Gosling did not in my hearing say anything with respect to her state, before the policeman put the question to her—nor had any person besides myself said anything in her hearing about her state.</p>

               <p>duty near Bolton-place—I know the house of Mrs. Dolly, No. 9, in that place—I noticed a man walking in front of Mrs. Dolly's house, from twenty minutes till a quarter to nine—it was five minutes, to the best of my opinion—whilst he was walking up and down, the woman walked out of Mrs. Dolly's house, crossed the foot-path, and went into the road, and the man who was walking in front, crossed and met her—they went, arm-in-arm, together, towards the Queen's Elms—I noticed the man's person—I looked very narrowly at him—the pri<lb/>soner is the man—the woman wore a coloured gown, and a dark shawl with a coloured border—I took no further particulars—she seemed a smart made woman, respectably dressed—I did not see her face, for they walked in a different direction to where I stood—the man was dressed in black—he had on a black hat—the brim might be considered a little broad, but it was nothing particular, but what, in my opinion, suited a man of his age.</p>

On the night of the 29th of April, I was standing near Chelsea church—the carman Timms was with me—no other person at that time—it was about twenty-five minutes to eleven—while standing there, I saw a man running in the direction from the bridge, and calling "Police! police!" in a tone of voice, as if he was very much agitated—he went up Church-lane, or Church-street—I was not stand<lb/>ing in Church-lane—I was in Duke-street—Duke-street and Church-lane join each other—I saw him return almost momentarily, and he said, "There is a woman that has cut her throat on the bridge"—I cannot say which way he went then—I left him immediately, and went towards the bridge—I saw a policeman—the man had on a dark frock-coat to the best of my recollection—nothing else that I remember—he had a hat on that was broad-brimmed, and he wore it much over his forehead—I afterwards saw a person whom I believe to be the same, at Wandsworth police-station—that was on Satur<lb/>day the 11th of May, I think—I saw him standing among other people, and recognized him—it was the prisoner—I believe him to be the same man—he is the person I singled out from among the crowd at Wandsworth, and I believe him to be the person I saw that night.</p>

On the night of the 29th of April I was at the corner of Church-lane, near the old church, Chelsea, close to the stable where my horses are kept—Cook was there with me—he was standing in the road—I did not see a man come from the bridge—I saw a man come down Church-lane—he called "Police! police!" and said a woman had cut her throat on Battersea-bridge—he then went along the waterside—not towards the bridge, but the other way—I did not take notice of his person at all—he had a surtout coat on, I believe; a frock coat, you might term it—it was between ten and eleven o'clock—it struck ten when I was in the King's-road, it took me a quarter of an hour to come home, and I had been home some time before I heard the man repeat these words.</p>

To the woman that I adore, and will adore to the last hour of my existence—Sarah, beloved Sarah. In the name of God have pity upon your unhappy Augustus. I waited yesterday morning in the greatest anxiety in the hope of seeing you with me at the altar of God, according to your promise. This morning I intended to watch for you at Queen's Elms, but you sending me word by Caroline that you would call on me at eleven o'clock, made me stop at home; did you do that on purpose? It is now four o'clock, and I shall not stir from Queen's Elms till I have seen you; but if you should evade me, pray send me word by Augusta before twelve o'clock to-morrow, where and at what time I am to meet you in the evening.

I suppose you spent a happy evening yesterday, while I was pining in my now desolate garret. O my Sarah—if you knew how unhappy I felt, I think you would almost have been tempted to come and see me, even at the late hour at which you came home. What a miserable day again I have to pass. Pray, my dearest Sarah, shorten the dull hours of my solitude, and come and see me as early as you possibly can—as early as your good heart will prompt you. Come and take a cup of coffee with your Augustus—your devoted Augustus and faithful husband. I shall expect you from four to five o'clock, for your interview with Dr. Morrison will, I know, be the means of saving me, and insuring my future welfare, by being able to possess you. How proud I shall be then to say to my ungrateful children, "Here is the woman that saved your father's life"—I suppose you are aware what makes me so unhappy this day—if not, look at the date of this letter, the 16th. I fully expect a letter from your sister Caroline to-morrow morning, as I requested it as a par<lb/>ticular favour, as you would spend the evening with me. God bless you, my beloved Sarah.

               <p>"Thursday afternoon, 18th April, 1844. Dearest and beloved Sarah,—I have not recovered from the shock the news you brought me last evening gave me. I did not say much to you for fear of increasing the lowness of spirits in which I found you; but the nervous grasp with which I pressed your hand while at chapel, must have let you know what was passing in my agitated bosom. Bitterly did I reflect and repent the rash step I took on the 9th of August last, as by this time, with perseverance, you and I might have been happy. The idea of your being obliged to turn your house into a lodging-house for common men, breaks my heart. Is there nothing else you can do? The idea of an unprotected woman to be surrounded and have to wait upon a parcel of fellows, drives me mad. The continued hatred of your sister Ellen towards me also afflicts me to the highest degree; a woman who I never injured in any way, but always respected, and would have been proud to call my sister. She was partly the cause of my leaving my home, and I do really believe will not be satisfied till she sees me dead; on her head their will be my death, and I shall leave to Providence the care of punishing her for her inveterate and undeserved enmity to me. Excuse me, my adored Sarah, if my feelings force me to write thus; but you have no idea what pangs I endure when I reflect upon what has passed for the last nine months. Do not fail to meet me and Caroline at chapel on Sunday. Poor girl, I thought she would have fainted when I told her of your troubles; she would have gone over to you this evening, but the little boy is so poorly she cannot leave him in the evening. Do not be shy at Mr. Morrison when you see him on Sunday. I merely told him, that you had acted as a mother to my children, and how happy I should be to have such a woman as you for my partner, if ever it pleased God to put me in a situation to offer you my hand. I inclose a letter I received from your Caroline. You will inform me on Sunday what I am to say to her in my next. I suppose William will call on</p>

               <p>me by eight o'clock on Saturday evening; I shall wait at home for him. Perhaps you will send me a few shillings by him, in case the weather should be bad on Sunday, which I pray God will not be the case, for I long to join my prayers to yours, for our future welfare and happiness. Should Dr. Morrison write to you, or make any further inquiries, pray let me know im<lb/>mediately. I shall call on him on Saturday morning. I hope, my beloved, you have been able to keep up your spirits, and gone on pretty well with your work; to-morrow evening you will be enjoying yourself, perhaps while I am pining. Can I call at Higgins's for you if so let me know. Why don't you get Mrs. Rock to write to me if you cannot spare time, yet a line from your own hand would be such a consolation to your unfortunate Augustus. Try, my dearest, to find a few minutes to spare to write yourself, if it is only one line, signed by my beloved Sarah; I shall preserve it as a treasure. Do not forget the broach and the book on Sunday. God bless and protect you, my beloved Sarah—my only friend. Pray for your affectionate husband, "<hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>."</p>

My unfortunate Augusta leaves her situation to-morrow even<lb/>ing—can you still act as her mother, and give her shelter until she recruits her health and obtains a situation as nursemaid? she can take care of your house, and do all you require her to do, to assist you and keep your house in order; pray do not abandon her. Will you be kind enough to meet me at seven o'clock to-morrow evening, at Trafalgar-square, to receive her in your care, and see what her mistress will allow her for what she has done. My poor heart is broken at the idea of seeing such a young girl so unfortunate. I have something on my mind which I want to divulge to you, in case anything should happen to me, therefore pray attend to this solemn appeal of mine to meet me to-morrow at seven o'clock precisely. Your unfortunate <hi rend="smallCaps">AUGUSTUS DALMAS</hi>. "</p>
               <p>"Tuesday evening, 23rd April, 1844.—My Sarah,—This is the first time you sent me a cross message, and I hope it will be the last. You told me you had forgiven me, and gave me your blessing. Why, then, should you now send me such a message that you are very cross with me? Augusta has money to pay you for her temporary stoppage at your house, as I think Caroline will require her assistance in the nursery, or get her a situation near her, therefore do not be angry. You always told me that Augusta should never want a friend as long as you had a home for her, but whatever you do for her will be fully rewarded. See you I must; therefore send me word by Augusta to-morrow morning, when and where with the least inconvenience to you. Although you sent me such a cross message, I am still your affec<lb/>tionate husband, <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. Relent, relent."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The three following letters were those found on the table at the prisoner's lodging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A—"To Mrs. M'Farlane, Bridge-road, Battersea, Surrey.—Read with atten<lb/>tion the last sentiments of a man who did once love you to perdition, whom you have ruined, and now grossly insulted, and call Mr. Kiss my * * Infernal Millwood! monster in woman's shape!—you have now thrown off the mask, and shown yourself in your true colours; an abandoned profligate prostitute of the lowest order. I know all your artful deceptions. You are little aware who watched you when you were carrying on your criminal intercourse with your paramour. You used to send my daughters up stairs, and under pretence of bringing the tea-kettle on the wash-house fire, you artfully ex<lb/>amined</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100194"/>
               <p>the passage and the stairs to see that no one was listening or watching, then locked yourself in the back chapel room, and prostituted yourself for hours together. You have dishonoured the names of your father and husband, and have the effrontery to boast of it. Well might the gar<lb/>deners, when they used to pass your dwelling, say, "This is the house of that b—old wh—M'Farlane, who used to live in the gardens; she keeps a chapel and a brothel." I was so infatuated, I would not believe any of those reports, but am now fully convinced; indeed your obscenities with me, and your repeated pollutions of my person ought to have opened my eyes, but under a spell, I mistook your profligacy for affection. All you wanted was to satisfy your obscene propensities, and enjoy yourself at my expense, and when you found all the money gone, like other prostitutes, you laugh at me for a fool, and insult me in the most disgusting language, fit only for a Westminster wh; but you shall not go unpunished. I write by this very post to Mrs. Talk, and others of your family, and disclose the whole of your profligate conduct. You—to dare to say that you have done anything for my family; they never had an ounce of bread from you but what you charged them the price of a loaf. You have shamefully robbed them and me. You directed your thief of a son to enter in the book double the amount of whatever they had. You have lived upon my money for the last four months, and you never rendered an account. Where did you get the money to pay for your son's shoes, but in my purse? Did you not charge me for Sophia's expenses down to Derby, when you had more than the amount sent you by Miss Graham and Mrs. Woolf? Did you not have the meanness to charge the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which your paramour, Meredith, deducted from the linen-draper's bill? when you had so much money of mine in your hands, you would not even allow poor Augusta a penny for medicine, while you was launching me into all sorts of extravagance, in supplying you with gin, &amp;c., &amp;c. Instead of a virtuous woman, I found in you a cursing, swearing, blaspheming, gin-drinking prostitute, who will go with the lowest fellow, provided he can treat you—a woman of the most vulgar and dirty, lazy habits—who blushes at nothing—call to her son, in the presence of my daughter, to fetch the p—p—, and squat and ease herself before him—and O, horrid! allows that son, seventeen years old, to sleep with her, when she is aware of his having obscene books and pictures in his possession. In<lb/>famous woman, these are the actions for which you ought to be horse-whipped out of Battersea; and wherever you go, there ought to be a post and a lantern with the words, 'Beware of a prostitute.' Simpson had often told me that you were a bad lot altogether, and that you were one of the most artful pro<lb/>stitutes in Battersea, but I was fool enough not to listen to him. Monster, you have obtained your wishes in bringing me to my grave—you are my murderess. I shall haunt you during your life, and when I meet you in hell, will torment you to eternity—you will wither and die a miserable old wretch. Miserable man that I am, to have placed my affections on such a prostitute and monster; but my children will revenge me I hope, and make you restore all you have robbed them of, and give an account of my money. You have lived for years by your prostitution, and obtaining possession of the unfortu<lb/>nate property. Well might you, with your two days' work, wear nothing but silk stockings and French shoes, and lull yourself in bed till nine o'clock, while my poor unfortunate children were obliged to do your dirty work. You and that old b—d, Rock, dare to call my daughter a wh—; look how she works, and that will be at once a complete denial of all you artfully tried to insinuate in my mind against her; but she has found friends, who will punish you for what you have done to her. I have informed her of all your</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100195"/>
               <p>obscene actions with me—your debauchery and profligacy; and you may rest assured she will revenge me. I send this letter unsealed, on purpose that it may be read at the post-office, and that all Battersea may know what a pro<lb/>fligate wh—you are. The letter to Mrs. Talk is also left unsealed for the same purpose; independent of which, I left a paper on my table which shall appear in the papers, that you may not have a chance of escaping the op<lb/>probrium and the scorn you so richly deserve, and prevent other miserable beings from falling into your snares. Go, wretched wh—, and carry on your trade fairly at Wapping, amongst your companions, and don't assume again the cloak of religion to hide your profligate conduct. Complete the educa<lb/>tion of your worthy son—he cannot have a better tutoress in the art of iniquity; you can make him fit for anything, and prepare his way to the gallows. Love, jealousy, and despair—all your works, have brought me to complete madness—my pen curses you—yet, in my dying moments, my poor heart still loves you. Farewell for ever.—<hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. "</p>
               <p>B—"To Mrs. Talk, near the Bridge, Battersea, Surrey. Madam,—That consummate prostitute, M'Farlane, is a dishonour to the name and to your family, and it is high time you should be acquainted with her profligate conduct. She has carried on an illicit intercourse for some years with a married man—that profligate Meredith, the nephew of Mr. Breeze, the linen<lb/>draper, at Kensington. With all her cunning she could not prevent my children from discovering her licentious libertinism; and yet this is the woman that I unfortunately did love—fatal is the hour I ever admitted her in my house; but under the mask of hypocrisy she resolved my ruin. She had hardly closed the eyes of my dying wife, than, by the most lascivious caresses, she created the fatal feelings which have now brought me to perdition. She made a secret entrance from hers into my house, that she might have access at any hour, without being perceived by her sister Ellen. Alarmed at the progress of the fatal passion she was to art<lb/>fully raising in my bosom, I resolved to fly from the scene, and accordingly abandoned my home, family, and business, with the full intention of destroy<lb/>ing myself; but the recollection of a faithful and affectionate daughter, who was hastening home from America, prevented me; she met me at Liverpool, and persuaded me to come back to London, where, on my arrival, that Mill<lb/>wood, M'Farlane, came to meet me. She invited me to her house, where she renewed her lascivious caresses, professed the most ardent affection for me, saying that since the death of her husband she had never loved any one like me; she readily accepted me as her future husband, and induced me to pub<lb/>lish the banns in Kensington church, and our marriage was actually fixed for the 16th of Jan. last. Meanwhile she had received a large sum of money for me, which she wanted me to give to her son, to set him up in some busi<lb/>ness; however, having received some hints that she was carrying on an illicit intercourse with that profligate, Meredith, I hesitated; she then made up her mind to rob me of part of the money, and make me spend the remainder in debauchery with her, play-going three times per week, suppers, gin-drinking, coaches, <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, omnibuses; nothing stood in the way. She then began to amuse herself, as she calls it, in exciting the passions to an unnatural degree by acts of the grossest indecencies, and repeated pollutions of my person, ex<lb/>posing her bosom for me to suck her breast, and all sorts of obscenities that can be practised in the brothel; stopping with me till one and two o'clock in the morning; had me at her house on the Sundays, and while prayers were offering to God below, was amusing herself in her libertinism with me, sending word down to Mr. Baker that she was very poorly. You now know the cause of her absence from chapel. Ask at the toll-gate at what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100196"/>
               <p>hour she used to come home in the morning; interrogate my children, for even their presence did not stop her from her indecencies. Finding my money going fast, I wanted once more to fly from such a den of infamy, and, under pretence of having some business in Paris, asked her to let me have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my money: but no, that was not her game; she would not see me depart till she had quite done with me. Alarmed at my awful situation, I began to make repeated inquiries, and found all my suspicions well founded, that every one of the Battersea gardeners knew her to be a common prostitute. I taxed her with her illicit intercourse with Meredith, and she had the un<lb/>blushing effrontery that she should still carry it on; and to prevent her sister from observing when he comes, she meets him at that old bawd's, Mrs. Rock. What will you think when I inform you of her allowing her son, seventeen years old, to sleep with her, when she admitted to me herself that he had in his possession obscene books and pictures; and when she comes home, even in the presence of my youngest daughter, calls out to <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> to bring her the po, and squats herself before him. Horrid! Will you after this look upon that infamous woman as your sister? Impossible. Having now given up the chapel, she intends to turn her house into a brothel, by taking none but single men lodgers. What a miserable and unfortunate man I have been to put my affections in the power of such a vulgar prostitute. Now that she has completed my ruin, she most grossly insults me, and even to my daughter calls me Mr. Kiss my * * *. Could I have expected more dis<lb/>gusting language from a Westminster wh—? Heartless wretch! When, last Sunday week, she kept me in debauchery till four o'clock in the morning at her house, I informed her that my mind was in that state that I should cut my throat; she very coolly said, "Don't do it here, it will make such a mess." Can you any longer allow that infamous prostitute to dishonour your maiden name, and allow her to call you sister? She has driven me mad—mad—mad; she has murdered me! <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. "</p>
               <p>C—"To my unfortunate family—Be it known, that infernal prostitute, M'Farlane, of No. 13, Bridge-road, Battersea, that second Millwood, has brought me to perdition; she has robbed me and my family under the mask of affection; she has led me into all sorts of debauchery: her profligate and illicit intercourse with that married man, Meredith, the nephew of Breeze, the linen-draper, of Kensington, at the very time she had offered to become my wife, has made me come to the determination of committing suicide. I have been adoring a common prostitute, who now insults me in the most re<lb/>volting manner. To have been mad enough to put my affection on a swearing, cursing, blaspheming, gin-drinking washerwoman and a wh—, has turned my brain; I can live no longer: let the world know her, and may this prevent other victims from falling into her infernal snares. <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. My unfor<lb/>tunate children, my unfortunate family! Farewell Caroline; farewell Char<lb/>lotte; farewell Sophia; farewell Augusta; farewell for ever: that Millwood M'Farlane has murdered me. <hi rend="smallCaps">A. DALMAS</hi>. Avenge my death."</p>
