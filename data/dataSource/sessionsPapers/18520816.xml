                  </hi>, Esq. I am a barrister, at 7, New Square, Lincoln's Inn. The prisoner came to my chambers on 29th June—he asked me if my clerk was in—I said he was gone out for a short time, but would be in shortly—he said he came from Messrs. Davis's respecting a fee of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an extra fee on account of difficulties respecting certain papers—he did not say he came to pay it—he said his call was respecting this fee; and he said he was quite sure Messrs. Davis would pay it—I expressed my regret that they should have the trouble to send about it—while we were talking, the clerk, Mr. Marsh, came in—I accordingly left the clerk's room, to which I had gone, and went into my room—I rather thought I should see the fee come after, but it did not—the prisoner certainly did not pay me—I did not receive from my clerk any account for the purpose of my clerk signing it—the clerk came in, and I left it to him to attend to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner, ray brother Thomas; we are solicitors, and live at 25, Coleman-street. The prisoner was in our employ, as clerk, in June—he had been so since the 10th or 12th of April—I am a client of Mr. Williams'—on 29th June I gave the prisoner this account, with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In gold, to pay it—the amount is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was going to the westward—I saw him on his return, about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he then told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160006"/>
               <p>me he had paid Mr. Williams himself the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he told me he had left the account with Mr. Williams to be receipted, and that Mr. Williams never receipted accounts himself—he said I should have it the next day—I did not have it—the last day the prisoner was in my employ was on 1st July—he went out on business, and I did not see him afterwards till 7th July—I had no notion whatever of his leaving my employ—on 20th July, after he had been before the Magistrate, I found this account amongst the papers of a suit in Chancery, which no doubt the prisoner had had occasion to use—on 7th July I heard he was in the lower part of the house, and I went down, and found him in the passage—he complained of my having spoken harshly to him, and I accused him of what I termed embezzlement—he stated that he had lost two sovereigns of the money, and he meant to make it good—I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> There is no other office there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Our rooms are the only offices that are occupied; I have no recollection that you offered any explanation, or said that you came to explain—you did say you had come to make up your account, but you had no account to make up—I keep a cash-book—if I gave you money to pay, it was your duty to enter it in the cash-book, but that only applied to petty amounts—this was a transaction by itself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Williams. I remember coming in on 29th June, when the prisoner was there—my master went into his own room, and left me with the prisoner—he produced an account to me of some office fees that had been made before, and some extra fees that had been omitted, and he asked me if I would give him an account of the fees that were then due—he said Messrs. Davis were very good ones to pay fees, and he would bring them up in a few days—he did not say he had lost the money, or had got the money; nothing of the kind—I gave him the account of the remaining fees, and he left the office, taking the account away with him—he did not leave it with me to put the receipt to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is very true what is stated by Mr. Davis and Mr. Williams; the fact is, having other business to do, it was my custom to put down the daily work on a slip of paper, which I carried in my waistcoat</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160007"/>
               <p>pocket; I changed the half-sovereign, and the three sovereigns I wrapped up in my daily list, and put it into my waistcoat pocket, and, going to other places, I must have dropped the money; Mr. Davis knows how difficult it is for a clerk to state to his employer the fact of a loss; I told him I had paid it, but I had lost it; how it was I cannot say; I did not go to the office again till I had used my utmost exertions to make the money up, but, not having done so, I went for the express purpose of telling him the fact; if I had absconded it would have been a different thing, but I never kept out of the way; he knew where to find me; I could have had a good character from a gentleman with whom I lived seven years, but he is dead; and my late employer, with whom I lived four years, is in Brussels; I only regret my error in having stated that I had paid it, but I did it hoping to make it up; if I had stated that I had lost it, it would not have been credited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Magistrates, at Brighton. I remember the defendant, Mr. Sill, attending before the Magistrates there, on several occasions—I saw him there on 8th March—there had previously been several hearings of the case of Staven and Broome—the charge against them was, obtaining money and bills from Mr. Hamp under false pretences, and for cheating at cards—I did not take any note of what Mr. Sill said on 8th March; I can speak from my memory—he applied to the Magistrates that they would sanction his withdrawing from the prosecution, and that Mr. Chase's recognizance, who had been bound over to prosecute, subsequently to Mr. Hamp being bound over, might be considered to be discharged—his grounds for making the application were, that Mr. Hamp had made an</p>

               <p>affidavit in the matter relative to Mr. Sill's bill of costs, in which he, Mr. Hamp, swore directly opposite to the evidence which he had given before the Magistrates in his deposition; and that another witness, Sherman, I believe, had also made some affidavit, or statement, contrary to what he had sworn before the Magistrate; under these circumstances little reliance could be placed upon them, and he desired to withdraw from the prosecution—there was a great deal said on the subject, but I cannot charge my memory with any thing more—the Magistrates retired, and after some consideration returned, and told Mr. Sill that, as he desired to withdraw from the prosecution, they no longer considered him as the solicitor for the prosecution—that was followed by Mr. Sill saying that he hoped he had the approval of the Magistrates in the course he had pursued—the Chairman replied, "We give no opinion upon that, Mr. Sill;" and that closed the proceedings—Mr. Sill never appeared as solicitor for the prosecution after that—the Magistrates had previously bound over the superintendent of police to prosecute—I was afterwards instructed by the Magistrates to carry on the prosecution—I did so, and Staven and James were tried and convicted—the proceedings were against John Broome, Charles Staven, and John James—James and Staven were convicted, John Broome did not appear—that is, he did not appear to answer the indictment; he was there, but was not tried—Mr. Hamp and Sherman were examined as witnesses for the prosecution, on the trial of that indict<lb/>ment—Mr. Hamp was subpœnaed because he did not appear at the first assizes, and his recognizances were estreated; but Sherman having appeared at the first assizes his recognizances were enlarged.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 102, Lisson-grove. I was, a short time ago, proprietor of the Opera tavern, in the Haymarket—I am also the champion of England—I remember a young gentleman of the name of Hamp lodging at my brother's, John Broome's, in Air-street, Piccadilly—I remember their going to the Brighton races last year—after that there was a charge made against my brother John, with Staven and James, of cheating Mr. Hamp at cards—I was not at Brighton at the time—I first heard of the charge on 23rd Aug.—I know the defendant—I had never known him before the charge was made against my brother—I first saw him, to speak to him, on 6th March, at an oyster house in the Strand—(I attended at the Spring Assizes at Lewes—I saw Mr. Sill there then, but that was after 6th March)—I was at the Coal-hole tavern, in the Strand, and was sent for—a friend, or relation, of the pro<lb/>prietor of the Coal-hole came for me, and I went to Mr. Price's oyster shop, in the Strand—it must have been about 11 o'clock at night, it was Saturday night—I saw Mr. Sill there—he shook hands with me, and said he had been anxious to speak to me for some time—we had several glasses of grog together in the oyster shop; I paid for the greater part of it—Mr. Sill then proposed going to my house, as he could not speak before so many persons—in con<lb/>sequence of that I ordered a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went with Mr. Sill to the Opera tavern—it was near 12, or it might be a little after when we got there: we went into the bar-parlour, my wife was there—she left the room, and when we were alone Mr. Sill said it was he that had carried out this prosecution against my brother; and he also said that he had seen the Secretary of State on the subject, and he had told him that if my brother was convicted he would be transported—he said it was impossible for him to escape, as he had drawn an indictment with thirteen counts, and he could not get through it—our con<lb/>versation lasted till 5 in the morning—he said there was just time enough to save my brother, and he could do it; and he also said that he must have for doing it at least 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give me till 2 o'clock on the same</p>

               <p>were, it was what the world thought—my brother said he could give him no more money, and would not allow me to give him any; but in a few minutes after I went out for a bill stamp, and Mr. Sill drew the body of it—it is an order on Taylor and Lloyd, of Birmingham, for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">reading it</hi>)—my brother said that he had ruined him, he had sacrificed his position, and his character, and he could not submit, or allow me to submit to this extortion, either of us any longer—Mr. Sill said we were well aware of his power with the Secretary of State, and if we did not give him the money he should most certainly carry it into effect—I sent for the bill stamp, because I thought it was better to do so than allow my brother to be sacrificed—the first bills were lying on the table, and my brother asked him to let him look at the bill stamp—in reaching over for it my brother picked them all up, and put them in his pocket—I also retained this 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—Sill was very much excited, and said if we did not give them up, he would never leave me or my brother until he had transported us—my brother had possession of them, and refused to give them up to Sill—Sill said, "I will give you one other chance before you leave, and if you do not I will make it the bitterest day's work you ever had in your life"—my brother said he might do his best or his worst, be should never give them up, they were his property—we were acting under advice in taking this course—here is another bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Mr. Sill on Thomas O'Brien—it is in Sill's writing—I had to give him the money—I gave it him on 6th March (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"3rd Oct. 1851, Three months after date, pay to my order 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for value received—to Thomas O'Brien, Esq., Accountant's-office, General Post-office, London.

I know John Broome and the defendant—I was one of the witnesses examined at Brighton against Staven and James, in the case that Mr. Sill was acting as the prosecutor's attorney—I first saw Mr. Sill on the subject of that trial in the early part of Aug., 1851—that was the first examination—I saw Mr. Sill first in London, at the Cheshire Cheese, kept by Mr. Lane, in Marquis-court, Drury-lane—a man named Watkins was with him, and Mr. Hamp, Mr. Jones, the landlord, and Mr. Doyle, the barrister—they were talking the matter over before I went in; and we went from the Cheshire Cheese down to his office—Mr. Hamp said Mr. Sill was go down to Brighton, to get the bills back in the Brighton case—when Mr. Hamp told Sill about the circumstances, he said, "Broome knows nothing about it; he went down with us certainly"—Sill said, "Certainly he went down with us, and you must put him in with them, because he is a monied man, and be can pay the expenses"—on other occasions I have had conversations with Sill about John Broome, when he was in the country, at Bacton, in Herefordshire, where Mr. Hamp lives—that was in Christmas week—he said he could get a good sum of money out of the prosecution, and I was foolish if I did not get the same too—I said I should not do anything of the sort, and told him I knew very well that Mr. Broome was innocent—he said, "Innocent or not, it matters very little; it is what the world thinks of him after what I have done"—afterwards, on 16th March, I attended the trial at the Lewes Assizes—I was bound over to prosecute—I saw Sill on that occasion in the passage of the White Hart, opposite the Court-house—he said he had got a good sum of money and bills out of <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Broome; why did not I have some too; and he said, "You will be of great assistance to me if you can persuade him that I have got power with the Secretary of State, as he can transport his brother John"—he said if I could do that, and he could get some more bills for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I was to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> in, and have one-third—I said I should not do anything of the sort, and said he was quite aware Mr. Hamp had told him that John Broome was innocent of the charge—he said he had completely frightened <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi> Broome by telling him he had seen the Secretary of State, and I was to keep to the same tale—I did not agree to do anything of the sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I was shopman to the prisoner, at his shop in Upper Whitecross-street. I entered his service on 11th June, 1851—he had not another shop at that time, he had afterwards in Chapel-street, Islington—I remember a fire happening at the shop in Whitecross-street on 24th June—previous to that fire the prisoner had spoken to me about a fire being likely to happen—it was four or five weeks before, I cannot exactly say—he talked about his wanting to get some money, and said he was in difficulty—it was something to that effect, that he wanted to get some money somehow or other, and he thought it would be best to fire the place and get some money from the Insurance office—he conversed with me on that subject more than once; he used to speak very frequently of it—I do not remember exactly the words he might have used, but he was frequently speaking that he intended to fire the place, and they were making preparations for it—he directed me to pull down some of the ceiling in the front cellar—that was the portion of the cellar under the end of the counter, near the back of the front cellar—that was the night before the fire—no one was present when he gave me that direction—I pulled down the ceiling that same evening, and put it into a bag and carried it away, and shot it behind Pickford's wharf in the York-road—while I was taking down the ceiling I saw Betteridge, and he said I had not pulled down enough, I was to pull down some more—he told me where to place the rubbish—he told me he required the ceiling to be removed to put some empty barrels and boxes underneath, in order that the fire might get through the shop quicker than it would if the ceiling was not removed—I <hi rend="italic">eased</hi> a board under the counter, I mean I wrenched it a little up—it was not loose before I loosened it; it could then be lifted up and down—Betteridge directed me to do that—Mr. Betteridge had an errand boy of the name of William Warner at the shop in Whitecross-street—Warner was not on the premises on the night of the fire; he was sent into the country on the Tuesday before—Betteridge told me that was because he had better know nothing about it—a dog was kept at Whitecross-cross street—it was generally kept in the cellar—he was loose, and could go into either cellar—there are two open doorways between</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160032"/>
               <p>the two cellars—the dog was not at Whitecross-street on the night of the fire, it was at Islington—I took it there on the Thursday, the day before the fire—I also took some goods and a coffee box—there was some tea and two boxes that were taken from the house—what they contained I do not know—they were not stock from the shop, but something from the house—there were two boxes of tea, the coffee box was empty—it is a box which stands on the counter, with three partitions in it for ground coffee—I believe it was a japanned box—it generally stood on the counter, or somewhere where it might be seen—it was a very good box—there was another coffee box at the shop in Whitecross-street that had been there from the Tuesday night before—it came from Mr. Rose, in Old-street-road—I went there by Mr. Betteridge's direction to fetch it—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he had told me how much I was to pay—the time I took the coffee box to the shop at Islington was the last time I was there before the fire— Betteridge directed me to pile up the boxes and chests in the cellar under<lb/>neath where I had taken the ceiling down—I did so—I placed several empty barrels, and tea boxes, and sago chests, that I fetched from the yard, and some chest lids from the shop—I did not place anything else there, besides the boxes—there was no paper there; after the shop was closed, I put some paper near the cellar door—the shop was closed a little after 10 o'clock—Mr. Betteridge and his housekeeper Charlotte Webber were present when I placed the paper there—Mr. Betteridge told me that it was put there for whoever went down to light it—Webber was present, but she might not have heard that said—we all had supper together that night; and I went to bed a little after 11 o'clock—Mr. Betteridge told me I was to go to bed, and he would call me before the fire got dangerous—I mentioned to him about my clothes—he said there was no chance of its going so far as the top of the house where I slept—I do not know whether either of the prisoners went to bed that night; I went to bed and left them up,—I was called up by Mr. Betteridge, I should think between 12 and 1—he had on his trowsers, shoes, shirt, and braces—I also saw Webber; she was in the same room with Mr. Betteridge; that was the second floor front—she had not her gown on, but she had some underclothes on; what they were I do not know—I went down into the second floor front room, where the prisoners were—the engines had not arrived at the time I entered the room, nor had the fire escape—before they came, and before any one had given the alarm, Mr. Betteridge said to Webber, "Had we not better give the alarm?"—she told him not to be a fool, to let them find it out—I believe the police gave the alarm, there was no alarm from inside the house; the fire escape after<lb/>wards came, and by that left the house—we went over to Mrs. Seward's, on the other side of the street, for a time—Mr. Betteridge came there, but did not stop there—we went back to the shop; it might have been an hour after, I cannot exactly say, it was as soon as the fire was put down-next morning Webber told me that she lit the fire because Betteridge was a coward—she told me the fire was lit about 12—since the fire Betteridge has conversed with me about it—he said it was put out a quarter of an hour too soon—on the Wednesday after the fire I went to the Monarch Insurance Office—Mr. Humphreys, the surveyor of the Company, was at the shop; and said he wanted me to go with him and Mr. Fogo—the prisoners knew that Mr. Humphreys had asked me to go there—I saw Mr. Jay, Mr. Humphreys, and Mr. Fogo there: I made a communication to them—on my return to Whitecross-street, the prisoners asked me where I had been to; and I told them: and what was said, and I told them—they were both present—I told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160033"/>
               <p>them that the people at the office knew nearly all about it; and Webber said they did not, they had only been <hi rend="italic">pumping</hi> me—she asked me if I had said why I was to take the ceiling down,—I said, "Yes,"—and she said, if I had not said why I was to take that down, she could have got us out of it by saying that the ceiling fell down into her washing, while she was washing—I know a boy of the name of Ensor—I did not give him anything the day before the fire—I saw some books given to him by Mr. Betteridge; they were the shop books; I believe one was a ledger, what the others were I don't know.—(<hi rend="italic">A plan was here produced, and the witness pointed out to the Jury the different portions of the premises, and the position of the fire.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any lodgers in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the place where I pulled down the ceiling was in the front kitchen, underneath the counter—we generally sat in the kitchen, except on Sundays—the kitchen is behind the store room—the store room is the front room first floor, and the kitchen is behind the store room up one pair of stairs from the shop—then there is the sitting room and a bedroom behind it, where Webber slept—m y master's bedroom had been the store room until the day before the fire; then he removed into the sitting room on the floor, that is a story higher—when I first went into the prisoner's service, Webber was in the country for two months—I was not an apprentice.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How old are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I shall be seventeen next Oct.—I had been with Mr. Betteridge for twelve months on the 11th of that same month, acting as his shopman during the whole of that period—he was carrying on business at 152, Whitecross-street—he had no other shopman but me and Warner—he was there before me, he is rather younger than me—before I came to Mr. Betteridge I had been living at Wat-lington, in Oxfordshire—I was in service there at a grocer's for three years within a few days, that was my first situation—I had two masters in the same shop—I can read and write—I have not received a very good education—I do not mean that I was very badly brought up—I went to school—I was not in the habit of going to Church, generally to chapel—I was in the habit of going to chapel, not with my master and friends, I generally go by myself—I saw the contents of the parcel that was given to Ensor, I saw it being done up; it was done up in my presence—empty barrels were occasionally kept in the cellar—Webber was in the habit of washing in the back cellar, not in the cellar where I took the ceiling down—there is an opening from one cellar to the other—she has complained of the ceiling falling on her washing, but not in the part where it was pulled down—I do not know that Warner had been promised a holiday for some time before—it had been spoken of about his going into the country long before—his friends live in the country—I do not know that he had asked to go, he had been spoken to about it by Mr. Betteridge, I cannot say how long before—it might have been two or three months, I cannot say—there was a dog there—I do not know what kind of dog it was, I do not understand dogs—I do not know whether it was a terrier—I know the difference between a terrier and a Newfoundland, it was not a small dog, it was more of a bull-dog, I should suppose—I cannot say what it was, it might have been a bull-terrier—I had 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week wages, and my board—I do not know that Mr. Cook bad complained of the rats at Islington, and asked for the dog to come there—I know that the rats at Islington had been spoken of, and he had a dog there that killed rats—there was one dog at each shop—there was a complaint made that the rats had actually bitten through the gas pipes at Islington.</p>

               <p>was required? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, the one that was at our place would not touch a rat, or go anywhere near it, to my knowledge—I have seen him run away from a rat—I only knew Mr. Cook from his being with Mr. Betteridge—he had been with him about six weeks, or it might have been more—it was four or five weeks before the fire that Mr. Betteridge first began to speak to me about it—I was not in the habit of going out with Cook; I assisted in clean<lb/>ing the shop at Islington with Cook before it was opened—I did not take my meals with him then, I came down to Whitecross-street to meals—I was there nearly all one day, and I think I was there a little time after that—I was not in the habit of going out with Cook at any time, not to my know, ledge—I do not remember that I have been out with him—I have never been out with him of an evening, nor of a Sunday—I have certainly walked with him little way towards his house; the way I was going—he lived in River-street, King's-cross—I have been to his apartment there—I do not know who he used to go and see there—I have been there two or three times; he did not invite me, I think I called upon him; I do not remember that he invited me—I have never spent the evening with him there, merely called for a short time—I have not been there with him on a Sunday, not at all that I remember—I have never spent the Sunday with him—there was a woman living in River-street, I do not know her name—I have not, to my know<lb/>ledge, been there with Cook, except the two or three times that I called there—if I had spent a Sunday with him I could not have forgotten it—I have been with Cook since this matter was investigated at the Police-court—I was with him at Islington, in the same shop where he was—that was after Mr. Betteridge was taken into custody—I think I was in the shop with him nearly a week—he and I were carrying on the business with a young man named Chalmers, who came there on the Saturday night—I have been at Cook's house since that, I do not know how many times; it might have been two or three times perhaps—it has not been a dozen times, I swear that—I went there to visit him; I used not to spend the evening with him, nor the day—I went there merely to speak to him, to see him—I might have had business with him—I went to see him—perhaps I had not any business with him—I do not remember that I had any particular business with him, perhaps I had not any—I went to see him as a friend—I have not spent any Sunday with him since, or taken any meals with him—I have had a cup of coffee at his house one morning—I was there about 10 o'clock, not to breakfast; I had had my breakfast—besides that, I do not remember that I ever drank with him before or since—as near as I can recollect, I think it was between 12 and I when I was roused out of my bed on the night of the fire—I am not able to say whether it was nearer 1 than 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been spoken to by Mr. Betteridge about going down into the cellar with a candle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, not often; perhaps I have more than once—he has not blamed me for that—he has blamed me for doing things in the shop, if I did anything wrong—that has not been very often of late—he told me after the fire, that I was to say that I went down into the cellar with a candle—he told me to say that—I have mentioned that before—I have not told it to the attorney for the prosecution—I do not remember that Mr. Bet<lb/>teridge has complained of my going down into the cellar with a lighted candle—I went to bed on that night, knowing that the fire was going to happen, I undressed myself, and latched my door—no one could get in from the outside without forcing the door open—I went to sleep, and was roused out of a genuine sleep; I did not sham sleep, I could not help going to sleep; I tried to keep awake—some of my clothes were in the bedroom.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not so fast asleep when Mr. Betteridge came up stairs, that he was obliged to force the door open in order to rouse you up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he did force it open; the prisoners and I escaped by means of the fire escape—the escape man and the police were there at that time, not the firemen—the engine had not arrived—there were a few persons outside, not a great many, not so many as might have been thought—I cannot say whether Mr. Betteridge had his stockings on.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly lived at 46, Chapel-street, Islington. I was employed there, as shopman to the prisoner, from the commencement of May—that was about the time the prisoner took the shop—we were not doing the trade we expected we should do—about the 10th May the prisoner told me that he contemplated setting fire to his house and premises in White-cross-street; that he should do it for the sake of claiming a greater amount from the Insurance Company than he was insured for, or the goods that would be destroyed rather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made no remark particularly—I heard the conversation—he was my employer—previous to the fire various things were sent from the shop in Whitecross-street to my shop, various goods, stock for the shop in Chapel-street—no books were sent—a dog was sent the day previous to the fire, or the same day—he told me he should send it up out of the way—he also told me that he should send the lad Warner out of the way for a holiday into the country—two chests were sent to me the day previous to the fire, I believe, and some tea—there were clothes in the chest belonging to Webber, and some belonging to Mr. Betteridge—neither of them slept at my house—I remember receiving a coffee box a day or two previous to the fire—it was sent up from the shop in Whitecross-street—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160036"/>
               <p>did not know that it was coming until it arrived—Webber afterwards came up to remove it, as inquiries bad been made respecting it, and she removed it from where it had been deposited and hid it in the cellar below the shop—that was after the fire; it might be three or four days after—she said she was sent up by Mr. Betteridge to secrete the tin—it had been placed in a room up stairs—she had it brought down and she hid it in the cellar—I did not see it afterwards—I saw her go into the cellar with it, and there is no outlet besides; she could not have gone anywhere else—I saw Mr. Betteridge the night after the fire, and he told me of the fire—I said I had heard of it, and asked him if it was burnt effectually or thoroughly destroyed—he said, no, it was not, it was discovered too soon—he afterwards told me that if any in<lb/>quiries were made respecting the two chests, I was to say they were my property—he told me that Judge had been taken to the Monarch Fire office to be examined, and he was afraid he had told too much, or words to that effect—Webber came to me on the Friday afternoon, as the fire took place in the morning, to change her dress—she requested one of the boxes to be taken up stairs—it was taken up stairs, and she changed her dress and left the place—she did not say anything to me before leaving—after the first examination before the Magistrate she came up to Chapel-street, and asked me what I should do or what I should say if I was examined or asked any question—I said I should tell the truth, and she remarked that there was not a hole for them to creep out of—I did not know anything of Mr. Betteridge's affairs, only from what he told me about the time of commencing, that he was rather embarrassed—he did not say that he was short of money, but that he had been refused an extension of credit at a certain house he dealt with, and they wished him to reduce his account, which he bad done.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160037"/>
               <p>that—there is no mistake about that—I know River-street—I lodged at 23, River-street, previous to going to Chapel-street—I was not in the habit of sleeping there while I was in Chapel-street—I used to go there to get something for dinner next day, and come back to the shop and sleep—I might have a bit of supper there, and go back to my own place to sleep, because I had no one to cook for me at the other place—Judge has been to River-street to see me since this occurrence; he knew where to find me—I have no recol<lb/>lection of his calling on me there whilst I was at Islington—he might have called on a Sunday—I would not swear that he has or not—he has perhaps called on me three or four times, or perhaps more, since the investigation at the police court—he had no particular business with me—he merely called as a friend, I suppose he is a stranger in London, he has no relatives here, nor have I—a Mrs. Cableton lives at 23, River-street—Mr. Betteridge never complained to me that I had let her have some tea without paying for it—he never said a word to roe on the subject, I can explain the circumstance you allude to—the party I had appartments with was in the habit, from the first commencement of our business, of ordering a few things every week, which was regularly entered—I believe hers was the first order in our book—she gave an order for two quarter pounds of tea to be sent in one parcel—she brought the tea back in the afternoon, and said, before the parties in the shop, "You have made a mistake with my tea"—she took it out of a basket and I did it up in two quarter pounds, and she carried it home—no com<lb/>plaint was made about that, but a person called that night and said that he had followed Mrs. Cableton from the shop, and tried to make an accusation against me in the presence of Mr. Drew, who is sitting there, it was about 12 o'clock at night, I do not see the person in Court who made it—Mr. Betteridge did not make any complaint—he was then in custody—Mrs. Cableton is a married person—her husband is away at present, and is expected home soon—he has been away for some months—I am not married—before I came to Mr. Betteridge I lived in the Gray's Inn-road, with a Mrs. Palmer, managing a business—I was there rather better than twelve months—I have been for a short time on the Croydon and Epsom railway—no other—I was discharged from there in consequence of a reduction taking place in the number of hands for the winter months—that was the reason given me—I had been there about four months—I have been at Exeter—I was there perhaps a month or six weeks—I was never on the Great Western line, or any branch of it—it was about 10th May that Mr. Betteridge made use of the expressions to me about contemplating the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never communicated with the fire office until it had happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know what office he was insured in till after it had happened—I made an inquiry the week before, but did not find out—when I say I made inquiry, allow me to explain, the shop in Chapel-street was about being insured, and the policy was sent back in consequence of the name being spelt wrong, and some other errors in it, and I merely asked if the policy had come from the same office—that had no reference to the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the district A, of the fire-brigade. I went to the fire about 2 o'clock in the morning; it was out then—I was with Alfred Wilson, and John Crampton, who have since met their death by being crushed in a fire—I examined the premises with a view to ascertain how the fire originated—(I had not then heard any account from the boy)—I considered it originated in the front cellar—there was an aperture in the floor of the shop, at the end of the counter; and the flooring was burnt at that part—the end of the counter was burnt off about two feet each way—the aperture appeared to have been opened purposely for the fire to go up—the boards appeared to have been loosened by some parties, and they were loosened by the fire as well—it was burnt through in one portion—those boards formed part of the fabric of the house—there were boxes and things piled up under the aperture; not immediately under it, but a foot or so from it—the fire would pass through the hole as through a funnel, which carried it into the shop—one board was burnt through, and the adjoining board was loosened, as though it had been prized—I concluded that the fire came from the boxes—the boards were not burnt immediately over where the fire was—if there had not been a hole, it would have burnt immediately over the fire, instead of burning where it did, which was a foot and a half or two feet on one side—the opening caused a current of air to carry the fire into the shop—I was led to suppose, by the end of the counter, that there had been two fires—at that time I did not know that a portion of the board had been prized; that would account for all the appearances which presented</p>

               <p>themselves—the fire had burned the basement of the shop, and the house was severely damaged by heat, and it had burnt all the goods in the shop—the flooring'of the shop forms the ceiling of the cellar; it was burnt through, the joists were charred—six or seven feet square of the flooring and joisting were actually burnt—the fire must have arisen in the cellar, at the staves, tea-boxes, and chests, immediately under where the greatest action of the fire ran—there were no combustible materials there which could have caught light; it was merely kept as a lumber place—most of the boxes were lying under where the fire was, or within two feet of it; but there was a vast deal of water from the engine, and that might have washed away some—there was a copper in the back cellar; it had not, in my opinion, been recently used for washing; the flue was broken down—there was a ceiling to the back cellar; a portion of it was broken.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had the engines been playing before the fire was extinguished? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I got there at 2 o'clock, it was extinguished then—the water injured the stock in the shop, but it was not displaced—Judge and Mr. Cook were examined at the police court before I gave my evidence—it was my opinion originally that two fires had taken place—the flooring at the back of the counter was entirely burnt, about two feet square I should think—some portion of the board which was prized was burnt—it was lifted up—it was near to the aperture at the end of the counter—I did not notice any nails in the board that was lifted up—I looked at it without touching it, because I would not displace it—from the basement, the joists over your head were very much burnt—the fire would have gone up between the joists which go through a party wall, and up at the end of the counter, which caused a thorough draught, and the fire would rush to it—that is my opinion—there was no other draught, and no other trapdoor open—I do not think there was any window—I saw no light through—there was no trapdoor that I am aware of—I did not examine to see if there was one—I had no occasion to do so, in my opinion—I saw there was no place to see daylight through—there are open iron gratings under the window, but it appears to be filled up, as no daylight can be seen when you are in the cellar—I did not examine it at all, I had no occasion—I was there two hours, or two hours and a half.</p>

I did not get it from Churchill, his agent, till the Monday following—on the Tuesday I went to assess the claim—I did not examine the premises, I examined the stock; the insurance being on the stock, fixtures, and furniture—I think clothes were not included in the insurance; there is no item in the claim for clothes—I noticed the remnants of a coffee canister, and gave it into the hands of a policeman, who now holds it—on the Wednesday morning, in consequence of information I received from Mr. Jay, I asked Betteridge where he had purchased that canister—he said he had purchased it of a hawker that came into his shop about three or four months previously—I asked if he could tell from whom—he said he could not; it was a stranger, who came into the shop hawking goods—there is only one canister charged for—as far as my recollection goes, I think he said he purchased this because the former canister was worn out, but I will not say positively—I went down into the cellars to examine them, that was after we had received the informa<lb/>tion</p>

               <p>—I observed the hole that had been spoken of by the fireman, and like-wise the board (<hi rend="italic">referring to the plan</hi>)—this represents the basement story—this is the front cellar, and this the back—the great body of the fire seems to have been near the centre of the front cellar, the under side of the joists of the flooring boards were here severely burned—the two deceased firemen and I were in the cellar, and our first impression was, that there had been two fires, because it was so very much more scorched in one part than another, and we could not account for that, except upon the principle that there had been two fires—then it was afterwards revealed to us that this board on the top step had been prized up—I could see that—the fire had actually burned away the boards in the lower part of the floor—here is an area of about 4 feet 6 inches—the burning away here covered an area of 2 feet 3 inches by 1 foot 1 inch, or 2 feet by 1 foot; making a superficial area of about 4 feet 6 inches upon this area that was burned away; but the intensity of the fire had evidently been here—this fire had not been set alight in a very <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> way, because there was no exact funnel, no draught for it—these casks must have burnt for a considerable time, and then have burned the under side of the ceiling; but without that board being raised up, most likely the fire would not have extended into the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you draw this plan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, for the office—before I drew it I did not give any notice to the prisoner or his solicitor to attend with any surveyor to watch—I had no instructions to do so, it was ray own impulse to do it; at least I had no instructions from the office to do it; I thought it would render the matter clear—it is customary, if a surveyor has to survey premises that are to be purchased, to give notice to the other side, so that two surveyors may go through the premises, one on each side —I should do so in an ordinary transaction—I did not do so on this occasion—if it had been thought of, or desired, I should have been very glad.</p>

               <p>am not conscious of having done anything unfairly in this matter, my atten<lb/>tion being now drawn to it I should have been most happy to have met another gentleman—the casks that are put in the plan are merely sketched in, not for the purpose of ornament; they represent what I saw at the time—I cannot say that these casks were there; there were eight casks there on the Saturday morning when I was there; a portion of them were burnt, very considerably, and some not—they were knocking about the cellar—they are put together in the plan, as nearly as I could do it, to afford information—there was a funnel formed by the joists of the ceiling between the cellars and the shop, through which a current of fire would pass rapidly—that funnel led towards the part that was burnt—the flooring was burnt to the extent of four foot six, superficial—I am sure there was no window to the front cellar—I examined for the purpose of seeing, and there was none—there had been an aperture, but it was bricked up, both back and front—I should think from there being no other aperture the fire would pass through this funnel with the greater rapidity—there was no trap door, or any iron grating, through which a light could get into the cellar—I examined on the Saturday, with reference to that—if there was any iron grating it must have been bricked up, it was not visible—I do not think that great heat could cause wood to bend, there is not much expansion in wood.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not known instances in which there has been a severe fire on one side of a street where the shutters of the houses opposite have actually been bent by the heat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen the paint blistered, but here where the great portion of the fire was, the floor was intact, it was not injured on the upper surface—the aperture is under the counter—the fire does not appear to have ascended through the ceiling, except by this aperture—I should say that heat does not bend wood—I have not known the shutters of a house opposite a fire bent by the heat without being burned—I do not know of any such instance—I do not believe it could be possible, except it was unsea<lb/>soned wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Queen-street, New North-road, and work at Mr. Tirebuck's printing establishment, in Monk well-street. The prisoner was an apprentice there—it is the custom for the workmen to go to dinner at 1 o'clock—there is a room adjoining the shop, in which we dress after wash<lb/>ing—a person must come through the shop to go there—there is no open communication with the street—I never go out to dinner, but stop to look after the place—the prisoner was in the habit of going at 1; but on 15th July, having some work to finish, he did not go till half past—from the time the other men went at 1, and when the prisoner went, no one came in—I had a waistcoat hanging up in this dressing room, with a silver watch and chain in it—I saw it safe there at 10 minutes past 1 when I went and got some money out of it—the prisoner's clothes were also in that room, and when he left he went there, put his clothes on, went away, and I did not see him for a week afterwards, when he was brought back by his mother—I went into the room at a little to 2, and found my waistcoat was gone, and the watch—two of the men had then come back, and gone into that room; one of them was still in the room, and I immediately communicated it to him.</p>

I am a daguerreotype artist, of 432, West Strand—I know the prisoner—about the middle of May he came to me and said he was going into the country, and wished a portrait for a specimen—I lent him one for two or three days—either he or his son took it away—I saw it again last Friday, at the pawnbroker's—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I had been living with the prisoner for a little better than twelve months, but had been part of the time in service—I left him, and went to service again, five days before this matter occurred—I left him on Friday evening, and I went back on Tuesday night to get my clothes, and to see him—I found him in a public house—he told me to sit down and drink with him—I did so—he took me to another public house, and called for a quartern of the best rum—I staid there till it was getting on for 10 o'clock—he called for another half quartern, which we drank between us, and then he wanted me to have a pint of half and half—I said if I did I should be tipsy, and could not go home to my place—he said, "Come and make my bed, ray bed has not been made since you left me"—I said I could not go up stairs because my mistress only gave me leave for two hours, and I could not stop—he said, "Come up, and I will not delay you half an hour"—I said, "I shall go up and make your bed"—we went up stairs at about a quarter or half past 10—he then locked me in, and said, "You won't go home to your place to night; I shall be up early in the morning, and then you can go to your place"—I went to bed—I said I should lose my place for staying out—I had been such a short time in it—about 2 or 3 in the morning he put his hand across me, got kissing me, and he had got a razor open in his hand—I said, "Don't murder me"—he said, "I will serve you out now"—he gave me the first cut here (<hi rend="italic">on the chin</hi>)—he wanted to cut my throat—I put my arm up, and he cut it, in two places—I kept my arm all the time to my throat—I said, "White, you have done for me at last"—he said, "You are not murdered yet," and gave me another cut on my arm, as I was at the door—I opened the door and ran down stairs, leaving the door open—a policeman took me to the hospital directly, and I became unconscious—I have been an out patient ever since, and have lost the use of my arm—there was nothing</p>

On 9th June, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!" by several women—I went to the spot, and found Mrs. Hurley coming out of the court bleeding from the face and arm, and holding the cut together—I went to the second floor of 11, Devonshire-place, and found the door fastened on the inside by this piece of wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) being placed above the latch—I called to White to open the door—I received no answer—I called a second time, and threatened to break the door in, which I did, and found the prisoner lying on the edge of the bed undressed and bleeding from a wound in the throat—he said, "I did not think she would have done this to me"—he directed my attention to where I should find a razor—I found this razor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) covered with blood and the handle broken; it seems to have been twisted—the blade is not broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Painter, a surgeon, of Broad-way, Westminster. I am in the habit of attending Westminster Hospital, and assisting in dressing wounds—I saw the prosecutrix on the morning she was brought in—the surgeon who first dressed her wounds is ill—I saw two wounds on her face and two on her right arm—those on the arm were very deep; one was three inches long, and divided some of the muscles and tendons, which will prevent her using her hand for a length of time, and will quite cripple her—those on the face were deep, but did not go through the lip, and she had another deep wound on the arm—I think the wounds on the arm were received while putting her hand up to defend her throat from being cut—I saw the prisoner's wound—it was about two inches long—the trachea was not divided at all—no large vessel had been cut, but he had lost a good deal of blood—I should say it had been inflicted by himself because it was cut on the left side, and the point where the razor would go in was consider<lb/>ably deeper—it was such a wound as is commonly inflicted by a right handed person cutting his throat.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 230). On the morning of 21st July, I was on duty on the right hand side of Holborn-hill—I came down to the end of Field-lane—it was about 20 minutes past 1 o'clock—I saw the prisoner standing with a female whom I had seen before with prostitutes—I requested the prisoner to move on—he said he would go when he thought proper—I said he must go when I thought proper—he did not go, be stood for several minutes, and I stood also—I then took him by the arm to move him—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and struck me—he then walked sharply down Plough-court—I followed him, to take him into custody for assaulting me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160061"/>
               <p>I followed him down to the house, No. 27, which is the back door of 27, field-lane—when I got to the door he began making use of bad language—he called me all but everything—I took hold of him to take him into custody, and he said, "I will be b----d if you take me"—I was not aware that he lodged in that house—I endeavoured to take him into custody, but he resisted me, and began making use of abusive language—he called me a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi>—during that time the door was opened, and I saw Mr. Henderson partly dressed—he said to the prisoner, "Why don't you come in doors, that man will not hurt you"—the prisoner still kept calling me a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi>—Mr. Henderson got bold of his arm, and pulled him in doors—(there was a light, the gas was burn<lb/>ing in the room)—the prisoner walked to a table that stood at the further end of the room, right opposite the door where I was—he stood there a few minutes, and then rushed towards the door—seeing him rush, and being much agitated, I drew my truncheon—he rushed past Mr. Henderson, who was standing with the door in his hand, and said to me, "You b----r,----r, I will learn you to lay anything to me"—he raised his right hand, and I perceived that he had a knife in it—he made a stab at me, which I warded off with my truncheon—we then closed and got struggling, and in the struggle the leathern strap which goes round my wrist, to keep my truncheon, broke, and he got the truncheon from me, and with it he made a blow at me, which I received on my right shoulder—I do not know whether he dropped the truncheon, or threw it away, but it fell—we then separated, and I was going up the court to get further assistance, and he ran after me with the knife—he struck at me—I had nothing to ward it off, and I stooped, the knife came against the side of my face—it cut my cheek and under my nose, and went down to my breast, and the knife bent, as you see it is now—I was bleeding profusely from the face—the prisoner tried to get away, but I held him till further assistance came—another policeman came up—I was obliged to let go the prisoner, I was so exhausted—I looked about, and close on the spot I picked up the knife—this is it—I afterwards went to the hospital—the surgeon examined me, and I got a certificate—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but he was perfectly aware what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the lodging-house, 27, Field-lane, which has a back door into Plough-court. On 21st July, and for some time before, the prisoner had been lodging in that house—he used to take his meals in the kitchen, which has a window into Plough-court—I burn a gas light there till about 2 o'clock; not all night—on 21st July I had been sitting up for the prisoner, who was out—I had a light in the kitchen—about half past one I heard a knocking at the back door—I went to it, and found the prisoner and Marshall, the policeman—they appeared to me to be wrangling, and I could hear the prisoner calling Marshall a <hi rend="italic">puppy</hi>—that was the only word I could distinguish—they were in conversation—I knew the prisoner was drunk, because he had been in my place before, and asked me for the loan of six<lb/>pence—I went out and talked to the prisoner, to induce him to go in doors; in fact, I pulled him in—he went about three parts down the kitchen, and the policeman said, "If you come out of that place again I shall lock you up"—the policeman stood at the door outside, and as soon as he said he would lock him up, the prisoner opened the drawer, took a knife out, and</p>

               <p>rushed past me out—I ran out of the front door into Field-lane, and saw a policeman—I told him to go round—I was not gone above five minutes—I went round the court and found the prisoner on the ground, in custody bleeding from the inside of his hand; and Marshall was standing by bleeding from the face—the knife is now bent, it was straight before—it has no handle, only the iron—that might injure a man's hand if he squeezed it very tightly—the prisoner was in the habit of taking his meals in that kitchen; he must have known that the knives were kept in that drawer.</p>

On the morning of 21st July I was called into Plough-court—when I got there I saw the prisoner struggling with Marshall—the prisoner was holding him by the hair of his head with his left hand, and holding the knife in his right hand—I seized him by the collar—Marshall was holding the prisoner by some part of his body with his right hand, and with his left hand he was holding the prisoner's right hand, which had the knife—Marshall's face was bleeding very much, but what from I did not know—I took the prisoner into custody, and when I took him the knife fell on the ground—I had pulled him down—his hand was bleeding, but what from I could not tell—he seemed to be a little under the influence of liquor, but he was quite sensible enough to know what he was doing—I took him to the station house.</p>

On 9th July I saw the two Scotts, the father and son, coming from Gold's Hill—I also saw the prisoner—young Scott went up to the prisoner and struck him—he said, "You had a b----y lot of talk about me last night," and struck him—the prisoner said, "I don't know that I saw you last night"—Scott then "struck him—they had one round, and both fell; the prisoner was under<lb/>neath, and Scott on the top—they both got up again, and were in the act of fighting—the father was in the act of striking some person with the canteen; I cannot say who—he did not strike anybody with it—the prisoner then turned round and struck him somewhere about the ear—he knocked him down—he fell on his back in the road on the stone pavement—I think he had a cap on—I walked away and did not see any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. About a fortnight before 20th July I met him accidentally—he told me had been very unfortunate and thrown out of work, had been confined in the hospital, and undergone an operation for the stone—I had known him about five or six years ago—at the time I was foreman to Mr. Burt he was employed there, and was a very steady, sober, honest man—I had the opportunity of giving the gold out to every man in the factory; there were twenty-five of them—I never found anything wrong, and from the knowledge I had of the prisoner's character I gave him leave to refer to me, and Mr. Sraily called on me on 20th July.</p>

I saw the prosecutor on the night of 15th June—he was in a very faint and weak state from loss of blood—I found a wound on his left cheek about an inch in length, and an inch and a half deep; there was a small artery divided —it was a very dangerous wound, it bled on two or three occasions after it was dressed—he was in danger for ten days or a fortnight; he is still suffer<lb/>ing from it, and he will be some time before he recovers—the effect on his speech is produced by the wound—there is paralysis on one side of the tongue, and he will never be able to speak properly again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacco pipe maker, and live in Cornwall-street, Mile End-road—the prisoner is my brother-in-law. On 16th May, about half past 11 o'clock, I was at my father's house, 25, West-street, and saw the prisoner there—he was in liquor, but knew very well what he was about—he was <hi rend="italic">heaving</hi> stones at my father's door and shutters—I went out to get some beer for supper, and he began using abusive language, and throwing stones at me—I came back with the beer, and more stones were thrown, and at last one very large one was thrown, and my father went out to give the prisoner into custody—he ran away, and during the time we were going up the street we met a policeman, and my father gave him in charge—I was with my father, and was going to point him out, and during that time the prisoner came back again, ran across the road, and said, "I have you, you b----take that," and laughed—I was stabbed in the groin—my bowels were disarranged, and I was obliged to put my hand to keep them from coming out—I did not see anything in his band—after that he attempted to strike my head, but my father struck his hand down, and it came by my ear and inflicted a cut—I called out to my father that he had a knife, but I could not halloo very loud, and he did not hear me—I managed to get in doors, and found myself bleed<lb/>ing very much—I had not quarrelled with him—I have had a few words with him, but nothing to any effect—I was taken to the London Hospital, and remained there seven weeks—I sometimes feel the effects of the wound in the groin now—the wound on my head is healed—I believe I was in great dan<lb/>ger for some time while in the hospital—I was not able to come out at all during the seven weeks—I can do a little work now, but I cannot do a hard day's labour.</p>

                  </hi>. I live and carry on business at 58, Baker-street, Portman-square, the Baker-street Bazaar. I am in partnership with my brother, Mr. William Massey, and have been so about eight months—before that I carried on business as a linen draper, at Stamford, in Lincolnshire—I am twenty-nine years of age—I had been in business as a linen draper six years—I am a Lincolnshire man—my father was a very large farmer there—I have one brother, who lives at St. John's-wood, who has an appointment in the city, and another brother who is an ironmonger, at the Baker-street Bazaar—on Friday, 30th July, I went in an omnibus, from St. John's-wood to Charing-cross—I dismounted from the omnibus at Charing-cross—I left my brother's at 10 minutes to 10 o'clock, and I think it must have been about 20 minutes past 10 when I got from the omnibus—on my return from there I passed the back of the barracks—I had no occasion to pass it, but I did pass it, on my way back to St. John's-wood—there is a urinal there at the corner of a street, where the baths and washhouses are—I do not know the name of that street; it is at the back of the barracks—there are six divisions to the urinal—I have made a model of it since (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—there is a gas light at the end of it—there is no gas light at the top—you can go into it from either side—I am not sure whether I went in to the third or fourth division from the side nearest the baths—while there I did not speak to a soul—I did nothing while I was there except the purpose for which I went in—when I first went there the place was full, and two others waiting—I did not see the prisoner there—I went in, and came out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There is a long wall there I believe, and this place is fastened against the wall, there being more wall on each side of it, out-side the place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when I left I should think there were four persons there—it was perfectly light—I came out at the end against the baths, and turned to the left to come into Princes-street, that leads into Oxendon-street, and into Coventry-street—it is the only direct street into Coventry-street—I went straight up, I passed the baths and washhouses, and turned westward towards the Haymarket—I did not go up a street called Arundel-street, which has no turning, and then come back again—my attention has been since called to Arundel-street—I certainly did not go up there—I went through Titch-bourne-street, into Regent-street—I continued part of the way up Regent-street, on the right side—I then crossed over to the left, and waited to hear a band playing, I should think about eight minutes—it was playing in one of the bye streets leading out of there—I then proceeded to the Regent-circus, where the omnibuses stop to take up persons—up to that spot nobody had spoken to me—I had not the slightest idea that any one was following me—I had passed many policemen between the urinal and the Regent-circus—I waited about fire or six minutes for an omnibus before one came up—during that time no one spoke to me—there were policemen standing there—at the expiration of that time I was about to get upon an omnibus—I had not got up—I was just moving from the causeway to get up; I had not touched it; I was close to it; it had stopped—any one could tell by my manner that I was going upon it; and as I was going, the prisoner touched me on the shoulder in this way, took hold of my left arm, and said, in a low tone, "I want to speak to you"—I turned round, and he said, "You have been guilty of an indecent assault upon me at the back of the Trafalgar barracks, and I mean to have your name and address"—he was not dressed half so well as he is now—I had never seen him before until that moment—I turned round, and said to him, "You villain, what do you mean? I have never seen you in my life before, and I am only surprised at your audacity in making such an accusation"—he replied, "Oh, we shall see"—I said, "I suppose you are one of those fellows that require feeing, but you will be mightily deceived in the person you have got to deal with, for not one penny, or one farthing, or a single fraction would I give you if it were to save your soul"—I felt very intimi<lb/>dated; indeed I think I might have been knocked down with a straw at that moment—he kept saying, "Oh, we shall see," and he said he was determined to have my name and address—I said, "If my name and address is all you require, that I can easily accommodate you with," or "give to you"—I took out my card-case, and was going to give him my card—I took out my pencil also, to write my address upon it; but it struck me just at the moment, that if I gave him my address, that would be all he required, and he might annoy me in after life, in writing or some other mode, and I thought I bad better not give it—I gave him a card—it was afterwards produced by him at the police-office—I did not tell him my address when I gave him the card—I said I was going to St. John's-wood, near the Eyre Arms—I said that I lived near there—the omnibus was not stopping all this time; it had gone on—I then walked on, up Oxford-street, partly on the left side, as far as Duke-street, and then crossed over to the right, the northern side, the side nearest St. John's-wood—I turned up Duke-street, into Manchester-square, and ultimately into Baker-street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160074"/>
               <p>—that is the street in which I carry on business—during the time this took place, as we went along, I repeatedly saw police-officers, up Oxford-street, and likewise in Manchester-square—when I got to Dorset-street, which is a street crossing Baker-street, I turned round, and said "Now I shall not allow you to follow me or insult me any further"—as we went along he repeatedly spoke to me, but I never made any reply—he kept following me—I was conscious of his following me—he said he was as much a gentleman as I was—and what a very fine sort of a gentleman I must be, and those sort of observations—and in Baker-street I said, "I shall not allow you to follow me, or insult me any further"—we had passed a policeman about thirty yards in Baker-street, and I turned back and met the policeman—he was following us, and I said to him, "This man has a charge to prefer against me, policeman, you must take me into custody, and hear what he has to say"—at the very moment I began to speak, the prisoner also said, "I give this person," or "gentleman in charge"—I spoke first; I am sure of that—we met the policeman—the prisoner said he gave me in charge for an indecent assault at the back of Trafalgar-square—he must have seen the policeman as we passed him in Baker-street; he could not help seeing him—we were going in the same direction—the prisoner was behind me—I said to the policeman, "Now, supposing this accusation to be true, what should you have done to the person that did it? would you not at once have knocked him down?"—the policeman said, "Certainly, I would"—I went to the station with the policeman—the prisoner there preferred the charge, and I was locked up all night with other prisoners—some drunken, horrid fellows were in the same den where I was put—the prisoner was not detained in custody—he was allowed to depart—next morning I was taken to Marlborough-street police-office, put into the dock, and the prisoner appeared against me—he was sworn and examined—after the case was finished on his part, the worthy Magistrate, Mr. Hardwick, dismissed the charge at once, and made us change places, and bound me over to prosecute at this Court—that was the Magistrate's own act—there is not the slightest foundation for saying that I put my hand upon his private parts in this urinal, or that I exposed my person to him—I had never seen him to my knowledge till he approached me at the omnibus.</p>

               <p>towards Panton-square at all; I am quite sure of that—I did not turn up any street—I crossed Coventry-street from the left to the right, a little further on than Oxendon-street—I did not go into Leicester-square at all— I did not go down Arundel-street or Arundel-place—Regent-circus is a very populous place—the prisoner did not come up to me, or make any observation to me until I got there—after he first spoke to me I might have called the attention of the police: I did not do so, because such a thing never struck me at the moment—there were, of course, plenty of passers by to whom I might have spoken—I asked the policeman if the charge were true, and a man had conducted himself to him, as the prisoner said I had done, whether he would not have knocked him down—the same reasoning would certainly apply to the charge as to the offence; I might have knocked the prisoner down when be charged me, but that would have been taking the law at once into my own hands—I did not see the policeman when I was locked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live at Barking. On Sunday, 4th July, at a little before 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was standing in East-street, Barking—I know the Bull corner—it is a sharp ugly corner—I saw a horse and cart coming towards London—the prisoner was driving—he was coming galloping—I should think at fourteen or fifteen miles as hour—the prisoner had a white stick in his hand, and he hit the mare with it while it was galloping—there was a girl and a boy in the cart with him—he drove round the Bull corner at the same pace—he did not pull in—one of the wheels <hi rend="italic">skidded</hi> on the ground, it did not go round at all—the other wheel was turning round, but it was not on the ground—the wheel that was on the ground was sliding along—as they were going round the corner the cart upset—there was a dead horse on the cart besides the prisoner and the two chil<lb/>dren—they were all thrown out—I went and took up the little girl—I saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner and the little boy under the cart—having taken care of the little girl, I got hold of the little boy as quickly as I could—he was bleeding from the nose and mouth—I carried him into Mrs. Kemps, and the surgeon was sent for—he appeared to be dead.</p>

On 14th Aug., about 4 o'clock, I saw the prisoners crossing the railway—Howard had a bag; they were together, and Harris assisted Howard over the fence with the bag—they then deposited it in a cart which was standing on a bye-road—they both took part in that—I called a policeman, and gave them into custody—I saw the officer find one cwt. and a half of springs, and one cwt. and a quarter of iron, the property of the Eastern Counties Railway Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich, and am publisher and proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Greenwich Observer.</hi> I know the prisoner—he applied to me to become collector of advertisements for me—the terms agreed upon were twenty per cent., of course that was for genuine advertisements—he brought me an advertisement to insert for Mr. Burnby, a china and glass dealer, at Deptford—I inserted it—I have a copy of the paper in which it was inserted—this is the advertisement he brought me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he called my attention to the writing on the paper, that it was to be inserted once, but the type was to stand, with the expectation that it was to be inserted again—I had not inserted any before for Mr. Burnby—it was inserted on 2nd July—this is it—I asked the prisoner if he had arranged with Mr. Burnby as to the price of the advertisement—he told me no, it was to be arranged according to the scale of prices—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on that advertisement—I sent the account to Mr. Burnby, which was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I would not have paid the prisoner that 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I had not thought the advertisement was genuine—the prisoner had presented an account, including several advertisements, charging twenty per cent, on the gross amount, but Mr. Burnby's was omitted in that, and he brought it to me afterwards, and said it would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I reminded him that I had paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. excess on a former account, and that would account for it—I would not have allowed that account afterwards if I had not believed that he had obtained authority to insert that advertisement—he brought me this account of commission on advertisements—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, contained William Youens</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and John Anthony Waite</hi>, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I believe he brought this account about 1st July—before he brought this account I had inserted two advertisements for Mr. Waite and Mr. Youens—I asked the prisoner whether he had made any arrangement with Mr. Waite—he said no, it was to be inserted according to the scale—I settled this account on the supposition that these two accounts were genuine, in fact that they were all genuine—I after<lb/>wards applied to Mr. Waite, Mr. Youens, and Mr. Burnby for payment—I was not able to get either of those moneys—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the pri<lb/>soner's writing—the commission on Mr. Waite's and Mr. Youens' advertise<lb/>ments would be about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live in New-street, Borough. On 29th June I was at work at a dust yard, at Rotherhithe—the prisoner was at work there about half past 1 o'clock—we are both Irishmen—when I came in after dinner, there was work thrown on me which I had no right to do, by a man that worked alongside of me—I objected to do it—the prisoner was working up over me on a hill of dust—he said if I did not do it he would put me out of the yard—I said he dare not do it—they came and gathered round me; one of the five struck me with a brick in the mouth, which knocked out one tooth, and loosened three more; the prisoner came up, stabbed me with a knife in the shoulder, and gave me three or four kicks in the belly—I did not fall then, but was knocked down afterwards with a pot—I was in the hands of a doctor afterwards—I had offered to fight the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wool spinner, at Wellington, in Somersetshire. I was present at the prisoner's marriage at Wellington, on 17th Feb., 1840—he married Jane Ebdin, my sister—she is now living, I saw her in good health last Monday morning—I signed the register.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Newton-street, Holborn. I was in service—I was married to the prisoner in Bloomsbury Church on 25th Feb., 1850—he was not with me longer than eight weeks at first—he stayed with me till I had parted with every thing, and then he threw himself out of work and went into the country—he came back after that, and persuaded me to live with him again—I provided him another home, and he did not stay with me then more than five weeks—I did not hear he had got a wife till after I had been confined—there was a woman came and insulted me, and said she was his wife, but she was not his first wife, Jane Ebdin—the child I have in my arms is the prisoner's child—I asked him whether he was married—I put the ques<lb/>tion to him several times before I was married—he said he was not, and took</p>
