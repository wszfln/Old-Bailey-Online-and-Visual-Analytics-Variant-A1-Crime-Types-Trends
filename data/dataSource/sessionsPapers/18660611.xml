                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Rock, of Walbrook, as a clicker, and have been so rather better than two years—the prisoner was in their employment as head foreman—he worked on the top floor, and I was on the next floor under him—printing was principally done on that floor—about the 11th or 12th January, the prisoner came down, and said to me, "Baker, look out two dozen of the best white leathers"—I said, "Very well, sir"—I looked them out—he came down again, and said, "Lay them on one side for about half an hour"—I did so—he then came down with two patterns, and said, "Cut up one dozen skins of the largest pattern, and see how many you get out of a skin"—I cut them up from the patterns that he gave me—they were purse patterns—I cut up one dozen of the largest pattern, and took them up and gave them to the prisoner—he then gave me the next pattern, a size smaller, and said, "You can cut up the other dozen with this pattern"—I did so, and took them up to his desk, where he was standing—he said, "Look out five skins more; I have not got quite enough to cut up, and cut up to the last patterns you cut the others up to"—I did so—he then gave me a smaller pattern, and said, "Cut up the remaining pieces with this small pattern"—I did that—I got the skins out of Mr. Rock's stock—I gave the patterns back to the prisoner with the leather—in the course of business it is not usual to give the patterns back again—when I gave the skins and patterns to the prisoner he was over against the lift-hole, where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110006"/>
               <p>his desk was—I did not see what he did with them—I cannot say whether the white leather on these purses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the leather, it is a great deal like it; but there is so much leather alike, that I cannot say: it is the same in quality and substance, and about the size—I was engaged for about two hours and a half in cutting up these skins—a few days before the prisoner was discharged, Gerrard, one of my fellow-workmen, brought me a paper pattern—this is not it—these are the patterns the prisoner gave me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pattern Gerrard gave me was a large square pattern; about a large post octavo—it was about the size of this Hebrew Bible—I cut the piece of leather according to this pattern—this is a piece of Persian purple sheep, such as we use—I got the leather out of Mr. Rock's safe, or case—when I had cut the leather according to the pattern, I gave it to Gerrard—here is another book containing the forms of the Bishop-Stortford School—this leather is a great deal like the leather that Mr. Rock has in stock, but I can't say whether this is the leather—Gerrard brought me a pattern in respect of a book about that same size—I recollect cutting a light brown leather of this description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew that the prisoner was carrying on a separate business, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was thoroughly well known in the establishment to everybody—it was known that leather and other materials were sent in to him—we work from 8 o'clock till 8—we have breakfast before we go—we have dinner at I, and we are allowed half an hour to it, and half an hour for tea—they did not work over time at Messrs. Rock's; they did at the prisoner's—I knew he had a shop—I believe it was carried on as "Carter Brothers," by his wife—Carter is his wife's brother—I know it by hearing other persons say it in the shop—I think I have seen his wife once, but I should not know her again—I knew that Mr. Rock's men worked overtime for the prisoner—I also knew that the prisoner dealt with persons with whom Mr. Rock dealt—I can't say whether the prisoner supplied articles to Messrs. Rock at the wholesale price—I can't say whether he supplied them with purses; I believe he did—I do not know whether any of the other men worked in the shop on their own materials—these strips of paper resemble the patterns—this white leather is of the same character; it is a good deal like it—I don't recollect that this is any part of the leather that the prisoner handed to me—this white leather was bought of Mr. Wrigglesworth—I believe both Mr. Rock and the prisoner dealt with him for leather—I was told so by our solicitor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Messrs. Rock Brothers and Payne—on 11th or 12th January, the prisoner gave me a brown paper parcel—it contained leather—besides that, he gave me some white leathers, about the size of the largest patterns produced—he told me to cut up material for a gross of purses of the pattern he gave me—I did so—he told me to go to his desk, that I should find some white leather there, and to take a gross from them—there was more than a gross there—it was white, and about the size of the smaller pattern—I packed them up in a brown paper parcel and gave it to the prisoner—I have looked at the white leather in the flap of these purses—it is similar white leather to that I packed in the parcel—white leather is always very nearly alike; it resembles it in quality</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110007"/>
               <p>—about a week after this, the prisoner told me he had received these purses back from Miller, who had had them to make for him—I had previously heard from the prisoner that they were going to Miller to be made—he said Miller had charged him fifteen shillings for making them—on the day the prisoner was discharged from Messrs. Rock's service, Gerrard brought me a parcel—I afterwards went and saw the prisoner at his house, 15, Patriot-row, Cambridge-road, Bethnal-green—I told him that those parcels that he had requested I should send out I had not been able to send out, as I had heard that no parcels were to be sent out—he told me that I might have given them to the boys, but that did not matter, the parcels were to be sent to his house—Gerrard was present at this conversation—he told the prisoner that in the afternoon he was binding two books, and they took them away from him—he said, "There are several books there belonging to you, what shall I do with them?"—the prisoner asked where they were—he said he had packed them in a brown paper parcel, and put them in a certain pigeon-hole—the prisoner told him to leave them there, and if anything was said about them to refer to him—Gerrard then asked him, if anything was said to him in the morning, what he should say?—he said, "Why, tell them you have been doing two or three books a week for me"—I said I thought there had been more—he told me I was mistaken; the books I had seen there were books that had come there to have some slight defect rectified—I have occasionally seen more than two or three books a week there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you rightly, you delivered to him some leather? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were three or four different parcels, each containing a gross—I don't know where they came from—they had been given to me with directions to tie them up—I am speaking of the brown paper parcel and the loose one—where that leather came from, I don't know—I knew that he used to do work on his own account in the shop—I knew of the business that his wife was carrying on—there was no concealment whatever about it—he never told me to conceal it—it was perfectly well known; it was thoroughly well known in the establishment—I used to help him after hours in making purses of this description, lined in the same way, and made of the same character of leather—I have done that for three years, I should think—I was not binding books for him at the time he was discharged, or doing anything for him—I was never told by anybody to conceal the fact that I did these purses for him—I know his wife—she lived in Patriot-row, and carried on the business there—I know Mr. Carter; he is her brother—I never noticed the name over the door—the two parcels that he wanted me to get out, were two parcels of wallets—they are a kind of large purse, a kind of pocket-book with a metallic book—the parcels came from a shelf behind his desk—they belonged to the prisoner—I brought them in from my home—I had received them from the prisoner to work on—I received them from his own house, and brought them without any con-cealment to the shop—they were openly on the desk.</p>

Rock knew it; I speak about the hands employed—I did not mean to include the Messrs. Rock—I am not aware that any means were taken to prevent Messrs. Rock knowing it—I have not seen books bound for the</p>

I am in the service of my uncle, Mr. Miller, a purse-maker—about 16th or 17th January last, I received from Bartlett a parcel containing materials to make up a gross of purses—I assisted my uncle in making them up—these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are something like what I have done for him—I believe them to be the same—there are a great many others here with the inner flap taken out—when we sent them home they had the inner flap on—they have been taken off since—I don't know what would be the good of taking the flap off—it would make the purses unsaleable—I can say that these purses have had flaps on, and that they have been taken off—when fit for sale, some persons would send them out at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that would be about it—they are worth nothing now.</p>

I am one of the detective officers of the City—on 12th February, I apprehended the prisoner at 15, Patriot-row, Cambridge-road—Mr. William Rock, one of the firm, was with me—I told the prisoner that I was an officer, and should take him into custody for stealing a quantity of leathers, on or about 19th January, from the premises of Messrs. Rock, the materials for making a gross of purses, which were taken, by his orders, to a man of the name of Miller, in Ware-street, Kingsland-road—he said, "Very well "—I then commenced to search the house, accompanied by the prisoner and Mr. Rock, and in a back room on the first floor the prisoner took up this parcel, and said, "These are the purses Miller made," taking out one of the purses from the parcel—turning it to the back, he said, "This leather I took to your warehouse, where it was cut up"—that was dark leather—Mr. Rock said, "How about the white skins that were cut up at the same time?"—the prisoner said, "I gave no orders for any white skins to be cut up; I am not so black as I have been painted; I have done no more than others in your employ have done, and are still doing—I know everything that takes place at the warehouse, and people call and tell me almost every night, or every night"—I pointed out some other purses that I found in the room—he said, addressing Mr. Rock, "The whole of the materials in this room were being made by your orders"—I asked him who his firm consisted of—he said himself and Obadiah Carter.</p>

                  </hi>. In January last, I was in the service of Messrs. Rock, as a bookbinder—the prisoner was foreman of that department—I remember, in January, his bringing me this book, the training-school form—I don't know exactly the date—it was then unbound—he said to me, "Will you be kind enough to bind this book for me? Give it a little bit of vellum binding, to make it open freer than a general binding will "—I said, "Very well, I will give it half-and-half; that will enable it to open up freer"—he said, "Do it as quickly as possible, because it is wanted"—I took the book on from the sewers, and got it ready for the cutting—I rather think I cut this book myself, but that I cannot swear to—I covered it—I got the cover from a person, named Baker, in the employ of Messrs. Rock—before I did my part, the book had gone through the hands of Silverson—after it was cut it went to be redded at the edges by Silverson, and then I covered it—I got the boards from Drew—whether he cut these identical boards or not I cannot say; I rather fancy I cut them myself—I afterwards got from him the two Hebrew books—he brought them to me, and told me to bind them in a piece of purple sheep—I proceeded to bind them—there is only one party appointed to cut the boards—sometimes I might cut them myself, if he was not at his post—they were boards from Messrs. Rock's establishment—whilst I was binding one of these books, Mr. Rock came and found me doing it—the books were then ready to be covered—the prisoner was not present when Mr. Rock came to me—I have got one of the intended covers—I should think this was the leather intended to cover the Hebrew book—this was in my possession at one time—the cover for the other book was torn up by myself—I rather think the prisoner was discharged the same day—in consequence of some communication made to me, I afterwards went and saw the prisoner up Bond-court, Walbrook—I told him that I was covering one of the Hebrew books, and that Mr. Rock came and said to me, "What are you doing here? what is that cover for?"—I said, "For covering this book"—he said, "Where is the order for them?"—I said I had no order—he said, "How is that?"—I said, "I don't know; I rather think they are Mr. Hall's books"—the prisoner said to me, "Don't remove a thing; leave them there just as they are"—I said, "I have not covered the books; the two covers are spoiling. and I have torn one up"—he said, "Never mind about that, don't remove anything; if they wish to know anything about the things, refer them to me at once, and see that nothing is removed from the place "—I had pasted the covers when Mr. Rock interfered—I afterwards went to the prisoner's house with the witness Smith—I had previously given a parcel to Smith to take to the prisoner—he had refused to take it—I told him at the time, "It don't matter if you take it or not, it is the parcel you have been making"—I am referring to the wallets—what passed at the prisoner's while Smith was there was very similar to what I referred to just now in the court at Walbrook—I merely told the prisoner what had occurred, and asked what I should do—he said, "The best thing you can do is to put the books into a parcel, put them into the middle pigeon-hole, and if they wish to know anything about them, refer them to me "—I did not hear him tell Smith to say there had been two or three books a week done—I know the lift-hole in the warehouse—there is a lift-hole that goes right through the firm—a person standing at the lift-hole could see any person coming up the stairs—I have received directions from the prisoner with respect to that lift-hole, to place a lad over the hole to see when Mr. Rock was coming, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110010"/>
               <p>to let me or other parties know—it was usual if, for instance, one of my fellow-workmen spoiled something, to say to me, "I have just done this wrong; put a boy over the hole, or perhaps Mr. Rock will come up and <hi rend="italic">sack</hi> me," and the boy used to sing out "Shears"—I don't recollect whether a boy was put over the hole while I was engaged in binding this book—I know a boy was not put over the hole while I was doing this, or I should not have been caught—it was a common occurrence, if we were going to cook any little thing, or boil water to make tea—if Mr. Rock had caught us, perhaps he would have discharged us—all manner of boys were placed there—Ryan was one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am assistant to Mr. Carter, a tobacconist, of 13, Cannon-street—there is a post-office at the shop, and we sell stamps—the prisoner came in about seven o'clock on Monday evening, May 7th, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps—she gave me 2 florins—the underneath one was very suspicious looking—I tried it, and found it was bad—I broke it—she had then left the shop—I put the pieces at the back of the till by themselves—I afterwards gave them up to the constable—on Tuesday, 15th of May, I saw the prisoner again about a quarter to six—that is the business time in the day, the time the letters are going out—I recognised her at once—she was at the other end of the shop—she asked for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, worth of stamps—she tendered in payment 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and half-a-crown—I saw Treen take up the half-crown and break it in the detector—I said to the prisoner, "You gave me a bad 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece last week"—she said, "You must be mistaken "—I said, "I am not; I am quite certain you are the same party; I shall send for a policeman"—she said that she was a respectable woman, and received that half-crown from a gentleman—I sent for a policeman, and gave her in custody—Treen gave me the half-crown that he broke, and I gave it to the constable.</p>

               <p>after I pleaded guilty—I then made a statement which was taken down—he produced these receipts to me at the time—I have no connections at Luton—I have friends there—Mr. George Hunt is one, my late employer there—I do not remember making any statement to the constable Gaylor—I did not tell him that the hats came from George Hunt of Luton—I made a similar statement to one of the officers—I said the hats came from Luton—I won't swear I said they came from Mr. Hunt—I won't swear whether I did or did not—Mr. Hunt is a manufacturer of straw hats and bonnets—I lived with him for some time—I told the officer that I said to Buckthorpe these were job lots which I had bought myself in the Luton market—I do not know where these letters of mine have come from that have been shown me to-day—they were shown to me before to-day by Mr. Wontner, the attorney—he did not tell me where he got them from—I could form no opinion—I have sold goods to other persons besides the prisoner; to Mr. Crowe of Hammersmith, Vyse of Ludgate-hill, and, I believe, I sold a very small lot to Mr. Norcot of Hammersmith—I also sold a small lot to a draper at Newark whose name I do not recollect now—I do not recollect any other—I would not be positive—the transaction with Vyse was first—it might be twelve months ago, or a little more, before I sold the goods to Buckthorpe—those were not jobs lots from Luton—I told Vyse they were goods from Luton—they were the property of Smith and Lister—they were stolen—the other goods were also goods that I had stolen from my employers—I told them something to the same effect that they were goods from Luton—the goods I sold to Crowe and Vyse were sold at a very different price to those sold to Buckthorpe—they were sold cheap—cheaper than they could have been sold over the counter, but a mere trifle—I used to drive about in a gig or trap—I did not represent myself as an agent for a house at Luton—I will swear that—I do not recollect ever doing so—I used sometimes to deliver the goods in the trap—it was the property of a horsedealer, of the name of Morris, in the Old Kent-road—I did not keep it—I used to drive about in it occasionally—I sent the goods out of the warehouse by my boy—it is a boy who was in the same employ<lb/>ment—I employed him to take goods out of the warehouse—I do not wish to implicate the boy at all—I believe he did not know that I was taking them.</p>

On 15th March I went with Mr. Smith, one of the prosecutors, and the officer Hancock, to Buckthorpe's house—I received 201 hats and 36 bonnets from him—these are some of them—they are all different sorts—I took possession of a number of letters and invoices at the Mansion-house—they were brought there by Buckthorpe—I do not remember these letters—they were invoices that Buckthorpe brought to the Mansion-house—I did not take any letters from Buckthorpe's premises—he produced invoices of the goods at the Mansion-house—I do not remember anything of the letters.</p>

               <p>here—he showed some letters and invoices to Mr. Smith, and said that he had bought them as job lots—he produced the invoices, and as far as I observed he was quite open—I saw his wife—I do not know that she said anything relating to the millinery business—I went in with Hancock, the other officer, and told him we were officers, and were in search of goods missing from London; had he bought anything of that description?—he said, "No, I only buy of one person, that is a man named Norton, he is at Messrs. Smith and Lister's, of Cannon-street; I buy all my goods of him"—he then showed us what he had got, and Mr. Smith identified them, and we brought them away—the goods were in different parts; some were upstairs, and a good many were exposed in the window; the others were in square boxes—there was no concealment or hesitation—I did not see anything that would justify me in taking him into custody—he asked his wife to produce the invoices—she went up stairs and got them—he said that Norton had represented to him that he was the agent of a Luton house, and that they were job lots, some of which had been reblocked.</p>

On this Sunday morning, I was standing at the end of Sydney-street, Goswell-road, and saw both the prisoners—they were on the right-hand side, at the end of Sydney-grove, coming towards Goswell-road—I saw Probert cross over to the end of Sydney-place—Nye turned round into the Goswell-road, to the right—about a minute after, Probert came out from the end of Sydney-place, and called out," <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, are you going home?"—Probert ran across the road, in the direction the other prisoner had gone—immediately afterwards, I heard some person in the street call out, "Stop them"—Probert was followed by a</p>

I live at 2, Love-court, Ratcliffe-highway—on Saturday night, 4th June, I was in my house waiting up for my son—I fell asleep beside the fire-place—I awoke at 3 o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoner looking at me where I laid—I got frightened, and screamed for police, and asked who he was—he never answered me, but flew out of the door—I ran after him, and halloed out "Police"—the front door was shut when I went to sleep, but not bolted, and the inside door was latched—I did not miss anything at that time—I acquainted a policeman of it, and on my return, I picked up my husband's trousers and coat—I shortly afterwards went out again, and two policemen came down with the prisoner in custody—the policeman asked me, "Would I know the man"—I said, "Yes, that was he," and I looked again at him, and saw my husband's comforter round his neck, and my daughter said, "Mother, he has got my father's coat on him," and he had—I identified it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On Saturday night, I came ashore from my ship to buy some little articles to take aboard; I bought them and put them in my coat pocket; I got intoxicated, and lay in some court drunk till early in the morning, and when I woke, I found my coat and articles gone; I went into the first house that was open; I did not know where I was. My ship is in Shad well-basin now, and the officers could give me a character; I was never in London before; I did not know where I was.</p>

I think my husband's coat had been placed on a box by the side of the bed—the bed was in the room I was sitting in, on the first floor—the trousers and comforter were on the bed-rail—the out-side door was closed, and the inside door was latched—there was no open door for anybody to come in at, not without lifting the latch—that could be done from the outside.

I live at Woodland Cottages, Shakespeare-road, Hornsey—I saw the prisoner between 7 and 8 on Monday evening, 26th March—I went to remove some goods for her mother, and saw her sitting on a mattrass in the room, suckling the child—she was not dressed for going out—I asked her what things there were going—she told me and said, "Now mother is going I shall not stop long"—I asked her what she was going to do—she said that she was going to put the child out to nurse and go to service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the establishment of Messrs. Bevington—I have been there 91/2; years—Mrs. Milson had been there about the same time—after the premises were closed in the evening, I and Mrs. Milson were the only persons usually left on the premises—we both slept on the premises in the upper part of the house—the ground floor was used entirely for warehouses and counting-houses, also the first floor and part of the second—it is a very large building, sufficient to prevent me hearing what is going on below—on the 11th of April, after the place was closed, I heard a ring at the bell—Mrs. Milson was in the dining-room at the time, and I was in the bed-room—when the bell rang she passed out of the dining room and went downstairs—the bed-room is close by, on the same floor—the door was open—I did not see her, but she spoke to me; she said it was for her and she would go down—that was as near ten minutes past 9 as I can recollect—I believe I went out of my room myself a minute or two after she went down, and when I got into the dining-room it was ten minutes past 9—when she went down she seemed to be in perfect health; she had a bad leg—I never saw her alive again—at a quarter-past ten I thought I would go down and see if she was ready to go to bed—I took the candle, and when I got down to the bottom of the stairs I found her lying dead—my first impression was that she was in a fit—I took bold of her hand and called her; finding I could get no answer I went to the door—I saw a woman at</p>

               <p>the door, as I supposed, standing there for shelter—she did not come in—I waited for a few minutes until I saw a police-constable—he came in, and saw Mrs. Milson lying, and then he asked me to wait while he went to the station and got assistance—when I went back with the constable I saw that she was really dead—after the house was closed in the evening persons very frequently came—very frequently there would be two or three rings of an evening—Mrs. Milson generally went down—when she did go down to answer the bell she frequently stopped down all the evening—she borrowed money from me on two occasions, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time—that was, as near as I can recollect, about two or three months from the time of the murder; the first time was on the Friday and the other on the Saturday—after I had lent her the sovereign on the Saturday I looked out of window and saw a man get in a cab at the corner of Budge-row by the lamp; I could not tell the time; I think it was between eight and nine; I am not certain—the bell had rung, and her sister had come in before I lent her that sovereign, but I do not recollect whether it rang afterwards or not—I think the man that got in the cab came out of the house—I did not see him directly he came out of the door, because there is a reflector over the door; but he went close from the door at any rate, and Mrs. Milson was looking out at the door after him—she had gone down not many minutes before he went out—I should think she had borrowed the sovereigns of me not more than five or ten minutes before she went down—she had been down before that, and she came straight upstairs to me and asked me for the sovereigns, and went down again directly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far in the doorway was the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A good distance; close to the stairs, some yards within the doorway—the feet were towards the stairs; she was lying in rather a slanting direction, against some bales—I don't think that the policeman ascertained that she was dead before he went for assistance; he did not touch her, he merely came and looked at her—I don't know that he saw that she was injured; it was obvious that she was injured—there was a great deal of blood—he went for assistance, leaving me alone with her—I had known the deceased 91/2; years; we both went to Cannon-street together—we were always on perfectly friendly terms—she was a widow; her husband died while we were there, 6 years ago; I know that—I knew very few of her friends or associates, two or three—her late husband's sister, the two Misses Cox, and the Misses Strugnell, were the principal—they used to come sometimes of an evening and sometimes in the day; they always came upstairs when they came—she used frequently to go downstairs after business hours, and sometimes remain down the whole evening, very often it would be from eight to nine before I would see her, or from that till ten; then she would turn the gas out and come up—she would sometimes be away as much as two hours—an hour and a half was very usual—since her leg had been bad she stopped downstairs more on account of its being a trouble to her to get up and down stairs—she would say, "I am going down; I have got some letters to write, and I shall go in the counting house"—she had frequently sat down a good deal since her leg had been bad, that was quite two months—she had always been in the habit of answering the bell and receiving visitors—I never learnt from her who they were—she never used to tell me who they were unless I saw them—I never saw them, she always went herself, and when she was out nobody came—I rather gathered from that that the persons came by appoint<lb/>ment</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110045"/>
               <p>—she had always been in the habit of having visitors ever since she had been there, visitors whom I did not see—while her husband was alive, people came then that she did not have upstairs—she was of a very cheerful disposition—she used to receive a good many letters and write a good many—I never saw the addresses of the letters that she wrote—she never asked me to post them, she used to give them out to be posted, sometimes to some of the boys when they were going to the post, sometimes to the tradespeople when they came—I think it was between two and three months before her death that she borrowed the sovereigns of me on the Friday and Saturday—I saw a man on the Friday go into the dining-room, just the back of him, and on the Saturday I saw the man get into a cab—I could not tell exactly what time it was on the Friday; it was in the afternoon during business hours—on Saturday it was after business hours, I think between eight and nine, after the business was closed—that was the time I saw him get into the cab—I was up on the second storey—it was quite dark at that time—the cab was waiting for him—I can't tell whether it was a Hansom or a close cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether you ever heard from Mrs. Milson who the persons were that called? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said the man that called for this money was named Denton, and gave his address in the Old-change, and called himself a solicitor—she told me that, when she borrowed the money of me—I saw the cab leave—I waited till it drove off—it went towards London-bridge—when I first came down on this night the gas was all out but one burner, and that was over where the body lay—the burner over the door was turned off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Great Trinity-lane, Cannon-street—on the night of 11th April, about half-past 10, I was called to Messrs. Bevingtons' premises, and there saw the body of Mrs. Milson lying—I found many very extensive wounds over the head and face—there was one causing an extensive fracture of the skull; two others on the left side of the head—death was caused by effusion of blood on the opposite side of the head—one of the wounds had ruptured a large vessel, and that was the immediate cause of death—there was much blood—the light was very bad—the light of the gas was shaded from the body as it lay by some cases of goods, but there was a large quantity of blood on the ground, which in<lb/>creased in quantity while I was there—it flowed while I was there—it had considerably increased when I left—the body was still warm when I got there—there was a small quantity of blood on the legs of the packing stool, which was opposite—there was no track of blood—it appeared to be one pool undisturbed, flowing from her head as she lay—some such instrument as this might have caused the wounds—I don't undertake to swear that it did—the wounds were of two classes—one class, which would be produced by a blunt, heavy instrument, and the other class, by a sharper instrument; such as one end of a weapon like this might produce—they were deep wounds; one of them in particular, extending from the outer orbit of the eye to the nose bone; a deep, penetrating wound—another went down deep into the flesh, and cut through a small bone—in my opinion it is possible for the sharp part of the instrument to have made one class of wounds, and this blunt part the other—there was no blood on the instrument that I could see—I looked—I should certainly have expected to find blood upon it, if it had been used—I certainly think there must have been blood on it as a consequence of wounds inflicted with that weapon; unless, of course, it had been very carefully cleaned afterwards—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb/>amination.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I take it for granted that several of the arteries were separated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; many vessels were divided—the effect of the division of an artery is necessarily a spirting of blood—the blood from an artery would spirt out in jets—that is so invariably—it cannot be otherwise if a person is alive—the blood continued to flow during the time I was there—the blood continued to ooze—after the action of the heart had ceased from death, the jetting from the arteries would cease—I should say she had been dead an exceedingly short time—I should think not as much as an hour—I think I might with safety say under half an hour—I did not see any jets of blood; that might be accounted for by this theory, it may be that one serious wound was inflicted, that the blood from that did not fly to any very great distance; that then she fell, and after that the other wounds were inflicted; and the blood from those would not go to any great extent; that is my idea—I could not say, with any great certainty, which was the wound that felled her, supposing that was the case, but there was one wound which appeared to be the most formidable wound, inflicting the most damage on the soft parts, although I would speak with very great caution on the subject; if I was compelled to gay that one wound did it, I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110047"/>

               <p>show me, or tell me, where he was that night from 7 to 10 o'clock—he con<lb/>sidered, and said he was with a Mr. Harris—when I made the charge, he said, "It is a very serious charge indeed—I am as innocent as a baby—I have not been in London since the 1st of February, when I called on a Mr. Fuggle, at 10, Aldermanbury, about some money that was due to us: 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that my brother lent Mr. Fuggle"—he said, "I first went with that letter," alluding to the letter signed Terry and Denton—"the latter part of last year, I called, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—she," (meaning Mrs. Milson) "was washing up, I believe—it was either Thursday or Friday, the first time I went; she told me to come on the Saturday—I said to him, "Did you write this receipt?" showing him the receipt signed W. Denton—he said, "Yes; it is no good denying that, for it can be proved to be my handwriting"—I said, "Why did you sign as W. Denton?"—he said, "I have sometimes used that name"—I said, "How many times have you called on Mrs. Milson?"—he said, "Three times—she has paid me two sovereigns, and I wrote her a receipt each time; I knew that was all wrong about the money, and I know Terry was not entitled to it, and that was the reason I did not sign my right name"—I asked him if he could tell where he was—he accounted for being with young Harris up to half-past 7 o'clock that night; that he then went out and met a young man, and they were going to a meeting, this young man went to the meeting, and he went for a walk—I believe he mentioned who the young man was, but I do not remember the name—I conveyed him to London, and charged him—the charge was read over to him, and he said he was innocent—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>:—"Mrs. Milson, the bearer of this I have sent to you as my adviser—I have taken this course as I have received so much annoyance from Mrs. Webber that I can put up with it no longer—he will propose terms to you, which you may accept or not at your pleasure—failing to your agreeing to this proposal, he is instructed by me to see Mr. Bevington, or Mr. Harris, and explain to them how the matter stands—you know yourself what reasons you put forth for borrowing the money—doctors' bills, and physicians for your husband, which you know was not so—I shall also have him bring your sister before Mr. Bevington if necessity or your obstinacy compels my adviser to go the extreme, "signed George Terry.—(<hi rend="italic">Receipt read</hi>:—"Received of Mrs. Milson 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>was wearing a light pair of trousers at the time—I did not when I found the coat say, "Oh, here it is, all right; here is plenty of blood "—I never made mention of anything of the kind; in fact, I did not know there was blood at that time—the clothes were examined when we got to the office—I did not make any observation about blood in any way—I swear that—he did not in answer to my observations say, "It is coggle"—not to me—I believe he did mention it to some person—he did not show me a bottle—no bottle was shown to me—some few days afterwards there was—it turns out not to be blood but coggle—I was first in communication about this murder on the 12th of April, the very day following—I first saw Mrs. Robins before the coroner, when she was examined as a witness—I had not had any com<lb/>munication with her before in any way—I saw a photograph on the wall at the prisoner's mothers', and asked whether that was his photograph—he said "No, it is not; here is one of mine," producing it—I took possession of it, and have had it ever since, and have got it now—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not mention it in my evidence—he did not give it to me—it was taken down—I looked round the room and saw this and one of his brother—I believe I asked whether his brother's was his portrait, and he said "No," and pointed to this—I do not know when I first got into communication with Mrs. Robins—I saw her at the inquest, and I believe that was the first time I saw her—I did not show her the photograph—she has never seen it to my knowledge—I am sure she has not since I have had it, no more has any one else—I believe I showed it to my commissioner, and that was all—it is not a good resemblance—it is rather a flattering likeness—I was not the author of the plan of marching a manacled policeman in front of the house—I have heard that it was so—I did not see it—I did not tell Mrs. Robins that she might expect to see the prisoner pass the house—I am quite sure about that, nor did I tell anybody—I had nothing to do with it in any way—I took good care not to be present, so that it should not be said that I was with him—I took care that strangers were with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the city-police at Bow-lane station—on the day after the death of Mrs. Milson, Mrs. Robins came to the station and gave me some information respecting a man leaving the premises on the night of the murder—some days after that the prisoner was brought to the station—it was necessary to take him from Bow-lane to the Mansion-house—he was taken along St. Thomas Apostle to Queen-street, along Cannon-street and Walbrook to the Mansion-house—that is the way all prisoners are taken from Bow-lane-station—he walked with two other officers near him, but he was not handcuffed—there was nothing to indicate that he was a prisoner—there was no policeman manacled—the policeman was taken away in a cab previous to that—that was done in consequence of there being an immense crowd at the station, we could not get in or out, and we put a policeman in a cab, and the mob went away thinking he was the prisoner, and the prisoner walked as other people through the street—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110051"/>
               <p>there was no indication that he was a prisoner—he was not touched, or handled, or handcuffed—I had made a communication previously to that to Mrs. Robins—I told her to be at the door, and watch all persons that went through the street for the next quarter of an hour, and see if she saw any person like the man she had described to me—I did not go and walk by the prisoner's side—I was on some distance in front—after I had passed, Mrs. Robins, I believe, went in, and did not see the prisoner go by—as far as I could see nothing was done, or intended to be done, to point out the man in any way—everything was done to prevent his being pointed out by any person—no one knew who he was—in fact he walked to the Mansion-house without the notice of any one—I afterwards saw Mrs. Robins; in conse<lb/>quence of what she then told me, I asked her to come up to the Mansion-house—before she was allowed to see the prisoner, a number of persons, several of them strangers that I never saw before, were brought in and placed with the prisoner—they were in one room, Mrs. Robins was in a centre room, and they passed through that room into another, walked by and back again—I was standing a short distance from Mrs. Robins, and after they had passed the second time she said, "The third man was the man I saw"—that was the prisoner—nothing was done to indicate to her who the man was—not a word was spoken to her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was it that told Mrs. Robins to be at the door to look? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I told her to be at the door, and to notice all persons who went through the street, and tell me if she saw the man that came out of the house on the night of the murder—that was all I told her, I am quite sure—I don't remember telling her anything else—I think I can safely swear I did not—I did not mention Mr. Bevington's name to her—I had no occasion—I am quite sure I did not mention it—I was on in front—I had not my uniform on—I was in plain clothes—she knew me; that was why I went away from the prisoner a long distance—the officers in charge, Obey and Green, were not in uniform—there were one or two other officers at a distance behind; they were not part of our party—they were going to the Mansion-house—they started from the station immediately after us—the prisoner was in charge of two officers only—he did not walk between the two; he walked by the side of one—the other was a little way behind—I was a good distance in front, some fifty yards—I saw Mrs. Robins and her servant at the door, when I passed—I can't say whether they saw me—I took no notice of them.</p>

Bevington's—I believe he is the man I have seen come out of Messrs. Bevington's—I think it was after nine o'clock, as near as I can recollect, I saw him come out of Messrs. Bevington's door once—I was at Mr. Mackintosh's door when I saw him leave the house—on Wednesday, 11th April, my mistress was out—she came in at ten minutes past ten o'clock—I let her in, and she said something to me when she came in—next day I went out and heard about the murder—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man that I saw come from Messrs. Bevington's—I am not speaking of the night of the murder—I recollect seeing Inspector Foulger—the next time I saw the prisoner was the day he was taken to the Mansion-house—he was not pointed out to me—I knew his face—I knew him again, when I saw him before he got to Messrs. Bevington's door—I did not pick him out at all—I thought, but I did not say anything at the time—nobody pointed him out to me.</p>

Bevington—I live on the premises with my servant, Catherine Collins—I have resided there turned eleven years—on Wednesday, 11th April, I went out about ten minutes to eight, and returned again about ten minutes past ten—I rang the bell—just as I rang it, I was very much frightened by the violent slamming of Messrs. Bevington's door, and I saw a man leave Messrs. Bevington's steps—he passed me on the right, and gave me a side look as he was opposite my door, and his left eye and my right eye met at the same moment—No. 1 is on the left hand side of Cannon-street, at the corner of Budge-row—it used to be Cannon-street West, but it is altered now to Cannon-street—No. 2 is nearer St. Paul's than No. 1—a person leaving No. 2 and passing No. 1 would be going towards London-bridge—he might also go round Budge-row towards St. paul's—the nearer way to St. Paul's would be turning the other way instead of passing me—at the time he passed me I stood near the door, and he stood just where the reflection of our hall lamp shone on his face—he was some little distance from me—I could not have touched him—he gave me a side look when he passed me, and that made me notice him—I could not say exactly how long I noticed him—it might have been two minutes, it may have been more, I could not say—he walked in a very hurried manner, and he leant forward as he walked—I saw him go to the end of the pavement towards London-bridge, and then my door opeued and I went in—I noticed that his legs were very thin, and his feet broad, and he walked flat<lb/>footed—I believe the prisoner to be the man—I next saw him at the Mansion-house—there were fourteen people altogether passed me—they came by me, and directly they came through the door I knew the prisoner, but did not say a word until he passed back again, and then I said, "I believe that is the man I saw leave Messrs.

Bevington's—I was frightened at the door banging, certainly—it was a regular loud slam—I looked round and saw what it was—I was not in so much fright then—I was in a little alarm when the door slammed—the confusion when the cab passed was a great deal more than when the door slammed—of course I was frightened, I was startled, I was not actually frightened—I took particular notice of the man's legs, and why I did so was because the reflection of the lamp caused me to notice it—that was in front—I mean the street lamp, not our lamp—his trousers were dark, I could not see whether they were black or not—I could not swear his trousers were dark—I believe his clothes were all dark, they looked so—I could not see nothing about the trousers—I say I believe the clothes he wore were dark—his trousers appeared to me dark—I do not feel any doubt about it—the whole of the clothes seemed dark—that is all I can say—it had been raining during the day, but it was not raining then,—it was wet under foot.</p>

               <p>time it was supposed the prisoner left and returned, and that it was of vast importance to ascertain the distances—I did it with a wheel-measure—the distance from Slough Station to 15-arch bridge is 1 mile, 3 furlongs, 123 yards—I don't know how far the Seven Chimneys are from 15-arch bridge—I can't say that I ever heard the name Seven Chimneys before—Mr. Whitehouse did not mention the Seven Chimneys, nor could he clearly point out where he did meet the prisoner; he said he met him between Eton and the 15-arch bridge—these were all the measurements I took—I do not know the Adam and Eve.</p>

               <p>masters of Eton College, as butler—I know the prisoner—I am well aware of the night of the private theatricals—they took place on a Wednesday—there were two days, one was on a Wednesday, and the other on a Friday—I went on the Wednesday—they were held at the Mathematical School—I was going home after my work—I don't sleep in the house—I go home—I have a shop also at Eton—I met the prisoner that evening within a few doors of my own house, as near 8 o'clock as I can judge—I knew him well—he had been in the habit of coming to the house once or twice a week with errands—his mother is laundress to a great portion of Eton, and for the house that I am at—she has part of the work, a certain part of the work, not the whole—he has been in the habit of bringing the things home, fetching them on a Monday, and bringing them home on a Friday—I am perfectly certain I saw him that night, and at the time I mentioned as near as possible—I will not swear to five minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was it you met him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the High-street, within a few doors of my house—my house is in the High-street—he was alone—I did not say I went to the private theatricals that night—I said that was the night: I did not go—I did not leave my house after I once entered that night—I did not go that night—I was walking home from my situation—I leave at all times—there is no particular time—I know what time it was on this night, because at ten minutes past 7 a fellow-servant came into the pantry—I was then at work—she said, "Are you at work till this time of night"—I said, "Yes, I am endeavouring to finish this job if I can to-night"—she said she was going, she looked at the clock and saw it was ten minutes past 7, and it would have taken me from half to three quarters of an hour to close the house, change my clothes, and go up to where I saw the prisoner—I am certain I could not have got away from the house in less than half an hour, even if I had left work at the time—the place I speak of is about three quarters of a mile from the Windsor and Eton Bridge—it is not towards the barracks—it is towards Slough, the house I am in—it is the last house in Eton—Smith was coming towards his own residence—he was on my right hand when I saw him, and he crossed towards his own home on my left—it would be considerably above a mile from the turnpike—it is not because there was a theatrical performance that night that I fix that night—the reason why I can fix it more particularly is that I had promised to take my children for a long walk, Wednesday being a half-holiday, and they were to meet me after their dinner in the college—the rain came on and prevented their coming, but later in the afternoon they sent to know if I would take them if it gave over raining, and I said "No," as I should continue my work that day, and the first dry day they should come out of school earlier, which they did on the following Thursday—I first mentioned this some weeks ago, in fact, immediately after the prisoner's apprehension—I believe I called it to mind the same day—I went straight home after seeing him—I did not come out again—I am not the person who has been spoken of as being at Goddard's—I believe I first mentioned this to some workpeople in the house who told me of the apprehension—I did not go to the police or mention it to them—I had no evidence to give, I considered—I read the case in the paper afterwards, but I saw that there was no defence taken—I feel confident that I am not mistaken in the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is the turnpike from the Slough station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Half or three-quarters of a mile—the place were I met the prisoner must be more than a mile and three quarters from the Slough station—I should say it would be about two miles—the place where Mr. Whitehouse met the</p>

               <p>prisoner is nearer where I live—half-an-hour would be enough for a person to go from that place to the turnpike, and come back to where I saw the prisoner—they might walk it leisurely in that time—I should think it would be under four miles an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe manufacturer, of 48, Craven-street, Finsbury—in 1865 I had an account at the London and County Bank, Islington-branch—I usually kept my cheque-book in my desk, and sometimes in the safe—in May, 1866, I drew a cheque in favour Messrs. Somerville for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that cheque I received back from the bank, and filed it—it is now missing—the prisoner was in my service—he had only been with me a few months—he was with me before Christmas last, and left about 9th January this year—he was a clicker—two men named Wheeler and Wilson were also in my service—about 13th January I had occasion to look at my cheque-book, and I found two cheques missing—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I first saw on 13th January—it is signed in my name, but not by me, and I never authorized anyone to sign it—I have seen the prisoner write, and am acquainted with his writing—I believe this cheque is in his writing—the whole of it—"Somerville &amp; Co." and "sKauffman Greenbaum," is an imitation of my writing, but the date is different—after the 13th</p>

I took this letter to 5, Connaught-terrace on the evening of 14 th—it is a coffee-shop—I saw the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note put into it first—in company with another officer, named Bone, I kept watch on the house, in plain clothes, that evening, so that I could see what was going on without being seen—about 11 o'clock I saw the prisoner drive up to the door of the coffee-shop—there was nobody in his cab—he got off the box, and went to the door, and knocked, and I heard him say, "Is there a letter for A. A.?"—Mrs. Greigson said, "Yes, there is one," and went into the shop—the prisoner went a few paces into the passage—Mrs. Greigeson then returned with the letter, and gave it to him as he was coming down the steps leading into the street—he broke the envelope—I then said to him, "Whose letter is that?"—he said, "It is mine"—I said, "I shall take you into custody"—the letter was quite open, and his hands were on the con<lb/>tents of it—his hand was on the note when I spoke to him—he then said, "It is not my letter; it is for a gentleman in my cab"—I walked with him to his cab, and there was no one there—it was quite impossible for any one to have jumped out of the cab after he drove up, without my seeing it—I</p>

I asked the servant in the bar, and she said there was no letter there; the gentleman then told me to drive to 5, Connaught-terrace. I drove there; he was then inside the cab, and he said, 'I am not going to get out; I want you to knock at that door, and ask if there is a letter for A. A.' I got off my cab, and knocked. The door was opened by that female, and I said, 'I have got a gentleman in my cab, and he sent me to ask you if you have got a letter for A. A.' She said, 'Yes,' and went into the back room. I went back to the cab, and then went to the door, into the shop. I was in complete dark<lb/>ness where I stood; Mrs. Greigson was at the far end of the shop; she came to me and put the letter into my hand. I walked out of the shop; a man followed me out and said, 'What have you got there?' I said, 'I have got a letter.' He took it out of my hand. I said, 'I have got a gentleman in my cab, and I said, 'Look, the cab-door is open, the gentleman is gone.'</p>

               <p>to Mrs. Houghton on the Wednesday evening, telling her it was my intention to leave my father's house—I received a letter from Mr. Olifier on the evening I left, when I was at Mrs. Houghton's house—I had mentioned to Mr. Olifier my intention to leave about three weeks before—that letter is not in existence—I did not read it—Mrs. Houghton read it to me—I do not remember that he said in that letter that if I left my parents' home he would have nothing to do with me, and give up all idea of marrying me—I will not swear that that was not in the letter—on Good Friday my dinner-time was about one o'clock—I had not then made up my mind to leave my father's house—I left about five—I made up my mind to go about an hour before that—I did not communicate that intention to any human being before I went away—Mrs. Houghton lodged at Mrs. Mills's house—when I went there on that Good Friday, Mrs. Houghton was not at home—I knew from Mrs. Houghton herself that she would not be at home that day, that she was going to the Crystal Palace—I saw Mrs. Mills, and told her I would wait till Mrs. Houghton came in—I waited till half-past ten—Mrs. Mills did not tell me that it was very late and very improper for a girl like me to be out, and advise me to go to my father's house—she sent the little girl up to say that she did not expect Mrs. Houghton home till late, and still I did not go home—I waited till Mrs. Houghton came—when she came, she and Mrs. Mills together requested and begged, and implored me to go home to my father's house that night—Mrs. Mills said that she would not go to bed till I went home—I did not go home; I went to the Queen's Hotel—they begged me to go home, and I said once that nothing should induce me to go back—they did not repeat their entreaties for half an hour—Mrs. Mills did not seem distressed at my refusal, nor did she cry—she sent Mrs. Houghton to go with me—I have sworn "They both endeavoured to persuade me to return home"—that is true, but they did not repeat that more than once—I only remember them saying it once—this is true, "They repeatedly entreated me to do so; the conversation lasted about half an hour"—it is true that they seemed distressed at my refusal—she was crying, and Mrs. Mills said, she would not allow me to remain in the house—it is true that I said I could go elsewhere, and that I persisted in refusing to go home—I went to the Queen's Hotel, and asked Mrs. Houghton to go with me—she went at my express request and desire—I did not and would not return home on Saturday morning—Mrs. Houghton went away from the hotel and got her little boy to stay with me—it was on that Saturday morning, at the Queen's Hotel, that I wrote to the prisoner to tell him that I had left my father's house, and to ask him to come to me—that was the first communication I made to him that I had left, or was intending to leave—I wrote that letter about ten o'clock—I did not give it to Mrs. Houghton to take to the prisoner—she went from the hotel at my desire, and came back to tell me she had seen the prisoner—she said he would not come there—she did not tell me that he told her to say that he disapproved entirely of what I had done in leaving my father's house—she did not implore me to go home then, not on Saturday, after coming from Mr. Olifiers—I sent the letter about ten—Mrs. Houghton returned about twelve—it is not true that she again implored me to return home at half-past twelve—I said so before the Magistrate, but that was a mistake—I sent a second letter to Mr. Olifier begging him to come—although I despatched the first early in the morning, and another in the course of the day, he did not come till four o'clock—I saw him go past at two o'clock, but did not speak to him—Mrs. Houghton did not tell me before five o'clock that she had met Mr. Olifiers in</p>

I am a carter, and live at White Hart-yard, Totten<lb/>ham—on Monday, 7th of May, I was driving a van with two horses along Wire Hall-lane, Edmonton, and there were two other carts following mine—Mr. Withey's was not one of these—his was a van—I saw him when he passed me—he overtook me—he was driving a horse and van—when he had got as far as my first horse he pulled up, because there was not room for him to pass—the obstruction was caused by a vehicle coming in an opposite direction—it was Mr. Millard's cart—the prisoner was driving it; at least, he was not driving it, because he was asleep—it was a heavy cart, with two horses—he had no reins—he was not on the driving-box—he was sitting in the bottom of the cart—I could see him in the cart—he was sitting on the off-side of the cart, lolling his head at the other side of the cart—I should say he was asleep—he did not look up or take any notice of the deceased's cart meeting him—the deceased hit at him with a whip—I cannot say whether he struck him or not, as I had got my own horses to attend to—it did not rouse him up, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> I could see—it did not hit the horses—I heard it hit the cart—the prisoner's cart did not pass on without touching the other cart—it hit the off fore wheel of the deceased's van—the deceased pulled up his van, and was waiting for the other to make way—he was thrown off—the stroke I suppose knocked him off—I saw the off wheel of the cart strike the off wheel of the van, and I then saw the deceased fall—he fell off the seat in front into the road—from where my wheel stood to the other side of the road is twenty-one feet—I was close on one side—there was plenty of room on the other side of the prisoner's van, and there was such room, that if he had pulled on one side there would have been no accident at all—I did not see the prisoner wake up—after he had passed the carts, he came back again—he should have gone on the hedge side—it is a country lane—the prisoner came back to where the deceased had fallen—the horses pulled the cart right through, till it got past all three and then stopped, and the prisoner came up to where the deceased was—Mr. Withey could not get up—he said something while the prisoner was standing over him—I do not remember what he said to him—he made a complaint of his being hurt—me and my mate put him in the front part of his own van—we met his son on the way home, and gave him up to him—I do not know his son by name, but that is the man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Richard Withey</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon residing at Southgate, near Edmonton—on 7th May, I was sent for to attend a person of the name of Withey—he was lying on a sofa, in the sitting-room—he was quite helpless—I found his left leg quite helpless, and with his sons I assisted in getting him up to bed—on examining him, I found he had fractured the left thigh—he was suffering very great pain—I did not discover any other injuries at that time—from the symptoms that set in, I had reason to believe that there were other injuries—inflammation of the bowels—in the evening sickness supervened, which continued more or less till his death—I think the inflammation of the bowels was consequent upon the injuries to the thigh, consequent upon the shock to the nervous system and the acci<lb/>dent—he died on the 6th of June—he rallied a little from time to time, but not materially—the cause of death was inflammation of the bowels, caused by the injuries—he was seventy-four years of age—he appeared, with the exception of these injuries to be in as good a state of health as a man of that age would be—I had known him more or less for more than twenty years—I had attended members of his family.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you are certain the inflammation did not proceed from any other cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no evidence of it at all—I made an examination of it afterwards—it is very unusual for inflammation of the bowels to follow from an injury to the thigh—it might be difficult for a medical man to say what was the immediate cause of inflammation of the bowels, but the symptoms in this case proceeding in a reguler train, and there being no subsequent signs of it, I come to the conclusion that it was from the injury received—there was a gradual inflammation coming on in the bowels from the time I first saw him.</p>

I am a surgeon, at 243, Hackney-road, and a bachelor of medicine of the London University—I was called on the night of 18th, to 99, Nichol-square, and found four children in an empty room—Walter was in a very weak state—I saw two children lying by the fire-place on the right-hand side, Walter and Clara—Walter had on what you could scarcely term a covering, an apology for a sheet, and Clara was per<lb/>fectly naked, nothing at all on—there was a thin piece of blanket covering both—under the window on the left, there was another child, Alfred—he had very little covering indeed: a little piece of flannel over him—Walter was breathing laboriously, and he was <hi rend="italic">semi comatose</hi>—you could scarcely understand what he said—he seemed to be dying—I directed them to be taken to the workhouse—I was afterwards present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb/>amination—I think on the following Saturday—there was no disease of any organ of the body—the cause of death was from effusion of serum into the three great cavities of the body, the head, chest, and abdomen—debility, and great weakness especially, would produce such an effusion of serum—absence of food would produce that—there was a little fluid in the stomach—that would be accounted for by a small quantity of beef-tea and wine—I examined the bowels carefully—there was scarcely anything in them—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110132"/>
               <p>cause of death was from debility, and from the absence of all disease in the body, I could only form the opinion that that arose from want of food—that is my opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I would rather read from what you swore at the police-court; is this true; "I ground my opinion that the child died from privation, from the state of the room, and the state I found the children in, and from what I have heard in conversation?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say that, but it is a very foolish statement—I was a little nervous at the time—I did not form my opinion from what I saw—I have not spoken to the attorney about this—I was not told by anybody that my evidence was not strong enough to convict him—that answer was given at the police-court without sufficient thought—I could not have formed my opinion from what I have heard—I have been examined before in a Court of justice—I was once in this Court, in a case of stabbing—I think I was the only doctor examined—I have been in dirtier houses than this one, but this one was quite empty, no furniture—the children did not complain to me of wanting food—I did not ask them—effusion occurs occasionally in children who are constitutionally weak, but not to the extent I found in this case—if I had found this very child in a gentleman's house, in bed, and clean, and had afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, I certainly should have said that the death was caused by starvation, if I found the same symptoms which I found in this child after death—I might perhaps be more careful in giving my opinion—effusion is the flowing of the serum into the cavities—it may occur and yet not cause death, but not to this extent—it may occur from constitutional debility, but not to the extent I found it here—the state in which I found the child could not have been caused by constitutional weakness—it could not have been caused by anything but privation—either of them will cause effusion of serum—I do not think I was pressed before the Magistrate about the food in the stomach—I did not go fully into the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination then—Dr. Clark gave his evidence first, and I was asked whether I agreed with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TAYLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever hear, or know at all, of a case of a child dying in this way, except from want of food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you say, in common parlance, that the child died of starvation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that would be the form of disease which an insuf<lb/>ficient quantity of food would cause—if a child was fed with meat and pudding on the Sunday, I should not expect its death on the following Wednesday in this way at all—suppose it had milk on the very day that I saw it, that would not alter the case materially—no doubt the effusion was in existence then—it might have been so on the Sunday—it could not have gone on for three or four mouths; three or four weeks we will say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the medical officer of the St. Leonard's, Shoreditch workhouse—four children were brought in there very early on the morning of 19th April—I went there directly, and saw Walter—his body was generally puffy and dropsical—he was breathing with great difficulty—he was insensible, or almost so, except when roused, and he would give an in<lb/>coherent answer—he died within thirty hours after his admission into the workhouse; early on the morning of the 20th—the last witness and myself made a post-mortem examination—there was no disease of any organ what<lb/>ever—I attribute this puffyness which I observed to dropsical effusion—effusion of serum into the various cavities of the body—debility was pro<lb/>duced by effusion, and there being no disease, I believe the debility arose from privation—there was a small quantity of fluid contents in the lower</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110133"/>
               <p>bowels—after his admission, I directed that a little beef-tea and wine should be given—that would account for the quantity of fluid that was found—the muscles were generally in a pale condition, and somewhat emaciated—the other children were getting better when I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not say a word before the Magistrate about the state of the stomach, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if I am not questioned, I do not give an answer—this is the first time I have been asked the question—I told counsel about it this morning—the question was put to me before the Magistrate, "Was it a likely case to arise from privation?"and my answer was, "Yes"—I still say I believe it was from no other cause—this effusion never arises from constitutional weakness under such circumstances, there being no disease to be traced in this child's body—if a child was of a weak or scrofulous habit, then it would be shown in the stomach—you might have mesenteric disease, disease of the heart, or disease of the lungs—where the effusion is from constitutional disease, or from scrofulous habit of body, you would also find signs of it in the body—there is always some disease to account for it—there must be a cause for every effect—as a law there is no such thing as con<lb/>stitutional weakness without some actual disease—there are some exceptions—if I found this effusion of serum in a child, knowing nothing of it, I should not immediately presume it was from starvation, but there being no assignable cause for death, I should then unquestionably attribute it to that cause which I have mentioned—the circumstances the child had been in, would not have any effect whatever—there are no causes that would produce de<lb/>bility that are not discoverable on the post-mortem examination—it is possible and barely possible, but not in my experience.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would mesenteric disease in all forms be traceable in the post-mortem examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would; we should see it in the glands and in the bowels—mesenteric disease is where the mesenteric glands do not take up the nutriment—there was no trace of mesenteric disease here—there is not always inflammation of the stomach with mesenteric disease.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bethlehem Hospital—I was surgeon to Guy's Hospital in April—on 11th April, about eight A. M. I received the prisoner—he had his throat cut—I had him under my charge during the whole of April, and then, my house-surgeoncy ceasing, I only saw him occa<lb/>sionally—he was under my care nearly three weeks—during that time I had an opportunity of judging of his state of mind—I have no reason to believe he was of unsound mind—he appeared quite rational—he was sensible when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186606110145"/>
               <p>he came to the hospital, but he could not speak from, loss of blood And injury to his throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he suffering from haemarriage when he came to the hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—assuming for a moment that he was just pre<lb/>viously in a state of temporary aberration of intellect, it is possible that the haemarriage would have the effect of restoring him—he was brought straight to Guy's Hospital—no extra precautions as to nurses were taken than with any other cut throat—I do not think it necessary that a person who attempts to out his throat is at the time not in a sound state of mind—a man who attempts to destroy his own life is not, generally speaking, in a sound state of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If it had been proved that on one or two previous occasions he had attempted to destroy himself, would it strengthen your opinion that the third time he was in an unsound state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be more likely—if he received a few years ago a violent injury to his brain by reason of severe violence, which rendered him unconscious for some time, that might operate on his mental powers—intemperate habits would have a great predisposing influence, particularly on a brain weakened by physical injuries—he came under my care directly he came in—I saw him at eight o'clock, and every day for three or four weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician of Great Dover-street—I attended the prisoner for the injury to his head—he had no severe external injury, but severe to his brain, I think—I cannot refer to the exact date, but he suffered from it two or three weeks—in my judgment his brain suffered from the accident—I have not attended him since—when he had sufficiently recovered to resume his avocations, he suffered from headache and complained of pains in his head—I had only known him about a week previous to the accident by attending his master and mistress, and he used to come for medicines for the family—I think such an injury might have an effect on his mental powers—change of manner, irritability, and attempt to commit suicide would indicate disease of the membranes of the brain, which would be quite consistent with the accident he received—such an injury to the brain as I have described would produce occasionally appearances which might be mistaken by the witnesses for intoxication—a small proportion of liquor would have a great effect upon a person whose brain had suffered an injury—the irritability described by the witnesses to-day would have just that effect—the symptoms would be those of mental cerebral affection, and not of intoxication.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I apprehend you believed him to be perfectly well before you allowed him to go to work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when a man has sustained so severe an injury to his head I should quite expect to find traces of it after<lb/>wards, unless there is immediate recovery—I should expect to discover it three years afterwards—a patient might become sane immediately afterwards, and, on the other hand, there might be phrenzy after the act—drink is very likely to cause irritability, and stupor also.</p>
