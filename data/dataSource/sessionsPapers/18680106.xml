I don't know what you mean; I never had any sewing-machine silk; I don't know what it is; I never saw any"—I said, "Are you a dealer in silk?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you mean to say you never had any silk or sold any?"—he said "No, never"—I said, "Are you quite positive?"—he said, "Yes"—I then took him away—after I had got a little distance I said, "Do you know Mr. Taylor, of Beech Street, Barbican?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said, "Do you now mean to tell me that you have never had any machine silk or sold any to him?"—he then said, "I have"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "I had it from a man in the public-house where you have just taken me from, but I don't know who he is, what his name is, or where he comes from; I don't ask questions of persons who bring goods to me"—I found that he lived in George's Row, in a little front room, a wretched<lb/>looking place, I found no silk there or any property of this description.</p>

               <p>and got hold of the nearest to me, when the prisoner struck or kicked me a terrific blow in the back, which left a bruise on my hip two or three inches long—I saw him do it—I instantly dropped the man I had hold of and fell on my knees, cutting the knees of my trousers open—I ran after the prisoner and captured him, not above the length of this Court off—I was then set upon by the whole lot and knocked down again—I was calling out "Police!" all the time, but nobody came to my assistance—I got up, ran after the prisoner again, caught him, and was taking him to the station when I was assaulted again by the whole gang—he broke away and was stopped by Parritt, a policeman being close on his heels—a comforter which had been round my neck was picked up in the road—I had been ill in bed for a month before this, and had only just returned to work—it preyed very much upon my nervous system, and I feel the effects of it now—I have been under Dr. Renger, of University College Hospital.</p>

               <p>into a fish and pie shop next door, and saw the prisoner and the same men there—after leaving the fish-shop I went down the Queen's Road, and when there the prisoner, and the other two attacked me—they knocked me in the ribs, and knocked me about, and knocked my face—I sung out for a policeman, but could not find one—I had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on me, and they took it from me—I can't say who it was that took the money—it was one of the three—I am confident that the prisoner was one of them—I went to the police-station and gave information—two policemen were sent with me to the spot where I was knocked down—they got their lanterns and matched the mud with the mud on my coat—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the police-station at Chelsea that same evening—he was along with eight or nine other civilians—I pointed him out as the man who had attacked me with the other two—I had been drinking, but I was not drunk by a long way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Newton Street, Holborn, and am a cattle-dealer by trade—I know George Gould, otherwise Bristowe, who was convicted at this Court last Session—I received a subpoena to attend here on the Tuesday, about the middle of the day—I have not got it with me; I destroyed it—I attended here on the Thursday to give evidence against Gould—on the Monday before that Thursday I saw the prisoner in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—Mr. Robson was with me—I had some words with the prisoner—I began with him first—I had had a good deal to drink—as to what took place between us I can't say—there were several words and a good deal of swearing, but as to the particulars that took place I can't say, further than a quarrel—I was examined before the Magistrate—my evidence was taken down and read over, and I signed it—I believe I said to the prisoner, "Don't you interfere with me, or I shall knock your teeth down your throat"—ho said, "You are interfering, I have found you out, you are giving Mr. Robson and Mr. Phipps some information"—I said, "I know nothing about it, I never appeared to any transaction, I am not a witness in any shape or form," no more I was—I don't remember anything being said about my giving evidence here against Bristowe—the prisoner said, "I believe you are inciting Mr. Robson against my father, or something of that sort—I said, "I know nothing about it, I have enough to do to trouble my head with my own business"—I did not hear the prisoner say, "I will settle you before I have done with you, and if you appear against the old man I will rip your b—guts up"—I did not say so before the Magistrate, not that I remember—he never made use of such expressions—we had been drinking in the neighbourhood eight or ten days—I have drunk with him before and since—I had been upset a good deal in business, and had been drinking for a fortnight, and, to tell you the truth, I don't know what he did say—I don't remember his saying if I appeared at the Old Bailey and gave evidence against George Bristowe ho would twist my b——neck—I can't say what day it was that I was before the Magistrate—I don't know whether he said, "You d——old villain, you are giving them the <hi rend="italic">tip</hi>, "I was so in liquor—I was in liquor when I was at Bow Street. not when I gave evidence here; I had been drinking, but I knew then what I was saying—I don't know whether the prisoner said to me, "I will punch your b——head"—I believe there was some swearing—I told him I would knock his teeth down his throat—I don't remember his saying I had been in prison.</p>

I am a wheelwright, and live at 29, Liquorpond Street, Gray's Inn Road—on Monday evening, 16th December, about a quarter to eight, I met Mr. Day in Portugal Street—while I was with him the prisoner came up and said, "You d——old villain, you are giving them the <hi rend="italic">tip</hi>"—that was the first thing I heard—he then came closer and said, "I will punch your b——head," and he lifted up his hand and was about to strike him, but I prevented him; he threw his right hand out from his body, as a man would do if he was about to strike another; he was quite close to him and could have reached him, when I went in between them—he then said, "I will wring your b—neck if you arc giving any information against the old man"—he entered into a</p>

               <p>variety of accusations as to his being an old thief, and having been in prison a multitude of times, and so on, but nothing further relating to the case, and after a good deal of squabble of that kind he went away—I attended at this Court when Gould, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Bristowe, was tried—I saw the man Day called as a witness—I also saw the prisoner called as a witness for the defence—on the Tuesday, about a quarter-past two, I was standing at the front entrance to the Court and saw a crowd assembled, and I saw the prisoner, in a threatening attitude against Day, making use of language which I could not bear, and he was removed by a City Constable, who threatened to take him into custody if he repeated it—on the Monday, in Portugal Street, Day never said a syllable to the prisoner before the prisoner spoke to him; he could not see him, because he came from behind us.</p>

               <p>the Christmas holiday, and the prisoner, who was in the room, called out to Mr. Grubb, "You are a liar"—the prisoner was not dining with us, he had had his dinner—Mr. Grubb asked him if he was alluding to him; he said that he was; he asked him a second time, and he said that he was—he got up and they had a little tussle together, and I think Mr. Grubb said that he would put him out of the room—I did not interfere in any way during the altercation; I still continued to sit there—I heard the prisoner behind me sharpening a shoemaker's knife, and with that he put one arm around my head, drew my head back, and with the other hand he drew the knife across my throat—I put my hands up to save my throat, and got three fingers cut—my throat was cut too, and there was another attempt down below, where he cut through six folds of my linen shirt, but did not wound my skin—he said nothing to me—I did not bleed a great deal from my throat, but very much from the wounds on my hands—I cannot say whether he was drunk or sober, I had not seen him since about twelve that day, and had not spoken to him at all that day.</p>

I looked up and saw him suddenly with his hand across his father's forehead—I immediately pounced on him, seized him I believe by the wrist, and held his hand, which enabled my wife to take the knife out of his hand, and give it to a servant, who ran away with it—it was a shoemaker's knife—my father-in-law struggled away and went to a doctor's, and the prisoner got upon me, but did not do me any particular harm—he was given in custody.</p>

I am single, and am servant to the prosecutor—the prisoner had a conversation with me on the Friday preceding this Saturday—he told me I was not to be surprised, as he should do for the old b—, as his blood was getting up, and he should do it—he did not use any name, but we were talking about his father.</p>

I did not—the prisoner's brother was at the Smallpox Hospital—he had been out in the morning, and I asked him if his brother was better—he said that he had not been to see his brother, it was his father and mother's place to go, and not his—he had not been drinking on the Friday, it was in the after<lb/>noon, but I cannot say the time exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of sewers in the City of London, and live at Low Leyton, in Essex—I have a house there abutting on the Thornhill Road—there is a garden at the back running down to a wall, which abuts upon an open space of ground where they are building—there is a shed at the bottom of the garden, and beyond that a plot of ground upon which a house is being erected—adjoining my garden there is another terminating in a shed in a similar way—there is an outhouse adjoining my house—at the back, from that to the bottom of the garden is about ninety feet—on Sunday night, 24th November, I had some tools locked in my outhouse—on the morning of the 25th, about half-past seven or eight, I found the window of the outhouse broken and a quantity of tools gone from a bench just under the window: three planes, three hammers, a mallet, four gauges, and a number of other tools, and from the shed, at the bottom of the garden I also lost a hammer, chisel, and screw-driver—that shed had been locked, but the key was left in the door—the value of all I lost was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave notice to the police—I observed some foot<lb/>marks in my garden, commencing apparently from the shed as if they had come over the wall, going along a border for about twelve feet across the garden, then apparently on to the path, and again on to the border at the side of the garden, traversing the whole length of the garden close to the wall till stopped by a low fence, then round the fence to the outhouse, as if groping their way in the dark—I also found footsteps direct from the outhouse by rather a shorter cut across the border, and back again the whole track—the marks were very distinct, some were trodden into the other, but there were over a hundred I should think quite distinct; there were only the footsteps of one person, as far as I could see—the path would not leave impressions, as it was hard; they apparently went out of the garden in the same way, over the shed; the shed is within 100 feet of the house that is building—there is a small hut about two or three feet away from my shed, lower than my shed, and the house that is being built is beyond that—I afterwards saw a pair of boots in possession of the police-sergeant—I saw the prisoner at the police-court wearing those boots—I saw the constable compare those boots with the impressions in the garden; he made fresh impressions with them by the side of the others; they corresponded most minutely—the right boot was trodden over on the right side; it was a plain side-spring boot without nails, very much worn—the impressions precisely tallied; both impressions when measured were exactly eleven inches long—the impressions of the left foot were very. indistinct at the toe, the toes must almost have protruded on to the ground, and I observed those pecu<lb/>liarities both in the original impressions and in those made by the constable; they corresponded in every respect—the prisoner appeared before the Magistrate on the first occasion and was let out on bail—I did not see him leave the police-court—I never saw the boots after that—I saw him again, on the second remand, on 5th December; he was not then wearing the same boots, but others—I have not seen them since—I have seen a marking<lb/>gauge and a mallet in the possession of the constable—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are both my property—I can't say I saw these identical tools in the outhouse on the night of the 24th, but I had seen them very</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 739 <hi rend="italic">A R</hi>). On Monday, the 26th, from information I received, I sent a constable to Mr. Haslip's house—I did not go that day, I went on the Tuesday—I saw a number of footsteps in the garden—as far as I could judge, they were the footsteps of one person—I traced them from over a shed in a piece of ground adjoining Mr. Haslip's shed, and into his garden through a newly-dug border nearly at the end of his house, where the outhouse is, and then back again to the same place—a great number of the impressions were very distinct indeed—a person could get into the window of the outhouse, which was broken—I went round to the building at the rear, where a house is erecting, and saw the builder there and the prisoner's father, and entered into conver<lb/>sation with them—the prisoner was then at work in the front room of that house, which is about a hundred feet from Mr. Haslip's garden—he was working with his father as a carpenter—he did not speak to me when I went in, but he looked at me—I noticed his boots, and, from his peculiar appearance. was tempted to look at him—he looked at me and hung his head down, as if he wanted to avoid my seeing him—I did not speak to him, but on looking at his boots I judged they would make similar im<lb/>pressions to those I saw—I then left, and made inquiries as to the pri<lb/>soner's character, and on Wednesday, the 27th, I apprehended him in Roman Road, Old Ford—he told me that he was at work at Chadwell Heath—that is eight or nine miles away—he had the same boots on when I took him—I took them off at the station, and went and made impressions with them by the side of the others, in the presence of Mr. Haslip—they corresponded exactly—I noticed the peculiarities—the left boot was worn away so that the toes almost had come to the ground; the right boot was trodden over on the right side—I observed those peculiarities and the impressions both in going and returning, and they corresponded—I sent a constable to Chadwell Heath, and received from him a bag of tools, amongst which was the gauge I have produced—the mallet I got from a man named Green, who was working on the premises where the prisoner worked—the prisoner saw me take the gauge out of the bag, and he said he had picked it up in a shed at the rear of the house where he had been at work, at Low Leyton—he said he saw the mallet with it—I gave up the boots to the prisoner when he was admitted to bail, and on the remand he appeared in a fresh pair—I have not seen the others since.</p>

I am a carpenter and joiner—I am out of employment at present—I live at 3, Kenilworth Road, Grove Road, Bow—I have known the prisoner about four months—I was a fellow-workman of his for about two days—I remember Tuesday, the 26th November, well—about half-past seven o'clock the prisoner called at my house, and said he had got a country job down at Chadwell Heath to go to, on the following day, and he wanted me to go with him, as there was work for two, but before he went there he wanted to go down to Low Leyton to get his tools, and I went with him that same evening—when we got there we could not get his. tools—his and his father's tools were kept together, I believe in the house next door to where they were working—after knocking some time at the house, and receiving no answer, he said he would go to the place where his father had been working next door—after searching about for some time he found a smoothing-plane—he put that on one side, as he did not require it—he then said he would go to the back of the buildings where he and his father kept other tools—I went with him as far as the back door—he went into a kind of shed or outhouse, and when he came out he had this gauge in his hand, I am positive he had not got it when he went in—he said, "I have got something that belongs to my father, we shall want it to-morrow" and I said, "Yes, we shall, bring it" and he did.</p>

I am the prisoner's father, and am a carpenter and joiner, living at 75, Hewlett Road, Old Ford—I work anywhere and everywhere, wherever I can get a job—I have been working down at Low Leyton—when I first went there I used to put my tools into an out<lb/>house; there were two outhouses on the piece of ground, one with a lock and key, and one without—I frequently put them in both places, but for double security I asked the next-door neighbour to allow me to put them into his house, as we were in the habit of losing our tools so much, and he said I might do so—on the night of 26th November I put a few in there, and some I left in the outhouse, where it appears this gauge came from—I left there that day at dark, about five or a little after or before—I did not know of my son having a job at Chadwell Heath until I came home on the Monday night, when a young man living close by came to tell him of it—he went with him to see about it, and came back and said he had got it—he then went out to see Dawe—that must have been about half-past seven or eight—he said, "What am I to do about tools?"—I said, "I have some tools at home, no doubt they will answer your purpose for the time being" and he had my tools, and went to Chadwell Heath on the next morning—I believe the first train leaves about seven—I remember Saturday, the 23rd November; my son came home about eleven o'clock that night, and he remained at home on Sunday, the 24th, the whole day—I was not well that day, and never left home till half-past six on Monday morning, when I left to go to Low Leyton—I shook my son in his bed that morning to wake him, and told him to get up and go to a person named Dawe, in Green Street, Bethnal Green, to whom I had taken two saws to be sharpened on the Saturday afternoon, that I might take them with me on Monday morning—I have heard the witness Dawe describe the outhouse where this gauge was found—I know the place—I have been in it frequently, and have been in the habit of leaving my tools there.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. On the night of 26th October, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Whelan was helped to my house—he had been a patient of mine before—he was suffering from partial concussion of the brain, and was partially conscious—he was covered all over with blood—I have attended him up to this time—he had contused wounds all over his body, more particularly on the chest, the scalp, the abdomen, and the back of the neck; also a lacerated wound on the upper left side of his head, penetrating to the bone, a contused bleeding wound on his neck, and a fracture of the lower jaw—next morning when I saw him he was spitting blood, and he had a rupture of the lower lobe of the left lung—there was</p>

               <p>a bruise outside corresponding to that, so bad that he could hardly have it touched—it might have been caused by a kich with a heavy boot—I con<lb/>sidered his life in imminent danger; he will always be very delicate, and will never be the man he was before—he is suffering still very much; he is permanently injured—every time the prisoner was brought up at the police-court he abused me dreadfully, calling me all sorts of epithets, and a quack.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"On the night of 26th October I had taken off my coat and boots, preparing to go to bed. I was in a back room down stairs at the house, 5, Armstrong Street. My land<lb/>lady and daughter were in the back room. I asked for a candle to go to bed. I wished my landlady good night, and came into the passage. I heard a scream. I said, 'Hullo! there's a row outside.' My landlady's daughter and I ran to the door. As we got to the door a man and woman passed by; they were talking rather loud; they made a stop in front of our house, and the woman laid hold of the fence. The man had his arm round the woman's neck; they were having high words; the woman didn't seem willing to go. I went up to them and asked the woman what was the matter; the woman said, 'Not much; will you direct me to Burridge Road?' I directed the woman; the man turned his head on one side away from me. The woman was very drunk. I then said, 'What does this b——vagabond want to do with you?' I received a blow from the man in the face, and was knocked down; I got up and struck at him, and closed with him; we both fell, I was under; he knocked my head several times against the ground; the woman was standing over me, striking me with her crutch. I got one of my feet against the man's</p>

               <p>breast and knocked him over from the top of me. We both got up and exchanged several blows; we then closed and fell again; I got up first. The man called to the woman to give him the crutch, and he'd soon settle me. I ran to the woman and took the crutch away from her; I then threw the crutch along the street as far as I could throw it. The man was on his feet and rushed at me; we exchanged several blows, we grappled and fell in the gutter; I was uppermost, the man holding me down, under<lb/>neath me. We struggled some time; I then got up; the woman had the crutch in her hand again, standing close to me; she was about to hand it to the man, when I snatched it from her. I told him to stand back, or I would strike him with it; I swung the crutch in front of him several times. He persisted in following me. I then struck him several blows with it. Some one in the crowd called out, 'Here's the police; run!' I then ran away and went in doors; I put on my boots and coat and came out again, and I went down to Woolwich, and had my head washed where it was cut. That's all."</p>
