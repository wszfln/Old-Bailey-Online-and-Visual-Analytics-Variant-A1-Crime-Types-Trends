               <p>Give the Court and the Jury an account of what the prisoner at the bar did to you, and the time when, as near as you can, and relate all the circumstances of it. Speak out, and don't be afraid. - Mrs. Russen is mistress of the charity-girls; when her daughter went upstairs to mind the children, he asked her to let me stay below with him when he went to sleep after dinner, for fear he should fall into the fire; when she was gone upstairs he took me upon his knee, and then put me down and put up my petticoats, and put his finger up between where I make water.</p>
               <p>Where did he put you when he put you off his knee? - Close to him; he sat and I stood for a little while; then he laid me on the kitchen-chair, then he took up my petticoats, unbuttoned his breeches, and put something up the inside of me.</p>
               <p>In what situation did he continue? Did he continue standing up or how? - He laid across me; afterwards he gave me a red and white handkerchief to wipe me with; then my mistress's daughter came down, and he told her he could not get any sleep.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you before that? - He said if I told my mother, or sister, or any body of it, that he would flog me severely.</p>
               <p>When he laid down upon you, what was it that he put to you? - His private parts.</p>
               <p>Did he enter your body? - Yes, he put his private parts quite inside of me.</p>
               <p>Did you feel any thing come from him? - Yes, all wet.</p>
               <p>Where did that come from? - From my master.</p>
               <p>Were you at all hurt by this afterwards? Were you sore or hurt? - I was sore, I could not make water for five days.</p>
               <p>Do you remember in what month this happened? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember how long ago it is? - I know it was when my mistress lay in.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after? - It was in the time of my mistress's lying-in.</p>
               <p>Did you mention this afterwards to any body? - No; on Thursday he went out to dine with a gentleman, and he gave the boys half a holiday; when he came home, he had three boys to do some work in the garden; then he sent the boys for some horse-dung to the church; then he called me to him, and laid me across the committee-chair in the committee-room; when he was getting on me he heard somebody come, and he got off from me and looked at the door, and there was nobody coming; then he did the same to me as he had done before.</p>
               <p>You must mention what it was he did to you. - The same as he did before.</p>
               <p>Did he do the same as before? - He lay upon me, and some stuff came from him; but there was not so much as there was at first.</p>
               <p>Did you after this tell this story to your mother or sister? - My sister went to wash my linen, and she saw the stuff on my shift; the first time Mrs. Pearce washed my linen she thought I had some sore; when my sister mentioned it to me I told her what I have told now.</p>
               <p>Was it shortly after the first or second time that you told your sister? - After the second time.</p>
               <p>Then your sister's observation must have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150004"/> been within a few days after this happened? - Yes; my mother was at work, and did not know it.</p>
               <p>Not till your sister told her? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your mother look at you when she came home? - No.</p>
               <p>What! not at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your mother at no time look at you, to see if any thing was the matter with you? - She went to a doctor in Whitechapel.</p>

               <p>Did your master go up to the boys as usual? - He gave his daughter the watch, he asked me what it was o'clock; I told him it wanted 25 minutes to two; he said his watch went too slow.</p>
               <p>Then it was before the school began in the afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It begins about two in the afternoon? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you cry out? - No; I tried to get off the chair, and he took and leaned hard on me; I told him so, and he did not mind it, as if he did not hear me.</p>
               <p>How came you not to cry out when he hurt you; was it the bearing hard upon you that hurt you? - Yes, and something else hurt me.</p>
               <p>Which hurt you most? - Not his leaning upon me.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder you had not cried out when he hurt you, if he hurt you much? - I was frightened at the first, and I told him of it and cried, and he did not mind it.</p>

               <p>Were the boys and girls all at home at that time? - The boys had half a holiday that time, the girls were up in the school.</p>
               <p>The girls school is not far from the entry? - No, you go into the parlour, and go up into the girls school.</p>
               <p>Then, from this entry, there is a door into the girls room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And no other door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was this in the entry that leads to the girls school? - No, the boys.</p>
               <p>Where was the place it happened the second time, in the entry or committee-room? - In the entry that goes into the committee-room.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. Suppose you go up stairs and go through the boys school, do you pass thro' the school to go into that entry? - No, you go down; the committee-room is down below.</p>
               <p>Is it up one pair of stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>How far is that entry from the girls school? - A good bit.</p>
               <p>There is no door, but the door of the school-room? - The parlour-door as you go into the entry.</p>
               <p>Then, as you go through the parlour, you go through the committee-room, without going into the boys school? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This entry is not up one pair of stairs then? - No, down by the committee-room.</p>
               <p>Now, how far is the committee-room from the kitchen? - Three or four yards.</p>
               <p>You say that was about five in the afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who was in the kitchen at that time, or who was about the house? - My mistress's daughters were below stairs, he went and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Was your mistress below stairs then? - No, she was up in the school minding the girls.</p>
               <p>You did not make any noise the second time more than the first? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you standing upon your legs the second time? - No.</p>
               <p>How then? - He laid me across the chair.</p>
               <p>I thought you said it was in the entry, not in the committee-room? - The second time after the first time he laid with me in the committee-room.</p>
               <p>You did not cry out? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you not to cry out; did he or did he not hurt you much the second time? - He did not hurt me much the second time, not so much as he did the first; I told him that he hurted me; he did not seem to hear it.</p>
               <p>Till your sister found it out you did not speak of this to any body? - Mrs. Pearce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150006"/> would not let me go to school, she sent one on the other side of the water to my mother.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing particular to you? - She asked me; I told her what my master did to me; she sent me to my mother, and I told her of it.</p>
               <p>Was this after the first time he used you so? - The last.</p>
               <p>Was it the first time that you told Mrs. Pearce? - Yes; I understood Mrs. Pearce washed my linen; at the first she did not say any thing; she thought I had some sore.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Mrs. Pearce the first time, when she saw your linen? - No; the last.</p>
               <p>That was a month after the first? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If they had not observed the linen, should you have told of it at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Who was it that began to make a stir about it, after you had told Mrs. Pearce? Was she the first person, or your mother, or who? - Mrs. Pearce was.</p>
               <p>What did she do upon being told of it? - She told my mother; my mother went on the Saturday and took him up.</p>
               <p>What became of him after he was taken up; was he taken before a justice of the peace? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Was you before any justice of the peace? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he before the justice at the same time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What justice was it? - Mr. Wilmot.</p>
               <p>You told the same story as you tell here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your mother and Mrs. Pearce by at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And what did the justice do upon hearing this story, and the complaint of Mrs. Pearce and your mother; did he send your master to prison or discharge him? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did you go to school any more? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he at home at his house after that? - My mother would not let me go to school after that to my mistress and master.</p>
               <p>What surgeon looked at you except that doctor in Whitechapel? - Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>He lives about Whitechapel? - No, he lives just by, at Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>He examined you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your mother by at the time? - Yes. And Mrs. Pearce? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Hyams? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150007"/>Did you observe any particular appearance upon the linen? - There was some yellow stuff as stiff as buckram; I asked her how that came there, she said her master did it; I asked her how, she said, when her mistress lay in he called her to him and set her atop of his knee, and put his hands up her petticoats, and put his fingers where she makes water, and hurt her very much indeed, and then he put her down, unbuttoned his breeches, and put in something else which hurt her very much indeed; that it was the second time in the committee-room upon two chairs; she said he hurt her very much, that she could not make water for four or five days, and was very sore indeed.</p>
               <p>Did she say how long a distance of time it was between the first and second time? - There were three times, twice in one day; he shut the door, he thought he heard somebody coming; he came again, and shoved her up against the boys wainscot, and wiped her with a red and white handkerchief: I told Mrs. Pearce, and she told my mother.</p>

               <p>When was that? - Of the Saturday; the day after my sister and I went together; we would not go in either of us; he begged and prayed we would tell him where my mother was; I said she was at work on the other side the water; I could not tell whether she had done work or no; he asked where my father was; I said, I believe he is at work; he said, I beg for my sake you will tell me where your mother or father is, for I shall not rest all night.</p>

               <p>You wash for the school I believe? - I do not: her mother is a poor woman; has a back room in my house; as her mother was out at work I washed the child's shifts now and then; I saw something upon it; I thought the child had a sore; the child was very loth to go to school, and played a truant a great while.</p>
               <p>About what time was it you made the observation? - I reckon it must be about nine months ago.</p>

               <p>Was the linen shewn to you at any subsequent time? - I used to wash it; the child had played a truant a great while; I told her father and mother; they used to beat the child unmercifully, because she did not go to school; I could not bear to hear it, so I did not tell them the last time; I told her she must go to school: her sister was about washing her linen; she saw something; she told me, and I told her mother.</p>
               <p>Was the linen shewn to you the second time? - I did see it, but I did not mind it at all; I am a single person; I did not take notice.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. You are subpoenaed here, I believe, on the part of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was desired by him to examine this child? - By Justice Wilmot I understood it.</p>
               <p>Where did you examine her? - At the Justice's house.</p>
               <p>When was it? - On Saturday the 20th of last month I think.</p>
               <p>You will speak as a fair man what observation you made upon it. - I was sent for by the Justice, that he desired to speak with me; when I went I found Mr. Russen and the parties there; the Justice told me the case, and desired me to examine the girl, which I did accordingly did: it did not appear to me that there had been any violence used; there was not the least laceration that I could porceive; and, if I understood right, there was a young man there that said he was a surgeon, that the Justice knew something of, at the time, that was with me; I desired him that he would introduce his finger into the pudenda; the child could not bear it; we both agreed, that no violence had been used.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by that, that there had been no offer of violence; was there no appearance that any violence had been offered the child? - There was no laceration.</p>
               <p>Probably not, at that distance of time; but was there no mark of any violence of any sort? - None that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect how long that was from the time that the girl alledged that she had been ill used? - I remember the child said, she had been ill used about last January; I then blamed her for not speaking of it; she gave me no satisfactory answer.</p>
               <p>If there had been any inflammation, it would have subsided before that time, and nature would have provided for any laceration; it would have healed? - It would.</p>

               <p>Then, to the best of your knowledge, her body had never been entered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it not usual for children to have what is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150009"/> called the Whites? - Yes; it might come from a strain.</p>
               <p>And then it would be yellowish and stiff? - Yes, it would be rather stiff and whitish.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Had she any appearance of that disorder upon her? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. If any man had entered the child's body, must not the hymen have been broke? - Yes, and a large effusion of blood would follow it.</p>
               <p>Upon that person's introducing his finger she cried out? - Yes; she cried out, and I desired the young man to desist; she could not bear it.</p>
               <p>Though it was done as gently as possible? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Who has told you so? - Nobody; because I was with him the whole time.</p>

               <p>You did not leave him till you thought him tolerably well? - When I left him he was not quite well enough to go abroad; I left him when I thought there was no occasion for any more medicines.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did Mr. Russen do the duty of his school any part of the months of January and February? - Yes; but at Christmas time I remember he was ill.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the time when Mrs. Russen was brought to bed? - No.</p>

               <p>Was he absent from it a month in the whole? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you keep no holidays at Christmas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you open your school again in January? - A fortnight.</p>
               <p>What day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Russen in the school when the children came the first time after the holidays? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was well and attended his duty then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he relapse after that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you remember his having a fore throat and fever? - Yes; the beginning of February.</p>
               <p>Was not he confined with that? - Yes; he kept his bed.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how often you attended for him? - No; when he sent for me I came.</p>
               <p>Then you did not live in the house?  - No; my principal business was to go with the children to church on Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and saints days.</p>
               <p>Then there might be no school for what you know the other days of the week? - No.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Russen might be confined and not attend the school without your knowing it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could he have been confined two months without your knowing it; at those times when he did not attend himself, did you always attend for him? - Yes, when he sent for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150012"/>Did he usually send for you when he could not attend himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. I must refer to the worshipful Justice Wilmot to set that matter right, his worship knows according to the rules of the school.</p>
               <p>COURT. If after the children came to school again after the holidays he had been confined for a month or six weeks, could that have been without your knowing it? - I believe he always sent to me if he wanted me.</p>
               <p>Did you attend for him six weeks together after the children came to school again? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you usher of this school? - No further than seeing the children to church on Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and saints days.</p>
               <p>JURY. Is there any other usher besides you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then who attended the school in the prisoner's sickness; did you attend the school for a week together? - No.</p>
               <p>JURY. I suppose the boys must have somebody to look after them in the absence of the prisoner? - I believe Mr. Russen begged leave of Justice Wilmot for the school to be alone for so long a time; Mr. Russen told me that he had begged leave for a week or two of Justice Wilmot.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. At Christmas we give them the Christmas week and a fortnight, which advanced pretty far in January, during which time I was very bad; at the end of that time I sent for Mr. Hawkins, one of the trustees, and consulted him what I should do; I was not able to keep the school; he said, it was better to give the boys a fortnight longer holidays, rather than have any difficulty in the school; the fortnight holidays were granted, which brought me into February before I opened school, which was on the second Monday in February, during which time Mr. Robbins only came to go to church; Mr. Haines attended me then at different times; my wife was brought to-bed about the 10th of January: on the other hand, the second time the girl accuses me with being in the boys entry, I was employed in the garden with three boys, who all before Justice Wilmot, Justice Spiller, Justice Durden, and Justice Bosworth, declared that I was never out of their company a moment of time while she stood in the boys entry, which was proved, and Justice Bosworth, Justice Spiller, and Justice Durden saw through the evil of it, and acquitted me from the charge; it is nothing now but a piece of spite to try me now for my life, when I was honorably acquitted by those four magistrates, and I was sent home; this was on the Tuesday after I was charged on the Saturday: Mr. Haines was at the office when the examination was, and remembers my discharge; Mr. Wilmot bid me be peaceable about the matter, and go home; this was fairly proved; Justice Durden told the prosecutors that if they ever troubled me any more, that he would imprison them for life.</p>
               <p>From the JURY to Mrs. PEARCE. Did you observe much blood upon the shift when you washed it? - I did; but it was upon the side, that is the reason why I thought it a fore.</p>

               <p>Did you examine her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you not to do that? - As she was a child, I thought it was by her running, and the heat of her water.</p>
               <p>So you treated it as a common thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it a usual circumstance to happen to children to be in that state? - Some may more than others.</p>
               <p>You never examined her yourself, nor took any more notice of her, till the prisoner was apprehended? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe, after he was apprehended, you examined the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long ago did you examine her? - I don't know what day.</p>
               <p>How did she appear to you at that time? - She looked very red and much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Did you take her to any surgeon? - Yes; Mr. Gilson examined her.</p>
               <p>Was that on the same day you examined her yourself? - I examined her afterwards.</p>
               <p>You thought she had chased herself with running? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when this girl was brought to you to be examined? - I believe it was on the 30th of September (refers to a memorandum) it was on Tuesday, September the 30th. I thought the Vagina was rather wider than I expected to have found in a girl of that age; but, upon introducing my finger, I found that the Hymen, which is a membrane that generally gives way by copulation, was not broken.</p>
               <p>Did you make any other observation? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any degree of inflammation appear? - There was a trifling inflammation.</p>
               <p>COURT. The inflammation was merely external? - Yes; there could have been no copulation, at all; as the Hymen was not broke I judged there was no immediate entrance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that there could be no degree of penetration without the Hymen being broke? - Very trifling.</p>
               <p>But do you say that there could be no penetration at all without the Hymen being broke? - I do; not into the body.</p>
               <p>Mr. HYMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I will ask you the same question I asked that gentleman; whether there can be no degree of penetration without breaking the Hymen? - It is impossible he could have entered the body half an inch without breaking the Hymen, or the Carunculae Myrtiformes; the Hymen is not in all children nor in all women.</p>
               <p>But where there is a hymen it is impossible to enter without breaking it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Has it never been known by surgeons, in their experience, that there has been a conception without breaking the Hymen? - It is impossible to admit that in the nature of things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Does that membrane cover the passage completely? - In some degree; but there is a small perforation left for the passage of the menses to come from the womb, that is left open by nature.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to say, that there cannot be a conception without breaking it? - It is impossible without breaking through the Hymen or the membrane.</p>
               <p>How far within the Vagina is the Hymen? - About an inch or an inch and half; the Vagina may be four or five inches, according to the different make of women.</p>
               <p>I am not asking the whole length, but the depth to the Hymen; you say it is an inch or inch and half? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150016"/>Then the lips of the Vagina may be penetrated to the extent of an inch and half without breaking the Hymen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then when you say that there can be no penetration without breaking the Hymen, you mean only that they cannot pass that membrane without breaking the Hymen? - The Hymen will appear very soon upon withdrawing the outward lips, so that it is impossible for a woman to be ravished without that is broke through, it can be only an attempt.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Ratcliff-highway: I was subpoenaed here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Who by? - By Mr. Russen, to appear to his character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The present charge I am innocent of; it is a real combination, as it would plainly appear, if my counsel had done me justice, and opened the case as it is; there is a leading clue throughout the whole.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your counsel are not at liberty to state any matter of fact, they are permitted to examine your witnesses, and they are here to speak to any matters of law that may arise; but if your defence arises out of matter of fact, you must yourself state it to me and the jury, and we are ready to hear you.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Here is a written defence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it in your own hand-writing?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. No, it is a copy from my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you must read it yourself.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. With regard to the first case?</p>
               <p>COURT. I am sorry to stop you: you must say nothing with regard to the first case; I am now trying you for having deflowered one

             gives this day, is as variously different to the account she gave before Justice Wilmot, as light to darkness; she there said, I never attempted any thing of this sort till on the 19th day of September last; now they have taken it back many months; I cannot tell what the bottom of this matter is for; I am really used exceeding ill; there is not one concurring circumstance to prove that ever I had to do with her either from the appearance of her linen. or any thing else; but one day there were three or four of these things done through a private pique of some of the gentlemen in the parish, and they have brought this to pass: her grandfather came to Newgate with a view to see me, I believe, but his conscience struck him, he would not see me; he called upon a Mr. Murphy in the ward where I was confined; he is an old acquaintance; he told Mr. Murphy that he was very sorry for the prosecution; he said, the prosecution which I am constrained to enter into against that man, so torments my conscience, that I cannot sleep night or day, but I must do it, or lose my bread; he brought up the same word as soon as Harris was gone, and the counsel, I believe, has the copy of what he said, or at least the attorney has; the grandfather of that child is bound over to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>COURT. What is his name?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Harris; he was bound over to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no such man appearing as prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. But Justice Wilmot has been ingenious enough to alter the whole scheme; he was at Justice Durden's last Monday; he told him he was inclined to mercy, and would do all he could to throw out the indictment; but on hearing that my friends were determined to move the cause to the King's Bench, that he should not have his ends, he then made three capital charges more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any well-grounded reason for imputing either to Mr. Wilmot, or to any one else any ill-will towards you?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Yes, for above a twelvemonth past; Justice Wilmot about a twelvemonth ago summoned all the subscribers to vote me out of the school upon a private pique between him and I; it was about pedigree; one of the churchwardens had talked to me against his worship, and his worship against me; he tried to vote me out; he could not carry his point; and from that time to this he has set his face<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150017"/> against me. A little before this happened, I had some words with the curate of the parish, reproving him for keeping bad company; the curate told the parties that I accused them of being whores and rogues; I only observed that the man that lives next door to me lives with another man's wife; that the reverend Mr. D. had a bastard child; he went to Mr. Wilmot, and went to the Commons to get a libel against me; he said, if it was possible to have my life he would have it; they told me they would make me stand in a white sheet for calling a woman a whore; upon this Mary -, the witness to the sister I had accused with taking a pair of Dresden ruffles from me, a little girl, went to the pawnbroker's to see if she could find them; when I was brought before Justice Wilmot that evening, nothing appeared of any signification, the Justice bid me go home, if I would promise to appear again on Tuesday; the curate of St. Stephen's, Mr. D -, appeared after I was dismissed by four justices of the peace, Mr. Durden, Mr. Spiller, Mr. Bosworth, and Mr. Wilmot; I was honorably acquitted of this charge; they pursued me like blood-hounds, and went round the parish, the curate and some more of them, and got a deaf, foolish girl to come and lay such a charge, and she pretended she could say I had to do with some more besides her; I went and surrendered myself to Mr. Smith of Tothillfields Bridewell; I said there was something amiss, I should be glad if he would take me as a prisoner; Mr. Smith did; the next day I sent to Justice Durden, and desired him to write to Justice Wilmot, and inform him, that if he had any thing against me, I was in custody; he sent and brought me next day before his Bench; there appeared these girls, this silly girl and the others; after I had been in prison a week, this girl was raised up through his insinuations by her grandfather, upon Justice Wilmot threatening him that if he did not conform to his will, he would turn him out of his bread; so I have been pursued for near a twelvemonth by Justice Wilmot with all venom in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. You speak of there having been an examination before four justices of the peace? - There was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you desired any of those justices to come here to speak for you? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were those examinations taken in writing? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are they brought here? - I believe my attorney has them; the examinations were all taken down verbatim; they were given to Mr. Naylor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was this girl examined there? - Not till a week after I was in prison: on the Saturday after I was confined, I with my family were turned out in the street; supposing I had been guilty, they should not have treated them in that manner; in order to prevent my getting assistance from any attorney or counsel, they stopped my money, and paid all my debts illegally, though I said I would not pay any body; I wanted the money in my present distress; I received but 6 l. 12 s. instead of 18 l. odd: Mr. Chetwood knows I sent a gentleman to retain him no longer ago than last Tuesday, because they stopped my money; they have taken every method to take away my life, and deprive me of power to help myself; I was a fortnight in Newgate before I could make any application at all; and Mr. Smith, the keeper of Tothillfields Bridewell, out of complaisance to Justice Wilmot, told him our intent, and then Mr. Wilmot, after talking of being inclined to mercy, the next day behold he found four bills against me of this sort; they were only called assaults before; they are now capital, in order to try me for my life: the reason was because on Monday he upon the bench had planned out what punishment I should have; he said he would have me stand nine times in the pillory before the school, once for every fact; no man living has been used so ill by that gentleman as I have for a whole twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>COURT. I have listened very attentively to all that you have said; I am sorry to say that it does not seem to the point; it seems to point to nothing. What witnesses do you wish to call and examine?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Whether application was not made to the justices by the curate of the parish and Mr. D - of St. Stephen's Walbroke?</p>
               <p>COURT. The Justice being here, I dare say he will have no objection to being exaamined, and answering your questions; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150018"/> it is a dangerous appeal; you suppose the justice not to be your friend? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you desire to have such a question asked him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you will give me the question I will ask it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Whether the curate of the parish; and Mr. D - of St. Stephen's Walbroke, did not apply to him for an action against me?</p>
               <p>COURT. That is foreign to this business; any thing that belongs to the subject of these accusations, I shall gladly enquire into, but as to quarrels between you and other persons coming before a justice, that has no connection at all with this subject.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. It was proved by a surgeon that stands here, that I was the whole time in bed at the time of the first charge against me; with regard to the second, it was proved I was not out of their company at the time she charged me.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you desire to have any question asked of Mr. Wilmot respecting this charge, I will ask it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. The whole parish have been incensed against me from the report given out at Justice Wilmot's office; there is no other foundation in the world for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. If there was such a thing I should be glad to assist you in tracing it, but all that you have said upon this subject is very vague, indeed it points to nothing.</p>
               <p>COURT to the counsel. Have you any witnesses for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Only to his character.</p>
               <p>COURT. They have been examined before.</p>

               <p>How old are you? - I shall be sixteen the 24th of next February.</p>
               <p>Did you belong to this school of which Mr. Russen was master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember going any where with Mr. Russen last summer? - Yes, to the Lock Chapel.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - On Friday.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what month it was? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you return from the Lock Chapel? - We went in a coach back from the Lock Chapel; he asked me in the coach whether I would let him have my maiden-head? I told him, no, I would not; when he found I would not, he entered my body; he took up my petticoats; he put his private parts into me, and when he had done he wiped me with his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Did you make any noise? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mention it to any body? - No, not till the Tuesday he was taken up.</p>
               <p>How came that? - He said that if I took away his character he would punish me; he told me there was no harm in it as he was a minister.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you at any other time to go with him any where? - He used to tell me where to meet him; to go and meet him at St. Paul's church, and from thence to the Lock.</p>
               <p>Did he repeat this at any other time? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Were you examined by any surgeon? - Yes, the surgeon in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him when he offered you this violence in the coach? - I desired he would not do it; I tried to get away, but could not.</p>
               <p>You said you did not cry out? - No, I tried to get away, but I could not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you observe any appearance upon your linen after the first time? - No; he wiped me with his handkerchief as soon as he had done.</p>
               <p>Where do you say it was that this fact was done? - In the coach coming along.</p>
               <p>You never told any body till he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken up? - I believe it is about two months ago since it happened.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was the coach at that time? - I don't know; it was along the streets.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150019"/>Don't you know in what part of the town It was? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the coach standing still, or going along? - Going along.</p>
               <p>Were the windows up or down? - Up.</p>
               <p>What sort of windows were they? - Glass windows.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - It was in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - The lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>You say he took up your petticoats and entered your body, are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What else did you perceive, did you feel any thing? - I felt something come from him into my body.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. I should be glad your Lordship would ask who bid her say that, she did before the Justice declare the contrary.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who told you to say so? - Nobody; I said it of myself; when I was before Justice Wilmot, I did not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>Did you say before Justice Wilmot that nothing came from him? - I understand better now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who has explained it to you since? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you examine this girl? - Yes, on the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>What sort of observation did you make? - I was of opinion that force had been used, there was a laceration of the parts.</p>

               <p>Was the Hymen entire or broke? - It was broke.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the girl's mother.</p>
               <p>When did she make any complaint to you of this? - Not till the defendant had been in custody, that was the first I knew of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Relate the manner in which your daughter told you of it.</p>
               <p>She came in a sad fright, and said her master was taken up; that surprized me, as I always took the gentleman to be a worthy man; she kept urging me to know what sodomy was, somebody had told her master was taken up for sodomy; I did not satisfy her: at last she said there were 6 of the boys and 6 of the girls at the office; I could not discover what that could be; to make short, she said at last, if it is for meddling with the girls, I am afraid it is true; I did not let that word drop; I insisted to know what she meant by it; then she said he had used her very ill coming from the Lock, and she confessed how he had used her the last time she was with him at the Lock; she related the matter to me much in the manner she has related now; she has never been with him since; she told me it was the last time that she went with him; she had been used to go with him often.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did you, upon being told this, go to the justice? - It was a neighbour next door told the girl first of it; I ran to the office about 4 o'clock; there was no one there; I went next morning and made a complaint.</p>
               <p>No one solicited you, you went and made the complaint upon what you had heard from the mouth of your daughter? - Yes, I did indeed; I had no thoughts of asking her such a question of Mr. Russen.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Whether any body told you any thing besides your daughter? - Concerning my daughter no one did, I have had it from her mouth and no one else.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. How has your daughter behaved herself with you; she lives with you, does not she? - She always did: she has behaved like a sober, honest child; she is rather babyish of her age, and Mr. Russen must be sensible of that; she is not womanish at all of her age.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I can say no more of this than the rest, it is all of a piece: the examination before Justice Wilmot of this girl was different to what it is now; Justice Wilmot himself was my author, that she told him in his private room, that I asked her to let me have her maiden-head; she said, I might if I would; so, he said, here is consent; this is nothing then: after that she charged me with entering her body; she declared upon oath then, that I never did enter her body: his worship sits there and hears what I say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you desirous that I should ask him that question?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. I beg your Lordship will.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Did she declare, that she gave her consent? - No, she did not say any such words; she did not then declare, that he entered her body; she said, he lay upon her; she said, that she was with him in a coach coming from the Lock, and he asked for her maiden-head; she refused, or rather did not understand what he meant by it; she did not say, that she gave her consent; but she said, she did not cry out; she said, he lay upon her; but she did not declare, that he entered her body: I told the parties, that no one need be bound over, for it did not appear capital, as she did not say her body was entered.</p>

My lord, I omitted one observation; when they came up, they said, Your money, and put your hat before your eyes. When they had robbed me, they said, I might go on: I cannot swear to either of the prisoners; I think one of the men was like Smart.</p>

In about an hour and a half after the rest of the catalogue came from the printer's, I went to hang up the wearing apparel; I then missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I told one of the clerks, and hand-bills, with a reward, were printed, and the things were found pawned.

               <p>Have you been taught your Catechism? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know that there is a God who punishes wicked people? - Yes.</p>

               <p>(He is sworn.)</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; my father sent me for some silk to Bow-lane, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>What quantity of silk was there? - Fifty bobbins; the silk was delivered to me by the foreman of the warehouse; I was bringing it back to my father; a young man came up to me, and said Mr. Collier, the foreman, had sent him after me for eight bobbins.</p>
               <p>What young man was that? - The prisoner Parkinson; I told him to come to my house with me, and my daddy would weigh them for him; he said he must have them directly to Mr. Collier to be weighed, and he took the basket out of my hand; he took eight bobbins out, and put them in his apron, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Did you suppose at first that Collier had sent him? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you imagine? - I bid him come to our house, because I meant my daddy to speak to him.</p>

               <p>What do you know of Anderton? - He stood on the opposite side of the way when the other asked for them, and when he had got the bobbins they both laughed, and Anderton crossed over the way to him; I saw no more of them; I knew Parkinson before by sight, I did not know the other.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - Nine in the morning.</p>

               <p>Without saying any thing to you? - He swore he would lie with me; I told him, he should not; he damned me, and said he would lie with me, let the consequence be what it would, and he threw me down; it is a very indecent matter to mention, but I am obliged to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must mention what he did undoubtedly. - He set his knee in the first place on my breast and stomach, and used me in the most inhuman manner.</p>
               <p>Describe what he did. - He effected his purpose in a very cruel manner; he tore me with his hands, and said I was not big enough for him.</p>
               <p>What did he do after he put his knee on your stomach? - It is a bold circumstance to mention by a woman.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing he did to you after he put his knee on your stomach? - He took my cloaths up; he put his fingers and tore my private parts.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, I was not large enough for him, but he would make me big enough.</p>
               <p>What was the next thing he did? - He proceeded, and had knowledge of me.</p>
               <p>You mean carnal knowledge? - Carnal knowledge, against my consent; I cried out several times, and he put something into my mouth, which I imagined to be a handkerchief; as soon as he had completed his whole desire he fled out of the room, and went down stairs, and left me in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you see any more of him? - No.</p>
               <p>He went quite away? - Yes; as soon as I was able to get up I came down stairs, and came out of doors; and as I was passing by the window I thought I saw the glimpse of a man at work in the house; I went back and asked who belonged to the house, and whether it was inhabited; he said it was not inhabited, but it was repairing by one Hatfield; I said I had been cruelly used, and asked where Hatfield lived; he said he lived at Tower-hill, the corner of Savage-gardens, and that he went out a short time before; I said he had used me very ill: I went home directly, and went immediately to bed.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you came home? - It might be upwards of two o'clock, I cannot say to a minute or two; I went to bed, band continued very ill, by reason of the inhuman usage I had received, and the sorvement; I kept my bed four days.</p>
               <p>Did you send for any assistance? - No; I was ashamed; I only told one lodger in the house; the second morning, seeing me in bed, she asked me the reason; I told her I was in a very bad condition, for I had been very badly used by a man that I had not found but; she came down the third morning; I was still in bed; she asked me if I was no better; I said, no, I was very ill; she asked me if I would have a little wine mulled; and she brought me the wine and a little tea: I told her the whole circumstances as I have now related; she asked me why I did not acquaint Mr. Jenkins; I said I was ashamed: I told Mr. Jenkins; I believe it was about the fourth day, by her persuasions; she said it was a pity I should be so badly used without telling it; I said I had no friends, I had nobody to relate my case to: Mr. Jenkins was in a passion when he heard it, and said it was hard treatment;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150030"/> he asked me if I knew where he lived; and he went to Mr. Hatfield's house; there was nobody there but his wife, I believe: Mr. Jenkins being ignorant how to proceed, he said he had a countryman, and attorney, and he would ask him how to proceed.</p>

               <p>I lodge in the first floor in Mr. Jenkins's house.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mrs. Clarke's being ill in June last? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the day? - I cannot remember the day; but the second day she related a little of the story to me; I came down stairs; she slept in a bed-room below stairs; there is a bed-room on every floor; I saw her in bed violent sick; I said, what is the matter; she said, she was very ill; she had been used very ill by a man that she had not found out yet; I went down the next day, and found her very bad; I saw things very indecent, and she spit blood; I sat down, and said, Mrs. Clarke, can you drink a drop of mulled wine? she said, it might do her good; I brought it down to her, and asked her what was the matter; she said, she had been used in a violent manner; the next day I saw her in the same case, and she then related the story to me; I knew the man in the back-room that was gone away owed Jenkins some money; she said, she went to take out a summons for her master to get the money, and she had been attacked by this Hatfield, that he jogged her in the court, and when she had got the summons, he followed her out, and told her he would serve the warrant, and took her to the second house in the Old Jewry; that he said, my name is Hatfield, follow me; and she went up one pair of stairs; he said, follow me up another pair of stairs; she did, and then he fastened the door with a log of wood or timber, that then he threw her down, and used her in a violent manner; she shewed me indecent things not proper to speak in court; I am a woman that have had many children, and know the case well.</p>
               <p>You must relate the fact. - I found her in a very ill state indeed.</p>
               <p>In what respect was she in an ill state? - She had a great discharge of blood come from her in a most violent manner indeed, and likewise spitting of blood; I know it must be by ill usage.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was by ill usage? - I saw it in the proper manner where it came from.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was by ill usage, and not from a natural cause? - I am sure to the contrary; about three weeks before she was as all women in common are; I am confident it was from ill usage.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of any inflammation or any wound? - No; she complained she was violent fore, and not able to discharge her water by the violence she had received.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was the second day? - It was the third day that she opened it entirely to me.</p>
               <p>You know nothing more of this transaction? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150032"/>Was you examined before the Lord Mayor? - No; my sister was brought to-bed, and I was obliged to attend her, and my husband had broke his arm, and I was obliged to attend him.</p>
               <p>Did any body else lodge in the house? - Yes; a gentlewoman in the two-pair of stairs, who is always out of town.</p>
               <p>Whether the prosecutrix is known as the wife of Mr. Jenkins? - No, I cannot say she is.</p>
               <p>Have you known her called so? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Don't you know she passed as his wife? - No; I have no doubt they cohabited together.</p>
               <p>Did they lie together? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did they dine together? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did they breakfast together? - That is in course where there is a housekeeper; being his housekeeper she is obliged to attend to his diet.</p>

               <p>About five or six days before the last sessions the prosecutrix came to me, and told me, Hatfield had used her very ill; that he had carried her to a house repairing, and had lain with her; she wanted my assistance; I went with her to Hatfield; I told Hatfield what she complained of; Hatfield produced to me immediately a receipt, which her attorney had given him; seeing this receipt I went to her and asked what she meant by not acquainting me that there was such a receipt, and by not telling me she had employed a lawyer; she said, he has got the three guineas, and will not give me any thing: the receipt being in the name of Griffiths, I advised her to go to Griffiths: I saw Hatfield again on another occasion; I had a bill of his; I told him then that the best way was, though he might have paid the money to Griffiths, and he had not given it her, his best way was to give her something to make it up; Hatfield expressed his willingness to do that; I saw her again, and asked her why she did not make it up; she said, she had no objection; I offered her half a guinea or a guinea; she said, she had been two guineas out of pocket, and she would consider of it for a day or two, two or three days after that she said, she would take three guineas; I told Hatfield of it; he refused to pay that; I acquainted her with it: she then preferred her bill.</p>
               <p>Was any body present at this conversation between you and her? - The shoe-maker was present, and another person, at the time I offered her half a guinea or a guinea.</p>

               <p>About three weeks and one day after this affair happened, the prosecutrix was brought to me by one Mrs. Bartrum; she represented to me that Jenkins was her husband, and that it had made such an uneasiness between her and her husband, that they should never be happy more; she said, it happened on the Saturday week; she desired me to put it back a week or fortnight; I said, I would not swear a false thing for my grandmother; she then said, she never had mentioned the thing to any other woman, and her reason for not mentioning it to the lodgers particularly, was because she would not expose herself to her lodgers; she cursed Jenkins for a fool, and said, if he had not denied her, they should have got more than the guinea and half which the petty-fogging lawyer offered them; she never told me what condition she was in, nor gave me any account of it; she always particularly desired when she first conversed with me, that the thing should be kept a secret from Harrison.</p>

               <p>HARRISON. I heard the conversation between Mrs. Austin and the prosecutrix; I heard the prosecutrix say, that Jenkins was a fool to deny her as his wife; I understood that she meant by that it had spoiled the opportunity of making a market of Hatfield; this woman asked my advice, and told me that she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150033"/> had been told, that she ought to tell of a rape to some woman within twenty-four or forty-eight hours; but she was very unhappy, for she had never told it to any woman till she had told it to Mrs. Bartrum; she wanted me to write to Hatfield, to say that Griffiths had proved a rogue to her, that she had never received a single shilling, and did expect satisfaction from him.</p>

I have been at more expence than that; I have been three guineas out of pocket; I don't know whether my life may not be at stake; I will not take it; I want to have Hatfield prosecuted: Hudson said, call upon me at my house to-morrow, or this afternoon, and he said he had an action against Hatfield for a note of 20 l. and he should arrest him if he did not pay it soon.</p>

               <p>These parties were all before me on two different days; I did not chuse to determine the matter the first day, because Griffiths was not present; they said, that he was gone to Guildford, or somewhere in Surry, and would be present the next day; Griffiths came and behaved in a very insolent manner; when I got possession of this receipt, I asked him how he came to draw such a receipt; I apprehended that Jenkins or Clarke had applied to him: they told me at first that he said he would write a letter, and would take out an action against the prisoner; when I read the receipt, I observed it was worded in such a manner, that it was indecent to him as a man, and scandalous to him as a lawyer; I asked him if he had taken out a writ; he said, no action was commenced; I asked him how he should presume to say Jenkins's lawful wife, or any body's whore? I asked him if he knew she was his wife or his where; he said, no, he did not know that she was; I asked Mrs. Clarke and Jenkins if they had given him any authority for that; they said, they had not.</p>
               <p>Did Griffiths pretend he had any authority to make it up? - He said, he had; they both denied it; I asked him, whether he had ever given them any part of the money; I said, you have expressed it in the receipt to be in full of all demands and damages, for Jenkins and lawful wife: he said, he had kept the three guineas for the trouble he had himself; I told him, he ought to be struck off the list of attornies: the woman said, that she had told a woman that lodged in the house two or three, or three or four days after it happened.</p>

               <p>I keep the Flower de Luce: the prisoner sat down on a seat at the door; as soon as Mr. Jordan came into the house the prisoner asked how far it was to Highgate; I told him a mile; he asked how far it was to London; I said, about four miles and a half; I went for a bit of hay for the horse; when I returned it was gone; I got my horse out of the stable, and I pursued him over the common; I heard somebody striking a horse smartly; I came up to him, and stopped the prisoner on the horse; I brought him back; he attempted to get from me by pushing me into a ditch; but I held him fast; and brought him back; he said, four men put him on it; and then he said, the owner gave him leave to ride it.</p>
               <p>Was he drunk? - I don't know that he was; he shamm'd drunk when he came back; before the justice he said, he was a horse-dealer, and came from Cumberland on Monday morning; he said, he was in liquor.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into the shop, and asked to see some silk stockings; Mrs. Lovibond shewed him some; he asked if Mr. Lovibond was at home; she said, no; he said he would wait for his coming in: I was sent to look for my master; I did not like to go, as I suspected the prisoner; I soon returned; then I saw the prisoner making an attempt to put the parcel into his pocket; he saw me, and then he put them on the counter again; then he began fingering some hats, and then I saw him put that parcel into his pocket: as soon as he was gone out of the shop I told Mrs. Lovibond that he had taken the parcel; I pursued him: when I came up to him I said, you'll be so good as to leave that parcel behind you; he did not appear to hear me at first; I repeated it; then he took it out, and said there they are. Mrs. Lovibond came after him with two men, and desired he should be secured, which he was; he said he would go quietly; he was taken by a constable before the justice.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. There is no particular mark on them, except being marked with four threads; but I had sold them to a gentleman, and had wrapped them up in that paper.</p>

I first saw them in Corke-street; I followed them into Burlington-street, where I took three of them; I saw only three; I brought them back to the house: I charged them with the theft, they all denied it; but upon separating them Foster confessed that he had then a brilliant hoop-ring and the garnet hoop-ring in his pocket; he delivered them to me; another of them, I believe Ditcher, told me he had dropped ten plain gold rings in Burlington-street; he took me to the spot where they lay, and I recovered them. Upon further examining the window I found there was a greater quantity of plain gold rings and some paste rings lost; Ditcher acknowledged having sold a parcel of them; he said he had sold a ring to Mr. Rapley; then I took them, namely, Ditcher, Foster, and Clark, to Sir John Fielding's office.</p>

             or Malloy, as he calls himself now, was apprehended the Saturday following, and three brilliant diamond hoop-rings were found upon him; they were stolen on the preceding Wednesday; the biggest of the boys also sold a ring to Mr. Salmon. [The rings found upon the prisoners were produced in Court, and deposed to by the witness.] The brilliant ring had a private mark on it, the other ring and the ten found in Burlington-street have no particular mark; I believe them to be my master's. Ditcher said that Clark drew them from the window, through this hole, with a small black wire; they were all in the same story; they all acknowledged having part of the articles drawn from the window, and that Clark was the person that drew them thence. I promised Ditcher that, if he would confess the whole, I would endeavour to be his friend.</p>

               <p>I am a chimney-sweeper.</p>
               <p>How many of these boys have you? - Seven or eight, or more, I don't know how many; I have been in the country; my daughter has had the conduct of my business: I never knew any thing dishonest of them before this; they work from three, four, or five in the morning, and are generally done about one, then they go out to play in the fields, or about the door; they do what they will after two o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. You that are trusted with the breeding up seven or eight boys in your business, don't you think it is rather incumbent upon you to take a little care of their morals, to take care they are out of harm's way, that they don't run about the streets and get thieving? - They have always the afternoon to play in.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the reason that nine out of ten of them are thieves; that is a great grievance that has long called for redress; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150040"/> is a shameful thing that these boys at this age are left without the eye of any master to take care of them; and this is the consequence they are now brought here to answer for being thieves; it is a scandalous thing in the master, he is as criminal as the boys, they are generally kept starving, and left at their own will to do whatever they please? - There is no such thing as starving in our business.</p>

               <p>On Friday night, between 11 and 12, I saw a hackney coach stand at a house which was notorious for receiving stolen goods; I had a suspicion of the prisoners; Fry came out and opened the coach-door, and took out a sack with the sheeting in it; I asked what he had got; he said, what is that to you; I laid hold of the man and of the sack; the woman of the house took the candle away, and carried it into the back parlour; she put out the lights that were in the parlour; I asked Fry how he came by the things; he said, his wife, who worked for the people in the Tower, ordered him to pawn these things; this increased my suspicion: I put Fry and the sack into the coach; I searched Fry, and found this picklock key in his pocket (producing it); on Monday morning I went to the Tower to inquire into the matter; I tried the warehouse door with the key and that key unlocked it (the sheets were produced in Court).</p>

On Monday the constable came, and asked if we had been robbed; I told him we had; he said he had stopped a soldier who was in custody: I went to the justice's, Fry was sent for, the sheets were produced; they are the same that are now produced, they are his majesty's property;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150048"/> Fry owned he had been in the warehouse on the Monday before with a soldier of the first regiment, and said that the soldier had taken away two bundles of sheets; Fry was then upon guard, and so could not attend his accomplice out of the Tower, but he attended him to the gate, with the sheets in a sack; he said he had sold them, but would not confess for what money; he owned he had got in by means of that key. I was present at the examination of Price; he said he was called upon by Fry to assist him; that he went with him near the store-room, and held the sack while Fry put in the two bundles of sheets, and afterwards carried a bundle part of the way to the mint, where he employed him to call a coach; that he brought the coach into the Tower, and ordered the coachman to drive up to the mint; that he met Fry with the bag containing the linen; that he put the bag into the coach, and told the coachman he had no occasion to get off the box; that Fry got into the coach, and he returned to the barracks.</p>

I did not know the skins, but I knew the horns, they had J S marked on them, the S was reversed - they were two black Welch heifers, two years old or better.

               <p>I am a shop-keeper at Canterbury: on Friday the 22d of August I met the prisoner with a man that lives at Canterbury, that I knew very well, he called me by my name, and asked me if I wanted to buy a strong cart-horse; I told him I did not; he said, his friend had one that he would be glad to sell on reasonable terms; I told him that the next day was the public market at Canterbury, and he might sell it there; he asked me then to recommend somebody to him to buy it; the prisoner said, he was under a necessity of selling his horse to save his houshold goods, and that he was going into Kent to join with a man in driving a diligence; I told him if I could be of any service to him in selling it at the public market I would; he said, his horse was seven or eight miles off, and he could not recollect the man's name where it was, but described him to me; he said, he wished to have it nearer the market, but could not get it, because there was an incumbrance of 10 s. upon it for keeping; and that if I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150051"/> advance the 10 s. I should have the horse to sell and pay myself; upon this I went back with him to the Star, and wrote a note to the person where the horse was, who, I understood by the prisoner's description, was a Mr. Campher, that if he would let the prisoner and the other man have the horse, and call upon me, I would pay him the 10 s. he sent the note back, and said, he would not let him have it without I sent him the money; I sent a porter with the 10 s. and the horse was brought to the Star; I saw the horse there, and desired the publican to l et nobody have it till I came for it myself: on Saturday I saw one

I said, I did not know that there was any occasion for me to go, but I will go with you now; he said, then it was too late, that the horse was stole, and the man was off; that he had partly owned the stealing of the horse to him: I apprehended the prisoner in the town about a fortnight after.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of September I was sent by my master to fetch some cloth from Mr. Kempson's in Fleet-street; it was wrapp'd up as it is now; I believe that is the cloth: the prisoner came behind me, and snatched it from me, and ran away; I followed him, and called, Stop thief; he ran up Paul's-court in Huggin-lane, Wood-street, and run into a house; some people went in after him, but could not see him: I fetched my master; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Coming up Wood-street I heard a cry of stop thief; a gentleman and I who were walking together went into Paul's-court to see what was the matter; there were a number of people gathered together, they said the man that had stole the cloth was gone into an empty house; Mr. Anthony came and offered a guinea to the first man that should take him; upon which I went up stairs in search of him, and took him; he produced the cloth, and said he was sorry for his crime; I am positive the prisoner is the man; I sealed the cloth, and delivered it to Mr. Anthony (it was produced in Court) I believe that is the cloth.</p>
