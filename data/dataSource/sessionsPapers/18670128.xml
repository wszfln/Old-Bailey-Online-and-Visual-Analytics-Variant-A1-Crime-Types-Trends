                  <hi rend="italic">After the examination of the first witness</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of Newman, took objection to the form of the indictment. The Counts for receiving did not allege that the goods received were the same as the goods charged to have been stolen; and as the Act of Parliament only permitted Counts for stealing and receiving to be joined in the one indictment, where that was the pose he submitted that it was a bad indictment, and must be quashed.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that it was not a material averment that the goods should be the same, and referred to Reg, v. Knowlden, 9 Cox's Criminal Cases. He also submitted that if the Counts were bad for duplicity, all the Court could do would be to put the prosecutor to his election.</hi>

I am very unwilling to stop a case unless I feel clearly that the objection is a good one. This case is perfectly distinguishable from that just cited by Mr. Besley, because there the qualification was this:—The rule in criminal pleading is, that where there is a general jurisdiction, and the qualification is subsequently put upon that, it is not necessary to enter the qualification on the record. Here, the authority to proceed in the way they have proceeded is given by statute; then it must appear that the statute has been complied with, and that the case comes within the provisions of the statute. By the statute it is</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">provided that they shall be at liberty to unite these Counts in the way in which they have been united here, when they are the same goods which are both stolen and received. But that is not stated here. Therefore it seems to me that this statute would not assist the prosecution. I was disposed to think at first that the only effect of that would be that under the old law I should, put the prosecutor to his election, whether he would proceed upon the, Counts for stealing or the Counts for receiving, because informer times that was the course pursued; it was only said it was irregular to unite the Counts, and the Judges held they must elect upon which they would proceed; but I have looked at the 11 and 12 Vict., where power is given to unite together in the same indictment Counts for stealing and receiving, and I find in the preamble a sort of decal<lb/>ratory statement: "Whereas, according to the present practice of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction it is not permitted in an indictment for stealingproperty to add a Count for receiving the same, or in an indictment for receiving to add. a Count for stealing the same property." Therefore the Legislature have declared that it cannot be done except under a power given by the subsequent Acts, and this case not being brought within those subsequent Acts, I must act upon that, and hold that the indictment is bad, and cannot be proceeded upon.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 14, Southampton Buildings, and have been so for the last ten or twelve years—in Sep<lb/>tember, 1865, the defendant was introduced to me by a solicitor Mr. Jenkins—he came to my office with the solicitor—I first had an interview with the solicitor—he came for the purpose of borrowing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security of some money which was then in the hands of the Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery, which he was entitled to in right of his wife; that the sum was something 'like 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but, it then being the long vacation, he could not get the money, or the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280009"/>
               <p>money could not be got out of Court until after the vacation—he said the money was required for business purposes in connection with two news<lb/>papers which he had—he named those two newspapers—that I might know exactly how he stood in the world, I took down on a piece of paper the amount of his liabilities from his own mouth, the exact titles of the two papers, the <hi rend="italic">South London News and Croydoni Free Press</hi>, and other necessary information for me to judge whether he was involved or not—upon that I agreed to lend him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at ten per cent. per annum, pay<lb/>able at the end of three months, but I said, inasmuch as the amount in the hands of the Accountant-General could not be ascertained, it was necess<lb/>ary I should take time to inform myself of the nature of the fund; but, the orders of the Court being so lengthy and the expense to obtain them being so great, I required to have extra security, unless that expense was incurred to enable me to get the information, I proposed to advance 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once on that day, it being Saturday, as he wanted to pay his wages for these papers, or else they would die, and I took an equitable memorandum—I asked him about his interest in the two newspapers—he said he pos<lb/>sessed the copyrights of them—(he said nothing about the value of them)—upon that I advanced 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him my own cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I received the money from the client, in order that he might have the money at once—upon that this declaration was drawn by me, it is in my writing; I drew it out in the prisoner's presence, he read it himself, I took the precan tion to hand it to him and his wife, and asked them particularly to read it, and they both read it—this is the defendant's signature.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What have you done with the draft? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was no draft, I deny that I swore before the Magistrate that there was. (<hi rend="italic">The deposi<lb/>tions of the witness, being read, contained the expression, "I will not swear that the defendant did not strike out of the draft of the declaration the</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; "<hi rend="italic">also, The draft of the declaration is not here, but I can produce it</hi>") Allow me to explain that; I was confusing at that time the piece of paper upon which I took the different memoranda I speak of, as the draft declara<lb/>tion, but I recollect as well as possible that I wrote that off at the time, such was the urgency of the matter—I did not say before the Magistrate that I could not swear you did not strike out the words "registered and unencumbered;"I said, with respect to the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you might have struck that out, but you never struck out the word "unencumbered"—I did not afterwards, upon the Magistrate saying I could not sustain the prose<lb/>cution, say, "Then I will swear it"—it first occurred to me to charge you with perjury when I found that the papers had never been Regis<lb/>tered, and that you were not the sole and registered proprietor, and that you had encumbered it before to Mr. Atherton—I did not require to go to Somerset House to ascertain it, when you made a solemn declaration—Mr. William Henry Honey is the prosecutor in this case, that is all—if he states he knows nothing about it it is not true—he never said that I had not repaid him any of the money—I don't owe him anything, I have had transactions with him, I have repaid him this money, he has had the balance of 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after deducting the commission, I paid him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think it was out of the 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I received in November; I paid him very soon after it was received—I can't tell the date exactly—I did not go and get the rest of the money, because I can have it any day I like, it is attached—I know Digby and Atherton, formerly printers in Chancery Lane—they have nothing whatever to do with this prosecution, except that Mr. Atherton is a witness—they have been at my office during the time you</p>

               <p>brought several actions against them, to ask me for certain information connected with these popers—I did not know that you used to print your papers there; they told me so; they did not tell me that you discharged them for misconduct and making mistakes, and for embezzlement—you brought several actions against them, what for I don't know, none of which did you carry beyond the day of trial—I don't know that they placarded Croydon and the neighbourhood with libellous papers, I never saw one of: them—I began the proceeding for perjury as soon as I found it out—I found it out on inquiring at the Registry Office, Somerset House, and from information that I received; I don't know the date exactly, it is So long ago; it was after January, 1866, I think it was either February or March—you employed my firm to draw a deed; that was after this trans<lb/>action, I don't know how many days after, I was in the country (<hi rend="italic">referring to a bill produced by the defendant</hi>)—it was about five days after my first interview with you—my father was in partnership with me at that time—the deed did not turn out to be useless; it was your fault that it was not acted upon; we put in it everything we were instructed to—you refused to pay my bill, I sued you for it, you defended the action—the Jury did not find that I had been guilty of gross negligence in drawing the deed, and give you a verdict; I swear that—I sued you for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on another bill at the same time, altogether 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I recovered a verdict for something about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—as far as I remember, there were two actions, one on my own account, as I was alone in business then, and one at the suit of my father and I, when we were partners—we have judgments against you which have never been satisfied—I did not subsequently threaten that unless you paid it I would transport you for perjury—I believe my father went to your sister's house to tell her ofthe fact that we were going to prosecute you for gross perjury—I believe the trial at the Sheriff's Court was on the 17th May—that was not the first occasion upon which I spoke about the perjury—it was expressly stipulated at the time you borrowed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that you were to pay interest at the rate of ten per cent, per annum, and the cost of the preparation of the deed—Mr. Jenkins did not explain to me that the newspaper had been registered in the name of your sister—I never heard of your sister at that time as connected with the matter—this assignment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Mr. Jenkins's writing—I never saw it till the other day before the Magistrate, when you produced it, and never heard of it—I did not give Mr. Jenkins 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to give evidence in your favour on this transaction—I lent him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me an I O U, which he has since paid off—I did not get the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Digby and Atherton to give to him—I never had a sixpence from them—on the 23rd of January, after you had refused to pay this bill, I went to Mr. J. Bruton, printer, in Crane Court, Fleet Street—I think that was after I had got the 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I served him with a notice which was required under the mortgage deed—I don't know that in consequence of that notice he ceased to print the paper—I did not hear so from Mr. Honey—I did not go to Mr. Bruton's about a fortnight afterwards, and tell him I had made a mistake, and there had been 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—I did not send my clerk to say so—at the time I lent Mr. Jenkins the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was not in great difficulties—I have never been applied to a second time for money—my father had his certificate at that time—he was not off the rolls for a considerable time, never—my firm was never in solvent—you did not tell me this was one newspaper with two titles—I distinctly made a point of knowing how many papers there were, and I took it down on the memorandum at the time—you told me it was the <hi rend="italic">South</hi>

It appears to me, instead of your owing two bills here, you owe four; you owe two bills in favour of Westall and proctor, and two bills in favour of Westall, Proctor, and Co."—he said he only owed two bills, and that was with westall and Proctor—he said,"I am a bankrupt now passing throught the Court"—I said to him, "Who is your inserted these gentleman, Westall and Proctor, in your statement of accounts?"—he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "Have you inserted Westall, proctor, and Co., also in your accounts?"—I then said, "I had better go to Mr. Munday and ascertain the particulars of this, as he is living in the same street"—I went to Mr. Munday's office and had a conversation with a gentleman there, and after that, and acting upon what the defendant said to me, I advised him to make this affidavit—I said, "It appears that Messrs. Westall and Proctor have proved their debt; how they should have issued this writ I am at a loss to know, and I advise the affidavit to be drawn, inasmuch as Westall, proctor, and co. drawing as the en<lb/>dorsers of these bills must be a forgery, if you only owe westalol and proctor money"—that was what I said to him—I said that, having only inserted westall amd proctor, he ought to have inserted as well estall, proctor, and Co., and having omitted them and sworn to the correctness of his preliminary statement leaving out those two creditors when he ought to have inserted four, as they were two firms he might he indicted—after making that statement to him he swore to the affidavit, acting upon my advice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surviving partner in the firm of Bell and Black, of Bow Lane, City—the prisoner has been in my service about two years—he left on the 13th of October—his duty was to keep the cash and collect the City accounts on Saturdays, and keep the day-book—he was to enter the cash in his cash-book and hand the money or cheques over to me—I never saw this cheque whilst he was in my service—I never got the money, and it is not entered in any of our books—the books are there—I have been through them, and there is no entry—I find entries by the prisoner at the time—I discovered this about ten or twelve days ago—I believe this receipt to be the prisoner's writing (<hi rend="italic">this was signed F. F.</hi>)—those are the prisoner's initials—I have the book now before me in which the cash entries are made by the prisoner.</p>

Q.</hi> I think you have been very unfortunate in your clerks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner is the third I have indicted, and who have robbed us to a very large amount—Holroyd and Allan have pleaded guilty—Holroyd absconded at the time I made the discovery about him, on the 15th of November I think, subsequent to the affair of this cheque—Allan absconded about the same time—the prisoner did not give himself up as soon as the charge was brought against him—I discharged him before that</p>

               <p>for receiving money and not entering it in the cash-book—he did not abscond—he did not give himself up—I know nothing about his making any appointment with the policeman—Holroyd was my managing clerk between four and five years—the others acted under him—the other clerks were not in the habit of receiving money and handing it over to Holroyd—I am not aware of it—they ought to have acted under his direction, but I am not aware of their handing over cash, because it was not his business to receive the cash—any cash he received it was his business to hand over to the prisoner to enter, or to enter it himself in the cash-book—Holroyd was in the habit of handing over cash to the prisoner—the prisoner was the cashier—I know Mr. John Black, my late partner's son—owing to his not having business habits, opening letters and so on, which I would not allow him to do, he quitted the office—he was not in the office during this date—I think my partner died on the 2nd of October—Mr. John Black was not in the habit of coming there between May and October—I forbade his coming—Foale collected on Saturdays—it was Holroyd's duty to give him the list of debts that he was to collect—it was not the usual course of business for him to hand the money over to Holroyd on his return—I am not aware of his doing so—I was invariably there on Saturdays—I believe the entries of the sums he received on Saturdays are in his writing, not in Holroyd's—I saw one entry the other day in Holroyd's writing, which I imagined was in Foale's, but that was not his duty—it was contrary to it—I am not aware of it in any other case—I have not examined with a view to find out, because it was not brought under my notice—Foale had sole charge of the cash, and he alone I looked to for it, and if he collected money from any person it would not be to Holroyd or any other person in the office I should apply, but to Foale—I am not aware that there are Other cases like that, there may be—I do not know of any—I was generally there on Saturday when the prisoner returned with the money he had collected—I don't know about always, if there were any sums of importance I always was—I did not come there exactly in the morning—about two o'clock or between one and two—there was a locked letter-box—I opened that—I used to take Holroyd into the inner office to receive money or orders, and he entered the money in the cash-book, and the cheques or cash, or whatever it might be, he handed over to Foale—he was the person that had charge of the cash—after he entered it I got it from him again, for the purpose of banking, and any of those I always signed my name to—if there were cheques to send to the bank sometimes one clerk was sent with them and sometimes another—all cheques were paid into our own bank—I sent Foale to the bank—Holroyd had not charge of the cash at all—I am not aware of his sending Foale to the bank—I can't swear he has not—any money that was to be banked was made out on a slip of paper, and all the remittances I got I marked off—I do not know of Holroyd ever sending Foale with cheques to be cashed—I know now that both of them have done so—I did not then—I was half my time from the office—I generally left between five and six—I left Foale and Holroyd behind; not Allan, he had no business in the office except occasionally—I did not see him for months at a time—the others stayed till seven—it was the prisoner's duty to go on and collect accounts on Saturdays—I kept Holroyd in the office to settle and explain accounts—I was at the office on Saturday, the 6th October—I did not desire him to go and get this particular cheque—that would be Holroyd's duty—I don't know what amounts he had to collect that day—I do not see any entered as collected by him that day—I can't say whether I was there when he returned—I</p>

               <p>believe it was the day of Mr. Black's funeral—I believe I sent him to Stratford that day with a cheque for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to pay the men—that was at one o'clock—he might be gone two hours or an hour and a half—Mr. Dean's place is in Leadenhall Street, on his way to Stratford—the workmen at Stratford are paid about two—it may have been about eleven or twelve when I gave him the cheque—my usual time for coming to town on Satur<lb/>days was a little before eleven—I can't tell whether he received a list from Holroyd on that day—I can't tell whether he returned before six.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Russian merchant carrying on business at Alderman's Wharf—in the autumn of 1864 the prisoner introduced him<lb/>self to me to inquire whether some friends of mine who were coming from Siberia had arrived, and in June, 1865, he borrowed 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd of me on a bill of exchange—before that bill came to maturity, and before I knew whether it would be honoured or not, he came to me on the 30th of June, 1865, and said that he had failed, in consequence of difficulties in St. Petersburg, and had got a friend who had lent him some Russian rouble notes, upon the security of which he borrowed 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me, as there would be a loss in exchanging them—he produced them; these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here are seventy-five of them—they are in the identical packets as he delivered them to me—they are for five roubles each; the aggregate value is 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the exchange varies—I gave him this cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); he endorsed it in my presence, and it has been returned to me by my bankers, paid—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was in custody last month—I put the notes by in my safe box, where they remained some months, for an opportunity of sending them to my agent at St. Petersburg, as to change them in London there would be a loss—in November, 1865,1 sent them to my agent at St. Petersburg, but took the numbers first; they were returned to me in May, 1866, as forgeries—when I was at the Mansion House the prisoner was asked whether he had any questions to put to me, and he said that he knew the notes were forgeries, and that I knew so also—there is not the slightest truth in that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never borrowed the money on the bill of exchange—I never had the money. I had 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not on account of these notes at all, it was a different affair altogether. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It was specially given him on the security of the notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why did you keep these notes in your possession so long? why did not you change them directly and get the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a matter of no particular importance; they were put away in a safe, and remained there—I thought in the first instance that you might come back to redeem them, you borrowed the money for a few days and promised to repay it—I sent them to my correspondent to be realised, and if they had been good they would have passed into circulation like notes in this country—I did not say at the Mansion House that I sent them to the Russian Bank, it would be quite out of course to do so—I got them back without a letter; the person who brought them stated that they were false—he was a German from St. Petersburg—I do not know where he is—they were sent back in the identical package in which they were received, with the specification which was sent out with them—the German was directed simply to give me a message, because the possession of forged notes in Russia would be a very serious thing, and my correspondent would not like to commit himself by writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If he brought the notes he could substitute these notes for others. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not marked them, but I had taken a specification of the numbers, and the identical specification sent by me to St. Petersburg was returned to me in London—I know that the notes are the same, because the numbers correspond—I have no other means of speaking to their identity—I know that the notes I sent were forgeries, because these are the identical notes—I have been to St. Petersburg—you asked me at the Mansion House if I knew a rouble note, and I said that I did, but I did</p>

               <p>not say that I knew the difference between a good note and a bad one—I do not know that you were here in November, 1865—a letter may have been sent to the hotel at Charing Cross to know if you had come back, but I did not see you. and did not know you were here—I cannot recollect sending a letter there by a young Spaniard, but cannot undertake to say that I did not—I do not know that you were in London again in December.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) what you call a specification? A. Yes, it is in my writing—the number of each note was taken down on this paper, which was sent with the notes to St. Petersburg, to Herman L. Milroid, a merchant in a very good position there—the whole seventy-five numbers are here—the messenger was a person who came to me with a letter of introduction, and was charged to deliver the notes and state that they were forged—it was only a verbal communication—I then communicated with a Russian gentleman, who examined them, and after<lb/>wards with the Consul here—I afterwards heard of the prisoner in France—my clerks might take upon themselves to make inquiries about him without consulting me—I have carried on business in London twenty-five or twenty-eight years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a professional interpreter—I attended at the Mansion House on the examination of the prisoner, and interpreted the proceedings to him—after Mr. Harbottle had been examined in chief the Lord Mayor asked the prisoner if he had any questions to put—I inter<lb/>preted that to the prisoner, and he then made a voluntary statement, which I interpreted to the Court—he first asked several questions which I interpreted, such as, "When did you send those notes to St. Petersburg?" and, "Why did not you send them before?" and, "Did not you lend me money without security on one or two different occasions?" and several more—he then said, "I knew the notes were forged, but Mr. Harbottle knew it as well"—I asked him two or three times, "Do I understand you rightly?" he said, "Yes, I knew they were forged, but he knew it as well."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

I allowed him to send me a sample by post. It was such a good one that I thought he was making a fool of me, and that it was a real note; I told him so and gave him back the sample. He said, 'I will send a worse one, so that you may be con<lb/>vinced that it comes from our factory;' and he sent me one finished here faulty. The figure 8 in the number was out of its place, and another un<lb/>finished, or a skeleton, as he called it (both annexed to this letter).

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"I wish to say some<lb/>thing now. Being in this position now as a criminal, I wish the people around me to listen and hear something. I went to Mr. Harbottle, because I was aware that thirty or thirty-five years since he ran away from St. Petersburg for a criminal matter. He was in the service of Count Levashoff, as the manager of his estate. That was the reason I went to him, as I told him at once I knew him; I mean of course, not that I knew him, but that my father-in-law was serving under the same estate as him. Another person made my acquaintance, and then also of Mr. Harbottle, and that person is the first director for the forged notes. I was so well acquainted with that person that I was able to send to the government there a small piece of the type of the notes. As a proof of what I say being true, I refer to Mr. Klein. This was the reason why I wrote to the Emperor and the Minister about it, and in order to get into the confidence of this man, who had entrusted me with the bits of type. You will understand it was necessary that I should get into his good graces. It was arranged that I and Mr. Harbottle should become agents of this man. I did not buy or sell any forged notes, but Mr. Harbottle bought on several occasions. Mr. Harbottle had no business to speak of it through any person but me. I brought to Mr. Harbottle's notice the seventy-five rouble notes, but on another occasion I brought him another seventy-five before this transaction. This transaction took place before the time Mr. Harbottle states. On another occasion, prior to these two transactions, the gentleman gave Mr. Harbottle 200 of these notes. I did all this only because I had already written about it and thought it would be easy for me to discover more. I did not receive any money from the Minister of Finance, but afterwards I was offered money by him, which I declined to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280029"/>
               <p>take, as I wanted to serve the state only as a patriot. At a later period I received from the Minister authority that I might go in partnership with those people and make the notes with them. There are the papers about it in the hands of the officer. It will look extraordinary why Mr. Har<lb/>bottle should all at once give information about it, but the cause of this will be shown later. I can prove that the reason they have not found out the manufacturers is that the persons are beyond suspicion."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner addressed the Jury through the interpreter, stating that he was a Russian, and Mr. Harbottle an American; that he had previously received money from Mr. Harbottle without security, and that having put his name upon a cheque was no proof that he had given any notes as security, which he denied doing, and contended that his letters to the Emperor and to the Finance Minister spoke for him and not against him; that on arriving in Lon<lb/>don he introduced himself to Mr. Harbottle, who he knew had been guilty of criminal acts in Russia for some years as adminstrator to an estate there and running away with the money, the prisoner's father living on the same estate at the time; that ten years afterwards Mr. Harbottle was manager of the estates of Count Pascoff, brother-in-law of Count Levashoff, the prisoner residing there at the time, but, coming afterwards to London, found that Mr. Harbottle was doing business there, went to see him, after which he met Ra<lb/>detzky, who proposed that he and Mr. Harbottle should become agents for passing forged notes, Mr. Harbottle staying in London and furnishing the prisoner, who was to go to Russia, with notes, and was to send back wheat or corn; that he did not like to lose their acquaintance and confidence, seeing that he could thus serve Russia as well as the poor peasants among whom the notes were circulated; that Radetzky proposed to Mr. Harbottle to send a certain sum to Holland, but the latter refused to have anything to do with any agents fat Radetzky himself; that Radetzky then proposed to send a commissioner with a parcel to meet the prisoner at a certain post-office, where there was a thoroughfare, another commissioner coming in the other way, who was to identify him, to which the prisoner consented, but declined being a party to utter the notes; that three transactions took place between them, in one of which, at the end of 1865, he received 200 notes, and in another the seventy-five notes in question, but, not having mixed himself up in the sale of the notes, he could not say how many Radetzky sold to Mr. Harbottle or what Mr. Harbottle paid him; that he handed over the packets of 200 and the 75 notes to the commissioner, who handed them to Mr. Harbottle, and that when he asked Mr. Harbottle what he had done with them he said, "That is my business;" that Radetzky was manager of the company who issued the notes, one of whom, named Lepault, was tried for that offence in Paris, but acquitted, as it was proved that he only acted for political purposes; that those who received the notes handed them over to their agents, who never knew the makers; that in writing for notes to the manufacturer, Radetzky would send an address, not his own, and if there was one line on it the person would know to whom to deliver it, but if two lines he was to give it to a higher authority; that a man named Jankouski took him to a house and introduced him to some of the agents, one of whom was Holchester</hi> (Tried December 20th, 1865); <hi rend="italic">that on the 13th of January, when he was going to Paris, Mr. Harbottle said that he would give him some commissions, and gave him a cheque for</hi> 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he took three receipts, one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, in different names, telling him he was to pay the money to whoever brought him those receipts in Paris: that the receipt for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought by a man named Lievitz, whom he paid and took the receipt, but that the two for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did not come at all; that before going</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">to Paris Mr. Harbottle told him to come to him for some forged notes to hand to somebody there, which he promised to do but did not, not liking such a commission, which displeased Mr. Harbottle, as he afterwards told him; that he gave information in Paris to Prince Dolgorouki, now General Governor of Moscow, who referred him to the Russian Ambassador at Brussels, then in Paris, who requested him to obtain some of the forged notes and send them to him in Brussels, which he did, having obtained them by letter from Radetzsky under the pretence that he had a buyer for them, and a few days after<lb/>wards Radetzky sent over a person to Paris with more notes, demanding to tee the buyer, upon which he applied to the Consul, and the persons were cap<lb/>tured with the notes, which Mr. Klein could confirm; that he then wrote to the Russian Minister of Finance, and afterwards went and saw him at Berlin, who begged him to assist in discovering the manufactory, and with one of whose agents, M. Kamensky, he laid his plans, and who offered him money, which he declined, not having then been at any expense; that he wrote to the Minister for a power of attorney for his protection, and received in reply a letter from the Department of the Minister of Finance, which he pro<lb/>duced, dated November 14, 1865, and which stated</hi>—"I hereby authorise you to execute those plans, to enter into partnership in the manufacture of these notes, and, if necessary, you may as well assist in making the notes, and you are also to bring into this manufacture the controlling machine of which you spoke; in one word, you can do everything which you will deem necessary." <hi rend="italic">He further stated that the Minister sent a letter in English to the police, requesting them not to interfere with him; that he then obtained the confidence of the forgers, and was thus able to obtain some of their steel types, which he sent to the Minister and to M. Kamensky which Mr. Klein was aware of; that Mr. Harbottle's statement was not true, and that it was not likely he should put off forged notes with a man who knew him so well, and who was acquainted with Russian notes, and never did so; that the trial of Holchester would have induced Mr. Harbottlt to examine the notes, if he really had them, before sending them to Russia; that he saw Mr. Harbottle in November, who told him that he had been instrumental in getting the forgers in Paris into custody, and, as Mr. Harbottle was mixed up in the matter rather heavily, he concocted this plan with Radetzky to crush the prisoner.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Hertford Street, Lisson Grove, and am single—I was talking to the prosecutor in the Edgware Road on this morning with another female, and saw the prisoner come up with another man—he said to the other female, "You have a husband at home; you ought to be in bed with him, and not with this man"—he then said to the prosecutor, "You go away," and struck him with his left hand and snatched his watch with his right—there was an Albert chain to it—the prosecutor seized hold of him, and the prisoner struck him two more blows in the face—they fell together, and I saw the prosecutor snatch his chain from the prisoner's hand—the prisoner then ran away—I ran after him, and called out, "Stop thief"—I caught hold of him, and he wrenched my arm and got away—a person was standing at the corner of Star Street, who tripped him up, and he fell—the prosecutor came up and fell on top of him—in the scuffle another man came up, who the prisoner passed the watch to—I believe he was the same man who was with the prisoner before I caught hold of him—the prisoner struck me a violent blow in the face, and I let go of him—a policeman came up, and the prisoner was given in custody—I am quire sure he is the man—I never lost sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I come from the Office of Finance in St. Peters<lb/>burg—all these notes are forged, and this one, which was found on the prisoner, is genuine—they are five-rouble Imperial Bank notes, and circu<lb/>late in the kingdom of Russia—they appear to be struck from the same plate, and are the same as those I examined yesterday—the numbers are done separately—they arrange that afterwards—they are very well done—</p>

Hereby is enclosed from that mint five roubles silver."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Groeger's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>:—"I beg some paper to write down what I have to say. I am innocent. I have given information to the Emperor of Russia. Where I came from, in my native place, we can get plenty of forged notes there: we get them from a Jew named Moses. I was going to give information to the Emperor of Russia where these papers were manufactured. Moses told me he would take me to the manufactory where they were made the day after I saw him. Instead of that, he brought me to London, without my knowing where I was coming, and he got a room for me for eight days. I asked him to take me back again the Thursday the landlady was present. I went out with Moses to get provisions. Moses did not come again, so the landlady sent out her son for them. Moses thought I was going to inform against him, and put the notes between the bed and mattress. As far as I know, he put them there the Wednesday morning when the snow was. I was going on Fri<lb/>day evening to the Prussian, or Russian, or English Consul, or some one high in authority. I was going to give information that I was brought to London without knowing it, and that I was going to Berlin to find out where the notes were forged, and to ask the Russian Consul to send me back home. Whilst I was thinking of this I was taken into custody. If I had known that the notes were bad, then I should have taken them to the Russian Consul. If I was allowed I would prove that Moses dealt in these false papers, if the English government would assist me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Giveger's defence, being interpreted, was that, after writing the letter to the Emperor, he pretended to Moses that he wished to become a dealer at the forged note manufactory, believing that Moses would take him there, and he should find out where it was; that Moses brought him from Berlin to Lon<lb/>don, and when they were sleeping at Ghent, Moses, having found the letter to the Emperor and discovered from it his (Groeger's) intention to betray the man<lb/>factory, determined on ruining him, so that he could not harm him or the manu<lb/>factory and for that purpose placed the notes in the bed, and then gave information to the police, leaving him with only a penny, and unable to speak English; that Moses might be arrested in Borlin, as he lived at the house</hi>

                  </hi>. I have been a master mariner since 1838—I commanded a ship for Holdsworth before 1866, called the <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>, which was lost in a gale of wind off the west coast of Scotland—in March, 1866, I received a letter from Holdsworth—it is destroyed—it was to hold myself in readiness to take command of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, which his friends were about buying at that time—on the receipt of that letter I came up from Liverpool to London, and saw Holdsworth at his office in Fenchurch Street—I had known him before that in Liverpool—I saw Dean in Fenchurch Street, he was a clerk in Holdsworth's office at the time—Holdsworth told me that his friends were about buying the ship <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, that she was then on her passage from London to Newport, and was chartered for Shanghae, and that if the ship was purchased they would give me the command—he told me to hold myself in readiness—I went back to Liverpool and re<lb/>ceived a telegram or letter, I am not certain which, to proceed to New<lb/>port and meet him there—I destroyed that letter—I destroyed all my papers—I went to Newport, and there met Holdsworth and Berwick—that was on the 20th of of March, 1866, to the best of my recollection—I went from the Newport railway station to the King's Head hotel in a cab—on the way to the King's Head I met Holdsworth and Berwick—Holdsworth told me to drive on to the King's Head—I did so and met them there—I dined with them that day, in the coffee-room—Berwick told me that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280052"/>
               <p>had purchased the ship, and that he had brought a mate from London to go out in the ship as mate—he said that he had known him for some time, and that he was a very trustworthy man—he said his name was Webb—the conversation was about the value of the ship, what it cost, and I think Berwick told me it would cost him 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put her to sea, that they intended to insure her for 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they did not think she would ever reach China—this conversation was at the dinner-table in the coffee-room of the King's Head—they told me, in the event of the ship not reaching China, it would be worth 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me, that Webb was a man whom they could depend upon, and that I was not to interfere with him, he knew what he was sent on board for—nothing more was said daring that conversation—Holdsworth said that Webb was an eccentric character, but that I would have to sail with him, as the owners wished him to go in the ship—he also told me I had better insure my effects for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was after Berwick had left—I said that I would insure my effects for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my life for another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—I do not remember anything more being said—I was introduced to Webb the same evening by Holdsworth, who told me that he was a parti<lb/>cular friend of Berwick's, and that Berwick wished him to go in the ship—I received the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> papers that evening from the late captain—on the following day I told Webb to go on board and take charge of the ship, and take an inventory of her stores—Holdsworth and Berwick left at noon the next day—the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> was lying at Newport at that time—Berwick told me that he had been through the vessel a few days before, and said she was a very magnificent ship—I remained at Newport until the vessel sailed—Webb remained by the ship, but had liberty to go to London—that was three or four weeks after this interview—he went because the ship was neaped in dock, and the outer dock was dry—he asked my leave, and I gave it him—he was absent three days—shortly after his return Holds-worth came down to Newport, it may have been a week after—before that I had made a complaint to Holdsworth by letter—I received a reply from him—I have destroyed that letter—he told me to bear with Webb, as the owners wished him to go in the ship, and I was not to discharge him on any account until I saw him—when Holdsworth came down Webb took him into my cabin and was with him there about ten minutes—after that Holds-worth told me he had spoken to Webb, and I should have no further trouble with him—he told me he was put on board by the owner for a special purpose, and must go, and that it would only be for the passage out—a few days after that I saw Holdsworth at Newport, when he came down to clear the ship out—he handed me a bill of lading to sign for some cases that were on board, that came from Allsopp's—he had spoken to me before this about the cases, about a month before we sailed—we left the dock, and hauled out in the roads on the 15th of May—he told me that Allsopp and Co. had a dozen cases of hardware or fire<lb/>arms, I am not certain which, and that I should have ten pounds for carry<lb/>ing them as cabin freight—he gave me the ten pounds when he came to clear the ship—he afterwards gave me a brace of revolvers—the cases came that I was to carry in the cabin about ten days before we sailed—they were put in the store-room, and were addressed, "The Captain, Ship <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>"—they were marked in a diamond with a "W"—the cases were on board at the time he brought me this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to sign—I signed three other documents in blank; they were not filled up with the contents, but this one was filled up with the exception of my signature.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This stated the shipment on board the</hi> Severn, <hi rend="italic">from William Allsopp and Co., of twelve cases, containing</hi> 500 <hi rend="italic">revolvers</hi>, 200 <hi rend="italic">carbines</hi>, 200 <hi rend="italic">sabres, and</hi> 200 <hi rend="italic">swords, to be delivered at Shanghae, dated London, May</hi> 12,1866, <hi rend="italic">signed by the witness, endorsed "William Allsop and Co.," and in the margin was a diamond, with "W. S."</hi>) The cases were marked with an "S," as well as a "W"—I think Holdsworth said the contents of the cases were hardware—when he gave me the revolvers he said they were a specimen of the contents of the cases—they were small soft-wood cases, bound with iron hoops—I never received any instructions from Holds worth, or any of the prisoners, what was to become of the cases—they were not addressed to any one else but myself—the ship was well provisioned for a twelve months' voyage—Holdsworth managed the provisioning of the ship—he ordered the stores—when the ship was in the dock I had an opportunity of seeing whether the ship was tight and strong—she was perfectly tight, and newly coppered—the copper was carried twenty feet forward and nineteen and a half aft—that is quite as high as usual—she also had a wood sheathing which went about five feet above the copper amidships, and three feet above aft, which would cover all trenail holes in the outer skin of the vessel—the object of the wood sheathing is to prevent the galvanic action of the sea upon the copper nails of the vessel—it is fastened on by nails from five to six inches long—they are of yellow metal—they are not fastened on by trenails or bolts—when we hauled out of Newport the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> drew twenty-two feet six inches of water—about a week after we sailed from Newport Webb asked me whether he might put some hands in the boats, and I told him he could do so—the boats were all put in good order and fit for use—some time after that I remember Webb being in the store-room, where the twelve cases were—the store-room was in the after end, under the cabin, between decks—the cabin was in a house on deck—the vessel was American-built—after Webb came out of the store-room he said he had opened one of the cases, and found that it contained salt—I said, "You had no right to open the case"—he said he was anxious to know what was inside the cases, as he thought they did not contain arms, from their being so light—there was a little salt in the vessel, for the ship's use, which came from Liverpool—we had tolerably good weather until we were off Cape St. Vincent, where we had an ordinary gale of wind—it did not amount to a storm—we close-reefed the upper topsails—there was nothing in that weather, in my judgment, that would cause the ship to make water—she did make water, and increased her leakage very suddenly—that was about a fortnight before she went down—we had then been out about a fortnight—when we found the ship make water we pumped her dry—we had to pump her every two hours after that, till there was no water in her—the strength of the gale lasted about twelve hours; after that, we got to the trade winds—we had very fine weather then—we continued to pump her every two hours up to the 14th of June—the pumps sucked her every two hours—on the 14th of June we found that the vessel began to make more water, about four o'clock in the afternoon (she had made water before that)—it took some twenty minutes to half an hour to get the pumps dry, before they sucked—when the pumps sucked there was about seven inches of water in her—about four o'clock on the 14th of June I observed that the men at the pumps had a much longer spell than usual—they had been pumping an hour without suck—I then sounded the pumps myself, and found about twenty-six inches of water I think; I do not remember exactly—about eight o'clock that night Webb came to me on the poop and asked me if I would get the boats out, as the water was gaining on the</p>

               <p>pumps, and that the ship was going down—I told him I thought he had tampered with the ship—he said it was done, and could not he undone—I asked what he had done—he said he had bored a hole, and in the act of driving a plug in he had broken the plug in the skin, and he could not possibly stop it—I told him he was mad to do such a thing to a ship in such a position, so far off the land, and told him to go below and endeavour to stop it, for it was plain to every person that the ship had been tampered with—this was about eight o'clock—he went down, and was there about ten minutes—he came again to me, and said it was impossible to stop it, as the water had flowed over the hole—if a plug had been broken in driving it into the inner skin, that would let the water in—the timber would be a foot or fifteen inches thick where I suppose the hole would have been bored, and there would have been fifteen or sixteen inches of space between the inner and outer skin, and the water would flow in there—when he said the water had flowed over the hole I said he was mad, for he would destroy every man in the ship—he said it would be better to get the boats out at once, as there Was no chance of saving the ship—I told him I would not get the boats out till the morning, and that I would hold the ship up for the Cape de Verd—that was the nearest land, but we were 180 miles to leeward of the nearest point—they were to the windward of the ship, and we were to the leeward of the islands—I held the ship up for the islands, for Port Baya, which was the only port we could fetch, and continued pumping the water in the vessel until noon next day—I divided the crew into three watches, and kept them continually at the pumps—at eight o'clock the next morning some of the crew came to me and requested me to get the boats out—the water was then gaining on the pumps, about six inches of water an hour—I kept them pumping up to twelve or one o'clock the next morning, the 15th of June—about two o'clock in the afternoon I gave directions to have the boats got out, and told the mate to provision the boats for twenty days—he told me the breakers were not filled, and that he would fill them himself—they were ten-gallon breakers—there were either ten or a dozen of them—they had been ordered by Webb in Newport—the boats were provisioned and the long boat filled with men—I was in the cabin when the long boat was manned—it was loosed down by the tackle and allowed to go astern—several of the crew were in her at that time—after that had been done Webb came to me in the cabin and told me that the men were crying out that there were two holes in the stern, and that he would have to shove off—he then went away in the long boat and cruised off in the distance, ahead of the ship—the long boat never got astern of the ship after that, as far as I know—Webb came to me on board again about six in the evening, on the starboard gangway—I hailed him—I called him into the cabin and told him that the merest child on board the ship could see that she had been wilfully destroyed—he said that there was no fear, he could buy the whole of the crew over, and that he did not believe any of them had seen the holes—he wanted me to leave the ship, but I told him I would not, and that I would rather go down in the ship than face the exposure—she was in a sinking state then—Webb did not say anything then that I recollect—he left me and went away in the boat—the carpenter, the boatswain, and three others, my boat's crew of the gig, were left on board—I remained until half-past seven, and then by the persuasion of the boatswain and carpenter I left—the ship could not have remained above water more than an hour after I left her I should think—I did not see her go do down—Webb had the log-book</p>

               <p>very uneasy about it—about ten or eleven o'clock the next day I went again to Holdsworth's office—I found Holdsworth and Webb there—Webb said that the ship's company had seen him to the station at Southampton, and had given him three cheers, and that it was all right, and would never be found out—Holdsworth looked at the log-book, and said that it would be all right—Webb brought the log-book—Holdsworth examined the protest, and said it was all correct—Webb said that he had sounded the carpenter, that he had not seen the holes, and that no person but Kelly and the boatswain had seen them, and that they had threatened to report having seen them, because I had punished them for stealing rum, but that he had talked them over, and we should hear no more about it—Webb told me that Kelly had taken rum, but I had no other proof—I did not speak to Kelly about it—Webb spoke to me about Kelly having taken rum, on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>—some days after this I was again at Holdsworth's office, when Berwick, Webb, Holds<lb/>worth, and Dean were present—Holdsworth sent Dean out of the office, and took the log-book out of his desk, and asked me how it would do—before this I had had a conversation with Holdsworth about another log-book, about a week after I arrived—after that he told Webb he had better get another log-book, because it had been tempered with and re-written—Webb said that he could get a new log-book and copy it—I went to Liverpool im<lb/>mediately after that—I was away a week I think, and when I returned I saw this one (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>)—Webb was in the office at the time with the book—he brought the book there that morning, and he was turning down the leaves and soiling it by rubbing each page with his hand—it was all written then—it is in Webb's handwriting—Dean was sent out before the book was produced—I told them that the log would never pass muster, because any person could see at once that it was a new book, and had never been to sea—Holdsworth and Berwick both wetted the edges of the leaves and rubbed them—Holdsworth told me he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month to keep me going until the insurances were recovered—only Holdsworth and my<lb/>self were present then—this was about the time this book was produced—I last saw the book in Captain Downward's office—before I saw it there I last saw it at Holdsworth's office, on the occasion when they were wetting the edges of the leaves and turning them down—I got back to Liverpool on the 4th or 5th of November—in consequence of a communication I received on my arrival, I went to Berwick's house and saw him there—that was at the Willows, near Liverpool—that is the name of the street I believe—I think his house is 25, the Willows—he said that he had asked me to call upon him to let me know that he was going to London the next day to see how the business was going on, because he could get no information about it from any person—I told him that I thought the business would fall through—I also told him that there were inquiries about it, and that it was in the hands of Captain Downward—he said that he had had a letter from Holdsworth a few days previously, stating that the case was going on all right, that the underwriters wanted to compromise the matter—I told him that I was very short of money, that I had not had a remittance from Holdsworth lately, and I asked if he would lend me a few pounds—he lent me a sovereign, and said that he would send me a remittance as soon as he got to London—about three days after, Holdsworth came to Liver<lb/>pool, and gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he told me the underwriters were going to prose<lb/>cute me criminally, in consequence of my insuring my effects for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said my insurance was the cause of all the row—I told him I did it at his</p>

Holdsworth &amp; Co.—it says, "I have to inform you that I got my men on board last night"—in this letter I said I hoped to make a good run out—at the time I wrote that I did intend to make a good run out—the offer of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been made long before that—we had an ordinary gale and sprung a leak, and we were at work at the pumps every two hours—springing a leak is a serious affair, but making water is an ordinary thing—I made a pro<lb/>test with some other men at Pernambuco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is only a copy—that protest was taken from the log-book—it was prepared by the Consul's clerk, from information forwarded by me, by Webb, and by the ship's crew—there were some of the crew, I believe, who signed the protest, and there were some who did not; they were all about the Consul's office—I was sworn to the truth of that protest—the protest says, "Sworn on the Holy Evangelists"—I stated in that protest that on the 29th May there were heavy gales, and that there was a violent squall that lasted an hour—that was taken from the log-book—Webb wrote it in the log-book, and that part of it was copied—it is not true—I swore that on the same day the ship was completely buried in the sea, and that the boats were adrift and everything unloosed, that the ship strained greatly, and that there was three feet of water in the well, that she was making sixteen inches of water in the hour, and that she had sprung a serious leak—all this was untrue—I also swore that the hands were constantly at the pumps, and that we passed a wreck on the sea, consisting of orange chests and a variety of seamen's effects; that was true.</p>

               <p>cross seas—it is a fact that the vessel was hit in all directions—the decks were flooded sometimes, the fore-scuttle was smashed, and a little water got into the cabin—it is a fact that on the 29th of May the gale abated—it is not true that the pumps were almost constantly kept going—the vessel was pumped out every two hours—it is not true that we still made sixteen to eighteen inches of water, but it was sworn to by me—on the 1st of June the carpenter reported to the mate that he could hear water rushing into the forehold—the carpenter and mate went down with a light, but the carpenter told me he could hear no water—I said, "After carefully overhauling, they could not find water, although they could dis<lb/>tinctly hear water coming in"—I swore to that, but it was untrue, like the whole of the document; not the whole, but the greater part—I said that the loss of the vessel was caused solely by the wind and sea, and not through any default or neglect of any person on board—I was sworn to that, but it is not true—I do not remember, when I came to London and law Mr. Holdsworth, his asking how the vessel was lost, I told him—he did not ask me—I told him that we had had very bad weather, and that no doubt the original leak was caused by the vessel touching the ground when leaving Newport harbour—we had touched the ground when we left Newport harbour, in going out of dock—we were drawing twenty<lb/>two feet—I don't remember telling him we were in such a state that we should have lost the ship and all hands if we had attempted to round the Cape—I did not, just before leaving the ship, order the carpenter to throw overboard the handles of the pumps—I told him to unrig them—I said if we could not save the ship nobody else should—he said she was past saving, there was ten and a half feet of water in her—the carpenter pitched one of the pump handles overboard in my sight, not by my order—I don't think I gave any order—I did not, I swear I told him to unrig the pumps—that was for the purpose of disabling the pumps, so that no one else could save her, because had she been saved it would have been evident to any person that she had been scuttled—I meant by "doing honest" to the underwriters, to take the ship to China—at the time I told the carpenter to unrig the pumps she was past recovery, a steam-engine would scarcely have taken the water out of her then—I was not drunk when I got into the gig and left the vessel—I am sure of that—I had drunk some brandy—there were three bottles drunk—I had drank the largest share—I fell asleep in the boat, and so did we all—when I was lying asleep atop of the thwarts I was awoke by the water coming up my legs—I was decidedly not drunk when I got into the boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> as second mate on the 10th of April, 1866—I remained on board, except on Sunday, until the 15th of May, when she sailed—I superintended the taking on board of several cases, between three and four feet long, and seventeen or eighteen inches high—Webb said they contained carbines and revolvers, and I think he said sabres—Webb would be the person to keep the log, according to the course of the ship's duty—the log was entered on a slate in the cabin—I kept a log of my own—I did that for myself, to see how to keep a log afterwards—the entries of latitude and longitude would not be made on the slate—I should work the latitude for myself—courses and distances, and the rate of sailing would be copied from the slate—in those respects the log and slate ought to be the same—in those respects the ship's log and mine ought to be the same—when it was my watch I should make the original entry on the slate, and when it was Webb's watch he would make it—I should occasionally write remarks on the slate also—I should fill up the rate of sailing on the slate—I do not know any other source from which the ship's log-book could be made than the slate—the state of the weather and so forth was written on the slate at the end of every four hours, with observations; that is, the officer of the watch wrote it down at the end of every four hours—(<hi rend="italic">log-book produced</hi>)—my log was copied from a piece of paper, which was copied from the slate—the slate is not allowed to go out of the cabin—I copied it from the slate on to a piece of paper, and then took it to my berth and copied it in the book—the pieces of paper are gone, with my clothes, down to the bottom—on the 20th of May I find by Webb's account that the rate of the ship's sailing is a uniform rate of four knots, and never less than three knots an hour—that is not the fact—she went as much as six and a half knots sometimes, and sometimes as little as two—at the end of twenty-four hours all the entries on the slate were rubbed off, to make room for fresh ones—in Webb's log on the 21st of May I fined that the ship's sailing during the twenty-four hours was seventy-three knots, in fact the ship's sailing was forty-eight and a half knots in the twenty-four hours, by my own log-book—on the 22nd of May</p>

               <p>the logs differ considerably—on the 24th of May the mate's log shows the ship steering one course the whole day—she steered two different courses by my own log—on the 25th of May the courses and the rate of sailing do not agree with my log—neither do the courses nor the winds—nor do they agree with my log on the 28th of May—that is my own log I am looking at. (<hi rend="italic">Reading</hi>: "7.30 a.m., blowing hard, with clear weather; double-reefed the fore and main topsails, stowed the crossjack, and unbent the mizen-topsail. 9 a.m., stowed the mainsail and jib, set the main spencer. 11.30, blowing hard, ship taking in water fore and aft; passed a quantity of oranges and broken cases; bent, unfurled a new mizen-topsail. Noon, reefed the foresail, pumped ship every two hours.") That is all that day—the corresponding entry in point of date in the mate's log, beginning at 4 a.m., is (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>:) "4 a.m., barometer fell to 29 degrees, stowed foresail, blowing a heavy gale, which completely buried the ship by the sea. At 5 a.m. a heavy squall struck the ship, which split mizen-topsail and foretop-mast staysail, and blowed terrific for one hour; several seas, breaking on board, washed our boats adrift, and straining the ship greatly; sounded the pumps, and found three feet of water in her well; set on the pumps; pumped her out, and found she was making sixteen inches an hour, having sprang a serious leak; bands constantly at the pumps. 11.30 a.m., passed some wrecked sailors' chests, boxes of oranges, apparently not long in the water, pumps constantly going"—It could not have blown so hard as that, because it happened that while I was on deck a harpoon was fetched, in order that we might see if we could catch some of the oranges which were floating past, and if it had been blowing hard I don't think we would have cared for that—on the 29th of May the ship sailed four courses by my log—I don't see that she sailed anything at all according to the mate's log—there is one course put down in the morning, but no rate of sailing—the mate's report as to the weather on that day is: "May the 29th, Tues<lb/>day, p.m., blowing heavy gale and cloudy, with dangerous seas on ship, reaching under close-reefed topsails; shipping heavy seas and straining much. At 5 p.m. wind suddenly shifted to N.W. in a violent squall, causing a fearful cross sea, which hit the ship in all directions, flooding the decks and cabin, and smashing the fore scuttle. Wore ship, when she lay somewhat easier. Barometer rising. At 6 p.m. the gale abated; shook out a reef of topsails. Ship very uneasy, and kept the pumps almost con<lb/>stantly going. Split the crossjack. Midnight, more moderate, the sea going down, made all plain sail. A.M., strong breeze and clear. 4 a.m. ditto, ditto weather. 8 a.m. light winds and clear moon; ditto weather; people employed repairing damage; carpenter repairing boats. "The state of the weather by my own log was:" Tuesday, May the 29th, blowing hard, and a heavy head sea, with clear weather. 3 p.m., ditto wind and weather. 5.30, wore ship and set the mainsail and jib shortreef out of the foresail. 7 p.m., set the mizentopsail double-reefed. 9.30, short reef out of the fore and main topsails and spanker. Midnight, set the fore and maintop-gallant sails, shook reef out of the mizentopsail, and set the mizentop-gallant sail and crossjack; latitude being observation. 3.50 p.m., fresh breeze and bright clear weather; a good deal less sea on. 2 a.m., Bet the fore royal. Noon, bright clear weather, with light breeze; people winding sails; pumped the ship every two hours"—In the early part of the night before we had been constantly making more sail—she was pumped every two hours, it might be oftener than that—they would begin every two hours, and they might leave off in ten minutes, and then</p>

               <p>they would take ten minutes in the next two hours—she was pumped twice in every four hours—the entry in the mate's log about the fearful cross seas, which hit the ship in all directions and smashed the fore scuttle, is not correct; it could not have been so, or it would have filled my cabin, which was on deck, right in the middle of the ship, where she would take in more water than where he was—on the 30th of May the wind and rate of sailing in the mate's log does not agree with mine—there is two points difference in the wind, and the rate of sailing does not agree—on the 30th of May the mate's log says, "Moderate and clear, leak seems to increase"—that is represented to be at midnight, one o'clock in the morning—the nautical day begins at noon—my entry is, "Midnight, clear weather and light winds, pumps constantly working every two hours, ship making five inches in the hour"—(<hi rend="italic">the witness then read the entries of the 1st of June</hi>)—in the mate's log it states that we passed Madeira at ten that night—by my log we passed Madeira at two p.m. on the 2nd of June—on the 3rd of June the entry in the mate's log is: "P.M., fine breeze and cloudy; car<lb/>penter reported he could hear water in forwards. He and the chief officer went below with a light, but could not find it out, but could hear it plainly. The leak gradually increasing. 4 p.m., ditto weather. 8, ditto weather; all plain sail set.

A.M., fine breeze and clear. 4 a.m., ditto weather, 8 a.m., ditto; crew employed' repairing head gear; carpenters required Noon, lat., by observation, 29-30 N.; long., chron., 20-12 W."—My log says, "Sunday, June 3rd, strong breeze and clear weather; 4 p.m., dry wind and weather; 8 p.m., took in the spanker-jibs and staysails; 10, fresh breeze and strong weather; midnight, dark and cloudy, people vari<lb/>ously employed; latitude by observation 29-8 N., long. 19-12"—The rate of sailing in the mate's log is not right, according to mine, neither lati<lb/>tude nor longitude; I have no entry of the carpenter's repairing—I can't say who would have the morning watch on the 3rd of June; I can tell you whose watch it was when the mate went down, because if I had been on deck the carpenter would have reported it to me, and it did not happen in my watch—I heard something of it, but I did not hear the carpenter's report, because I was below then—I saw the mate pass my cabin door with a bull's-eye lamp; where he went to I don't know, I heard afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">The witness then read the several entries from the mate's log and his own up to the 14th of June, which differed materially in most respects.</hi>) If the pumps had been constantly attended to, as stated in the mate's log, on the 12th of June, I should have entered it in mine, and another thing, I should not have got any sleep, or very little; it was right in front of my door, and made an awful noise—the meaning of "pumps constantly attended to" is that they are sounded I should imagine; if that was all I should not necessarily hear it; he has not put whether they were worked at all, he only says "constantly attended to," in other places it is "constantly going"—on the 14th of June the entry in the mate's log is: "Midnight, heavy squalls; shipping water over all. A.M., light winds and cloudy; heavy cross sea on; ship making water fearfully, and rolling heavily; crew constantly at the pumps, only stopping to clear them of the small coal and cotton seed in the pumps. Noon, latitude 16-52, and longitude 28-13 west." My entry is: "Thursday, June 14th. Course, S.W. by S.; parrots, wind E.N.E.; fine clear warm weather, with light breeze; 4 p.m., ditto wind and weather; 7 p.m., light wind, part cloudy; 9 pan, fine breeze, and clear weather; midnight, ditto wind</p>

People employed fitting new upper foretopsail, foot-ropes, and securing fore lifts; one hand mending the cross jack; pumps worked every two hours, ship makes 4 to 5 inches per hour." If what is entered in the mate's log about the heavy sea, the ship making water fearfully and rolling heavily, had occurred, I should have known it and entered it; it did not happen—on the 15th of June Webb's log says: "P.M., moderate breeze and clear, thought the ship steered wild, sounded the pumps and found three feet of water in the well; set all hands at the pumps, which were frequently choked with small coal and cotton seeds. 8.20, the crew came aft and said they could not hold out much longer, and begged the captain to bear up for the nearest port. The captain told the men that he was making for Pernambuco or Bahia ever since the ship sprung a leak. Captain Layland called the officers and carpenter aft and consulted them; they were of opinion that the ship could not reach that port, but might reach Porto Baya. We then shaped our course for that port, but making small way, having too much water in her, which put her down very much by the head. Both pumps at work all night, the water still gaining on the pumps. A.M., fresh breeze under all sail, heading up for Porto Baya, but making little way; 9 a.m., the crew came aft, being exhausted and alarmed, requested the captain to put the boats, as they were afraid that the ship might founder at any moment The captain then again consulted his officers and carpenter, and they were unanimously of opinion that the ship could not reach Porto Baya, and that it would be advisable to get the boats out. Put water and provisions, in them. The chief mate and ten hands in the long boat, second mate with five hands in the first cutter left the ship at dusk, and lay to. 7 p.m., captain, carpenter, and boat's crew then left the ship, there being ten feet nine inches of water in the ship, and ship settling fast by the head. The cap<lb/>tain, carpenter, and boat's crew then left the ship, all three boats having a lamp on board. Captain ordered them to keep lamps burning and boats to keep together and make sail for Porto Baya, bearing about east-south-east, distance 2.50, latitude at noon 16.10 north, longitude chron, 27.50 W. "I have only half a day's log in my book:" Friday, June 15th, fine weather and strong breeae. 4 p.m., sounded the pumps as usual and found twenty inches in her; pumped for half an hour again; sounded twenty-one inches. 5 p.m., 22 inches, all hands pumping. 8 p.m., thirty-one inches. Half-past 8, hands came aft and requested the captain to bear up for the nearest port; hauled ship close to the wind and bore up for St. Vincent. Midnight, thirty-nine inches in her." That is all I have here—the same sort of weather continued the whole of the 15th—I cannot tell what time I left the ship finally—just about dusk I had gone into the cutter before I finally left, and was there five or six hours—I went into the cutter in the first place between two and three o'clock—it was part of my duty to get the provisions into the cutter—I did not see any attempt made to discover where the leak was—there was nothing in the weather to account for the ship making water so suddenly as that—I recollect coming alongside the ship to take the boy Jones on board—that was after I had gone into the cutter to superintend the provisioning of it—I observed something in the outer planking of the ship's stern, on the port quarter—I had been away from the ship about two hours and a half—I left the vessel finally about dusk—I</p>

               <p>splintered—the holes were from an inch and a half to two inches—they were in like a straight line—one might be a little lower than the other—. they were under the stern, about a foot and a half or two feet above the coppering, on the port side—I saw them three times at least; it was only when the ship plunged very heavily by the head that you could see them—Webb was at that time looking over the stern, almost right over where the holes were—I reported the holes—I said, "Two b----big holes in the stern"—Webb said, "Oh! it is nothing; it must have been the London carpenters that left a couple of trenails there," and that he would like to have a rope round their necks, towing them after the ship—the holes seemed capable of being plugged—if you bore a hole you can plug it—I recollect the carpenter getting into the long boat at half-past seven—I originally went into the long boat, but at that time I had got into the captain's gig—that may have been about four hours after I had spoken to Webb—Webb disappeared immediately after I spoke to him, and the first I saw of him after that was when he was getting over the side into the long boat—that might hare been a quarter of an hour after, or perhaps less—Webb took command of the long boat, and we cruised about the head of the vessel, but never went near the stern—we never went near enough to see the holes again—we never went nearer aft than the main gangway—I recollect the three boats going away—it was getting dark at the time we parted—the ship was then rather deep about the head, her fore-chains were in the water—the gig lost sight of the long boat—during the night I showed a dark lantern a couple of dozen times, and was never answered by either boats—in the end we were picked up by the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>—while on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> I had two or three conversations with Webb—the first con<lb/>versation was the day after we had played a trick upon a foreigner who was there, and who told the mate we had robbed him of a box of matches—the mate called me aft and asked me about it, and in talking I happened to mention that I saw two holes in the stern—I said a man said he saw two holes in the stern—he started and said, "Don't you believe it, for the ship was top-booted"—by "a man" I meant myself—what made me say that was that he said he would put some of them where they would not get out so easy when we got to Pernambuco—I then said I had seen them myself—he said if he was me he would say no more about it, for if I was to say it when we arrived in England he should prosecute me or anybody else that would say that; that if it cost him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would do it—the next time I spoke to him he asked me who broke into the spirit-room—I said I did not know, but, as all command was given up of the ship, and everybody was left to do as they liked, he could not be surprised if spirits were taken—he said, "Did you take any?"—I said, "Yes, I collared a bottle that was about half full of rum, and if there had been any more I would have taken it too"—he said, "Well, I don't blame you, I should have done it myself, but it is the boatswain I want to get hold of"—he might not have said those very words, but it meant the same anyhow—I said, "I know nothing about the boatswain, all I know is that I got half a bottle of rum," I did not care whether he knew it or not—the next conversation I had with him was in Pernambuco—the first time was on the night we left the ship—the second time was when he came to me drunk at Pernambuco, in the Consul's office—he said, "Kelly, if I was you I would apologise to the captain for what you have said, because I told him"—I said, "That is very gentle<lb/>manly of you any way"—he said, "He told the Consul, and the Consul gave him a letter to the Magistrates in England to prosecute you"—I said,</p>

               <p>"Well, I have said nothing that I know of to induce an apology, but if I have said anything I will apologise to him"—he said, "Well, I have interceded with him, and if you do apologise to him the matter will be allowed to drop"—I said, "Thank you"—so I went to the captain; the first time he was busy and would not speak to me—there was plenty to eat on board—there was no allowance of anything—there was far more than we had signed for, far more variety, in fact we lived in the forecastle a deal better than some captains—rations were not served out, we got them whenever we liked—I saw the ship's log-book on the captain's table—I carried it up and left it on the poop—the cover was blue—the book produced is nothing like it—I rather think the log-book of the Severn was rather thicker than this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman—I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> at New port as an able seaman—the weather up to the 14th of June was pretty tine—we had a breeze on—the weather was fine on the 14th—I remember the ship springing a leak about a fortnight after we left Newport—the pumps were used after that every two hours—the pumps sucked at the end of the two hours—I remember on the 14th of June asking the boat<lb/>swain for some seizing stuff, about two o'clock—it was Webb's watch—the stuff would have to be got from him—seizing stuff is a small rope—when I asked the boatswain for it he went to fetch it, but did not bring it back—about half an hour after I had asked for it I was ordered to the pumps—I went to the wheel about three o'clock on that day—the pumps sucked in about ten minutes—I remained at the wheel till four o'clock—during that time the ship was in a very good state—she was not suffering or labouring at all—I was on deck from two till four o'clock that afternoon—I can't say whether I saw Webb or not—about nine that night Webb came to the forecastle door, he called me;</p>

               <p>he said it was a bad job the ship springing a leak like that (the springing of the leak took place about four o'clock that afternoon), and I had better go aft to the captain to know what he intended to do with her—he said, "We are a long way from land"—I and the other men went to the captain about two or three minutes after he told us to go—the captain was in the cabin with Webb—Webb came out and asked what we wanted—I said we wanted to see the captain—he went in to tell the captain—the captain came out and asked us what we wanted—Webb was there too—we asked the captain, in Webb's presence, what he meant to do with the ship—he said he knew what to do with the ship, and he did not want us to come and tell him—he said he was running for the nighest land—we asked him how far it was, and he said a thousand miles—we asked him if there wad no land nearer than that—he said there was to windward, and we told him we had better hold for the nearest land—he told us to go forward, for he knew what to do with the ship—the vessel was hauled off about half an hour afterwards—I think she steered to the southward—the last time the men pumped was twelve o'clock the next day—when we left the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> we went in the long boat—we first got into the long boat about three o'clock in the afternoon, to rig her out, to put the masts and sails in—while I was in the long boat it dropped astern, and I saw two holes in the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—I saw them about half-past three, I suppose about half an hour after I got into the long boat—the holes were about ten or twelve inches above the copper, and six or seven feet from the stern port—they were on the port side—I saw Webb on the poop at the time I saw the holes—I sang out to him that there were two holes in the vessel's side—I sang out so as Webb could hear, but he did not say anything, he went forward—I saw the holes two or three times when I was in the long boat—they appeared to be auger holes—they appeared to have been made from the inside, because the splinters where the auger came through were hanging from the ship—you could see the wood looking fresh where the splinters came off—there was no tar on them, I am sure of that—I know what is the top-booting of a vessel—these holes were through the top-booting—I got the long boat up to the port side of the vessel, and Webb went into the boat, and we cruised about—after I had called Webb's attention to the holes we did not go astern of the vessel again—we went a good bit off the stern—we did not go near enough to see the holes—Webb commanded the boat—after we had been cruising about for two hours we returned to the vessel—Webb went out of the boat for an hour I should say—after his return we stopped alongside for a bit, and then went away for good—we went to Pernambuco, and I came home in the <hi rend="italic">Edith Marian</hi>—I did not see any cause, except the holes, for the ship making so much water, as we had fine weather all the time—the living on board was very good.</p>

               <p>was on the poop when I heard it said—it was my watch, and I was attending to some sails belonging to the long boat—I was ordered to get those sails ready just after we had left the Channel—I was just finishing the main sail, that was the last sail to be done, but I had finished two others before—the long boat was ready for sea at the time, that is as soon as the sails were bent—when I heard of the leak I was ordered to the pumps—I continued to pump from four o'clock to half-past five, when I went to tea, as I had to relieve the man at the wheel at six o'clock, I believe that the water still gained—they continued pumping until eight o'clock, and then we went aft to the captain, to know what he was going to do—I had seen Webb before I went aft to the captain—he came into the fore<lb/>castle and called out for Bray—I did not hear him speak to Bray—the forecastle on that ship was on deck—it was a house on deck—after they came back Webb said something to me and the crew, and in consequence of what he said I and several of the crew went aft to the captain's cabin, Webb came out and brought the captain out, I asked the captain what he was going to do, and had some conver<lb/>sation about the distance from land—he said he knew what to do with the ship, and we went back and started at the pumps again, we worked at the pumps till eight o'clock the next morning, the leak was still gaining, and we went aft again to know what the captain was going to do—they would not let us do anything at first; then the mate came forward and told the boatswain to get the tackles ready for getting the long boat out, that was on the morning of the 15th, the tackles were got ready in order to get the long boat out—it was about half-past one or two when the long boat was lowered over the side, the other two boats were astern at the time—everything was ready for the rigging of the other boats, the sails and masts were in the boats ready to rig them—the water had not been put on board at that time—about three o'clock I got into the long boat myself, after all the provisions were passed in by the direction of the mate; she then dropped astern in order to be rigged; after she had dropped astera my attention was drawn to the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, by Henry Bray—I observed two holes in her stern as the ship heaved in the water, on the port side, I could only see them now and then, they were below the water's edge, and as the ship rose and fell we could see them—I should judge, from the appearance of the holes, that they were fresh, because we saw the splinters outside—I should think they were not more than eleven or twelve inches above the copper—I have heard what the sheathing or top-booting of the ship is—I cannot tell how high she was top-booted—the holes were through the top-booting—after I had seen the holes I sung out, I saw Webb looking over the taffrail—I sung out about the holes, three or four of us sung out, Webb went away from the taffrail after we had sung out, but where he went I cannot say—after we told him what we saw he said the carpenters in London had left out two trenails, I saw Webb again two or three minutes after, be appeared aft, and ordered the boat to be hauled up alongside—he came on board the boat then, and we cruised about, but we never went astern again, we went all about the ship for a mile or a mile and a half until the captain hailed us to come back again—the sails were all fitted in the boat when we were cruising about, she had taken in her water, she took it in from the mizen rigging of the ship, she had all her provisions in then, the provisions were put in just after twelve and the water at the same time—when we came alongside after cruising about the mate got out and remained in the vessel for some</p>

I am an able seaman, and shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> at Newport as such—on the 14th, the day before the ship foundered, it was very fine weather, and on the 15th the weather was also fine—I left the ship at about two o'clock to get into the long boat—Webb, the mate, sent me there—when the long boat was astern of the ship I saw two holes in the port side of the ship, that was about half-past two—they appeared to be from the inside to the outside, because the splinters came outside—on my seeing the holes I said something to Bray, who called out to Webb, who was aft on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, "Hole over the stern"—the mate said it was only a trenail out of the stern, and then went forward—Webb came and took charge of the long boat, and we cruised about—after he took charge of the long boat we did not go near enough to the vessel to see the holes—we left the ship for good in the evening—after that I was picked up by the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> and taken to Pernambuco and shipped home in the <hi rend="italic">Edith Marian</hi>—I have been a seaman thirteen years—there was nothing in the vessle, with the exception of the holes, to cause her to make water in the manner stated.</p>

I am a Swede—I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> as ship's carpenter—I have been a ship's carpenter and used to the sea for about ten years—I shipped in her the day before she left New<lb/>port—I think it was on the 17th that she got under weigh and proceeded to sea—at the time she left she appeared to be seaworthy—I remember having a breeze or some rough weather—that was about a fortnight after we left Newport—we were then close to Madeira I should think—the rough weather did not last long—after that the water had to be pumped out twice in a watch—by pumping it in that way we got the pumps to suck each time we pumped—that continued till the 14th of June—by that time we had got considerably past Madeira—before the 14th of June, and after the rough weather, the mate gave orders about pumping—we had to pump her twice in a watch—I told the mate one day, about two days after the rough weather, that one of the sailors said there was a leak in the forecastle—that was after we had orders to pump out twice every watch, and that if he liked to go down with me I would go down—we went down with a light, and made a careful examination, but did not see any signs of a leak—I did not hear any water coming in at all—after that we continued to pump as before, which kept the water down—on the 14th of June I sounded the pumps, and found water in her—that was about two minutes to four—up to that time they had pumped twice in a watch as before—when I sounded there were twenty inches of water in the ship—upon that we immediately set to work at the pumps—twenty minutes after I sounded her again, and there were twenty-one inches of water in her—the water was then gaining upon her—the crew kept pumping till the pumps drew clear water—I had not known of anything at the time which would be likely to occasion the sudden leak of the vessel—Webb came up and I told him about the leak, that it was very bad—that was in the carpenter's shop—he said, "Never mind that, carpenter; it will soon be over; it will soon be all right again, and I hope she will reach her destination in China"—he said, "When we get there I shall try and get you into my new ship, which I am going to be captain of, and I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more in a month"—I had shipped to go out and home in the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—on the evening of that day orders were given for the purpose of getting the water-kegs ready—they were</p>

I will get them punished"—that passed between us on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>—I told him what I had done before I left the ship, by the captain's orders; that was the unrigging the pumps—I asked him if there could be anything done to me for that—he said, "No, no, carpenter, you are all right, but keep still, and do not say anything to any one"—it would not have been possible to have saved the vessel with so much water in her, even if the pumps had not been unrigged—I went to Pernambuco, and remained there two or three days, and was one of those who made the protest—I did not give any instructions for the protest—I first heard about it at Pernambuco, at the Consul's office, before the paper was brought—I was there from nine or ten in the forenoon to four o'clock in the afternoon, standing waiting the whole time—the protest was read over in my presence by a boy about fourteen or fifteen years of age, and I signed it after the captain and mate—I came home in the <hi rend="italic">Oneida</hi> with the captain, mate, and some of the crew—the steward and I met Webb the night before we came from Pernambuco—he asked us to have a glass of beer—I said, "If you please"—he took us into a beer-shop, and asked me if I was able to make the boatswain drunk the next day, so as to make him unable to go with us in the <hi rend="italic">Oneida</hi>—I said, "I will try, but I have no money"—he then gave me two milreis to make the boatswain drunk—he said he wanted to make him drunk next day, because he did not want him in the mail boat, as he had too much to say—the boatswain is Thompson—I did not do what I could to make him drunk—I went into a public-house myself, and spent the money—Thompson did not get the benefit from it; I think he had a glass of rum before we started, but I do not know exactly—the boatswain came home in the same vessel as I did—after I came home I received a message from Lloyd's Salvage Association to go to them, and I went and told my story.</p>

I am a shipbroker and owner, of 126, Fenchurch Street—my agreement for the purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> was early in January, 1866—I had to pay down 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills, and the rest was to be secured on mortgage—there were some subsequent pay<lb/>ments—a part of the arrangement was that certain bills were to be handed over from Sir John Pirie—when I bought the ship I chartered her to Sir John Pirie—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original charter, dated 9th January—I agreed for the purchase of the vessel in December, 1865—after I pur<lb/>chased the vessel I expended money upon her in London; her hull was repaired and she was re-metalled and caulked—I saw her myself; she was a sound good ship for her age—she was American built—she was coppered eight or nine feet high when I bought her, and I coppered her to nineteen feet; when we put her in dock we found the metal was not good enough, so we re-metalled her—she was top-booted before I bought her—I knew Holdsworth in January, 1866—I met him at Liverpool some three months previously—after I had purchased the ship we met in the street, and he asked me if I had anything to sell, as he had established an office in London—that led to some conversation—I said I had nothing to sell but a vessel under charter, that she was a cheap ship, and had an excellent freight, and he might perhaps be able to do something with her—he said perhaps he could do with her, and asked me the particulars, and I gave them—I did not at that time give him the particulars of the charter-party—he went down to Liverpool and wrote me some letters—I saw him in London again occasionally—he said he thought he could get two friends</p>

               <p>days after that Dean came to me about the salt I had warehoused, but before that Dean came to me and said they required me to sign the charter-party for Shanghae—I made a remark at the time, "When will this matter end about this ship?"—he said there would soon be an end to signing any documents—I then went to Holds worth's office, and signed the charter-party—he had been to me several times—I believe Dean was present, but no one else—after that Dean came to me about a message from Messrs.

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a ship and insurance broker at George Yard, Lombard Street, under the style of Smith, Simpson, and Co.—I have a partner, Mr. Simpson—I have known Holdsworth about six years altogether—I have known Berwick about a year later—I never knew Webb—I never saw him till the day before he was arrested—I knew Holdsworth and Berwick in business transactions—I had more than one transaction with them before this, acting together, jointly interested—I have frequently been in the habit of advancing money on ships in my business—I have done so on ships in which both Berwick and Holdsworth were inte<lb/>rested—we had advanced money to Berwick in connection with a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Jane Brown</hi>—that has been paid—in the beginning of 1866 I saw Holds<lb/>worth in reference to the purchase of a vessel—it was about the beginning of March—he said he had a friend who wished to purchase a ship—he did not mention the ship at that time—he said he had come to us as a broker, to divide commission; my partner then came in and he asked him what kind of ship it was—he said it was a very fine ship, it was well adapted for China, that she could sail exceedingly well, but that he could do nothing unless we relieved him of a mortgage which the ship had on it—he then informed us that the ship was already chartered at a high freight for Hong Kong, or Shanghae—we replied that was an impediment to the business—he said that should not make any difference to us, we should have our com<lb/>mission, provided we would only take the mortgage on the ship—we said, "Well, who is your friend who is intending to purchase her?"—he told us that he was a respectable man, named Thomas Ward, of the firm of Thomas Ward and Co.—we said, "What is the amount required?"—I did not know Thomas Ward and Co. myself—I then said that we would inquire about him—he said he would require of us about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—subsequently to that there were a number of interviews, which took place more with my partner than with me—Ward's name was mentioned by Holdsworth when we saw him again on the subject—we refused to take Ward—Holdsworth then said he knew some one we were acquainted with who was much better able and would become surety for Ward, and then he named Mr. Berwick—we replied, well, he had lost a ship not long ago, and we supposed he was in funds—he said, "Yes, he can pay over 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately"—after two or three interviews a verbal arrangement was made that we were to receive 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, that we should receive a bill drawn by Mr. Holman, of Topsham, the manager of an insurance club there, for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were also to receive two-thirds of the freight and to stand as mortgagees for from 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the ship and freight—it was merely a verbal guarantee, but it was confirmed by the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being brought to us—we would not deal in the matter unless we had the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280092"/>
               <p>arranged that the mortgage should be properly prepared—the owner of the ship, Thomas Ward, was to be the party to it—nobody else at that time, but subsequently Thomas Berwick joined in the mortgage on the freights and policies—after that I think there was not any fresh arrangement—there is always a great deal of pro and con before business of this kind is com<lb/>pleted—I think I have told you the substance of the arrangement—we were to advance from 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—Berwick became security at the time of the conversation about the value of the ship and the amount required—it was said that Berwick would come forward as security and would pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before the business was quite completed we found that they had not enough money—bills were given to us for the repayment of the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was repaid by me to Holdsworth afterwards, on receiving these bills—I have bills in my hands representing 3764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these bills are accepted by Berwick—upon receiving those bills we repaid the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been advanced to us in cash by Holdsworth, because they required money, in order that he might be enabled to fit the ship out—I presume that arrangement was with my partner at the time the money was advanced—these are bills drawn by Ward upon Berwick in our favour, deducting tho 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there is 2764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on the bills—we held them as security—we asked for some other security, and we had some land in Liverpool assigned over to us—this is the mortgage on the ship, and here is also the other document, signed by Berwick—as the ship was to be mortgaged to us by Mr. Ward, Ward signed this for the purpose of carrying out that arrangement. (<hi rend="italic">The documents were put in and read: both were dated the 19th of March</hi>, 1866.) We had at that time 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash in our hands—we then agreed that we would accept drafts of Ward's for 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to secure which we had first of all the mortgage of the ship, and, secondly, this deed, by which Berwick binds himself to repay the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not pay the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all at once—we did not restore it on the 26th of June—we hardly knew what the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—I rather think it was part of the original agreement that the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced was to be repaid—my partner can tell you—by the arrange<lb/>ment in March the bills for 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were to be aocepted—I have not the bills here—they passed out of my hands into Croshaw's, but they have been paid—probably my partner has got them. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Simpson.</hi> I have not got them—they are in our office—I suppose they have been paid.) The 3504<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was secured by mortgage of the ship and the guarantee of Berwick—I was aware of the fact that there was 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. freight, which had been paid for by drafts of Sir John Pirie and Co. to Sweet, and handed over by him to Croshaw in part payment—they never came to our hands—by the terms of the charter-party other drafts were to be given by Sir John Pirie, which we received—they amounted together to 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that made up the whole of the freight payable under the charter-party on this side of the water until the coals arrived—these bills, amounting to 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were paid to our firm, and to that extent went in re<lb/>duction of our debt—we paid Mr. Croshaw the amount of his mortgage on the 30th of March—we paid 2884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—that cleared off all Mr. Croshaw's interest in the vessel as mortgagee—that amount was in addition to the acceptances—he also received 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that left the ship free so far as he was concerned—Mr. Sweet arranged to sell the ship for 6500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something else, afterwards—the documents were handed to Holdsworth after the arrangement entered into between me and him—I have not myself since paid any money to Mr. Sweet—the drafts repre<lb/>senting</p>

               <p>the 2276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debt still owing to Sweet on the sale of the vessel were delivered to Holdsworth I believe—our clerk was sent with Holds<lb/>worth to Mr. Sweet's office—those drafts for 2276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were paid—we re<lb/>ceived 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from John Pirie—the balance owing to us, as nearly as I can understand it upon the whole transaction, is 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were fur<lb/>ther advances to make up the 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—further advances were asked for by Holdsworth after the original agreement was entered into, and it was arranged that an equitable mortgage should be given to us on land, I presume that was about the middle of May—I cannot produce the memorandum of agreement made on the 22nd of May, 1856, between Thomas Berwick of the one part, and Smith and Simpson of the other—I did not know that it would be required—I do not think it was produced at the Mansion House—it is at our solicitors' office, Messrs. Ellis, Parker, and Clark—we made further advances to Holdsworth later in the year in respect of the ship—I have got a mortgage deed here—I think the matter stands in this way, on the debit side: To our acceptance, due the 18th of September, 2276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; same date, cash paid for fire insurance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Donaldson and Son, notaries, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Pirie, 691<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that does not mean a draft—that was paid to Croshaw, as part of the balance of the account—on the 22nd of May, to Thomas Ber<lb/>wick, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Holdsworth asked for that—that was part of the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a few days afterwards 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Thomas Berwick; then our charge for commission, five per cent, on 5623<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. freight, 284<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; commission on acceptances, 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and our account due this day, 428<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is a former account I presume, not on former transactions—I think they are payments for premiums principally, because the following is a premium for insurance, 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remember now the 428<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was an insurance, in settling the transaction Pirie and Co. said that that ought to be paid; it was the amount of insurance on the advance of freight; and after some consideration we agreed that that should be done by an acceptance of ours—the 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount of premiums on the insurance of 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., their balance of interest up to that time, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some petty expenses, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 4669<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the credit side we received of Fraser and Co. 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 8th of May—that was brought to us by Holdsworth—then we credit the draft of Holman and Sons, which I spoke of previously, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less the discount, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 662<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that leaves a balance of 3656<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that closes the account—the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not appear on either side of the account—our book-keeper superintended the keeping of those books—I did not look at them—Mr. Simpson did—there is Holdsworth's signature to this account in our books: "Settled and agreed on behalf of Thomas Berwick and Self, Lionel Holdsworth"—the account is headed, "Thomas Berwick, Esq., and owner,. of ship <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, in account current with Smith, Simpson, and Co."—I think there is a memorandum at the bottom with reference to the 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount of freight received from Pirie and Co.—it is not one of the items I have given, it appears separately on the account—that closed the account of money transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look again at your account, and see whether it is not now further reduced from 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by payment of those drafts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I see a further amount of cash paid to Croshaw of 2885<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is merely a memorandum—I did not think it necessary to read it—against that balance we still hold the equitable mortgage—the amount of insurance effected by our orders was 5500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the exception</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280094"/>
               <p>of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was effected through Mr. Fraser—Mr. Lupton did the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for us—the policies are here, with the exception of the one done at Bristol, which our solicitor cannot lay his hands upon.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During these transactions that you have spoken of did you see Berwick at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We never saw Mr. Berwick—the two payments made for him were made to Holdsworth—they were cheques; I have not got them here; they will be brought here, we have them—all I can say is that we gave certain cheques to Holdsworth—the purchase price of the vessel was 6500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—besides that there were many expenses on the vessel, so as to make her more valuable before she started; I do not myself know what they were; we did not make any expenditure upon the vessel; but necessarily upon a large vessel like that there would be very considerable expenditure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had known Mr. Holdsworth as a ship and insurance broker I presume? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in his dealings with us in these matters he acted as broker only—in the conversa<lb/>tions about this vessel he asked if we could look out for a good <hi rend="italic">Coolie</hi> charter; that would be in the Chinese seas—she was consigned to our agents at Shanghae for sale—we were also instructed by him, if we failed in a <hi rend="italic">Coolie</hi> charter, to get a guano charter from the islands out in those seas; we were instructed to look out for whatever was profitable for the ship on the other side; a guano charter was certainly in contemplation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about authorising you, as mortgagees of the vessel, to sell her if you could at Shanghae, in case a good price could be obtained for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We held a written authority for that purpose, not only in the mortgage, but a separate authority—the vessel was bought at a reasonable price; she had a very good freight; if sold in Shanghae she would have realised a large profit; we thought she would fetch at least 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, from our experience of having sold other vessels there—Holdsworth has owned two ships, of which we were mortgagees—one was not sold in China, she went out to China for the purpose of sale, but she was caught in a cyclone and condemned at Hong Kong, after performing various voyages from China; the other was sold in London—we have no security whatever of any kind or nature of Mr. Holdsworth in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—we looked at him only as the broker in the transaction—it was not at our request that he signed Berwick's account; it was done with our book-keeper; we did not know of it, either Mr. Simpson or myself—Mr. Crewe is our book-keeper; he will not be here, he has been for a long time in declining health, for two years past, and he has had an ague lately—he is so ill that he can hardly sit up in his bed—we received two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Berwick—Holdsworth forwarded us 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on the 20th of April—it is usual to insure over the value of the vessel; it is usually considered that we should insure double the value of a vessel to make ourselves safe—that is to secure ourselves against a variety of incidents—sometimes underwriters fail—in this case 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is gone in the Accidental Death Company—the principal reason is that of bottomry, which overrides our mortgage—we consider it necessary to over-insure to make ourselves safe as mortgagees; it is not the habit of owners to insure a vessel for double the amount.</p>

What led to that mortgage was, that the whole of the money was not forthcoming to pay up the mortgage to Croshaw—our advances were over the 2500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we had to pay Croshaw 2884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was a little more than we ex<lb/>pected, and Pirie's bills only realised between 2200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they amounted to 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and realised about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than that; the consequence was, we had to come under a larger advance than we ex<lb/>pected in the first instance; we were pressing Holdsworth for money to pay up the account due to Croshaw, and, as there was no money forth<lb/>coming, we got what security we could, and we took this—Holdsworth arranged with us that we were to have an equitable mortgage for security—he said he could give us that, when we were pressing him for money; he said, "Well, there is 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to Berwick from Holman (that is the Topsham man); I have no doubt I can get that made over to you"—then he mentioned this land; until he mentioned it we did not know of it—we paid Croshaw on the 14th of May, and we got this mortgage on the 22nd of May—we did not get the whole of the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we got a bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with a discount off, 662<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see Berwick at all with reference to this transaction, it was all managed by Holdsworth.</p>

               <p>we wanted to negotiate them—Holdsworth brought the bills to us—they were not accepted then; they were brought by Holdsworth, he said he would get them drawn by Ward, and accepted by Berwick, if we would make up our account—the body of the bills is in Holdsworth's writing—they are drawn by Ward and accepted by Berwick—those bills, amounting together to 3774<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., represent the amount of our account, as we had made it out up to the date of the bills, in addition to interest for six months—an account was made out for the purpose of ascertaining the amount between us and Holdsworth; I have it in this book—on the 25th of June the amount owing to us was 3656<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—we added six months' interest on the bills—this account does not go later, it is made up as you find, the interest account to the 13th of September, which was the day our bills were due, and it is credited and debited to that date—on the 28th of December the amount due was the amount of the bills, 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—in cash on the 25th of June, 36505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing—on the 28th of December the bills for 3764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were due, and 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was added for interest upon them—the bills correctly represent the amount due to us on the 28th of December—it is now more than 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 25th of June it was less—these bills have been negotiated, and have never been paid—this is my endorsement upon them—Berwick has found no money for the purpose of taking up these bills—the insurances for 5500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were effected, not on the freight, on the ship—all those transactions were managed by Holdsworth—I saw him several times on the matter—I never saw him at his office—I never was in his office—he always came to us—I do not know Dean—I never heard of him, and never saw him, not in any capacity—I did not know that such a man existed.</p>

Allsopp agreed to purchase as by the contract, which I then marked A.—I did not give it to Cozens, or produce it at that time—I did not show him a contract at the first interview, when I made the statement to him—I did not know then that he was a detective—the second statement was not to the same effect—at the second statement Cozens produced the contract I had made with Smith for the fire arms—I beg to explain; the first statement was made in ignorance of who Mr. Cozens was, and Mr. Griffiths, and I did not tell them the correct way of it, not knowing who they were; but the second statement, after I knew who Cozens was, I spoke everything as it happened—the first statement was erroneous, a falsehood; and afterwards I told them the second statement, the truth—I did not tell him I had never seen the invoice, but believed the signature, "A. Smith," to be in Smith's writing; I told him I had never seen the invoice produced to me—I will not say whether I told him or not that I believed it to be Smith's writing—I do not think I told Cozen's at the first statement that I had seen Smith write letters—he did not produce the invoice and allude to it till the I second interview—I did not on the second interview tell him I had seen Smith write letters, I forget whether I did at the first—I do not think I told him I had seen him write letters once or twice in my office—I told I him I had some of his writing at present in my office—I said that be<lb/>cause I did not know who Cozens ivas—I said that I had never seen I Smith before he called on me last April, and that I did not know where he resided, or where the articles were stored—I never saw the arms, but I stated to Cozens that I did—I told Cozens that in the spring of 1865 I had a small vessel put into Milford Haven in distress—it ended in Captain Taylor being recommended to me as the captain of my vessel—I do not remember telling Cozens that the transaction of the arms with regard to Smith was the only one I had with him—I said at the first inter<lb/>view that Smith appeared to me to be between forty and fifty years of age, about five feet seven, rather short, and speaking with a mixed Irish I and American accent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that he had a pale long face, with lightish hair and whiskers, and was shaved under the chin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought Mr. Cozens was asking me improper questions and I told him anything that came into my mind—I have not been doing that to-day—I am not in the habit of doing it—I thought he was very impertinent in doing it, and did not know who he was—I told him I thought Smith had been dealing in fire arms with the Confederate States, as he gave me to understand he had large quantities in addition to those which he had sold to Allsopp—not a word of that was true as regards Smith.</p>

               <p>not true that I had bargained with Smith and that he told me he would send them off, but those were my instructions—I did not sign Smith's name to any document that went down to the railway—I did not sign it to a shipping order: I swear that—I was formerly a ship master and afterwards a ship chandler—I have not been successful in business this last fifteen years—I have failed and have been bankrupt—a question was not put to me in one of my examinations at the Bankruptcy Court about my signature to a certain bill of exchange—I never denied my signature—the light first dawned on me that Cozens was a detective, at the second interview I had with him—he did not say that I was deceiving him—he did not say, "I have found you out;" nothing of the sort.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mind, he is coming, be careful what you are about; did not he say that he had found you out, and that you had told him a parcel of lies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember his saying so; I am almost sure he did not—I do not remember his giving me a short time to make up my mind whether I would tell the truth; I say that he did not say so to me—I do not re<lb/>member his saying that if I did not tell the truth by the following Monday it would go hard with me, and I should not know the last of it till the end of my days; he did not say anything to that effect—I came up to London after that and sought an interview with Mr. Holdsworth—I told him I had been waited on by two persons about some salt—I did not tell him I was sorry I had implicated him about some salt—I never told him I thought of destroying myself—I did not tell him before I went back that I seriously thought of destroying myself—I had nothing to fear in the matter—I may have asked him to give me some money—I did not ask him for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had had transactions with him in business and the balance was in my favour—I asked him for some money and got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sent me—I did not tell him that I had been spoken to by Cozens, who had insured my freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him that Cozens or some person had said to you that not only would you have your freedom insured, but your claim admitted on the Friend-in-Need Insurance Company for the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not about my freedom—nothing was said about the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi> that I re<lb/>member—Cozens said nothing whatever to me about my claim on the Friend-in-Need for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi> being satisfied.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition was here read, at Mr. Ribton's request as follows</hi>:) "I am one of the detective officers of the City of London Police Force—I received a warrant from the Mansion House Justice-room on the 18th of October, instant, for the apprehension of the prisoner, describing him as Joseph Stansfield 'Dean, otherwise William Allsopp, and since that time I have been seeking him—I have called at his office, at No. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Leadenhall Street, and failed to see him there—the name of William Allsopp and Co. is on the front door, and on the door of a room on the second floor back—there was a reward of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered for his apprehension, and from information I received I went with Serjeant Bull to Malpas Road, New Cross, Surrey, and there found the prisoner—I was admitted into the house, where I saw him—I asked him if his name was Dean, and he said it was—I told him I was a police officer, and had a warrant for his apprehension, and I read it to him—he said he knew about it; he had read it in the newspapers, and if I had not come down that evening he would have surrendered this morning, and told all about it, he was willing to give every information he could, and that all he did was for Holdsworth, and by his direction—he said he would tell me what took place: that Holdsworth came to his office with three bills of lading, and asked him to fill them up, and at the same time snowed him a railway receipt for twelve cases, containing pistols, firearms, and swords, which had been sent from Liverpool to Newport, and shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> (I had not said anything up to that time about the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>)—he said he</p>

               <p>consented to do the filling-up, and he did so, and endorsed the bills of lading; then Holdsworth requested him to write a letter to Messrs. Fraser and Co., the insurance agents, that the goods might be insured; that he wrote the letter, and Holdsworth took it away with the bill of lading; that he had never seen the cases, and did not know what they contained, except what Holdsworth told him, that he knew nothing about the Caledonian In<lb/>surance Company, and that he was to receive 2 1/2 per cent, on the sale of the goods, but he had not received anything—I said to him, "Are you trading under the name of William Allsopp and Co.?" and he said he had a right to trade under what name he liked—he said further that he had been previously a clerk to Holdsworth, and that how he first heard that there was something wrong in the matter was that he was in Holdsworth's office one morning (a fortnight ago), and he picked up a letter and read it, and it was from a person in Liverpool, named Pryde, directed to Holdsworth, stating that he had, or was, going before the Magistrates in Liverpool, to make a statement about those cases; that the next day he met Holdsworth by appointment in St. Paul's Churchyard, and that Holdsworth then told him that there was a great row about those cases, and that we should all get into trouble, that he was "off," and that he (Dean) must do the best he could for himself—I took him to the station-house, and on searching him found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his possession"—That is all true—a reward was offered for Berwick's apprehension, and from information I received I went to 28, Approach Road, Victoria Park, with Sergeant Bull and Captain Down<lb/>ward—I asked for Captain Berwick, and was admitted—when I went into the room Berwick was sitting down dining at a table by himself—he said, "Mr. Dupre?"—I said,"Yes"—I had sent in that name—he said, "Take a seat"—I took a seat—I said I was sorry that I had called upon him when he was dining, but I hoped that he would excuse me; and at that moment Sergeant Bull and Captain Downward were let in by the front door and came into the room—I said to Berwick, "My name is not Dupre, Mr. Berwick, my name is Webb; I am a detective officer, and you must con<lb/>sider yourself in our custody"—he said, "What for?"—I told him, "For being concerned with Joseph Stansfield Dean, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Allsopp, and others, in casting away and destroying a ship named the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, which sailed from Newport about the month of May last"—he said, "You are wrong alto<lb/>gether, I don't know such a ship"—I said, "Why, you were the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>"—he said, "You make a mistake, I never saw her, I never was on board her, and know nothing at all about it"—I said, "You will have to go with us"—he said that he should not go unless I produced the warrant—he afterwards said, "Where is the captain? is he in custody? where is Holdsworth?"—I said, "Perhaps you know better than I do"—he said, "I suppose I do"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found some 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on him—this was on the 30th of October—I took Dean on the 29th, and Webb on the 25th—Sergeant Bull went with me to arrest Webb—we went to Providence Row, Commercial Road, Whitechapel, and saw Webb in the road—I told him we were two officers, and should take him in custody for being concerned with Holdsworth and others in scuttling and casting away the ship Severn, which sailed from Newport—he said, "I did nothing of the sort; it is not likely, when I had 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property on board, and lost it all; it is not likely I should do such a thing to the ship"—I then searched his house, and brought away some papers—he requested his wife to go to Smith, Simpson, and Co., and tell them he was locked up at the station, and he wished them to come and see</p>

               <p>him; he told her to go to 12, George Yard, Lombard Street—I received two warrants for Holdsworth's apprehension, one on the 18th of November and the other on 8th October—I searched for him in this country between the 8th of October and the 18th of November—I had a man watching at his counting-house all day—I know his lodgings—I searched there, and could not find him—from information I received I went abroad to look after him—I went to Hamburg first, and afterwards to Gottenburg, in Sweden—I found that a person named Thompson had been staying there—I saw Mr. Pollaky cut out of the visitors' book this slip of paper. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Oct. 30th. No. 5; J. Thompson, gentleman, Hamburgh.") No. 5 was the number of the room he stayed in at the hotel—I had a photo<lb/>graph of Holdsworth, and showed it to the persons in the hotel; and in consequence of the information I received I went to Basle, in Switzer<lb/>land, and found Holdsworth there on the 29th of November; I read the warrant to him; he said he was quite willing to go back to England with me, he would not give me any trouble whatever—I did not know Ber<lb/>wick by sight—I took Captain Downward for the purpose of identifying him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Victoria Street, Hackney—on 29th January, between three and four in the afternoon, I went to Low Layton to see some empty houses, my mother's property—when I got there I heard some one coming down stairs in one of the houses—I unlocked the front door, and heard somebody run out at the back door and slam it—I followed through the house and saw the prisoner getting over some rails—I took hold of him and asked him what he did there—he said some carpenter, who he met in the street, brought him into the house to mend a door, and he did not know his name or where he lived—there were only footmarks of one person having gone into the house—I missed a brass tap from over the sink, and some keys, which were taken from the prisoner in my presence—at the station I said, "I believe these are mine"—he said he took them to try them to the doors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When we got back to the house did you not ask me how I got in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you did not tell me that the carpenter had left the door open, nor did I say, "It is impossible, as there has been no carpenter employed there lately"—the policeman did not press me to own the keys and the tap, so as to give you in charge—this tap is covered with white<lb/>wash—I had seen it a week or two before—'the policeman laid hold of your hand, which was partly in your pocket and partly out, and took out a number of skeleton keys—fifty or sixty keys were found on you, from which I picked but these six—I cannot swear to them, as about forty or fifty of them resembled one another very much, but mine were rusted through being in an empty house—I could not get into the other house because the lock had been tampered with, but I have broken in since and found the taps and keys arc gone from there—I had not been there for several weeks—I did not see you at the second house.</p>

               <p>on him—there were altogether fifty-seven door keys and eleven brass taps—Davies picked out six of the keys and one of the taps—I took these six keys and tried them to six locks in the house, and they fitted—I compared the brass tap with a place over the sink which had been forcibly cut, and it corresponded exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant, and reside at 7, Loampit Vale, Lewisham—the prisoner has been in my service as carman for about a month or five weeks—on the 28th of December I sent him with a van and horse to the Great Northern Railway, for two and a half tons of coals, and gave him twenty-five empty sacks to put them in—he was to take them to Mr. Tomkins, a customer of mine, at Varney House—I went on to Mr. Tom<lb/>kins, and was there when the prisoner arrived with the coals—I asked what he had got in the van—he said twenty-two sacks, and three riders—the gardener counted them, and he found only one at the top instead of three; there were only twenty-three altogether—the prisoner then said, "Oh! I forgot, I shot two sacks over the weigh-bridge at King's Cross, as I had two sacks over weight"—I said that was a palpable falsehood, and insisted on having every sack weighed; he had delivered one—each sack should weigh 2241b.—they weighed the regular weight—the prisoner said the twenty-three sacks was the full complement of the two and a half tons—the two empty sacks were there.</p>

I am a coal porter at the Great Northern Railway, King's Cross—I remember the prisoner coming there for some coals on the Friday; the ticket was directed for two and a half tons—I gave him twenty-five sacks; each sack would contain 2001b., or a little over; we generally give over the weight—some sacks weigh heavier than others; some weigh fourteen pounds, and some only four—I weighed the coals at the wharf or bays, where he loaded, and then he would go on to the weigh-bridge, where Toynton is clerk—I am not aware that I ever knew as much as a hundred pounds overweight in twenty-five sacks.</p>

I beg your pardon, I made a mistake, I had to shoot two sacks at the weigh-bridge because I was overloaded"—I said, "I never heard of such a thing," and I and his master said we would have them all weighed—they all weighed legal weight—he had shot one already—twenty-three sacks were delivered.</p>

You must come back with me and see what is the matter"—I took him back to Hanover Street, and there met Sergeant Hann, who charged him with being concerned with three others in stealing this lead—Metcalfe said, "That remains to be proved"—I took him to the station and examined his hands—they were very dirty and marked with lead—I found this life preserver on him when I apprehended him—I did not know Hogwood previously—he passed</p>

I am a physician, of Kirkdale, Sydenham—Mrs. Ellery and I arrived at Sydenham Station on the 15th of December, having with us seven boxes—I hired a cab to convey my luggage from the station to my house—on my arrival at home one box was missing—about ten days afterwards that box was brought to me by the police, in a broken condition—all the valuable articles had been abstracted—there were various books and articles of wearing apparel, all of which have been identified—I was present when the articles were packed, and know that such articles as this chemise and flannel petticoat were put in the box—the mark on the chemise is "Ellen," that is the name of my wife—I identify distinctly this book of Moore's Poems—there is a name now in it,"Mary Ann Carey," and a leaf has been torn out that name has been inserted since I lost it.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Gardner, of 7, Great Wild Street, Drury Lane—last month I was sitting with William Thomas Moore, my son-in-law, who keeps the Flying Dutchman, Wells Street, Camberwell—on the 17th of December the prisoners White and Green (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) came in; Green called for a pot of half-and-half and gave me a bad sixpence, and then called for a second pot and paid with a good six<lb/>pence—the prisoner then called for a pot and gave me a shilling—I put it in the till, which I had previously emptied—there was nothing there but the two sixpences that Green had given me—Green's wife then came in for a pot of half-and-half to take home in a can—she was not going to pay for it—I said, "You must pay if you please"—she said, "I am well known to Mr. and Mrs. Moore"—I said, "That has nothing to do with me"—I asked Green if he had got any money—he said. "No," and the prisoner said, "Here, I will pay for it," giving me a bad florin, which I took to my daughter—I gave the prisoner the change, and he and Green left together—the woman may have left a minute before—I then went to the till, exa<lb/>mined the shilling, and found it was bad, and the other also—I afterwards gave them to a policeman—I knew where Green lived, and sent to hit house.</p>
