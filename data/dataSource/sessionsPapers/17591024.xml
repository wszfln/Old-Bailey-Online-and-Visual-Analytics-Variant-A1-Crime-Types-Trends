               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jarrat. He was my servant: I employ'd him to fetch water in a cart, and other business about the yard. He was missing. I sent four people to look for him. They took him, and I was with him before the Justice of the peace; there he confess'd he had taken 20 Guineas and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it missing from?</p>
               <p>Jarrat. From out of the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your counting-house join to your dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Jarrat. No, it does not. He produces a bag. This is the bag that the money was in. Justice Pell deliver'd it to me with 16 l. 10 s. in it, which was taken from the prisoner at the bar.</p>

I told him, I came to see for him. I charg'd him with this robbery. I search'd him there, and found but a groat upon him. Going along in Whitechapel he said, he would walk no farther, he would have a coach. He would confess nothing, but said he would tell me in the morning. I deliver'd him up to Mr. Burill a constable in Whitechapel, and there left him 'till morning. When he was before the Justice he owned he had taken 22 l. 11 s. in my hearing; and he had given one woman 4 guineas, and another seven. We search'd him, and found 14 guineas and 16 s. and 6 d. and a 9 s. piece concealed under his backside in his breeches, in a bag.</p>

I was acquainted by Mr Brown my partner in a building, that a house belonging to me and Mr Richardson, as assignees of one Lee a bankrupt, was stripped of some lead, and he had a suspicion of Barber, and his labourer one Ellis. Mr Brown had examined Ellis, we took up Ellis first, he confessed, that he and Barber had taken it away. Then we took up Barber, and before the Justice they were there together. Ellis confessed he and Barber took it and carried the lead at five turns to the house of Speight. Ellis went three times and Barber twice. Barber contradicted that, and said, no Tom, I went but once, and that was with a little bit that I carried in my apron. Mr Speight was fetched there. He owned he had bought lead of them, but he contradicted Ellis as to the point of time of the night. I can assert the quantity is upwards of three hundred weight by the quantity that is missing. Speight did not own what quantity he had brought, but that he had bought lead of them two or three times. We got a search-warrant and searched Speight's house, (he is a Shoemaker and keeps an old iron shop) we found no lead there, we have not found any since.</p>
               <p>Q. from Barber. Did you ever suspect me in any thing of this sort?</p>
               <p>Hulbert. I never knew him 'till he came to work at this building. At first I thought him a diligent man, but latterly I did not think him so, by his behaviour to his master.</p>

            . Barber and I were at work at Knightsbridge at a building. I carried some lead from there to Westminster for the owner. Barber asked me, why I did not save a little for myself, and told me where I might sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of lead being taken away from Mr Hulbert's house.</p>
               <p>Ellis. Yes, that was in Tyburn-Road: Barber said, the man that owned the house was broke and run away. This is about six weeks ago. We went there: he watched below while I went above. I went and took away the middle gutter and some other lead. When I threw it down he cut it in small parcels with a brick-axe. After we carried it to Speight's house, we got there I believe between ten and eleven at night, he lives in either Bird or James-street, by Grosvenor's-square: we made five turns of it, I carried three, and Barber two; Speight was at home, (we had sold him some small quantities before) he paid Barber that night two half crowns in part of pay.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lead weighed ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. I cannot tell the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What per hundred was you to have for it?</p>
               <p>Ellis. They gave us a penny a pound for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Ellis. No: the first parcel came to about four shillings and six-pence, the whole of the three last turns came to five shillings and some odd half-pence. I was taken up about three weeks after, and was before the Justice with the two prisoners. There I declared the truth, though I was not examined so regular as I am here. The prisoner Barber said there, that he carried a piece of lead in his apron, and Speight said, he had bought lead of us, but not that came to so much money as I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Barber. He owned before Justice Welch that I was at work at the time he took away the lead ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. That was at another time; that was with regard to taking two troughs off another house.</p>
               <p>Speight. When I was before the Justice, Ellis did not know me.</p>
               <p>Ellis. I knew him as soon as he came in at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Q. from Speight. Did you sell it to me or my wife?</p>
               <p>Ellis. He was present, and he gave Barber two half-crowns in part of pay that night, and he paid me four shillings the first turn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Ellis. Barber kept the two half-crown pieces, and I the other.</p>

            . I have known Speight about twenty years: he has lived in my house six years, in James-street Grosvenor-square; he is a Shoemaker, and his wife keeps a broker's shop, sells old iron, and the like. I have ask'd him the price of things, he has always call'd his wife. I don't think he attends that business. I know he has been gone 6 or 7 months, but I took no notice of his going or coming. His wife paid me at that time. I believe he returned about a week before he was taken up: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240006"/> know it was a very short time; it could not be weeks but days.</p>

            . I had an action out against Speight on Nov. 6. 1758. I employ'd an officer; he absconded. I renewed the writ several times, but could not take him. I went to his house in August last, in James-Street, Grosvenor-Square, and ask'd his wife if he was at home? she said he was not. I desired her to tell him to come home, and I would make up matters with him, and I would have no officers to molest him. He came down about a fortnight after to me in St. Martin's Lane. We made up matters.</p>

               <p>Priscilla Stanley. I have known him above 20 years. He came to me about Christmas last, and told me, he was afraid of being arrested; I let him be at my house about a fortnight, before he went to the other lodging. I believe he is a very honest man. I have laid at his house since, and he has not been at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who took the things?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No; I am not sure of that. We have found a sheet, a blanket, and a flat iron; but one thing may be like another, I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunt. I am a Pawnbroker. He produced a sheet, a blanket, and a flat iron. The prosecutrix, prisoner, and the constable, came the night before last and asked for these things, and I delivered them to them. The prisoner pawn'd the sheet and blanket to me, but I did not take in the flat iron. The prisoner said they were her own when she brought them.</p>

She went away on the Wednesday, and I found her on the Tuesday following. She was carried to St. James's watch-house, and from thence to the Justice's there. Before me she confess'd she had taken and pawn'd the things to Mr Watson. I went to Mr. Watson's and found them accordingly.</p>

            . I am laundress to Mr. Pardoe's lodgings in Lincoln's-Inn; he was out of town, and his chambers were repairing. I brought his watch from the chambers for security.

He told me also, if I believed in God he could cure me. I said, I did believe in God. I put my stomacher on one side for him to touch it with his hand. He said he must touch my stomach, and he put his hand farther. Then he said, I must turn three times round to the sun, which I did. I soon miss'd my master's watch out of my bosom: it was a shagreen watch with a gold dial plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had it in your bosom when the prisoner undertook to cure you.</p>
               <p>Badderley. I am sure I had, and when I took him up he owned he had it. And when I took up the other prisoner, who is a soldier, he own'd he had had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Deering present at the time you lost it.</p>
               <p>Badderley. No, he was not in that house then. I have since been told, that the prisoner Tucker is a madman, and has been in Bethlem 3 or 4 times.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>


               <p>Badderley. He has been a Cheesemonger, and kept a shop in the Fleet-Market. I took him before Mr Fielding, there he own'd he had the watch, and that he took it from me; and there the soldier owned he had it from Mr. Tucker, but I never got it again.</p>

            . I am a soldier. I came into my quarters at the Castle and Falcon in Holborn, about 6 in the evening, on a Saturday, about a fortnight ago, I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I lost the watch last Saturday was se'nnight.</p>
               <p>Rice. There the two prisoners were drinking together: I sat down in the next box to them, they ask'd me to drink. Deering handed the pot to me over the table; I drank, and gave him the pot again. Tucker took a watch with a yellow dial-plate, with a shagreen case, and a packthread string out of his pocket, the glass fell; he took it up, and in striving to get in again he broke it, he having his breeches on with the wrong side outwards, went to pull them off to turn them. (He pretended to be out of his senses.) Deering said, let me hold the watch 'till you turn your breeches. Tucker gave him his watch to hold. He was about ten minutes in turning his breeches: in the mean time Deering ran out of the tap-room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240008"/> into the street with the watch. Tucker looked up and said, Is the man gone with my watch. I ran directly after him, but he had made his escape, and I could not catch him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing hanging to the packthread?</p>
               <p>Rice. Only a key. The madman then said, it was not his own, but it was a gentlewoman's which he had in cure with a sore breast, and he would buy a silk string to it, and bring it to her again.</p>

               <p>Deering's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in that house on Saturday was se'nnight, and Tucker came in after I was there; I never saw him before, he sat down in a box and called for beer, and pulled out this watch and opened it, and looked at it, and was for taking it to pieces; he ran his thumb through the glass and broke it; it fell down, he picked it up again, but could not fix it in again: then he said to me, Here, do you take it. I took it in my hand, there were several people asked him how he came by it; he said a lady he was courting gave it him; they asked to look at it, and handed it from one to another, and I never saw it since I delivered it out of my hand, neither did I run away with it.</p>

            . I have known Tucker about 10 years, he was a cheesemonger, a man of worth, but by unavoidable misfortunes was reduced; he has been out of his senses many years: I myself have known him to commit several acts of lunacy, going about preaching; sometimes almost naked, pretending to cure people. My father has an estate in Hertfordshire, out of which he pays Tucker about 10 l. per year: he came to me some time ago, and desired I would get him into St Bartholomew's Hospital, his legs were swelled; I got him in, he was so outragious there, that the people could hardly tell what to do with him; after he was cured he went down into the country, and then came up again to our house, and seemed tolerable well, and we settled with him; this is about three weeks ago; he went away as we thought to Hertfordshire, we gave him a written order to a woman there to let him have a Guinea if he wanted it. I have often met him in the streets dressed in the same manner he is now*, telling people he could cure all deceases, if they believed in Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, by only licking them: on the Tuesday or Thursday before he was taken up, I saw him in Morefields with a great crowd about him; he said to the people, What do you trouble me for, I am going home? he went towards Bethlem Hospital, and the people followed him, they admitted him in from the people at the gate, knowing him very well; there I found he was known by many of the disordered people walking about, as well as by the servants belonging to Bethlem; of my own knowledge, I do not know that ever he was confined there; but I went yesterday to the steward, who let me take extracts from the book, and I find he has been confined there three or four times. He produced a paper. This is a true copy of what I found in the book, I went and examined it with the book afterwards, and here is the steward's name to it, testifying it to be a true extract; he went in there in the year 40, and continued there till the year 43; he is certainly out of his senses, and here are others that can prove the same.</p>

How long have you had him? said he, Six months. I said, What will you have for him ? he said, What is he worth. I said, I must not be buyer and seller too. He asked ten pounds for him. I said that was too much. Then he said, Six pounds ten shillings. I bid him four Guineas. He said, I must give four pounds ten shillings. He got off and put him in my stable, and came in and drank a dish of tea. I agreed to give him the money. I mistrusted he was not honestly come by. I gave him half a crown earnest; and said, If he appears to be your own property, I'll give you the rest of the money. Have you any body to vouch for you? he said, There is a man at the Weavers-Arms that will vouch him. I went with him there, there was the other prisoner, his brother, but he then went by another name; that man said it is

I charged an officer with him, and then asked him to tell the truth; then he said, Indeed Mr. Green, I did steal him out of Aylsbury Fields.

            . I am a servant to Mr Sabbatin; the prisoner came and pretended to take a house of my master for his mistress in September last, about the 20th: he went to look at Mrs Chiselden's house, and I went with him, he looked all over the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any furniture in the house then?</p>

               <p>Lawrence. There were a bedstead, bed, blankets, a quilt, pottage pot, stew-pan, and all the other things mentioned in the indictment. He said, that house would do very well for his mistress. At going away I fastened all the windows, but the lower window, he pretended to have fastened that, and told me he had, but he left it without fastening. I went back again to see if it was fast and found it open: I fastened it. We missed the things mentioned in the indictment on the Saturday following.</p>

            . On Michaelmas day I went to the garden belonging to Mrs Chiselden's house, to gather a few grapes. I tried the shutter to the window and found it was not fast, it fell back, then I found the sash up, and the glass broke near the fastening. I saw footsteps about. I went into the house, and up stairs, in the first room I found nothing missing, in the second I missed the bed and bedding, then I went and sent our boy, the last witness, to see what was missing, and to fasten up the house. The next day Mrs Kirby, at whose house the prisoner's mistress lodged, told me there was great reason to suspect the prisoner in taking the things.</p>
               <p>Mrs Kirby. On Michaelmas day, a lady that lodges at my house, went to London in a coach to take her money, that is paid to her quarterly; my daughter went with her, the prisoner was her servant, he put up some bed and bedding behind the coach. When my daughter came home she told me she believed I had lost a bed. I went up stairs to see. I found two pillows none of my own. I asked the gentlewoman about it. Her maid said, she believed she had seen it before at a house she had been to see. Then we thought it belonged to the prosecutrix. I went directly and told this to Mrs Sabbatin, and so it came out. The goods produced in court. After this there were a stew-pan, pottage-pot, tongs, shovel, and poker, found in and left at my house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These two pillows I believe to be mine, I had just such. The bedding is marked, I know them to be mine.</p>

            . On the twenty-ninth of September in the morning, the prisoner brought a bed and blankets to my house; he flung the bundle down at the bench at my door, and wanted a shilling's-worth of punch. I said, what will you do with a shilling's-worth of punch in a morning. He said, he was a-dry, and was going to Ponders-End with these things to have them carried down to Hertford, and had some more things to fetch from Enfield, and desired I would let them be put in my bar.</p>

            . The prosecutrix desired me to have the care of her house at Enfield. If any body inquired for such a house to come to me. On the twenty-ninth of September my wife went to Mrs Cheselden's house, and returned and said, it had been broke open, and she believed the bed and bedding were missing. I sent my servant to see what had been done, and to make the house fast. He returned and said, he missed several things, as bed, bedding, and other things. I ordered him to get the carpenter and fasten the window up again, and went down with him. I found the glass in the sash next to the screw was broke: it appeared very plain, that the house had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lie in that house?</p>
               <p>Sabbatin. Part of the house was inhabited by Mr Brown, but this part of the house no body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240011"/> lived in.

            . I am a Coachman. I was hired to bring the prisoner's mistress from Enfield to town, I was with her by five o'clock in the morning. The prisoner came to me and asked me, if I could put his bed in the boot of the coach. Upon seeing the bundle, I said, I could not put it in, it must be tied behind. He said, it was his mistress's bed, but there was a young woman in the coach that he did not care should see it; but said, if it must be tied behind it must. We had got it tied behind before his mistress came. He desired me to carry it to the Falcon at Edmunton, and put it down there in the path way. I put it down at the Falcon gate, and saw no more of him 'till night; and when I went home he was at the house where his mistress lodged; then I had a suspicion that something was not right.

            . I came up in the coach from Enfield to London with the lady, and saw the prisoner meet the coachman at Edmonton, at the Falcon, for the parcel; and the lady, his mistress, told me there was a bed fastened to the coach behind, when I went into the coach; and after this, by searching about, I found a stew-pan, a pottage-pot, fire-shovel and tongs in my mother's hay-loft.</p>

               <p>Barker. No. I do not. Except the prisoner put them there; he lived with his mistress at my mother's.</p>
               <p>Isabella Smith. I liv'd servant to Mrs Croucher. My mistress went to town to receive her quarterly money, on the twenty-ninth of September; the prisoner lived servant with her at that time; Mrs Barker came and told me, that the coachman said the prisoner had put a bed behind the coach, and she believed it was her mother's bed; when I came home, I happened to go into my mistress's bed-chamber, there I saw two pillows; and I had been with the prisoner to see the house which was afterwards robb'd; and I came and told my mistress I thought it would do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you went with the prisoner to see the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was about a fortnight before Michaelmas day; my mistress bid me to give her compliments to the lady, and tell her she would wait upon her next week; the prisoner ordered me to stay at the house, and he went and fetch'd the footman; he shew'd me the house; I bid the footman give mistress's compliments to the lady, and tell her she would wait upon her next week; and I came home and told my mistress what I had said; I never heard any more of it; after seeing these pillows in my mistress's room, then I told the people I thought I had seen them pillows at that house which I went to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your mistress and his mistress the same person?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes: she is.</p>

            . I am Sexton of the parish of St Martin in the Fields; I was in waiting in the month of September, and on the sixteenth after Evening prayer, at five o'clock, I missed two silk damask curtains from the churchwardens and overseers pews, they had been left safe in the church over-night; on the twenty-second, being the Saturday following, after Evening Prayer, which begins a quarter after three o'clock, I search'd the church over; and, on the top of the gallery-stairs, I found the prisoner lying at full length; I sent for the keeper of the Round-house, in order take her into custody; I went also to the Justice, to enquire what I must do with her; and in the mean time she was searched in the Round-house. The other witness will give an account of what they found upon her.</p>

            . On the twenty-second of September, by order of Mr Churchwarden, I was sent to the church to put up an organ curtain to the churchwardens pew, that they should not look naked where the others were stolen from; there Mr Stephenson made a fort of an out-cry on the top of the stairs; I went up, and there I saw the prisoner lying at full length with a little light bundle under her head; she said, she was very sick; I went down stairs again; then came the Round-house-keeper, in order to take her away. I was before Justice Kynaston, where she was examined; there were some binding, and a little slip of damask found upon her; the Justice ask'd her how she came by them; she said she found them in Monmouth-street, at the upper-end, over-against Mr Loader's.</p>

            . I was the Constable in this affair; I was sent for to St Martin's Vestry, on the twenty-third of September, in the morning; the prisoner was committed to the Gatehouse; I went with her; on the Monday about noon the Justice sent for me, and desired I would take them slips of damask and go with him; we went to the back side of St Clement's church, to one Cameron, we there found the curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Cameron?</p>
               <p>Caddey. He is a Piecebroker. The curtains produced; one had a slip about two or three inches wide cut off it; the slip found upon the prisoner was put to it; then it made the two curtains of a length; and the slip tallied as to the flowers, length, and in every respect put it beyond all doubt but that it was cut off the curtain.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stephenson. Can you say these are the curtains that belong to your church?</p>
               <p>Stephenson. I believe they are same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I never touch'd the curtains; I never wrong'd any body of a farthing in my life; I found them pieces in Monmouth-street; I came from Cobham, and had not been in London above a fortnight; I am subject to fits, and I was afraid one of my fits was coming, made me go up stairs in the church.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Q. What were her words?</p>
               <p>Jones. She said Dolly had taken a piece of gold out of this man's hand, and would not give it him again. Then said I, Poh, Poh, she is only playing the rogue, I dare say she will give it him: come, Dolly, give the man his money. She said she would not give it him 'till such time he had given her a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she pretend that shilling was for? did he owe her a shilling?</p>
               <p>Jones. She said it was for oysters and beer some time ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them both before?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had seen the woman before, but did not know the man; I knew both the women.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Jones. I have known her about eleven years, ever since I have been in that neighbourhood, but were no ways acquainted.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her business?</p>
               <p>Jones. She sold fruit and oysters, and things of that sort about the street. The man said, he never owed her a farthing in his life. After some-time we perswaded him to give her a shilling. She was going to take it. Stop, said he, perhaps you will take the shilling as you did the gold; then he gave the shilling into my hand to hold 'till he had his piece of money. Then she said, he should not have the money at all; and I had no business with it. I endeavoured to perswade her very much to let him have it; but she said, it was no business of mine. I told her, it was my business, because it was done in my house. She bid me to mind my house, and not busy myself with that. Then I told her, that she must abide by the consequence of it. Then he went for a constable and she was taken up.</p>

            . One of them call'd Will, will you give us a pint of beer, I answer'd I would. We went in at Mrs Jones's, which was not above twenty yards from where they were standing. I never stopp'd in the street with them a moment; nor was I with them in any other house. I call'd for a pint of beer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240014"/> and we drank once a-piece. I pull'd out some half-pence to pay, and by chance pull'd out a 3 l. 12 s. piece. The prisoner snatch'd it out of my hand, and said she would look at it. She said she had not seen such a piece of money a good while. I did not pretend to catch hold of it at that time, thinking her honest. She went out at the door; I expected she would return and bring it me. She came in again; I asked her for it; she denied having it, and said she knew nothing of it. I thought she was joking, asked for it again, and said, Do not play about with the money and lose it; it was a great deal of money to me. At last she began to swear that she knew nothing of it, and did not know who had got it; she got up, I catch'd hold of her, and stopp'd her from going out. The people of the house wanted me to search her. She swore vengeance bitterly against any person that should offer to touch a rag of her cloaths; and said, she had a sore breast, and let any body put their hand in her bosom if they dare. I did not search her, but got a constable: when he came he said he had no business to search her, but took her in charge. She was carried that night to Clerkenwell-Bridewell, and from thence to Justice Welch. I heard her examined. She denied having it. The Justice ask'd her, how she came to offer to produce it, in case I would give her a shilling? but I do not remember her answer. I never saw my money since.</p>

I said, Do you think I never was mistress of a crown in my life? I went out to buy a pennyworth of oysters, the woman opened me five; I ask'd her to change me that piece of money, she offered to throw it in the kennel; then she took it up again, and a man took it out of my hand and look'd at it.

I went out, and at the end of the market, I was shewed to the prisoner, and told she had a bushel of pippins; I took hold of her, and charged her with taking them: she down upon her knees, and said, She had out-lived all her acquaintance, and wanted to be either hanged or transported, or else she would cut her own throat.

If right takes place I ought to swear a robbery against them, for having my goods torn back again after I had paid for them; no, no, here is a Judge here and another in Heaven; they made such a halloo-belloo nothing could be like it; I was obliged to give up my own basket and my own apples; my sieve and my apron; and I had nothing in my pocket but two-pence half-penny.</p>

               <p>Q. What sum was the bill for?</p>
               <p>Keen. It was for 250 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember of whom you received it?</p>

               <p>Keen. I'll tell you from the first beginning of it; I liv'd as porter to Mess. More and Smith, Stock-brokers in Pope's-head Alley; there came a gentleman-like man; my master was gone out, so was the clerk; he said, is Mr More or Mr Smith in the way?</p>

               <p>Q. Look about you; see if you see him.</p>
               <p>Keen. That gentleman at the bar is the height of the man; to the best of my knowledge he was something fuller in the body: I believe him to be the man, but will not positively swear to him it is so long ago. When he came into the office there were nobody there but myself. When he asked for my masters, I said they were gone to dinner, and they will not be here 'till to-morrow between ten, and half an hour after two; he said, Because I want to lay out 2 or 300 l. in stock with them. He went out at the door, and came in again, and said, Sir, I have a favour to beg of you, and put his hand into his pocket and pull'd out this bill, I should have gone myself, but am to meet a gentleman at the Victualling Office, but shall be too late, do you go to Sir Charles Asgill's, and there, I imagine, you will have notes for this bill, producing it, and then go to the Bank and get cash for them. I said, Pray, what is your name? he said,

Accordingly I was going; Stop, said he, he put his hand in his pocket and pull'd out a money-bag, and said, take this, and when you have got the money carry the bag before you in both your hands. I said, when I have got the money I'll take care of it (I receive a great deal of money, I know how to take care of it ). Said he, I shall take it as a favour if you will carry it so before you. He order'd me to come to him with it at Browne's Coffee-House in Fenchurch-Street, and if I was there before him I was to wait for him; and if he was there first he would wait for me. I went to Sir

I looked about and he was not there; I said to the gentlewoman of the house, I have got some money for a gentleman, and if I got here before him I was to wait. She said, sit down; in about half an hour he came in; I went to the end of the table and throw'd the money down before him; he fell to scraping it over: I have seen thousands of pounds told over, but I never saw money told so fast in my life. I went and sat down just opposite to him, and looked at him, to see how he told it. When he had told it twice over he put it in the bag, and paid me, and I came away about my business. About three weeks after, a gentleman at the Coffee-House was reading the News-paper over; he took the daily-paper in his hand and show'd me the advertisement, and said, Do you know any thing of this advertisement? I said I receiv'd the money; then I went to Sir

When I waited upon Mr Merry he asked me, whether the person had a fear on his forehead. His hat was not off when he was with me, so I could see no scar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember this man being in custody, and afterwards being before Mr Fielding?</p>
               <p>Keen. I do: Mr Nightingale told me the man is taken, and you must be at Mr Fielding's to morrow about nine o'clock. When he came there to the bar, I was sitting in a chair, and took a full view at his face. The first question that was asked him was, pray what is your name. My name is

               <p>Q. Who was there at the time?</p>
               <p>Keen. Mr Merry was, and his clerk. When Mr Fielding thought I had had a full sight of him he called me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Merry mentioned?</p>
               <p>Keen No, he was not at all: nor did I hear him say a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Nightingale there?</p>
               <p>Keen. He was. Mr Fielding called me in, and I was sworn. He asked me what I thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240020"/> of the man. I said, he was fuller in the body, and fatter than at that time, and his dress was altered. I desired to see him with his hat on as it was on when I saw him before, and stopping. He put it on. I do think it is the same person, but I do not swear that.</p>

               <p>Keen. He answers to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the description you gave of him?</p>
               <p>Keen. I told them when I first described him, that he was of a brownish complexion, roundish face, and his nose had a little poine turned up.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you met with a thousand people that answer that description that you have given: did you percieve any thing remarkable in him?</p>
               <p>Keen. In the first place, what made me take notice of him was, because of his talking of laying out two or three hundred pounds with my master in stocks. I then looked him fuller in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing so remarkable in his face, that by this description he may be known from another person.</p>
               <p>Keen. I did not percieve any thing remarkable in his face.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. Did you give a better description of him then, than you do now?</p>
               <p>Keen. When I came to the bankers, I had a better remembrance of his features than now. I could then have pointed him out from amongst five hundred people.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him at Mr Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Keen. He was off I believe thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken?</p>
               <p>Keen. He has been in goal ever since, I believe it is about eight or nine weeks ago. He was taken the last day of the last sessions held here but one, that was in July.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner at the bar ever since the 18th of November 1755.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever in the capacity of a servant under Mr Merry?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He was his Book-Keeper, and Cash-Keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in that capacity?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He was from the 22 d of July 1755, to the 7th of May 1757. He was absent in that time about two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live there in November 1755?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I did from November 1755 'till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr Merry's office?</p>
               <p>Matteson. It is in Laurence-Pountney-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same person, or is it a matter of belief?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by then?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He went by the name of

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Quilty of Malaga as a correspondent of Mr Merry?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this correspondency continue?</p>
               <p>Matteson. It was closed the 19th of April 1757.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no other correspondency between them, - no draughts after that time?</p>
               <p>Matteson. All correspondence ceased between them, except a letter or two. There was no letter passed between them since the 2 d of August 1757.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that transaction the closing accounts between them?</p>
               <p>Matteson. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. HAVE you seen any bill drawn upon Mr Merry by Mr Quilty since that?</p>
               <p>Matteson. No: I generally go to the Post-Office; if there had been any letters I should have seen them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the evidence, Keen, coming to your office?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I do: it was about ten days after the bill was paid; he gave me a description of the person who sent him with the bill to Sir Charles Asgill's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your opinion of that description?</p>
               <p>Matteson. The description that he gave to my master, in my presence, made us positively think, that that was the prisoner at the bar, without doubt; we did not doubt in the least but that it was he, both with regard to his person and dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any alteration between his appearance now, and what he was when he went away?</p>
               <p>Matteson. Only he is fallen-away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being before Justice Fielding ?</p>
               <p>Matteson. That was on the Saturday, the last day of the last sessions but one?</p>
               <p>Q. Before he quitted Mr Merry's service, did you ever hear any name he went by than that of

               <p>Q. Was he ask'd about Mr Merry ?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He was: and said he never knew any such name, or any such person.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he shew'd to Mr Merry?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He was: Mr Merry sat by him; Mr Fielding ask'd him whether he knew Mr Merry; he denied him, when he saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he see him?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He saw him there; I was his fellow-clerk; Mr Fielding bid him look at me; he did; and denied knowing of me, or having ever seen me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any particular mark upon the prisoner's face that you can tell him by?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Q. If there is a mark, you can given an account of it?</p>
               <p>Matteson. When he was in the compting-house, I used to observe a scar in his forehead, just above his nose; I described that to Mr Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a man conceal that scar if he drew his hat over his face?</p>
               <p>Matteson. It is so high, I believe he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lived?</p>
               <p>Matteson. At that time he liv'd with Mr Merry, he lodg'd in Lemon-street, Goodman's-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a good penman?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He is a very compleat penman.</p>

               <p>Matteson. This is a very great similitude to Mr Merry's hand-writing (I mean the name), but I really believe it is not from circumstances that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that the correspondence was carried on, was it usual to have letters of advice?</p>
               <p>Matteson. Yes, it was, very often.</p>

             given Mr Merry credit for the sum of 250 l?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He had made him debtor, but now he has taken it off.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that to be wrote off?</p>
               <p>Matteson. It seems he was fully perswaded that it was forgery; therefore it was wrote on again, as his giving him credit for 250 l. again, in order to ballance this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the reason of it?</p>
               <p>Matteson. My master insisted on it's being a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Considering the circumstances of this transaction, are these the only circumstances on which you are induced to believe this is not the hand-writing of Mr Merry?</p>
               <p>Matteson. No, Sir; when he was suspected to be the person that forged the bill, there was a search-warrant taken out, and in his house there were found many papers belonging to Mr Merry.</p>
               <p>Q. What papers were they?</p>
               <p>Matteson. Some of them were invoyces and bills of lading, and letters from different parts, where my master corresponded; and amongst the rest, bills of exchange, and my master's hand that had been to a letter, and cut off (that is my master's name). There was also a letter drawn by this same Qullty, a real bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the finding of the pa pers?</p>
               <p>Matteson. No; I did not see them found, I saw the papers afterwards. The prisoner was trusted with my master's cash, and always made up the accounts, 'till October 1756; then there was a deficiency of 49 l. 11 s. 8 d. which he made himself debtor for in my master's books.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon all those circumstances, are you induced to believe it is not Mr Merry's handwriting?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Strip yourself of them; what should you have believed if an indifferent person had brought it?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I should have thought it had been Mr Merry's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion did the prisoner leave your master?</p>
               <p>Matteson. I cannot tell the occasion; he went away two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he leave his house the last time?</p>
               <p>Matteson. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. After May 1757, was he employed for your master?</p>
               <p>Matteson. Yes, he has come to translate Spanish for him; he understood Spanish very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the forgery, do you remember he was sent for?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240024"/>Matteson. Yes, my Master sent me for him to come to make up the account; he made excuses of being lame, and master sent me with a coach after that.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your master, was he then debtor to your master?</p>
               <p>Matteson. He was; but it has been since made up; he was debtor 48 l. 9 s. 8 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this book again; is this the customary manner in which they write them off?</p>

               <p>Nightingale. This is writing on; by virtue of this entry it will be increased 250 l. It is wrote in this way on presumption of it's being a forgery.</p>

We searched, and found a prodigious number of letters, invoices, bills of lading, and other papers, which appeared to be received by Mr Merry from Portugal and Hamburgh. All these papers appeared to be Mr Merry's which the prisoner could have no right to, as I should presume.

Our lives throughout, shall give proof of our gratitude, in continually imploring the eternal Father of Spirits, to repay your tender concern for us distress'd pilgrims, with rewards eternal in glory.

               <p>Merry. He is a very extraordinary penman.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he quit your service for good?</p>
               <p>Merry. It was some time in May 1757: he was a little faulty in making up his cash, something deficient, and I insisted upon his coming and making it up. He is a compleat proficient in the Spanish language; so I said, I would not apply to his security, but he should work the money out, so he came some times and translated some few letters in the year 1758.</p>

               <p>Merry. When I last saw him he looked better in flesh, and was better in cloaths than now. After he left me he appeared shabby in cloaths.</p>

               <p>Merry. By the case, and the description he gave. But I was in some measure convinced it was he before I saw the porter; because in turning my book over, I set my lad to cast it up, and I cast up the other, and found there were 250 l. difference. Then I took the book and looked it over myself, and found it the same. When I came to look over the bills I was vasty startled, having had no business with Mr Quilty for some time. I own the hand on the bill has some strong resemblance of my own hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at the searching the prisoner's house?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be your own hand writing?</p>
               <p>Merry. I believe it is. These papers were what he had no business with; he must take them for some use or purpose; there were some letters of every gentleman almost abroad, that I correspond with; a vast number of invoices: upon looking for some real bills, in order to compare with this, I found the second bill a real bill of Mr Quilty's. The acceptance on the first was for 177 l. that bill was taken away, and I cannot find it in my compting-house; that bill is drawn in the same favour as this is, in the same name; when I came to turn the bill, and look at the endorsements, I am of opinion, that the name

            . I am very sensibly acquainted with them: he was so much in debt that he could not stay, and I maintained his family when he was away; he took with him, even his old shirts and old shoes. This was in May was twelve month. I heard in the family that he owed above a hundred pounds, to a man at the Bull, ten pound borrowed money, who frequently came to his house, and threatened to arrest him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you look upon it that he went away for debt?</p>
               <p>Deming. I do believe he went away absolutely for debt. I was sent for when the house was searched. I asked Mr Merry, when this thing was done; and told him, I wondered, if he was guilty of the crime, that he should be seen publickly; for I saw him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he abscond from his family?</p>
               <p>Deming. I believe it was about the middle of May was twelve month. I had, I believe, five or six letters from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they come?</p>
               <p>Deming. They came by the Post. He wrote me a letter that he should be at the Monument in Blackmore-street, on the 26th of April last, at three in the afternoon; I went there, he was standing in the public alehouse smoaking his pipe; I shook my head at him, and said, For God's sake what do you do here ? Why said he. Do not you know, said I, the crime that you are charged with, that will take away your life. I took him to the window, and charged him with it. He said - </p>
               <p>Court. What he said is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Deming. I saw him often during the month of May 58, in destitute circumstances, poorer than he has been since, because I have maintained him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he paid any of his debts since?</p>
               <p>Deming. Of my own knowledge he has not.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the cause of his distressed circumstances?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I suppose he could not maintain himself; I believe he was out of employment.</p>

               <p>Q. to Deming. What do you think was the cause of his distress?</p>
               <p>Deming. I believe it was about a hundred pounds bond; and his family coming on, he has a wife and three children, and she big again. I never look'd upon him to be a negligent man; a good man: I have heard say, he used to take his family to prayers.</p>

The prisoner said there were three shillings and six pence when I was in the house with her. She fastened me in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the house?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I saw no body else in the house but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you go into the house?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I went in about nine or ten at night, and sat in a chair and slept, with my head on a table, 'till about two in the morning. When I awaked I could not get out 'till day-light; she was gone, and I was left alone.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get the door open?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I got that open with my knife. I miss'd my money.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss that?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I miss'd that about two o'clock, purse and all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door fastened?</p>
               <p>Husdon. It was hasped to, and I put it off the staple with my knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I took her up at Wapping New, Stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The next day. She had my purse in her hand when I first saw her; I said that was my purse; she said it was, and she delivered it to a waterman; and I am very sure he put nothing into it, and took nothing out, and he gave it to me; there was in it six guineas and a half, and one 36 s. piece. I took her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240029"/> before Justice Scott, there she was examined; she told the Justice that she took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know she took it out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hudson. I only know it by what she confessed afterwards. If I had found her at taking it out of my pocket I would not have let her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her from Wapping-Stairs immediately before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I took her first to the house where I was with her, and kept her there 'till I got a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you how much money she took out of your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I ask'd her where the rest of the money was; and she said, she had given that to one of her companions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you what the rest of the money was?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I did not ask her; she had made away with seven guineas and two 36 s. pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any money that night?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; I did not; she took enough, I had no occasion to give her any.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you given her some money before she took your purse?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go into that house for?</p>
               <p>Hudson. To see her bed; but it was so dirty and nasty I would not lie in it. We had a pot of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she ask you to give her something?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No; if I had been sober I should not have been there.</p>

I have a drawer in the counting-house, which I keep the key of myself; on the 10th of October last my master was gone out upon some business, and left money with me put up in papers. I had chang'd a Bank note of 50 l. for a gentleman. The last time I looked in the drawer was between twelve and one that night; I went to it to get a handful of silver out of a bag that I have there, to give change to a gentleman up stairs. I put the silver in my pocket, and did not make an entry in the book, doing it in a hurry; I might leave the key in the drawer for what I know.</p>

               <p>Q. What money was in the drawer at that time?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. There were two rollo's, fifty guineas each; twenty-nine guineas, part of a rollo; a 50 l. Bank note, and a draught upon somebody in Lombard-street for 22 l. odd; I went to bed, thinking every thing safe. When I got up, my master and I went to settle accounts, as we do once a week, to strike the balance; I felt for my key, and miss'd it; I look'd at the drawer, and that was lock'd; I enquir'd for it of every servant in the house, but could not find it; the prisoner at the bar was out all that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he gone out before you miss'd the money?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. He was: there was also another servant out; I never had a very bad opinion of the prisoner; but upon his being extravagant I mistrusted him more particular; I ordered the other servants not to say a word<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240030"/> what had happened, but to keep it a secret 'till I had a farther proof, for I thought I should find it out in two or three days, by his paying some debt; on the Friday morning, my master ask'd me if I had heard of my money; I said, no; said he, I have, the prisoner at the bar has got it; he said, he was told he had paid six guineas to Mrs Clark, and he did not know how he could get it; upon this, the prisoner was charged with taking it; upon being ask'd how he came to have money to pay that six guineas; he said, he had borrowed seven guineas of one Murphy, that keeps the sign of the Coach and Horses; I went to Murphy, and ask'd him if the prisoner had borrow'd any sum of money of him within these two days; he said, no; then I desired he would go home along with me; and before I got home the the prisoner had confess'd he took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. I was: and Murphy brought eleven guineas, which he said the prisoner had left with him, and tendered it down to him; the prisoner would not take it up, but push'd it to me, and said it was part of the twenty-nine guineas that he had taken out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he opened the drawer?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. Before the Justice he said he found the key in the drawer, and he took the money out, and left the key in the drawer; the Justice ask'd him, if he had stolen the twenty-nine guineas out of the drawer; he said, yes; and he own'd that the money he had paid was part of it; that was six guineas to Mrs Clark and four to Murphy; upon the whole I understood he had squander'd the rest away, or paid debts with it.</p>

               <p>Kennet. I never heard the least complaint of him 'till this time; I would have trusted him, or any of his family, with any thing they should ask.</p>
               <p>Mr Watson. I have known him ever since he was a child.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>Mr Watson. He has a very good character; and so has his whole family, as any family in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Mr Perkins. I have known the prisoner a great many years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Mr Perkins. I believe he had a very good character; if he had had a bad character he would not have been there where he lived, he has been there twelve or thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Mr Wilson. I have known the prisoner eleven years; he always was very honest, and bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>Mr Clark. I have known him sixteen years; I never heard any thing ill of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this of the same sort that she had cheapen'd?</p>
               <p>Elderton. No: it was a separate piece. Produc'd in Court and depos'd to.</p>

               <p>Elderton. I value it at four shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jourdan. About the fifteenth of September I happen'd to go into Mr Elderton's shop, and into a little back room, there I saw a woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner at the bar; there was a little stir; I enquired what was the matter; they said she had stole a piece of black lace; she was search'd, and a piece was found under her stays.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It appears to me since, upon enquiry, that the prisoner has lived very well in the parish, and necessity has drove her to do this; and I am very sorry for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jourdan. I made strict enquiry and cannot find that the woman has ever been guilty of such a thing before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What ship is this?</p>
               <p>Wilson. The Phenix Hospital-ship, in the King's service.</p>
               <p>Q. What prisoners had you on board this ship ?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We had four pyrates, that is, reported to be so, which were sent from the Royal.</p>

               <p>Q. How many pressed men had you on that ship?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Really I do not know, because they are kept by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ten?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I do not know that we had.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you five?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you two?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I do not know what we had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Meekins on board ?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it reported that you had a good many pressed on board ?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I am sure there were some.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon the deceased to be a pressed man?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did; he had not been long on board us.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call long?</p>
               <p>Wilson. A day or two, or three.</p>
               <p>Q. What officers had you on board?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We had no warrant-officer on board except me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the superior officer on board?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Squire's acted as turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He is <rs id="t17591024-24-deflabel121" type="occupation">Boatswain's steward</rs>

               <p>Q. What is Neal?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He is a marine on board.</p>
               <p>Q. How many marines had you on board besides Neal?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We have only he had another; they were guards-men over the pyrates.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not guards over all the prisoners on board?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We had no guards 'till the pyrates were brought on board. I understand them to be a centry over the pyrates.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your reason for understanding it so; did you hear any order given?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did not.</p>

             along with Makepeace siting in his cabbin; it was about three or four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Meekins?</p>
               <p>Walker. He was a pressed man, belonging to the Doctor's ward; I heard a noise, and we went upon the main-deck to see what was the matter; Makepeace went first and I followed him; as soon as I came upon deck, I heard these words, Stop the man; likewise, Fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who said that word Fire?</p>
               <p>Walker. I am not certain who it was, because the ship's company were all in a flurry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body repeat the word?</p>
               <p>Walker. Makepeace repeated it after that; he unhappily cried Fire, repeating the word from them that first spoke it.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was Makepeace from Neal?</p>
               <p>Walker. He was just by him on the quarterdeck; not above two or three yards.</p>

               <p>Q. What was done afterwards?</p>
               <p>Walker. The centinel Neal, said, If I have orders to fire, I'll fire, and took up his piece; and after that, the word fire was said again, and the other repeated it afterwards, and he fired a second time. I stood close along-side Neal when he fired.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the deceased to the ship?</p>
               <p>Walker. I believe he was about forty yards distance in a boat; the first fire was what was the death of the man; he failed in his rowing upon the first fire; they brought him on board, and I carried him down into the Doctor's ward on my back: we asked him which shot hit him; he told us twice, It was the first shot that hit him. I held him while he was dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. After the first fire, What did the prisoner Makepeace say?</p>
               <p>Walker. After the first fire, there were still crying out Fire again: Several people called so, not one nor two, but more; Makepeace said, Do not fire any more, for I believe the poor man is hurt already; there was a boat in pursuit of him, and the men called and desired they would fire no more, for they could take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was the deceased making?</p>
               <p>Walker. He was making towards the Tower-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they to him, that were in quest of him ?</p>
               <p>Walker. They were within twenty yards of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe they might have taken him, if he had not been fired at?</p>
               <p>Walker. I do believe they might, because the deceased did not understand rowing the boat very well; and there were people on shore might have stopped him, but people are willing to give a pressed man as much quarters as they can.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that called out Fire first?</p>
               <p>Walker. I took it to be Squire.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it between the first and second firing?</p>
               <p>Walker. I do not believe there was above a minute distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Whenever a pressed man offered to make his escape, did you ever hear an order to fire at him?</p>
               <p>Walker. I never saw a man endeavour to make his escape before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at sea?</p>
               <p>Walker. No. I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever a pressing about with others?</p>
               <p>Walker. Yes, with a lieutenant.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual to carry fire-arms on such an occasion?</p>
               <p>Walker. We never carry fire-arms.</p>

            . On the 27th of September the Tender went away, and there were no pressed men on board.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Pritchard. I was waterman belonging to the Phenix; this Nogan that is dead, was brought on board the Phenix as a pressed man; in the afternoon I was gone on shore to fetch some beer for the four pyrates that were on board.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the pyrates come on board the Phenix?</p>
               <p>Prichard. They came that day, or the day before. The prisoner Neal and another marine were centinels over them; they came with them as a guard; as soon as I brought the beer, and had carried it on the quarter-deck,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240035"/> in about ten minutes time I heard somebody say, A man had made his escape from the centry; I made haste down the ladder into a press-gang's boat, and got in persuit after him, and was within about twenty yards of him when he was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was he rowing?</p>
               <p>Prichard. He was rowing towards Tower-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have re-taken him before he got to Tower-stairs had there been no firing?</p>

               <p>Prichard. Yes: I heard firing, but do not know who gave the command to fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened to the deceased?</p>
               <p>Prichard. As soon as he found himself wounded he leaned round on his right side, and put his hand over and got hold of my boat; there were two holes made with the balls in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the holes there before?</p>
               <p>Prichard. No, they were not: he desired me to come on board him as fast as I could; I made the press-gang's boat fast to the other, and tow'd the boat, and desired another boat also to take me in tow, and brought him on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of this firing, who was on board that had any command.</p>
               <p>Prichard. The Boatswain was on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Regulating Captain?</p>
               <p>Prichard. He was on shore; the only warrant-officer that I know of on board at that time was the Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. It is customary at any time to fire at a person on board that shall endeavour to escape?</p>
               <p>Prichard. I cannot tell; I belong'd to her but about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the Surgeon's Steward an equal power with the Surgeon?</p>
               <p>Prichard. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the Boatswain's Steward a power to act when the Boatswain is not there ?</p>
               <p>Prichard. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Have either of them power to give an order to fire?</p>
               <p>Prichard. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any expression with an oath, why don't you fire?</p>
               <p>Prichard. I heard it, but cannot say who spoke it; I was then in persuit of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased called to by any body before the firing ?</p>
               <p>Prichard. I heard them call, Stop the man. I do not know whether he was call'd to.</p>

               <p>Meekins. That is Neal; after which Make-peace call'd out, For God's sake, fire no more; Squire would have had him to fire again, but Makepeace was against it; I believe the man was shot then, for he laid by his scull and turn'd on his side; after that, Squire repeated the the word with an oath to the soldier to fire again; then the soldier took up a piece and fired again a second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he had time betwixt the two firings to charge his piece again?</p>
               <p>Meekins. He took up the other marine's piece, and fired that the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after Makepiece had desired the centinel not to fire?</p>
               <p>Meekins. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What are Squire and Makepeace?</p>
               <p>Meekins. Squire is Boatswain's Steward, and Makepeace is Surgeon's Steward.</p>
               <p>Q. to Black. How came you not to tell that Neal took your musket to fire the second time?</p>
               <p>Black. They were both lying together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take it out of your hand?</p>
               <p>Black. No, he did not: but he took it up and fired it.</p>

            . I am a Volunteer on board the Phenix; on the twenty-seventh of September last I was on board, but did not see the firing when it first began; Squire was in the Boatswain's cabbin; there was an uproar that a man was got over the ship's side; we ran up; they call'd, Stop the man; and call'd to the man to come back; he would not.</p>

               <p>Q. Who call'd to him to come back?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. The centry call'd to him; then he was fired at, at the first firing he failed in his rowing.</p>

               <p>Murphy. She lives any where were she can. about the fifth of October, I happened to be out when the prisoner came in; I was fetched home; she having asked for me: when I came home, I saw her in my parlour; she told me she was come to drink a dish of tea with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you any acquaintance of her's?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you never in her company before?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Never in my life. I have seen her in the street, and she has come to my father; but I never eat nor drank with her in my life.</p>

               <p>Murphy. I saw her put her hand into the beaufet and take out a spoon; she put it first under her cloak, and then put it into her pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, when you saw her take the spoon?</p>
               <p>Murphy. Then I desired her to stay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send for a constable?</p>
               <p>Murphy. No, I did not; she went out at the door, and up the court, and I desired Mrs Crookshanks to go after her, that I might have time to fetch my husband, least she should be gone out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fetch your husband?</p>
               <p>Murphy. He came, and ran after her, and Mrs Crookshanks brought her back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when she came back?</p>
               <p>Murphy. I was in the house then; I then charged her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say upon that?</p>
               <p>Murphy.

Mrs Murphy went to her husband, and I went after the prisoner, and stopped her just by the Black-horse; her husband and another man came after me, and they brought the prisoner back: I first laid my hands on the skirts of her gown, and said, Haseldine, You shall come back.</p>

               <p>The circumstances of the present case I will open to you as shortly and clearly as I can; but it will be necessary for me to go a little back before I come to the transaction of forging the present deed; it is laid in one count to be done with intention to defraud The Right Honourable

             or Mr Clewer, the prisoner will be proved to have been guilty of the offence charged against him.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Mr Fox about two years ago became intitled to an estate in Wiltshire, on the decease of Mrs Horner, to whom Mr. Ayliffe had been formerly steward, but had been some time discharged from her service. Mrs Horner, however, out of regard for the wife and family of Mr Ayliffe, desired Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240043"/> Fox, that he would make Mr Ayliffe some beneficial lease of the value of about 30 l. a year; there was no obligation upon Mr Fox to do this; but being willing to fulfil that lady's request, and having purchased an estate called Russley-Park; which is the estate conveyed by the deed laid in the indictment, and supposed to be forged, he made an offer to the prisoner, 
               <persName id="t17591024-27-person354">
                  John 
                  Ayliffe 
               <interp inst="t17591024-27-person354" type="surname" value="Ayliffe"/>
                     <interp inst="t17591024-27-person354" type="given" value="John"/>
                     <interp inst="t17591024-27-person354" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  </persName>
            , of making him a lease of that park, and the grounds belonging to that estate, being 120 acres for the term of ninety-nine years, for his own life, his wife's life, and his son's life, at the rent of 35 l. a year. Mr Ayliffe was extreamly rejoiced at this proposal, as there was a very good house, and a considerable estate about it, of double the value of the rent reserved; and he gladly accepted the offer. You will find in consequence of it a draft of a lease was prepared and carried to one Mr Jones, a Stationer, in the Temple, to have two parts of it engrossed; I do not name the person that carried it, because he was unknown; but the instructions he delivered at that time, were to make two parts of this lease; but not to add the common conclusion at the end of it, which is, [In witness whereof the parties above named have hereunto interchangeably set their hands and seals.] And the reason given by the person bringing the draft why that was to be omitted, was, because the parties might want to add some other covenant; therefore, that was by order of the person that sent him not to be inserted.</p>
               <p>This circumstance will afford something very remarkable; for Mr Jones's clerk, 
               <persName id="t17591024-27-person355">
                  Henry

             (whom we shall call) did engross two parts of this draft, all in his own hand-writing to the words (In witness whereof); and he will prove, if my instructions are true, that these engrossments were exactly agreeable to the draft brought by this unknown person, who, when they were prepared, fetched them away. It will appear, that these deeds so ingrossed were shortly after executed at Mr Fox's house, one by Mr Fox, and delivered to Mr Ayliffe, the other by Mr Ayliffe, who was then Mr Fox's Steward, and left in the hands of Mr Fox. And as the words (In witness whereof, &amp;c.) were left out by 
               <persName id="t17591024-27-person356">
                  Henry

               <interp inst="t17591024-27-person356" type="surname" value="Thomas"/>
                     <interp inst="t17591024-27-person356" type="given" value="Henry"/>

                  </persName>
            , so it will appear, that the counterpart, which was left in Mr Fox's hands, was filled up, by the hand-writing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>This will shew two things, that the person that carried the draft of this lease to be engrossed was an agent sent by Mr Ayliffe, and the deeds engrossed by 
               <persName id="t17591024-27-person357">
                  Henry

             ( one of which two we shall produce) will be identified by Mr Ayliffe's own hand-writing, added in the conclusion, and filling up that line which was directed to be omitted.</p>
               <p>These leases being engrossed, you may well imagine the manner in which they were executed, by a Gentleman that had a confidence in his steward; a steward, who had so considerable a bounty, immediately moving from his master and who could not be suspected at that instant of putting a trick upon him. And I suppose therefore, Mr Fox, on his steward's bringing the leases to be executed, executed them in his house, without ever reading one word of them; yet, however fraudulently Mr Ayliffe had the opportunity of acting, Mr Fox had care enough to have the counterpart left in his own custody.</p>
               <p>After this, you will find Mr Ayliffe fell into very declining circumstances; he wanted to borrow money, and applied to

               <p>The deed which was so executed by Mr Fox in December, bore date the 27th of November 1758, the rent 35 l. per year, and was witnessed by Fannen and Hobson, who will be called: and upon borrowing this money of Mr Clewer, a security was to be made to him of several estates, and amongst the rest, this estate of Russley Park. And accordingly you will find, upon the 13th of April 1759, in consideration of the sum of 1700 l. Mr Ayliffe made a mortgage to

             and himself, as dated the twenty-second of November 1758, of that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240044"/> estate at 5 l. a year rent; and Mr. Clewer having advanced to the prisoner several sums of money, to the amount of 1700 l. this mortgage-deed was executed to him by the prisoner, by which this Rusley es tate is assigned to him, and at the same time a title-deed, to verify the recital of the lease of Rusley, in this mortgage, was delivered to Mr Clewer by Mr Ayliffe, which we say is a forged lease, being a lease bearing date 22d of November 1758, between Mr Fox and Mr Ayliffe, at 5 l. a year, subscribed H. Fox, and endorsed with the name of the very two witnesses to the deeds that were really executed at Mr Fox's house, bearing date the 27th of November 1758, and at 35 l. a year rent. This was delivered to authenticate the deed recited in that conveyance of the leasehold premises that was made to Mr. Clewer as a security for his money.</p>
               <p>It will be proved to you, that at the time of this transaction, which was in the Paper-Buildings in the King's Bench-Walks, at the chambers of one Mr Priddle, Mr Ayliffe desired there might be an oath of secrecy taken by the persons present, not to disclose that he had mortgaged this Rusley estate; an oath of secresy they were surprized at, and refused to take.</p>
               <p>I mention this, to shew the reason he gave for it, which was, That he would not for all the world have it come to Mr Fox's knowledge that he had mortgaged this Rusley estate; for, says he, I am sure he will be very angry with me, if he ever hears of it. When he could not bring them to take an oath, then he was forced to depend on their promise, That it should be kept a secret; a secret indeed, the prisoner knew too well it ought to be for his own safety. It will appear in proof, That this lease is every word of the prisoner's own handwriting - The date the 22d, not the 27th, the rent 5 l. a year, and not 35 l. That the name H. Fox was forged, and the names of Fannen and Hobson, the two witnesses to the real deed, will also appear on this deed to have been forged. This lease so being delivered over, and the prisoner still continuing in very distressed circumstances, Mr Clewer had a mind to know (and sent Mr Green to Mr Fox for that purpose), whether Mr Fox would take up the mortgage that had been made to him of Rusley. When Mr Green came to Mr Fox with that proposal, he said, He had no mind to buy it in; and the rent being mentioned by Mr Green, in the conversation, to be 5 l. per year, Mr Fox said immediately, No, Sir, You are mistaken; it is 35 l. - Mr Green then produced the lease, and Mr Fox not having the least idea of that deed's being forged from one end to the other; said, It must be a mistake; but began to suspect that a fraud had been put upon him at the time of the execution, and that the deed he had in his custody might be at that rent too: accordingly he went up stairs to examine it; and when he came down again, said to Mr Green, It is 35 l. a year. Mr Green was a good deal surprized upon hearing it; said, He was afraid Ayliffe was a bad man, and immediately went from Mr Fox; possibly he went directly to Mr Ayliffe, to inform him of it; but, however, Mr Ayliffe was certainly informed of it very soon. And you will find, upon his discovering that it had reached the ears of Mr Fox, from whom he so much wanted to conceal it, and that for very good reasons, as he had been so bountiful a friend to him, he writes a letter to Mr Clewer which we shall produce, and incloses in it a letter, which he desires Mr. Clewer would write to Mr Fox, to disavow it; and to deny that there was any mortgage actually made. This will be very strong evidence, to shew that the prisoner was really sensible that the lease which was delivered to Mr Clewer, and shewn to Mr Fox, would not bear the light.</p>

               <p>In regard to the first charge, of actually forging the lease, the circumstance to prove it will be, that it is all of the prisoner's own handwriting. As to time and place, when and where it was is done, it is impossible to know and prove exactly in what secret corner, or in what place, a man does transactions of this nature. And therefore, as to the time when it was done, it must be gathered from this violent presumption, that it was done at the time when the person stood in need of that forgery, in order to receive an advantage by it.</p>
               <p>As to the place where this lease was uttered and published, knowing it to be forged, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240045"/> will be made extreamly clear. It was at the chambers of Mr Priddle in the Paper-Buildings in the Temple; and that it cannot be the real lease executed by Mr Fox is plain, because Mr Thomas will prove the two leases ingrossed by him were of his own hand-writing, down to the words (In witness whereof, &amp;c.) The counterpart produced is so and the rest will be proved to be Mr Ayliffe's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>It will be proved also, not to be the same by the prisoner's own declarations to Mr Fannen, one of the subscribing witnesses, near the time of the execution of the deed at Mr Fox's, when the prisoner expressing his joy, and declaring the goodness of his master, Mr Fox, said, that he had got Rusley conveyed to him at 35 l. per year. There is likewise another strong proof of it; Mr Ayliffe had a servant named Lodge, (who will be called) to whom the prisoner delivered that lease which he had of Mr Fox, with some other writings, near the time when it was executed, and then said, Mr Fox had granted him a lease of Rusley at 5 l. per year; but Mr Lodge will prove to you, that he had the curiosity to look into that very deed, and he saw it was 35 l. a year. Gentlemen, these circumstances will be very clear evidence to shew, this lease at 5 l. a year was forged, from his own declaration to Fannen that it was 35 l. per year, and his declaration afterwards to Lodge that it was 5 l. per year, but when the deed was looked into by him, it appeared to be thirty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>The lease now produced will be proved to be a lease forged, and wrote by the prisoner, and in order to raise a sum of money, he has made it 5 l. instead of 35 l. a year, which makes a great difference in the rent reserved.</p>
               <p>And it will be clearly proved too, that he published this lease with intention to defraud Mr Clewer, who advanced him a large sum of money upon it. These are circumstances which we shall lay before you; and when we have done so, I make no doubt but you will discharge your consciences, and find the prisoner guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any request being made, and by whom, to keep this mortgage a secret?</p>

               <p>King's Counsel. Do you remember any person applying to you, the latter end of the year 1758, to get two parts engrossed of a lease of Rusley-park, in Wiltshire, in the name of Ayliffe?</p>
               <p>Jones. I did three parts of a lease, Fox and Ayliffe; my clerk Thomas engrossed two of them, and Henzell the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240047"/>Q. Were there any particular instructions given you by the person who brought the draft?</p>
               <p>Jones.

               <p>Mr Fannen called again.</p>

               <p>L. Ch. Justice. How many did you see executed?</p>
               <p>Fannen. There were only two executed the lease and the counterpart; the first by Mr Fox and the other by Mr Ayliffe.</p>

               <p>Fannen. I am: I have been well acquainted with his hand-writing these thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your name, which is set there as a witness, like your hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Fannen. There is an imitation of my handwriting, but it is a very bad one.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Is your hand-writing always the same ?</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Then, what reason have you to say, it is a bad imitation of it?</p>
               <p>Fannen. Because it is not like it; it is intended to imitate mine, but compare that with mine upon the counterpart, and you'll see a very great difference.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Look at these (producing three several letters) are these your handwriting ?</p>
               <p>Fannen. (He takes them in his hand) these are my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>They were all three delivered into court.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Can you positively swear, that your name on that lease is not of your hand-writing ?</p>
               <p>Fannen. I do.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Justice. The lease from Mr Fox to the prisoner is dated in November 1758. Was you a witness in that month, or a short time before or after, to any other deed between Mr Fox and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fannen. No, my Lord, I remember being a witness to this counterpart executed by the prisoner, and to the original executed by Mr Fox, but to no other that year.</p>

               <p>Q. Does it appear to you to have been intended to imitate your hand?</p>
               <p>Hobson. It was certainly intended to imitate it?</p>
               <p>Q. Does it imitate your writing?</p>
               <p>Hobson. There are two letters here particularly very bad; the H is much wider than I write it, and the turn of the n is not at all like mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the counterpart of the lease. He takes it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Hobson. I remember I was witness to the prisoner's executing this counterpart, and to Mr Fox's executing the original.</p>

               <p>King's Counsel. Whether was you a witness either in the month of November or December, or before or after, to any parchment-deed at all, besides this that you have proved?</p>
               <p>Hobson. I do not remember that I was.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Are you acquainted with Mr Fox's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hobson. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with him?</p>
               <p>Hobson. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hobson. About eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the name H. Fox to this deed, (pointing to the forged lease) of Mr Fox's hand-writing ?</p>
               <p>Hobson. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Tell us why you think so.</p>
               <p>Hobson. Because of the I in the H. (pointing to the first limb of the H, and turn of the x.)</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Look at those X's, and tell us wherein they differ from this. Producing some papers signed H. Fox.</p>
               <p>Hobson. The turn of the X is carried more round in this than in those of Mr Fox's writing.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Do you think it is possible, in the course of a gentleman's signing deeds, to write always just alike?</p>
               <p>Hobson. It is possible to write very much alike.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Do you know what business Mr Ayliffe was formerly?</p>
               <p>Hobson. I know no more than that he was a steward to Mr Fox.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Have you observed any difference between Mr Fox's signing, when he franks a letter, or when he signs any instrument ?</p>
               <p>Hobson. There is a difference.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Can you describe that difference?</p>
               <p>Hobson. Mr Fox makes his X's different in a frank, from what he does at other times.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Look at his name on this paper, is this his writing?</p>
               <p>Hobson. (He takes it in his hand) This is his writing.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Is that X like the x to the deed? Compare them together.</p>
               <p>Hobson. If you look upon them together, you will see a great difference.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Look at this paper. (Producing a letter frank'd with Mr Fox's name.)</p>
               <p>Hobson. (He takes it in his hand) There is but very little difference except in the X.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Is not the top of this I of the H larger? (Shewing him a frank.)</p>
               <p>Hobson. It is; but perhaps this may be of the prisoner's own making; for he used to frank sometimes in Mr Fox's name.</p>
               <p>The letters and papers were delivered into court.</p>

               <p>Netherton. This is not his hand-writing; the manner in which this is wrote, in regard to the shaping of the letters, is not like his hand. Mr Fannen makes the strokes of his N farther asunder, and rather freer and sharper, and turns the bottom of his J more round.</p>

               <p>Lodge. I have been frequently backwards and forwards with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time in December 1758 acquaint you with Mr Fox's having granted him a lease of Rusley-Park ?</p>
               <p>Lodge. I copied a draught to carry to Mr Paterson, and therein left a blank for the rent. Mr Ayliffe told me he did not know what the rent would be. It might be 5 l. a year, or it might be a pepper-corn; I wrote it, and and I believe he carried it, in my own handwriting, to Mr Paterson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards deliver a lease to you which was executed?</p>
               <p>Lodge. Yes: I can't directly say the time; but, I believe, it was in December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time tell you what the rent reserved was?</p>
               <p>Lodge. No: not at that time; I looked to see.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find it to be?</p>
               <p>Lodge. I found it to be thirty-five pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he give it you?</p>
               <p>Lodge. He gave it me at Mr Priddle's chambers, or coming from thence; I took and put it in my pocket, and going to a vault, having no waste paper, this being done up in a new'spaper; I took it out to tear off a piece of that paper, and then I had the curiosity to see what the rent of the lease was, and I saw it was thirty-five pounds in words at length; and it was in the same hand-writing as this counterpart is, as high as a person can carry it in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any name to it?</p>
               <p>Lodge. Yes, there was H. Fox to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr Ayliffe originally?</p>
               <p>Lodge. I have known him a great many years; I believe he kept a school.</p>

               <p>Lodge. At Lineham in Wilts.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this deed and the signature H. Fox; (shewing him the forged lease) whose writing is the name H. Fox subscribed to it?</p>
               <p>Lodge. It appears to have a strong resemblance of Mr Ayliffe's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? Have you ever seen him write Mr Fox's name?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240051"/>Lodge. I have two or three times seen him frank letters with Mr Fox's name; and it looks like the command of his hand, though wrote larger than the franks.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. How did the prisoner sign the franks?</p>
               <p>Lodge. He used to make the franks in the same manner as Mr Fox does.</p>
               <p>The forged lease read and compared with that set forth in the indictment.</p>
               <p>L. Ch. Justice. Are the words thirty-five pounds in the reddendum and covenant of the counterpart of the genuine lease in words at length; and is there any razure in either of them in the lease set forth in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Clerk of Arraigns. The rent in the counterpart is in words at length, and there is no razure in the other.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. My Lord, we rest it here.</p>

               <p>Cruse. I was subpoena'd last Monday, and came up here from the country; I have not been paid for my journey nor expences; therefore, I hope I shall be considered.</p>
               <p>L. Ch. Justice. That is never done in cases of felony.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Do you know Mr Fox?</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any lease he executed to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cruse. No: I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear Mr Fox make any declaration concerning any lease he had granted to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cruse. He said he had agreed to give him a lease at thirty-five pounds a year; and that if he signed one for five pounds a year it was an imposition, that is all, I know of it.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Explain that?</p>
               <p>Cruse. The draft of the lease was thirty-five pounds (as Mr Fox said), but the lease that he had signed he never read it.</p>

               <p>Brown. The first glance of it shews me a great aukwardness; it is not Mr Fox's handwriting, but a very bad imitation of it; there is a stiffness in this that I never observed in Mr Fox's writing.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. I am an Attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this deed ( shewing him the forged deed) did you ever see this in Mr Fox's hands?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. No, Sir, I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not Mr Fox make some acknowledgment to you?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. That was matter of private conversation; Mr Fox asked me if I knew any thing with respect to the lease of Rusley-Park.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. I attended Mr Fox at Holland House, he said, Mr Ayliffe had made it 5 l. instead of thirty-five pounds, and seemed then to look upon it not as a forgery, but as a fraud and imposition. He said, he first intended it should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240052"/> be 40 l. a year, but being desirous that he should have it upon reasonable terms, ordered it to be made 35 l. but said, Ayliffe had imposed upon him. That was nearly the sense of what passed at that time.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. When was this?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. This was about the latter end of July last.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Was this before Mr Clewer had shewed Mr Fox the lease mortgaged to him?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. It was after that, I think, Mr Fox told me he had seen the deed; but I will not be positive to that, I think he said it was made 5 l. instead of 35 l.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Did Mr Fox treat it as an imposition, or as a forgery?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. I believe Mr Fox then thought that the lease he executed was 5 l. instead of 35 l.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Justice, to the counsel for the prisoner. If you build upon Mr Fox's opinion of this matter you may call him as a witness, and have the benefit of his testimony, although they cannot call him on the part of the Crown.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Mr Fox is near at hand, and will be forth-coming if they desire it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. No, we do not desire it.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Are you sure Mr Fox told you he had seen it?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. I think he told me so, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Did he tell you any thing of the counterpart?</p>
               <p>Bonnell. I think he mentioned it; but to be particular I cannot.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. My Lord, we now shall call witnesses to the prisoner's character.</p>
               <p>Lord Chief Justice. It is clear Mr Fox himself had formerly a very good opinion of him, by employing him as his steward.</p>

I have one particular reason to look upon him to be an honest man, he had turned out a servant of Mr Fox's, I applied to him to employ him again; no, said he, I'll employ no person that will not regard the interest of Mr Fox, my honour will not let me do it: for Mr Fox's interest is in question, as several people have complained to me of him.</p>

               <p>King's Counsel. Was there any mention made of an oath of secrecy?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I cannot say that; it was desired to be kept a secret.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Who desired that?</p>

               <p>King's Counsel. Was Mr Ayliffe by when the Attorney mentioned it?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. What was said?</p>
               <p>Bradley. It was said Mr Fox would take it ill, if he knew that Rusley-Park was mortgaged or sold; and he therefore was very desirous it should not be known.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Who said that?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Really I can't say which of them said it; it was spoke when the mortgage was signed.</p>
               <p>King's Counsel. Who was the Attorney?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Mr Priddle was; I think he repeated those words; but I can't recollect positively who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Was it in my hearing?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I can't say you heard it; you was there when this deed was signed.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Is it an uncustomary thing for a mortgagor to desire it might be kept a secret, and not be exposed, that he has mortgaged his estate?</p>
               <p>Bradley. It is often desired.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Do you think, that if a mortgagee is paid his money, there is any necessity to disclose the mortgage?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I should think not.</p>

This piece of dimity lay in the window; the prisoner draw'd it nearer to her; I kept a good eye on her, and while I went to the other end of the shop, the dimity was gone from the place where it lay.</p>

               <p>Griffith. I saw her draw it near her, and lay her elbow upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Griffith. I did; she had us'd to come to our shop, and we had missed things several times. I observed her to shuffle something about her stays; I guess'd she had it there. There was another woman in the shop, she had bought something and she went out, I stepp'd after her, and told her the case, and desired her to go back, which she did; then the prisoner went out, and I after her, and brought her in again; I charg'd her with taking the dimity, and she took and threw it over the counter.</p>

I went out, and this young man came out after me, and told me one of the women that were in the shop had taken something; I stepped back with him; then the prisoner went out, and he after her, and brought her back, and I saw her fling the piece of dimity over the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the shop before the prisoner and the other that came with her?</p>

I have been trusted with a thousand pounds to pay 150 men, my Lord, and my King; ask Mrs Jones, if I ever wronged her of any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Mrs Jones. I beg to be excused answering that question; for I can say nothing to her advantage, I am sure.</p>

I got a warrant and took her up; after that, she owned she had taken the things mentioned in the indictment, and had pawned them at Mr Fryer's in Wych-street, for 3 s. or 3 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she live with you then?</p>
               <p>Folger. Yes. This was a week after I missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to let it pass so long?</p>
               <p>Folger. I told her, If I had but the things I would let it pass.</p>
