What do you want?

I am a shoemaker, at 1, Frederick-place, Kings<lb/>land-road—on Sunday, 10th May, I was with Corbey at the Barge-house bear-shop, between 4 and 5—I had been in his company all day—before getting to the public-house I had seen the prisoners behind us some distance—I went in and had a pint of stout and a pot of ale, and then saw them outside the door—Corbey then went out at the front door, and Gilks' brother said to me, "Your friend has gone to Edmonton Station"—I said, "Well, I shall go after him;" and I went after him, as I thought—I got about 300 yards, and happened to meet a friend and looked back, and then saw Corbey and the prisoners alongside the river, just over the bridge—Huns was on one side of the prosecutor and Gilks on the other, and the other two were behind—I saw Gilks put his leg behind him, and try to throw him down—Gilks took his watch, tried to unscrew it first, and because he could not do it quick enough, he broke it—I went up to him, and said, "You have got his watch, and if you give it to me, I won't look you up"—he said, "I shan't"—I said, "Then I will make you" and I caught hold of his collar—he had the watch in his hand, and as I was looking after the other for a minute or two, he got away, ran along about twenty yards with the watch, and threw it into the water—it was quite light—it was not a knife he threw in—it was the watch—after that I ran through the river after them, and Huns kicked me directly I got across—I had two struggles with them, and kept them in view till they were given in charge—I said if they did not go I should give them in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, King-street, Stepney—I was about three months and a fortnight in Yates' service at 86, Wheeler-street—I do not remember in what month I left—I know the prisoner—I have seen him at Yates' house four or five weeks continuously—I remember his bringing a dark bag, with a light coat and some pairs of trousers light and dark—I did not see more than one coat—I think they were all in one bag—I did not see that he had my parcel or bundle—my master was not at home when he came, and he left the clothes there—on the Sunday evening a Jew man came and looked it them—I do not know whether he purchased them—I do not think he took any of them away—at the time the prisoner brought the clothes a man's portrait was taken out of the coat pocket—I had a look at it, and he had the same clothes on as those the German stole—there was a pair of black kid gloves, and he put them and the portrait in the fire.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 320). On Monday morning, 23d May, about 1 o'clock, I heard a man screaming in Bluegate-fields, Victoria-street—I beard a man say, "I have got it," and saw Hurley leave the crowd and go into his own house, about ten yards from the crowd—I knew him before—the prosecutor, came up, very much excited, and the worse for liquor—I saw Brown standing in the crowd, dressed as she is now—I believe she it Hurley's sister—I apprehended them both in the neighbourhood about ten minutes afterwards—I told them the charge—Hurley said that he was not there, he was in bed at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hurley. Q.</hi> I live at No. 6, do I not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the crowd was opposite the court by your house—I cannot say who it was that said, "I have got it"—I had hold of the two witnesses, and held them till the prosecutor came up; he said that they were there, and I told them to come to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hurley's Defence.</hi> I hope you will take into consideration that the prose<lb/>cutor first said that he was lying at the end of the street, and then in the middle of the road. There is no lamp in the street, and it would be impos<lb/>sible, unless you know a person well, to recognise anybody by his features. The prosecutor was so intoxicated that he could know nothing. I had been to a meeting, and taken too much to drink; I laid on the bed till 12 o'clock, when I went out to get something to drink, but the houses were shut. I was standing at my door, and saw the last witness coming up. I stepped across and said, "Is your name on the bill to perform at the Phoenix on Monday night?" He said, "It is." I saw the prosecutor stop Lynes, and went in-doors and took no notice, because there are always <hi rend="italic">rows</hi> in that neigh<lb/>bourhood. I was sitting in-doors, and my sister came in. She offered me some gin, which she had at home in a bottle. I went out for it, but had not</p>

               <p>gone two steps when the policeman said, "I want you, and you too." I went to the station. The prosecutor was intoxicated. Is it right for me to be convicted on a drunken man's evidence? He does not say that he got up and was attacked a second time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bonnet manufacturer, and live at 24, Stewart street, Spitalfields—I knew the deceased, William Henry Doggett, twenty or thirty years—he lived at 19, Shoreditch, and was an ironmonger; he had a Shop there—the prisoner was living with him; she is his wife—he was 38 when he died—for some months before his death I had been in the habit of seeing him at his residence—he was suffering from dropsy, and had been con<lb/>fined to his house fur some months—when I saw him it was in his bed-room—when I have been there the prisoner was generally drunk—I have heard that they have been married six or seven years, but I don't know. (Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that in this case he was entitled to call for strict proof of marriage, the allegation being that death arose from neglect of duty on the part of the prisoner; mere cohabitation involved no duty; the only recognised duties were the natural and the paid; if a nurse undertook the charge of a patient for hire, no doubt a duty would arise; there were also the natural duties arising from the relationship of husband and wife; in this case there was nothing but the fact of the prisoner's being a wife that would imply any duty, and, therefore, as in a case of crim. con., strict proof of mar<lb/>riage was necessary.</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">BARON BRAMWELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that this case intro<lb/>duced some novelty, although, perhaps, the principle was not a new one; mere cohabitation clearly carried with it no duty, but it might be a question sup<lb/>posing the man to be incompetent, from his condition of mind or body, to take care of himself, and the prisoner had charge of him, whether there was any duty towards him on her part, and whether, if he died by reason of the non<lb/>performance of that duty, she would be responsible; it had been said that strict proof of marriage was not necessary except in two cases, crim. con. and bigamy; he was very much inclined to think that the contention of Mr. Serjeant Ballantine was right; that, for there to be a duty, there must be the relationship of husband and wife, parent and child, other relationship imposing a duty of care; but if that were so, it might be proved in the ordinary way, by repute.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">was not prepared to argue that that might not be so; he only felt it right to mention the matter, that it might not be assumed that the objection was not open to him.</hi>) At the time of his death, I should my the deceased was not in a very sound state of mind to suffer what he</p>

I am an inmate of St. Luke's workhouse—on the morning of 27th March I was assisting in the relieving-office—I heard a noise at the gate where Sully was, and went to see what was the matter—I found the prisoner and Sully quarrelling—the prisoner had his hand on some iron railing close to the gate—I went up to him and asked him to go out, at the same time taking his hand from the railing—he made no reply, but used some abusive language to the deceased—he struck at the deceased two or three times, but I cannot say whether he hit him or not—the deceased instantly fell, but whether or not from the effect of the blows I cannot say, and the prisoner flung himself upon his body—I and a man named Hill took him off with some difficulty—we were in the act of taking him out when Mr. Gilchrist came up and ordered us to detain him—I heard the old man say, "My God! my thigh is broken!"—when the old man fell I was within a yard or two of him—I did not strike the prisoner—he was very violent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; if you had been I should have seen it; but you must have been struck, for you had a black eye—before the deceased was on the ground I only laid hands on you, so far as to remove your hand from the iron-railing—after you fell on the deceased, Hill and I removed you from his body with difficulty to get you out at the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at 240, City-road—I am the medical officer of St. Luke's workhouse—I knew the old man Sully, and was called to attend him on 27th March—I found him in the infirmary, and proceeded to examine his thigh; it was severely fractured, and the bone was nearly protruding through the skin—I attended him from that time up to 17th May, when he died—he died from the irritative exhaustion of an unhealed fracture—he was a very hale man for his age, which was eighty-three, but he gradually sank—there must have been considerable violence used, but how it is difficult to say—there must have been more violence than a simple fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose the thigh was broken by the deceased's own weight in falling to the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was broken by some one falling on him; as if some person had dropped on him with the knee; but that is only an inference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I knocked at the workhouse door about a quarter-past 10, and asked for relief. The deceased, who opened the door, made me no answer, but slammed the door against my forehead. In a moment of ex<lb/>citement, I said I would give it to the old rascal, little thinking what would happen. I waited outside a few minutes, and seeing some people go into the workhouse tried to go with them. The deceased seized me by the neck, and Hill, who was crossing the yard, came and struck me on the eye Bowker then came, and Hill pulled me down and tried to put me out.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080051"/>
               <p>Several people about the door cried "Shame!" I was then on my back, and on getting up the deceased attacked me a second time, seizing me by the neck. We struggled together, and both fell, and that was how the accident happened. I had no desire to injure the old man.</p>

I am an architect, and live at Brecon, South Wales—on Saturday, 8th May, I was staying at the Crown Hotel, Leicester-square, and about 12 o'clock that night I was near Mile End-gate—a man asked me for something for a bed—he really appeared to be deserv<lb/>ing, and I gave him a shilling—some time afterwards I was walking along to get a cab, and received a very severe blow with some hard instrument on my head, which completely stunned me, at the same moment a man, what appeared to be in a recess or doorway, sprang out, and struck me, in far less time than I am describing it, a severe blow on the forehead—his fist was armed with some hard substance I am positive, and I fell—I recollect some man tearing at my ring to get it off—here are the marks of his fingernail—as I came to my senses, I heard people say, "They are robbing the man; look at the blood"—I also heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and a paceing down the street—five or ten minutes afterwards, I found several women round me, bathing my head with hot water, and I found I had lost my silk-handkerchief, a gold chain, three little seals, two keys, and a silver watch—I believe Brock to be the man who struck me, but I should be very sorry to take away the liberty of anybody—I believe he is the man, from his light-dress—just before the blow I saw Hancock pass me and come back—this if my handkerchief and watch—I swear to it from a little indent which I did when I was fishing—I will describe the seals without looking at them; they are two cornelian stones and two other stones, and a light pink one—the larger one has a dove upon it—I also lost a sovereign, and about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my watch was worth 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my chain 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I said that I did not want it; I had just had one; but with a little persuasion I had a cup of coffee and a slice of bread and butter. They then asked me questions about the robbery, and we took a walk, but could not find Clark. They told me to bring him to the station, which I did the next day, and Glark gave him the chain; with that they took us and gave as a pot of beer and some tobacco at the Prince of Wales, and about an hour afterwards they came and told us the inspector wanted to see us. He came over, and said he was in duty bound to send us before a Magistrate.</p>

I am the wife of Edward Upjohn, and am house<lb/>keeper at 2, Lower Belgrave-street—Mr. Harrington Balfour lodges there—on 14th May we had a dog in the house belonging to him, and it was missed on that day—on Monday the 25th, Kendillon called at the house, and inquired if Mr. Upjohn was at home; I said, "No"—he said, "I have called respecting the dog you have lost" (bills had been printed)—I said, "Mr. Upjohn is not at home, can I go with you to see the dog?—he said, "No, you had better not; it would be better Mr. Upjohn should come"—I said he was out of town, and would not be home till late, and we arranged that on the Tuesday morning Mr. Upjohn should go to 31, Regent-street, Chelsea, the address given by Kendillon—I understood him to give the name of Dillon, but it might be a mistake—I communicated what had passed to Mr. Upjohn when he came home—the next day, the 26th, Kendillon called again, and said he had called respecting the man who had previously called on my husband—I then said, "5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a great deal of money to give without the dog being produced," and he said, "They are always sure to produce the right dog"—he then went away—on the 27th he called again, accompanied by the other prisoner—both of them spoke to me, more especially Crowley—they said they had called respecting the dog again—I told them Mr. Up<lb/>john had gone to 31, Regent-street, Chelsea, to see them still further about it, and I asked Crowley how long it would take him to go to Shoreditch (they had stated before that the dog was at Whitechapel)—he said, "Two hours"—they then said they would go away, and wait outside half an hour—at the end of that time Crowley came back alone—I sent Mr. Balfour's valet for him; Mr. Upjohn had returned in the mean time, and these was a police<lb/>man in the house—he heard anything further that took place.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Hunt, a baker, at 25, Helen-street, Clerkenwell—on 10th February we were living at 105, Goswell-street—about 2 o'clock on that day I saw the prisoner, I believe; I firmly believe he is the man—he was getting into a cart from the private door of our house—Thomas Quarry, his wife and four children, lived in the house besides us—I went down stairs, and saw ten or eleven sacks of flour in the passage—I did not count them—that was after I saw the prisoner drive the horse and cart away—I did not see the sacks again—they were gone before 4 o'clock—the cart was empty when it went away—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner who drove it away.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Norris and Chaplin, wine and spirit brokers—we have had transactions with the bank<lb/>rupt for some time—these warrants have all been through our hands—we have been in the habit of making advances to the bankrupt, and made an advance to him in February—we keep an account of the money advanced, but not of the specific securities that we receive—I have no memorandum to refer to which will tell me when we received these warrants—by referring to my book, I see by a cheque that we made an advance on the 26th of February, of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there have not been any warrants since that 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by way of loan, but there may have been by way of exchange—we should not advance the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without security—I can give an opinion as to these warrants—I should think, looking at the date on the warrants, that we must have had them somewhere about that time—we have made no advance since the 28th of February—I am not able to say whether those are the warrants we received for the advance, or for the exchange of other warrants—the exchanges are not entered in our books—we keep books of the moneys advanced, but not of the securities—we regard the warrants as bullion—there were exchanges after the 28th of February—I do not think they were to such a large extent as those warrants would represent—I was examined in the Bankruptcy Court—I have no notion now to what extent there were exchanges after the 28th of February—I cannot tell whether those sixteen warrants were deposited at once or not—our first transaction with the bankrupt was on the 18th of March, 1861—we have sold wine for him; we did not purchase wine from him—I can tell you the total amount of our transactions since that time, but not the amount of our advances—up to June, 1861, they were 8,590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to January, 1862, 19,520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; from January, 1862, to June, 1862, they were 21,735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we did not advance any money after the date of the petition in May, 1862—his bills were returned to us—those figures include the dishonoured bills—I have given you the debtor side of the ledger—when we made an advance, we should give him a cheque for the amount agreed upon, which he would leave the warrants—we should not give the cheque without the warrants and we should draw at three months, and that bill would be put into the safe with the warrants—the bill was held as collateral security—we should charge discount about three or four per cent above the Bank rate; eight per cent, if the Bank were five—I have a letter from the bankrupt, dated 26th June, 1861—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was read, and created a charge upon all warrants then or thereafter held by Messrs. Norris &amp; Chaplin, for the payment of all the bankrupt's I liabilities to them, with power, without further consent, in the event of default in the payment of any bill, to sell, and to deduct all charges, commission, &amp;c.; and an undertaking by the bankrupt to reimburse any loss that might arise upon the sale</hi>)—we continued to hold the warrants until the bankruptcy—we realised them on the 19th of June—I cannot tell precisely what those sixteen warrants fetched—I have the details here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not the course of business you have described, of depositing warrants very common in the wine trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very com<lb/>mon with a great number of merchants in the trade—there are several other houses besides ourselves who do the same sort of business with wine mer<lb/>chants very largely—when a person lodges warrants he can show the wine; he cannot take it away—he is permitted to sample it, and sell it, subject to the lien—it is not done secretly by the London Dock Company, but, having deposited the warrants, they allow him to sample the wine; it is a continual occurrence—the exchanges of warrants were not generally large ones—we</p>

               <p>had sold wines for the bankrupt exclusive of the realisation of securities—irrespective of the wine sold under the bankruptcy, which was sold with the consent of the trade assignees, I think we sold some 480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth for him, but I cannot tell the amount of sales—a conversation did occur between me and the bankrupt about his laying down some port wine when he could spare the cash, but I cannot assign any date to it—it was on an occasion when I remarked that some wines were freshly landed, and he said, "It is merely for temporary accommodation, those wines I am going to lay down in the cellar"—there are none of these warrants freshly landed—I do not think we exchanged warrants to so large an extent—I can only speak from my conviction by the entries in the book; I have no absolute knowledge on the subject—when I gave my evidence in the Bankruptcy Court, the circum<lb/>stances were fresh in my mind—if the bankrupt brought fresh warrants we should see that they were of sufficient security, and then let him take the others away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. Q.</hi> When the warrants are in your possession, you are, in fact, the owners of the wine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we could take the wine away on giving up the warrants—we view the warrants as property—we always take an endorsement on the warrant—it does not make over the title in the wine to us; it is simply an endorsed warrant, and we hold it—it is not endorsed specially to us, but in blank—the last deposit of wine previous to the 28th February was on the 17th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, residing at Windsor—before March, 1862, I had bought some wine of the bankrupt, and on the 4th of that month I saw him in Tower-street, and gave him an order for some wine—he then introduced to my notice some port wine, as very fine old wine of Offley &amp; Co.'s shipping—I think it was invoiced at 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per pipe—I men<lb/>tioned also a butt of sherry, which I had previously ordered, but which had not been delivered—I had applied a great number of times for it, and he had put me off some months that he could not get the warrants—he said at this time that they had been mislaid, but that if I pleased, he would clear all the goods then ordered on the following day, that is the port, the butt of sherry, and two or three other common wines which were purchased at the same time—I received an invoice of the whole, and there was a "duty "statement as well; the invoice was 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the duty 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these were accom<lb/>panied by two bills and a letter asking for my acceptance—I accepted them, and returned them by post, on the faith of the wines being in clearance—they were afterwards paid by me—I have never had the wine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the sherry, which had been paid for months before, paid by an acceptance of yours? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It had been paid by an accep<lb/>tance which had been properly retired—I do not remember that the bank<lb/>rupt lent me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the purpose of meeting it—I paid it some considerable time before this occurred; I cannot speak from certain knowledge—it formed part of a transaction with the firm of Lawes, Simon, &amp; Co., and when that partnership was dissolved, the bankrupt was particularly anxious to have all the accounts then owing settled up—it was paid entirely by me—it was all paid before this visit—I keep books, but I have not brought any; I did not think they would be needed—I had not had dealings with the bank<lb/>rupt for a long time; I think they commenced in 1860 or 1861—they have been to the extent of a few hundreds possibly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, carrying on business at 79, Great Tower-street, in partnership with Mr. Boyes, and we are the agents for the "Duff-Gordon" sherry—we had dealings prior to 1862 with the bankrupt, which were generally cash transactions under discount—in March, 1862, he came to us, and stated that the wines he had recently purchased and paid for under discount, were of a character which were getting him a very good private connection, and he then required some more of the same wine, to pay the duty immediately, to lay down in his new cellars in Mincing-lane—we then agreed to sell him three butts and three hogsheads of sherry of the value of 254<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at six months' credit—I gave him these four delivery-orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), signed by myself—we have never been paid for the wine—the inducement for our parting with the wine was our having discounted a bill from Sharp Simon for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore we knew that he had some capital to go on with, otherwise we certainly should not have given him credit for this wine—it was his having required discount for a very good hill of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which induced us—we knew he had that amount of capital, and, from his own account, he was getting a very good private connection from the quality of those wines.</p>

I was on duty in the Caledonian-road on Saturday morning, 23rd May, and saw the prisoners coming out of the Camden-road into the Caledonian-road about half-past three—I followed them, and afterwards saw them come out of the garden gate of Tillery-house on to the pavement—that was about a quarter to four—I had ample oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing them—I had seen them before, and knew them before—I then followed them into the Holloway-road, and met police constable 282 S—we both followed the prisoners to Holloway-gate, and I took Ayres to the station—Pearson was taken at the same time by the other constable they gave their names and addresses, and as they had nothing, they were allowed to go.</p>

About four in the morning of 23rd May, I saw the prisoners in Holloway-road, being followed by the last witness—they were taken to the station-house—I asked them what they had been doing—Ayres said he was only out for a walk, for the benefit of his health, and he had called on the other to take a walk with him—we took their names and addresses—I previously knew where Ayres lived—I went to Tillery-house after that, and saw the footmarks on the mould—I also saw some dirt on the iron railings in front of the kitchen window, and saw the coats in the area—I also found marks of some nails on the window sill of the drawing room, as if somebody had placed their feet there—the catch of the window was pushed back, but the window was down—I called Mr. Farmiloe up, and we examined the place—I found some gravel from the garden on the cushions of the chairs in the drawing room—it was easy to get to the drawing room window from the garden—about nine o'clock that morning; I took the prisoners into custody, on suspicion of breaking into a house at Holloway—they said it was not them, they knew nothing about it—I took a boot from each of the prisoners and compared it with the footmarks on the mould—I made an impression alongside of the footprints, and they made the same impressions—on the window sill there was a mark caused by some nails—several nails in one of the boots corresponded with these marks on the window sill.</p>

               <p>the entries that I require are in the books of the different societies, which they keep in their possession—I have no memorandum of my own, by which I can tell to what amount I am indebted at this moment—there may be ten bills outstanding with my name on, written by myself—I am sure there are not twenty—they amount generally to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am not liable to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there must be a great deal of it paid, it is being paid every week, and finishes every year—I don't think there is one outstanding now in which I am the borrower and the prisoner the surety—I cannot swear there is not—I always write these documents myself; nobody has ever written my name for me—I never authorized anyone to do so—I have never been security for Murphy or for Gyme—I have known Gyme five years and Murphy fourteen—we have only met together at these clubs, about once a week—we don't drink water there, but not more than a pint of porter, or a glass of gin and water each—there is no society at Hurst's public-house—at one time I went there mostly every evening, but I do not now, since Mr. Hurst has left the house, which was about a month ago—my name is upon all these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all mine—this is one not where I signed for Murphy, but where Murphy signed for me—the writing on the one in question for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is not unlike mine; it is not exactly like mine, I think, by the appearance of it—that is my correct address on the bill; they are generally signed at the latter end of the evening—I signed for the prisoner in March at "The Sovereign" in St. Martin's-lane—I proposed to be surety for him at the end of April, at the Apollo, and this bill was drawn up, but in consequence of the prisoner getting tipsy, and not coming up for the money, it was not finished—I would have been surety for him on that, if he had not been too tipsy to come—I did not know that he was arranging with his creditors at that time—I knew there was an execution in the place, but I did not know what for—that must have been before this bill was presented—I have heard since that he made an arrangement with his creditors, and subsequently went into the Bankruptcy Court—I did not go there yesterday about this—I heard that he had to attend the court—the prisoner made me a suit of clothes—I had them on 21st February—the bill came to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay for them at the time—I afterwards paid him the money in at The Sovereign—I paid him six sovereigns in gold—the last clothes I had of him was on 6th March, the last part of the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on my oath this bill was not handed over to the prisoner in port payment for those clothes—I borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Murphy to pay Gillman—Murphy is here—I did not give Murphy any memorandum for it; he lent it me without that—I often lent him money and he me—not names also; he has been surety for me—I have signed for different members of the club—I have lived at Richmond-buildings eight years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 58, King-street, Woolwich—my late hus<lb/>band was a baker there—the prisoner was my servant—it was her custom to fetch the beer for my supper, and at times she would fetch it in my absence, and put it on one side—on Sunday evening, 10th May, I went out about ten minutes to 9, and returned about a quarter to 11—I knocked at the door, and the prisoner came down and opened the door to me—she was partly undressed, and appeared to have been to bed—I saw the beer on the table, but having been out I did not, want it—I was going to put it away, but per<lb/>ceived a strong smell proceeding from it, which induced me to taste it—I then tasted it a second time, and put it away in a cupboard—next day it dinner-time she asked me if she should fetch the beer—I said, "Yes, fetch me a pint"—she said, "Oh, there is your beer in the cupboard, you did not drink last night"—I said, "Where did you get that beer last night?"—she said, "At Mr. Bayne's"—I said, "There is something the matter with it; I cannot drink it"—she said she had fetched some for herself and some for me, and had drank her own, and there was nothing the matter with it—I asked her who served her—she said, "<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Bayne"—I told her to take it back to them, and ask them if they had not made a great mistake in giving her that for beer—she was some time before she came to take it; which ex<lb/>cited my suspicion, and I took it myself to the house—they tasted it, and from what they told me, I Went back and taxed the prisoner with putting some<lb/>thing into it—the denied it—MR. Bayne afterwards came, and she denied, is his presence, having put anything into it—she waited some time, and he said, "Why do not you say what you have put in it? you have put some poison in it;" and he named different poisons to her—she would not own what she had put into it, and I said that I must have it analyzed—I went into the shop, and when I returned Mr. Bayne told me in her presence that she had admitted putting oil of vitriol into the beer—she did not deny it—we asked her what she did it for—she said that she did not know—we pressed her very much, and she said that she did not do it with any intention to do me any harm—I told her to leave my service, I should not require her any longer—I was with her while she was putting her bonnet on, and before she went out, she said that another person, who had been in our employ (Clifford) had told her to put it into the beer—she was there for some time, and I asked her why she should tell her to do so; she said that she did not know, but she met him a fortnight previously—after a time she left the house, and on the Thursday morning she went to the station and gave herself in custody, but I was not there—she said, in my husband's presence, that if he would go out of the room she would say who told per to do it—he went out when I asked him, and I was left alone with the prisoner, who said that Mr. Clif<lb/>ford had told her to put it in—on the following day I went to her mother's house—my husband went there before me, and when I got there she said that Mr. Roberts told her to put it into the beer, and that would settle me—my husband denied it, and said he knew nothing at all about it, and I said that he knew nothing about it—I said, "Why do not you tell the truth?" and after pressing her she said that Mr. Roberts had nothing to do with it, and Mr. Clifford had nothing to do with it; she did it of her own free will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bottle in which vitriol is kept at my house; it is used for cleaning copper.</p>

I said to him, 'Who shall I say?" He said, 'Say Clifford,' and I then put it into the beer, and shortly afterwards went to bed"—she also said that her master had seduced her last boxing-night; that her mistress was out that night, that he threw her down on the sofa, hurt her head, seduced her, and gave her seven pence; that he had had connection with her several times since, and she had had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from him—I told her it required a Magisterial investigation, and I must take her in custody—I took her to the station, and charged her, on her own confession, with attempting to administer the poison—I received this bottle from Mr. Bayne.</p>

I had my supper, and covered Mrs. Roberts' beer over. After George had had his supper. I left Mr. Roberts in the parlour, and went up stairs to see the baby to bed; when I went down Mr. Roberts was out at the back. He shut the shutter. The beer was on a table. He west into the wash-house, came in, and said that Mrs. Roberts was out till 12 on Thursday, 11 on Friday, and half-past 10 on Saturday. He told me to pour it in, and that would settle her. I said, "What shall I say?" He said, "Say Clifford." He told me to cover it over, and I put a plate on the top, I said, "Shall I sit up?" He said, "No, go to bed; and if you say any<lb/>thing about the beer, I will settle you." I went to bed, and afterwards heard a knocking. I let Mrs. Roberts in, and went to bed. Next morning I was laying the cloth for dinner, and there was a quarrel up stairs, mistress and master were fighting. He came down and asked me who had told mistress about the beer. I said, "I have not" He said, "If you have I will transport you. When your mistress comes down, ask her if she wants any beer; and if she says yes, tell her she has not drunk the beer you got last night. She did so, and I told her there was the beer she left last night She asked me who I got it of; I said, "<hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Bayne." She told me to take it there. While I was getting my bonnet she took it herself, and came back and said that it was poisoned. She spoke to Mr. Roberts, but I did not hear him make any answer. She walked into the shop, and said she would not have me in the shop any longer. I went up stairs, changed my dress, and went home. At night my father went down to Mr. Roberts The inspector sent down a policeman to ask if she would charge me. The inspector came back and said that Mrs. Roberts said she had no charge against me at all, and I bad better go home. I told them that Mr. Roberts had to do with it, and father came back and said that Mr. Roberts was coming down.

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother—when Mr. Roberts came into the sitting-room she was behind the door—her father said, "Eliza, speak the truth; recollect, you stand before God and man"—she said to Mr. Roberts, "You are the man' who took the bottle off the shelf; and told me to pour it in the beer"—Mrs. Roberts came in, and he said, "What do you think, the lying girl says that I told her to do it So respectable as I have been, do you think I should want to poison my wife? Paxton, do not you believe it;" and he said, "If you are satisfied, I am"—on the Monday night I was up at Mrs. Roberts', and she did not wish to give her in charge, as they wished it to drop—I said I should go to the station, as my daughter wished to give information about it, as she did not do it of her own accord, and on Sunday she went up to the inspector—Mrs. Roberts called my daughter a dirty slut and what my house, and that frightened the girl, and she would not say any more.</p>

I live at 6, Park-road-terrace, Forest-hill—I am an attendant in the British Museum—I and the prisoner married two sisters—the prisoner's wife occupies a house next to mine at Forest-hill—there is a garden attached to each house, divided by a wall about five feet high—my cellar window looks out upon the garden, underneath the back parlour window—it is about ten yards from the garden wall; the kitchen is built</p>

Shortly after 3 o'clock, on the morning of 20th May, I went to the prosecutor's house, in consequence of an alarm of fire—when I got there the fire was out—I accompanied Mr. Neale in making a search of the premises—I found that the house had been entered by the back kitchen window; the cross-pieces of the frame work had been broken out, and the whole four panes of glass smashed—the bottom part of the heavy framework had a slight cut in the lower left-hand corner—when that window was removed a person could get in or out—I found that the gaspipe had been out in two places, one about three or four inches from the meter, and the other about twelve or fifteen inches—one was a cross cut and the other lengthways—these are the pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appeared to be done by some rough instrument; not cut clean as with a knife—I was present when the inspector found this shoemaker's knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying about a yard from the meter; it has been notched like a saw; such an instrument as this would produce those cuts—I saw this knife fitted into the cuts in the framework of the cellar window, and they exactly corresponded—the gas was turned off when I got there—if it had been turned on the flame from these outs would have been about a foot below the ceiling above it—I found the boards there burnt for three or four yards immediately over the pipe—there had also been a second fire close against the door leading from the passage to the cellar—there was a mat outside that cellar-door, which had been slightly burnt—there was a pecu<lb/>liar smell of some strong spirit having been near that spot—I did not find any spirit there—I afterwards found some at the prisoner's shop at King's-cross; it had a very strong turpentine smell—I found this long meter key lying in the prosecutor's cellar, about a yard from the meter—there were a number of wine and beer bottles there; some appeared to have been recently broken, by the necks being knocked off—I examined the outside of the premises—I found traces on a dust bin at the back of the scullery in Mr. Neale's garden, of some person having got over the wall—the dust-bin is within about a yard of the top of the wall; a person could easily get over—on the other side of the wall I found the footmarks of one person; there were not more than two or three distinct footmarks on the mould close to the wall, within a foot and half of it—the footmarks pointed towards the wall—on the Friday morning succeeding the fire, after apprehending the prisoner, I went to his shop, 217, Gray's-inn-lane—it was a shoemaker's—in a cupboard in a parlour at the back of the shop, I found this</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 21). Shortly after 3 o'clock, on the morning of 20th May, I went to the prosecutor's house, in consequence of an alarm of fire—when I got there the fire" was out—I accompanied Mr. Neale in making a search of the premises—I found that the house had been entered by the back kitchen window; the cross-pieces of the frame work had been broken out, and the whole four panes of glass smashed—the bottom part of the heavy framework had a slight cut in the lower left-hand corner—when that window was removed a person could get in or out—I found that the gaspipe had been—cut in two places, one about three or four inches from the meter, and the other about twelve or fifteen inches—one was a cross cut and the other lengthways—these are the pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it appeared to be done by some rough instrument; not cut clean as with a knife—I was present when the inspector found this shoemaker's knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) lying about a yard from the meter; it has been notched like a saw; such an instrument as this would produce those cuts—I saw this knife fitted into the cuts in the framework of the cellar window, and they exactly corresponded—the gas was turned off when I got there—if it had been turned on the flame from these outs would have been about a foot below the ceiling above it—I found the boards there burnt for three or four yards immediately over the pipe—there had also been a second fire close against the door leading from the passage to the cellar—there was a mat outside that cellar-door, which had been slightly burnt—there war a pecu<lb/>liar smell of some strong spirit having been near that spot—I did not find any spirit there—I afterwards found some at the prisoner's shop at King's-cross; it had a very strong turpentine smell—I found this long meter key lying in the prosecutor's cellar, about a yard from the meter—there were a number of wine and beer bottles there; some appeared to have been recently broken, by the necks being knocked off—I examined the outside of the premises—I found traces on a dust bin at the back of the scullery in Mr. Neale's garden, of some person having got over the wall—the dust-bin is within about a yard of the top of the wall; a person could easily get over—on the other side of the wall I found the footmarks of one person; there were not more than two or three distinct footmarks on the mould close to the wall, within a foot and half of it—the footmarks pointed towards the wall—on the Friday morning succeeding the fire, after apprehending the prisoner, I went to his shop, 217, Gray's-inn-lane—it was a shoemaker's shop—in a cupboard in a parlour at the back of the shop, I found this</p>

               <p>bottle containing about half a pint of turpentine varnish—it has a strong turpentine or resinous smell—on Friday the 22d May, the prisoner came to the station at Sydenham; he demanded to know what inquiry the police had been making about him, and by whose authority—I kept him in conver<lb/>sation, sent for Mr. Neale, and he was given into custody—when the priso<lb/>ner was asked he said he had been from his shop to King's-cross that night, and would bring a witness to prove that he was thereafter 12 o'clock—I cut the pipe from the meter about four feet from the front-door, under the passage—I first heard the prisoner's name mentioned on the Wednesday morning after the fire—I am not aware that he went to his house on the previous day—I heard that he went there on Thursday, and that a constable was sent for—the constable who went told me so; he is not here.</p>

I went to the fire about 4 o'clock in the morning—I found the knife and compared it with the marks on the window—the point exactly fitted into the window frame where it had been used—the bottom part of the frame was partially sawn through—I went to the prisoner's house at King's-cross with Best, and a pair of boots were given to me there, which were found in the back-room, used by the prisoner as a bed-room, under a chest of drawers bedstead—it would not require a great effort to put them there; they would just go under—Sergeant Best pulled them out with a stick, and I took possession of them—I did not see them till they were pointed out—I compared the right boot with the traces in the prisoner's garden, it fitted exactly—I made another impression in the mould a few inches off, and it was the exact counterpart of one footmark; I only compared it with one, as the others were not distinct—these nails are quite smooth, and made no impression; it was only the general outline which corresponded, but on the left boot there was some yellow clay, the same as was found on the dust-bin—I have some of it here—there is nothing by which I can distinguish the clay, it is common to both sides of the river—I found this walking stick, standing in a leaning position near the prisoner's dust-bin at the end of the house, and about two paces from the footmarks—Funnell found it; it was given up to him—the right cuff of this coat (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) smells of turpentine, and does so still—I also found a file in a small drawer in the prisoner's shop, which would make such marks as are on the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cadet in the Royal Military Academy, at Woolwich—one day last October I went into the racket-court, and left my gold hunting-watch in my tunic-pocket, in the dressing-room belonging to the racket-ground—upon my return, I missed my watch—I had paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it about six months before—I know the boy Meopham, I used to see him about at that time—he was there frequently, and upon that day—after I missed my watch I gave information to the police, and caused inquiries to be made after it—I asked Meopham if he had seen anybody about the court on that evening, and he said, "Nobody, but two bird-catchers;" two people who had been catching birds, as he supposed—I have since seen my watch—it was shown to me at Walworth about a month ago—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a person examined at the police-court in this matter of the name of Mr. John Purcell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was; I took him there to be examined—I have not brought him here to day—I believe you have got him; he is here—I did not hear him prove that he had seen Mr. Prosser. wearing this watch openly for weeks and weeks—I was present when he was examined—he did not say that to my recollection; I will swear he did not—he told me that he had seen Meopham with the watch—I don't know whether he told the Magistrate so—Purcell told me that Meopham had offered to sell him this very watch.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080113"/>
               <p>therefore that would throw a doubt as to whether he brought his watch there or not He mentioned the loss of his watch in my presence, but never noticed any change in me, nor did I shun his company. Crouch did not say when he took me, that he wanted me about the watch I stole, but about the watch I sold to my master. I had sold a watch to my master, but not that one, and I told him directly what he gave me for it. They were both asking me questions going to the station, and I could not answer them satisfactorily: whatever I said, I said before I was cautioned. You, will find nothing to connect me with the watch.</p>

On 5th June, about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Cross-street, Woolwich, and saw the three prisoners—Bird and Smith immediately ran away, and I took Jackson into custody—I asked him what he had, and he put this jug on the pavement, and took these glasses from his pocket—I asked him where he got the things, and he said he found them—I then took him to the station—I saw the other two prisoners again at half-past 5, near the Arsenal gate, and took them into custody—I afterwards went to Mr. Graham's garden, to the refreshment-room, and found it had been opened and the property stolen—I saw some footprints in the garden, and afterwards took the boots of the three prisoners and compared them with the marks—Bird's and Jackson's corresponded exactly—there were marks of three or four persons, I think; but I could only identify the boots of Jackson and Bird.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not ft letter dated 22nd April, about Mr. Roby's account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, dated from Norfolk-street, Mile-end, where the prisoner lived—he says in that letter, that he has paid it—we should have received that on the 23rd—I believe the prisoner travels for Mr. Holdsworth, as well as for us—when he gets an order for soap, he sends it to us—he gets orders for other things, which he sends to other tradesmen—we did not engage him by salary for the whole year—we paid him accord<lb/>ing to the quantity of work he did—if he got no orders, he got no commis<lb/>sion—we had no power to order him to go to Mr. A. or Mr. B. and get an order—his time was his own—his getting orders or not, was optional with him—these two letters of 15th and 20th May, are in my clerk's writing—they are not written by my direction—I have not seen them they are written by the direction of my brother, who attends to the books, to ask the reason why he had not been to the factory, and in one we tell him that we had had a letter from a customer, asking why we had not sent some soap ordered a fortnight before—his customers were kept separate from the other customers—it was his own connection amongst whom he got orders, if he thought proper, and sent them to us—he was bound to get the money from the per<lb/>son to whom we supplied the goods, for us—we never sent another person to collect his accounts—he always collected them himself—that was the agree<lb/>ment when he was engaged—I think I was there with my brother when that agreement was made—he was to have a commission upon the soap sold and paid for—that was the arrangement—I don't think he had a large con<lb/>nection at that time—very little, I believe—we gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton com<lb/>mission, no salary at all—a man can make a very good living upon that commission if he works—he always brought a list down with him, ready made out generally, I believe—any books he had were his own, we did not supply him with any—we kept an account of the goods that went out, and the moneys owing to us; and accounts were rendered to the prisoner weekly, upon small slips, of the money owing to us from customers—he was not re<lb/>sponsible for the orders—he did not tell me, that if we waited, we should have the money—he did not give me to understand that there was any pro<lb/>bability of his making up the money—he said nothing to me about it, or in my presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner in the habit of coming daily to your place. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, once a week, that was the understanding—he communicated with us by letter, and sent the orders which he had obtained, and came once a week, generally on the Monday, to pay in the money he had collected the week before; and then on the Monday, he would receive the slips, with an account of the money he had to collect in the coming week.</p>

As to the first point he referred to the case of Reg. v. May, 8th Cox Crim. Cases, page</hi> 421. <hi rend="italic">As to the second point, he submitted that, although the prisoner did not pay over the money, there was no concealment, and he only held the cash for the prosecutor; and that the mere non-payment of it at once was not sufficient to constitute embezzlement.</hi>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a surgeon, residing at Fulham—on Monday night, 18th May, or rather, Tuesday morning, at a quarter to 1, I was called to see a man in a cab—he had a large bruise, the size of half an ordinary orange, on the centre of his forehead, and there were abrasions on the bridge and apex of his nose, and on his lip and chin—they might have arisen from a fall on a kerb-stone, or some hard substance—he was quite cold—I gave my opinion that he had been dead full half an hour, and ordered him to be sent to the workhouse—an inquest was held; and, by the Coroner's direction, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem examination</hi>—I found blood ex<lb/>travasated between the skin and the frontal bone under where the bruise existed; and on removing the upper part of the skull, and examining it from within, I found the frontal bone fractured, split through vertically downwards at the internal angle of the left orbit, through the roof of the left orbit as far as the centre of the base of the brain—it was a very extensive fracture as regards its length—it extended almost directly back<lb/>wards to the back of the skull, to the sphenoid bone—I do not think that would kill him at once—I think he died from the shock to the brain; he died from concussion of the brain, produced by the force which produced the fracture—the force would cause great concussion of the brain, which would produce immediate insensibility—this fracture might have been caused by a fall on a kerb-stone—I should judge from what I saw, that the man died without an effort to save himself—a blow struck with great violence behind the ear, might disable a man on the instant, fell him, and he might be utterly unable to help himself—supposing he fell from his feet to the pavement without any external violence, it would not be very likely to produce such an extensive fracture as that—I am not prepared to say that behind the ear is the most dangerous place in which a man could be struck; the bone is rather harder there; but if you go a little above, the bone is thinner, and you would have a greater concussion—I am not prepared to say that a heavy blow behind the ear is more likely to cause concussion than any other part, or to point to any particular part of the head where a blow would produce the most effect—I found the other organs healthy—he was a healthy man.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, was that the mark of a blow which might have had the effect of stunning a man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was not sufficiently extensive to make me believe, unless he had fallen and struck his head first, that he would be insensible; although it might make him reel half round, I do not believe it would have produced sufficient con<lb/>cussion to make him instantly insensible—I put my nose to his face; but as he had been washed, there was no evidence that he had been taking liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follow</hi>:</p>
               <p>" We came out of the Little Wonder singing, and these two were singing, they said, 'Go along, you are two b—s.' We went back, and asked them what they meant, and Cadman buttoned up his coat, and pretty nearly pushed me down. I went up to him, and we sparred, and he and I had two or three rounds in the road; Cadman and I. We were hugging each other against the wall, and Stephens was coming up. I pushed him, and he reeled against the wall, and down he fell. My head began bleeding, and then I went away.</p>
               <p>I have bumps on my head now. I met two or three <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> who were going to Epsom, and I went on the road."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, L</hi>). On Saturday, 25th May, I went to the prisoner's house—he keeps a general-dealer's shop, containing ropes and old metal of different descriptions—his name was not over the door—I found him at a public-house close by, and asked him if he had sold any copper bolts to Israel, who was with me—he said he had—I asked him how he became possessed of them; he said he bought them of a man named Morgan—I asked him if he had any in his possession—he said that he had not—I took him to Redcross-street, where he described Morgan to live, and asked Morgan if he had sold Green any copper bolts; he said he had not—Green said, "You sold me some to-day, and some yesterday"—I said, "You told me previously that you had not any more"—he said, "They are now behind the counter, part of them"—I said, "You told me you had no bolts"—he said, "You asked me the question, but I made no answer to it"—I took him to the station, and then went and searched his house, and found 6¼ lbs. of copper bolts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), marked with the broad arrow, but the marks have been effaced from some of them—they were part behind the counter and part in an adjoining room—I searched the house, and found a room fas<lb/>tened with a padlock—I did not go into it, but returned to the station, and the prisoner was searched by Serjeant Hart in my presence, and a key was handed to me—I asked him if the back room with, the padlock on it was his room—he said, "Yes"—I asked him to show me which key opened that door, and he pointed out the key—Sergeant Hart then went to the house, and brought me some metal of the same description as this—what Hart found is all in this bag—I asked the prisoner if he kept a book; he said no, he did not consider it necessary, as he was not a marine-store dealer—I said, "You are dealing in copper bolts; what do you call those but marine-stores?"—he said he did not consider he had any right to keep a book—on the following Thursday I went to Messrs. Bowes, wholesale dealers in marine-stores, and rag merchants, in Newington—I received 29 lbs. of metal there, 24 lbs. of which was stated to have been sold by Green—I found 11 3/4 lbs. of it which is marked with the broad arrow—I should say that 3 1/2 lbs. out of the 17 lbs. found in East-street was marked—there is marked metal in the lot found behind the counter, and in the lot in the padlocked room, and the remainder of it is defaced.</p>

Williams</hi>). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Mary Ann Newton lived with you four years and a half? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly—I had a character with her from the mother of a little girl who lived with me—I certainly did not know that she was separated from her husband—I knew she was a married woman, and that her husband was in India—after she had been with me a short time she owed a bill, and she took a note of mine which I gave her to pay for the taxes—she came crying to me and said, "Oh, ma'am, I have done such a shocking thing; I have taken that note you gave me, and paid my debts with it"—I forgave her that, and she paid me out of her wages—she behaved very well indeed afterwards—I do not know when she became acquainted with the prisoner, but I think it was at a tea-meeting they had at the chapel about a twelvemonth from this time—Newton often spoke to me about her rich uncle after she knew Wych<lb/>erley, not before—she was in the habit of going out very frequently to see this uncle—I always saw her go from my house, but never saw anybody</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080128"/>
               <p>with her—she did not dress particularly smartly when she went out, not more than cooks do now-a-days; she wore a silk dress, and a bonnet with flowers in it—I do not know that when she went out on some occasions she enamelled her face; I think she had colour enough without that—once she went out, and she told me her face was enamelled; that was to her sister's wedding, I believe, and a ball after the wedding—I did not tell her she had better be enamelled before she went to the ball, certainly not—she told me that Mr. Wycherley preached the Gospel to her, and gave her very good advice; and I said, "Well, then, you cannot do better than keep with him, and he will do you good," not thinking he was going to mislead her—she asked me if I should like to hear how well he prayed, and I said, "I dare say I am wicked like most people, and I have no objection to hear him"—after I heard him pray, I did not like him—I did not give her per<lb/>mission to allow the prisoner to come there—I will swear that I did not know that he was in the habit of coming to my house—I never said, to my knowledge, that I did not care if Mr. Wycherley did take his tea and break<lb/>fast there, if Mary Newton paid for it—if she says I allowed him to take his meals there she tells an untruth—I had another servant, named Ann Smith—she is a witness—she always slept with me—she is my lady's-maid and housemaid—Newton slept up stairs in her own room—I never knew that she was in the habit of paying for certain provisions at my house—last Christ<lb/>mas I dined off a turkey—I gave Newton the money to buy me a fowl, but I did not have it, because she said her uncle had five turkeys, and he had had them made a present to her, and would I accept one, as they would spoil?—I said, "Yes," but I gave her a complement for it afterwards, and I bought the sausages—I do not know that the prisoner and Newton dined off the turkey—her father and sister visited at my house, and I allowed them to sleep there—her father and brother last visited the house about two years ago, not since then, and the sister about last summer—she slept there—when I saw the prisoner on the Monday, I think Mr. Narracot, who lodges at my house, was in the room—I told the prisoner then that Newton had robbed me before—she often had conversations with me about her rich uncle—she told me that she was going to employ the prisoner as his rent-collector, and give him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I, of course, believed at that time all about the rich uncle—I do not know that she spent a good deal of money then.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAWTHORNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did she begin to talk about the rich uncle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After she became acquainted with the prisoner—she used to go to see him sometimes on the Monday, always on the Thursday, and Saturday, and Sun<lb/>day—she regularly took those evenings to go and see the uncle—I was not aware at that time that the prisoner was in the habit of coming to my house—I was confined to my room with rheumatics, and when I got in a room I continued there—when I came down of a morning I never went up stairs again till I went up to bed—I used to go in the drawing-room sometimes, down stairs—Thursday night was one of the nights Mr. Wycherley officiated at his chapel—I do not know about Monday.</p>

I am married—my husband is abroad—I am now brought up here from prison, having been convicted of stealing the property of Mrs. Levy, at the last Surrey Assizes in the summer of last year—I was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment for stealing two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, besides other things, the property of Mrs. Levy—I took the things—I had been in Mrs. Levy's service four years—I first knew the pri<lb/>soner about fourteen months ago—I became acquainted with him at a tea-meeting at a Baptist chapel at Clapham Rise, up a small court—he spoke to me in the evening after tea—he merely wished me "Good evening" that day, as a friend of our minister's whose wife I was with—that was on a Tuesday, evening—on the Thursday following I saw him again—my mistress gave me leave to go to the same chapel, and I went; and at I was coming out, to my suprise, I met Mr. Wycherle—he had not been preaching—there were two of the members with me, and I said, "Oh, Mr. Wycherley, how is it you are down here?"—he said, "I was passing"—he walked up to my mistress's door with me—I again went to chapel on the Sunday evening, but did not see him then—on the Monday morning the bell rang; I went to the gate, and the prisoner was there—I asked him how he came to come so early, and he said he wanted me to lend him a little money if I had got it, as he was in great trouble—I went up stairs to get him a little I had saved out of my wages—he wanted me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I told him I was only a servant, and had not got it, I had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I went up stairs and fetched that, which was all I had, and gave it to him at the front gate—he never re-paid that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent him that about thirteen months ago, after seeing him twice—after that I frequently saw him—we used to meet each other out of an evening by appointment—we agreed with each other to meet—he would write a note—I don't know where he was preaching—he first began to visit me in the house six months before I left—the first time he came I told mistress—he was then preaching at our chapel, and I intro<lb/>duced him to mistress as my pastor—he had a six months' call at the chapel—mistress allowed him to come as a visitor-from that time until I went to Yarmouth he came frequently—after he had been a short time, he asked me if I could accommodate him with making him</p>

               <p>a bed up in the kitchen, because his lodgings were so far off, and it was late, and me and my fellow-servant accommodated him—he slept a great many times in the bed—I did not tell my mistress anything about that—Ann Smith, the other servant, was quite a new servant—she had come very recently—the prisoner continued there, except on his preaching nights—he used to board in the kitchen, and sit down to meals with us—I was not feed<lb/>ing him on my mistress's property; I was paying for it; she did not know that he was always there—he used to wash up the glasses for us, when we asked him, and he has rubbed over the knives for us—one morning he was up stairs in my bed-room, and I and my fellow-servant were in my mistress's bed-room making the bed, and I said to my fellow-servant, "Shall I ask Mr. Wycherley to come and help me make this bed, while you dust the room?"—I did so, and he came and helped me, but only that once—I knew in the month of February where my mistress kept her money, a fortnight before I took it—I had some conversation with the prisoner about it—before I took the notes, I had taken the jewellery to lend Mr. Wycherley the money, with a promise that when the House of Parliament was open, he would return the money to get the things back again—I took three rings and two chains, and pawned them—the first ring I got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upon, the second, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one chain, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the other, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another ring, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I lent that 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Wycherley at different times, not altogether—when I took the things I gave him the money—when I lent him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I told him that I had got no more money, and he asked me if there was not anything of my mistress's that I could take to get some money on, if he promised to give me the money to get it back again, and I told him, "Yes," and then I took the jewellery, and pawned it—that was before the six months that he came and stopped—the property was never redeemed—the time was going on, and I was anxious about the jewellery, and I wanted the money to get it back again—it was proposed to me by Mr. Wycherley that I should take these notes—I said that mistress had got some notes in a drawer in her bed-room, but I could not take them as the drawer was locked—he said that I should find the drawer open, and on the Friday it was open, and I took them—that was a month before I took them—he asked me if I could not get the keys that undid the drawers, and I said, "No," I could not, I never had the keys, after<lb/>wards as I was in mistress's bed-room putting down the carpet the drawer came open as I lifted the drawers up—I took the notes out of a purse, and left the purse in the drawer—I then brought the notes down into the kitchen, and put them in the dresser drawer, and Mr. Wycherley was there—he asked mo to write my name on the notes I had taken, and to give him one—I did so, and gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay his lodgings with—I wrote my name on one more note that day—I meant to say that I told him I had never had mistress's keys, but that on the Friday, when I went to do the bed-room, in tilting the drawers I found that the drawer containing the notes was open—before the notes were taken, we had arranged to go to Egypt, and I was to take the notes for my passage-money—I had told the prisoner where my husband was—the prisoner had been a missionary out in India he told me, and had seen my husband out there—that is why I took notice of Mr. Wycherley—the prisoner said that Mr. Green, the shipowner, would give him a passage out free, and I was to pay my passage out—the prisoner pro<lb/>posed Egypt, because he said it was a country where he thought I should be able to get work, and do well, and my mistress would never take the trouble, or go the expense of sending for me from there—he said I was to bring the notes down, and put them in the dresser-drawer, and not to say</p>

OPPENHEIM</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you been in the habit of at<lb/>tending this Chapel before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three years before—I introduced him to my mistress on the first occasion on which he came, and he said prayers in the drawing-room, on that occasion—he used to visit, after that, very frequently, and remain all day and sleep all night, and have his meals there—I some<lb/>times told my mistress, that the prisoner had tea, or was going to have tea with them, and she made no objection—she said, that as my husband was away, he would keep me from getting into harm, and therefore she had no objection—I told her that I paid for his tea, and what he ate and drank—she said that she had no objection to that, if I paid for it—she saw him about two or three times—she knew the times that I told her he was there, but not other times—my fellow servant slept, with my mistress, and I slept upstairs—after I had been there about a year, my mistress did not give me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to pay the taxes, nor did I use it to pay a bill—I deny that; I did not do it—I never went to her and asked her to forgive me, for so doing, nor did she say that she would—she never deducted the amount from my wages—I had never taken it—the first time I robbed her, was when I took the jewellery—that was nearly thirteen months before I took the notes, I should think—I knew Mr. Wycherley about fourteen months before I took the notes—I do not know at all when the tea meeting was—I do not know the month—up to this time, I have known him seventeen months altogether—I pawned the gold chains and diamond ring, in the Walworth-road, at Mr. Folkard's, and left the duplicate in Mrs. Levy's drawers, before I went to Yarmouth—I had some time before that told my mistress that I had a rich uncle—it might be two years from the present time—it was somewhere about the time that I went to the tea meeting—she used to ask me where I had been to—I was in the habit of going out very frequently, but more after I knew Wycherley—I used to go to Chapel on Sunday—I went to one ball only during the time I lived with Mrs. Levy; I will swear it was not more than one—I did not enamel myself; I used a little powder, that is all—I tried to look as well as the rest, as well as I could—I changed one note at Mr. Hunt's, a draper, at Stockwell; another at Mr. Simmons's, a chemist, in South Lambeth.; and another at Mr. Clement's, a baker, in Clapbam-road—I took a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to Yarmouth, not a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; the rest was in gold—I did not change a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at a linen-draper's shop at Yarmouth; I will swear I did not take one—I will swear I did not take this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Yarmouth—I see on it, "Per post, East of England Bank, Yarmouth," and I swear I never changed it at Yarmouth; it was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that I changed there—this is Mr. Wycherley's writing at the corner of this note 73,091—I never wrote Mr. Wycherley's name—I think I endorsed four notes—I signed my name Mrs.Newton—I did not give Wycherley a second 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to go and change for me at Morris and Kelsey's, 248, Regent-street—I did not go out with the prisoner on that Thursday evening; he went to his preaching—I did not go with him to Morris and Kelsey's, in Regent-street; I will swear that; I never went with him to a shop in Regent-street—I went and changed the notes myself—I did not buy any clothes before I went to Yarmouth—I paid a bill at Mr. Hunt's for a dress that I had had some time before, that was all—in the year before I left my mistress I spent a good deal of money to buy grocery, and the bread and butter that Mr.Wycherley used to have—my wages were 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—my rich uncle did not allow me anything—Mr.</p>

               <p>wickedly was the rich uncle—I told untruths about that—I did not purchase a silk dress in February, or gloves, or any other articles, nor did Mr. Wycherley purchase them for me; he never bought me anything to wear—I did not spend anything in February for a Garibaldi jacket; I spent something for Rimmell's perfumery at Yarmouth, where I changed <hi rend="italic">the</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I never sent any money to my father, mother, or sister, at Yarmouth—I never got a post-office order, or sent them any money by any means—I never sent any money over to my husband in India—the prisoner has never lent me a farthing since I have known him, and he knows it—on the first occasion that I came against him, I swore he lent me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I do not think it was mentioned on the second occasion—on my last examination I said it was an untruth—I knew I was on my oath on the first occasion—I was very miserable when I gave myself up; not penitent—I never said I was penitent—I never repented of it—I knew I had done wrong—I was miserable because I had taken mistress's money—I told a lie before the Magistrate at first to screen Mr. Wycherley—he asked me when I was in one cell and he was in another, a short distance from me, and we spoke to one another—there is an iron-door, and a small piece left open; we could hear one another talk—I was brought nap from the House of Correction and put into a cell until they were ready for me to go in to be examined—I then had a few words with Mr. Wycherley, till we heard some one unlock the door, and then we dropped the conversation—I never did any<lb/>thing with another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I admit that I changed one at Yarmouth—I never denied that—I said directly I changed it at Yarmouth, and never denied it. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Note at Yarmouth, but at that time I did not know whether it was a five or a ten—I swore on the first examination that I had an uncle, named Parkinson, and so I have—I also said that I did not know how he came to know I was at Tunbridge—all the statements I made then about the prisoner were not true—it was planned between us that I should write my name on the notes, and I did so on all that there were there—the prisoner was present, Ann was doing the dining-room, and she came down into the kitchen at intervals—she was not there all the time—she was there when I wrote on some of the notes—I could not say how many—she might have seen me put my name on the notes—I never asked her whether she did—she came in for something, but I don't know what—no one was in the kitchen when I put my name on the notes, except the prisoner—I know Harry Smith—he is a friend of mine at Yarmouth—he was not at my mistresses' place on that day, I will swear that—he was not there during the time I took the notes—he did not see me mark any notes—he only came there once, and that was long before I took the notes—he was never in the kitchen after I committed the robbery—he was not in the kitchen one night when I took a note to the</p>

               <p>Swan to change—I will swear he did not sleep in the kitchen that night—he never slept there—I will swear that—he was there to supper one night with me and Ann and Mr. Wycherley, and I let him out between 10 and 11 o'clock—that was a long time before I thought of robbing my mistress—Mr. Wycherley never slept up stairs—in the morning, when we came down, be used to be so tired lying on the chairs, he used to ask me whether he might go up and have a rest on the bed, before we made it, in our bed-room, and he used to do so—I have never said before to-day that I lent the pri<lb/>soner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have never said before that I pawned the rings and chains, and gave him the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., nor have I stated before what he said about the House of Parliament—I should have stated it before if I had been asked—the prisoner sent his writing-desk by a cabman, for me to take care of; the other servant took it in, I was out at the time—it was during the six months he was staying there—it was in the kitchen—sometimes it was locked, and sometimes not—I was to stock it with paper, but I had not done so—I have come here to-day to speak the truth, and whatever I say tee-day is truth—what I told the Magistrate on the first occasion was not true—I did not have any conversation with that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Chipperfield</hi>) after my first or second examination, only what passed in the Court—I answered his questions—I did not go to his office; I was in prison—I did not see any one in the police cell, except Mr. Wycherley—not before I went into the court, but afterwards I did, after I had been in the court on the third occa<lb/>sion—Mr. Chipperfield, I believe, and my sister, came up on that day—my husband has been in India nearly six. Years—I married him years before he enlisted for a soldier—I think I can say I have been married to him sixteen years, and he left me nearly seven years ago—I had children—they are not alive—I think I had my first child about eighteen months after I was mar<lb/>ried—no one was present when Wycherley spoke to me in the cell at the police-court—the second time there was, not the first—as I passed the box in which he was standing, he said, "Say you owe me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—He moved his mouth the same as I have to him now—I knew by what ha said in the cell what he wanted me to say—when in the court he did not speak loud enough for me to hear, he merely moved his mouth and articulated "two pound"—I could see it was that—I did not hear the words "two pounds"—I lent the prisoner the first 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. long before he came to the house, about two days after I met him at the meeting—I took the jewellery before he came to the house to stop—I pleaded guilty at Kennington—the officer ordered me to get ready to come, and of course I obeyed—I did not see any One before I went to the Magistrate; not at the goal—I did not at any time or place see any one and tell them what I knew about this case—when I was brought up before the Magistrate I told a story—the prisoner was at that time in the dock charged with receiving a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I did not speak to any one or gave evidence before I told that story—I was taken to the prison last night—I might have seen Ann Smith, my fellow-servant, as I came out of the court—I was not allowed to speak to anybody—I did not speak to her.</p>

               <p>Of court—I said to him, "Shall I get punished for what I have done?"—he said, "You must not say anything at all against Mr. Wycherley, for you have received your punishment, and you will get no more and no lees" and he gave a pork-pie out of my hand to Mr. Wycherley—that was when I was locked up in my cell, after my first examination—I said I wanted a lawyer to speak for me, and he said, "How much money have you got?"—I said, "A sovereign"—he was talking to Mr. Wycherley, and acting and asking him questions—from that time to when I sent for Mr. Chipperfield no person offered me any inducement to tell what I have told now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, L</hi> 63). On 18th March, I was called to the station where Newton was, to make inquiries—the prisoner was not with her then—Sergeant Odell gave me his address—I made inquiries at his lodgings, and also at the chapel and other places, from 18th March to 7th April, but could not find him—I afterwards apprehended him at Whitchurch in Shoeshine—I had information from that part of the country about him—I took him on 7th April—I said to him, "I hold a warrant charging you, Mr. Wycherley, with being concerned, with one Mary Ann Newton, late ser-vent to Mrs. Levy, of 7, Stock well-place, Stock well, in robbing her of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in jewellery, and some wearing apparel, she being now under<lb/>going punishment"—he said, "Oh, dear, has she been tried?"—I said, "She has"—he said, "What has she got?"—I said, "Eighteen months"—he said, "Have you got the newspaper with the account of the trial in your pocket?"—I said, "I have not"—that was all that passed at that time—I left him, and in an hour or two I returned, after making inquiries in the town—he then said, "There is a lot of lies in the newspaper respecting that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed in the Borough"—he had some newspapers with him, with an ac<lb/>count of it—he gave it to me, and I afterwards returned it to him—he said, "I did not change one there; also about the turkey and the wine, I scarcely ever take wine. Newton gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at the garden gate; she owed me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I bought the turkey myself. The house was open to me. I have prayed to Mrs. Levy; she has been a wicked woman: it was prevent her from being bad any more, that I prayed to her"—I told him I had found, in searching his lodging on the 6th, part of a shirt, which Mrs. Levy identified as being her property—he said, "Yes; you will find no more than that; Mrs. Levy gave that to Mrs. Newton, and Mrs. Newton gave it to me"—I said, "Perhaps now you will tell me where you changed the note you had"—he said, "I will try and remember;" and, after a short time, he said, "I changed it at my lodging, No. 7, New Bridge-street, Vauxhall"—he did not say when—he said he had accompanied Newton on the morning she left her mistress's house to go to Yarmouth; that he went as far as the railway station, and no further, and came back again—while in the cab, going from Euston-square to the Lambeth police-court, he said, "I want to ask you a little advice; now, shall I plead guilty of receiving, as I am certain I am not guilty of stealing, or receiving with a guilty knowledge"—(I had previously given him the usual warning when I took him into custody)—I said I thought he had lived sufficient years to know what to do better than I could inform him, and I declined to give him any advice—he also said, "Believe me, Mr. Morton, I am innocent."</p>

               <p>Cells attached to the court—I remember the first day that Newton was brought there to be examined—one of the turnkeys of the Wandsworth house of correction brought her—I had Wycherley in custody at that time in one of the cells—I made a communication to the turnkey before be brought Newton into a cell, and then I went and took Wycherley from the cell that he was in, which was in the first row of cells, and placed him in one of the cells right round the corner, in another passage, quite away from this. row of cells—Newton was at that time in my room with the turnkey—I then put her into one of those cells in the first row, quite away entirety from where the prisoner was—there was one cell between the cell in which she was, and the one in which Wycherley was, but his cell was quite round the corner, in another passage—she was in the middle cell of three, and he was in the first cell, round the corner at right angles—I did not hear any conversation between them—I left a turnkey there—I cannot say whether he was there all the time, but he was for half an hour afterwards—I took Wycherley into court, and placed him in the dock, and then brought Newton in, and placed her alongside of me, not in the dock—I passed Newton's cell when I brought Wycherley into the court—he did not speak to her then; he took no notice at all, but passed along by my side—as far as I know, she did not know he was there—he had no conversation with her in the police-court—he could not have had; so was alongside of me all the time.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi rend="smallCaps">OPPENHEIM</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You placed Wycherley in a cell when he was first brought in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was before Newton was brought, and when she came I took him out of the cell in which I had placed him, and removed him to another—Newton had not been put in any cell before I changed Wycherley's cell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a grating of any kind in these cells? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in the door; rather larger than this book—it goes up with a slide—there is a ventilator at the back of the cell in the yard—a mere grating at the bottom of the brickwork, and there is an outside thing which can be opened and shut, and there is also an iron window looking into the yard at the back—there is no grating, or open place, between the cells, only in the door, so that I can put any little thing in, and drop it down without opening the door.</p>
               <p>MR. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are these cells built in a semicircular form; cannot the door of one cell be seen by anybody from the door of the other cells? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there is no grating through which a person in one cell could see through to the other—there is a back yard, and an iron window to the cells which all look into that yard; a person speaking out of one of the windows could not be heard by a person at the other, unless they haloed very loud indeed—the width of each cell is about six feet—I shut up the passage when I go out, as well as the cells—the little grating is under my</p>

               <p>command—if it is up the prisoner cannot open it—I generally speaking lock the door which leads to my room—a person speaking through the grating could be beard in the adjoining cell, or in a cell two off, but in a cell round the corner, they would have to hallo very load indeed to be heard—if Wycherley had been placed in one of the cells next to Newton, they could have beard each other, and that was my object in placing him in the other cell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Kennington—I appeared as solicitor for the prisoner at the Lambeth Police-court after the first exa<lb/>mination of Newton—on the second examination, which was the first examination of the prisoner, she was examined in Court; that was the first of my seeing her—I cross-examined her—she was taken from the Court to the cell in custody—I collected my papers, and went to the cell to see the prisoner—he spoke to me about his friends finding bail for him, he being remanded—when I was speaking to him at the cell, Newton was in the adjoin<lb/>ing cell, speaking-to two or three females who were standing about—some one mentioned my name, and I went from Mr. Wycherley to Newton—she said, "Oh, poor Mr. Wycherley, he is not guilty; he changed a note"—she only spoke of one note—I said, "Well, I have nothing to say to you about this; you have given your evidence in the Court, and of course it is written down"—I did not say to her then, or at any other time, "You need not say anything against Mr. Wycherley"—I thought her examination was over.</p>
