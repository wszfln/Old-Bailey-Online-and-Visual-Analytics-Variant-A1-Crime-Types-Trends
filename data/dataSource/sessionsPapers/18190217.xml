When the light came, I found a key inside; I knocked at the door, very hard, several times. A mob came round, and said somebody was running across the roof; I went through the next house, and found my yard-door open; I then saw my street-door opened, and two boys run out I ran to the door, and cried out Stop thief! Several persons pursued, and Gurney, who was convicted last Session, was brought back - the prisoner came to the watch-house, and was taken. I returned to the house, and found a quantity of lead taken off the roof, from the gutter, by the trap-door - it was fixed; the whole of the gutter was taken away, rolled up, and put on the party-wall; I took it to the watch-house. I afterwards compared it with the gutter, and it fitted exactly. The key had been left with Mrs. Johns, to show the house.</p>

I was going up Buckingham-place, and saw several people round the house; I saw two boys run across the roof, told the prosecutor, and he went through the next house into his own; I then saw two boys run out of the house - I pursued, and took one, named Gurney, who was convicted last Session - the prisoner was the other, I am certain of it; he came to the watch-house about five minutes after, and enquired for a boy, named Gurney, who was taken for some lead - the constable searched him, and found a pair of pincers on him.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the watch-house, Gurney was given into my custody; after I had locked him up, I went to the watch-house door - there was a number of people standing there; the prisoner came up to me, and asked if there was not a boy brought there for stealing of lead? I saw his hands were very black and wet, as if he had been handling something - I took him in to Gurney, and asked him if he knew him? he hesitated at first, and then said he did. I then said I thought he was concerned with him - he said he knew nothing of the robbery; I searched him - he was very unwilling to be searched. I found a pair of pincers in his coat-pocket, which appeared soiled, as if they had been pulling lead up. I was going to lock him up, when he began crying, and said he would tell me all about it, and that he, Gurney, and another boy, named Johns, went to the house about seven days before, to steal the copper and bells, but found they had been taken away; that they went again on the 29th to steal the lead from the gutters, and used the pincers to draw the nails out - I compared the lead to the place, and it fitted exactly.</p>

             WALKER. I am servant to Mr. Wray; I sleep in the kitchen. I went to bed before my mistress, and am not certain whether the door was fastened; at two o'clock I was disturbed, and found two men in the kitchen - it was the prisoners; Barefoot was at the bureau, searched the papers over; he had a small piece of candle in his hand - Wilks stood about a yard and a half from him, between the bureau and the door; I saw them plainly, and am sure they are the persons. I asked them what they did there? they told me to hold my noise, and called me a great fool; I said I would not, and knocked against the wainscot to alarm a young man who slept in the next house - they then began to make their escape; before that Barefoot asked me where my master kept his money? I told him to go about his business, and made the alarm - they went out of the door, which leads into Hopkins's yard - both the doors were open; they were shut when I went to bed. I followed them, and made the alarm; the watchman took them - they ran towards Holborn.</p>

               <p>ROBERT APPLETON. I am a watchman in Holborn. About ten minutes after two o'clock, the prisoner, Wilks, came and lit his pipe at my box; while he was lighting it, Barefoot came out of Eagle-street - he turned round to see if Wilks had got a light, and both went down Red Lion-street together. In about ten minutes I went and cried the half hour in the direction they had taken; I went towards Hopkins's gate, and saw them both come out of the wicket-gate together - I seized Wilks, and he immediately dropped the boots and shoes. I sprung my rattle - Quar came to my assistance, and picked them up. Barefoot ran across the street, and through a court - I am positive he is the man - he was close to me - the street is lit with gas.</p>

I knocked at the door, and asked for Barefoot? he denied his name; I went in, and took him. Wilks sent me a letter, and I went to him in Newgate; he said it was the first time that he ever did any wrong, and that he was concerned with Barefoot in breaking the house open - he told me where to find Barefoot.</p>

I could not cry out - he held me in this manner, while the other man came behind me, and took the watch out of my fob, my umbrella from under my arm, and 1 s. 6 d. in silver from my pocket, they then ran off across the fields; the prisoner ran towards Somers-town; I do not know which way the other ran. I immediately called out Murder! and Stop thief! as loud as I could - I was alarmed. Mr. Gliddon came by at the time, and seized the prisoner. He was taken to the watch-house, and searched. None of my property was found on him - the other man took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to me? you said I came behind you - A. He came sideways of me; whether he came from behind or not I cannot say. I could not see his features at the time, but immediately that he got from me I pursued, and never lost sight of him until Gliddon took him. From the time he left me till I came up to him was not above five minutes. No other person was near - he was never out of my sight.</p>

            . I was crossing the fields on the night of the robbery, between ten and eleven o'clock, heard a person crying Stop thief! and Murder! and saw two persons running, one was in pursuit of the other - it was a bright moonlight night; the man who was running away made towards Somers-town, in the field, not in the pathway. I ran in a direction to intercept him, and stopped him at the back of the houses in Somers-town. I did not lay hold of him, I only detained him against the fence; the prosecutor came up in about two minutes, and immediately said he was one of the two who had robbed him of his watch and umbrella, and emptied his breeches-pockets, which were turned inside-out - he had some marks of violence about his face and nose. I took the prisoner, and some watchmen and others came up, and took him from me. When I first stopped him, I asked him what he had been doing? he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Sir." I said,</p>
               <p>"You have been committing some robbery, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170005"/>shall keep you until this person comes up." He said nothing more.</p>

Before he took the horse, he was to take a bundle of papers to my agent in Threadneedle-street, to be sent to India - he was also to take an animal called a Macaw to Exeter Change, to be taken care of for me. After giving him these orders, I sent for Parry, and informed him that I expected a gentleman to call with a post-chaise for me, and to tell him he would find me in Somerset-street. Parry was to remain in the house till I returned.

            . The prisoner came into my service on the 7th of January - he told me he was in great distress, and wanted clothes and every necessary. I never saw him with a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned to town did you see him - A. No. I left town on Thursday morning, returned late on Saturday night, and found he had entirely left me. He had given me no notice, nor had I in any way discharged him. In consequence of information which I received, I searched for valuable property which I had recently brought from abroad, and missed the property stated in the indictment, which was all safe in a bureau when I left town. The gold coin consisted of a quantity of Napoleons, Louis-d'ors, and fourteen large Portugal coins worth four hundred rials each, nine pagodas, and an antique gold coin.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any particular article of wearing apparel in your possession - A. I had a hunting-frock of a particular make, it was as good as new, I never gave it away. I missed that, with a pair of plush breeches, and a piece of plush out of a chest which had two locks on it - they were locked, and the keys were in a drawer, were the valuable property was. The property which I lost cost me between 400 l. and 500 l. Parry remained in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this you had a very long pursuit after the prisoner - A. Yes; I went to Ireland, and secured him at a house in a village there - I found the hunting-frock and breeches in his bundle. I asked him where his bundle of clothes was? he said they were in his bed-room. I had the bundle brought down, he said it was his; I took them into my possession - they were then very dirty, and appeared to have been worn. I had received a letter from him. I asked him how he came by the clothes? as I did not then know I had lost them. He said he got them out of a trunk, the key of which he found in the drawer, and that he found the key of that drawer in a writing-desk drawer - I did not know I had left it there, but I found a key in the house afterwards which opened the drawer, it was not mine. I asked him how he could behave in such a manner towards me? he said it was not him. I asked him why he went away then? he said he had gone away, but that was his misfortune. A gold Napoleon was produced by the constable. He said he brought it from Gibraltar. He admitted the house had been robbed, but threw the blame on Parry. I desired him to be cautious in charging others, as I had examined Parry very minutely, and found him innocent of it in my opinion. He then said I owed him five or six days wages, and wanted payment. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170006"/>him that was nothing, compared to the loss I had been at. He said I had hung and transported thirty servants, and that I was a very notorious character. I left him with the constable, and went to the port, to arrange for his passage to England, as they would not put him in prison. On my return to the constable's house, I found the prisoner had got away. I returned to England - this was in February or March. I heard nothing more of him till last September. In consequence of what I heard, I went to Dumfries, in Scotland, and afterwards found he had been taken in Ireland again. I found him in custody last November, took him in Down, and brought him to London.</p>

               <p>Q. In the way did any thing happen - 
               <persName id="t18190217-6-person102">A. </persName>
            He made a very great resistance in Ireland gaol - I was obliged to have a soldier to come to town with him. When we were between Downpatrick and Belfast, he said I had been an excellent master to him. The soldier asked him how he could serve his master so, and that he would be hung for it? he said he should not, for he did not care for that, as it was not the first time he had forfeited his life, and he was lucky. He then asked the name of a lady, who, he said, came to my house in my absence, and rummaged my drawers, and said she might have stolen the things as well as him. When we got to the Peacock, at Islington, I put him by the fire-side while I went for a coach. On my return he had seized the poker, and swore he would destroy my soul, and send me to hell before he was hung. I handcuffed him, and took him to the watch-house, from thence to Hatton-garden, and afterwards to Marlborough-street, where he was committed. I have found none of my property, except the frock and breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. How long before had you seen the frock - A. In the week before, I dare say. I had seen the diamond ring three or four days before. I have no female servant. I always sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have accused servants of robbing you before - A. Never, except one.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he escaped from the constable - I believe you had a dispute with the constable about a reward - A. No, nothing of the kind. I never tried to get him to confess. He was a soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it extraordinary for a soldier to have a Napoleon - A. When he came to me he represented himself as greatly distressed, and without clothes - he was obliged to borrow money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he engaged to serve you by the week - A. Yes; his wages were due on Saturday. There were five or six days due to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house is your's - A. I am the owner. There are stables and a coach-house on the ground-floor, and five rooms above. There are two keys, one of which I took out of town with me, and Parry had the other. There is a side passage from the door, which leads up to the rooms. The property was in a chamber up stairs, adjoining my sitting-room, where I keep all my trunks.</p>

            . On the 4th of February I and the prisoner were in the service of Mr. Parkins. My master went out of town between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and gave me orders to take care of the property - the prisoner was not present then. My duty was in the stable and in the house - I had a great deal to do in the stable. My master gave me no orders to go to Threadneedle-street. About three o'clock a man came to the stable, and asked the prisoner if he had taken the letters to Threadneedle-street? he said they were not gone, as he had been to see for them, and they were not ready. The man asked the prisoner to take them, he said he would not, for he was going to Egham with two hunting-horses; the man then asked me to take them; I said I had no orders from my master to take them, and I was a stranger in that part of the town - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You must take them, as I cannot." The man begged of me to go, and I agreed to it. The man said he would go with me, to put me in the way. We sat out between four and five o'clock, and left the prisoner in the stable cleaning the horse he had brought home. I went up stairs into the house, changed my dress, returned to the man, told him I was ready, and came down stairs with the man. I locked the door, the windows and every thing were safe, and put the key in my pocket. I asked the prisoner if I should leave it with him or take it? he said I should take it, as he was going to Egham, and did not know whether he should return at night. I went to Threadneedle-street, and returned about eleven o'clock at night, having met a friend in Holborn. When I got back I let myself in, and found the door as I left it. I found M'Vey and the hostler up stairs. I saw the prisoner at the top of the stairs with a light in his hand; he asked me where I had been so long? and said that while I was out the house had been robbed. The hostler then came to the head of the stairs and said,</p>
               <p>"Now you are come I will go." I let him out, returned to the prisoner, and found him in the sitting-room. A mattress had been brought down and put on the floor - he said he was going to sleep there. I asked him if he missed any of my master's property? he said it was no matter to me whether he missed anything or not. I said I was going to the public-house to get some beer, and asked him if I should get him any? he said No; and if I had been at home the house would not have been robbed. I went to the public-house, returned in about a quarter of an hour, and found the prisoner lying on the mattress in the sitting-room - he slept there all night. I went up stairs with my friend, whom I fetched from the public-house, as I was afraid to sleep there by myself - next morning I let my friend out. The horses were not taken to Egham.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next morning - A. I went to the stable, and saw the horses were all safe, but missed my master's dog. I met the prisoner on the stairs, and asked him what had become of the dog? he said he took it out the evening before, and lost it, and after looking for it a great while, he returned, found the horses at a livery stable, and took them back to the stable; that he then found the back-window open, and on going into the yard, he found the shutter had been lifted up - he then went back to tell the hostler of the livery stable, that the house was robbed, and brought him back to see if anybody was in the house - that they got lights; the hostler brought a ladder, and he got in at the window, sent the servant home, and half an hour after he had searched every room except that next to his master's sitting-room, when he got a matress to sleep on, and a man bounced out of this room, and ran into the pantry; that he shot the man as he ran, and was sure he had hurt him very severely, for he fell, and groaned very much; that the man got out at the back sash-window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170007"/>the same as he got in at; I suppose it is fourteen feet from the ground. He said he shot at him while he was getting through the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a man on getting out of that window, get into a private yard - A. Yes, it is enclosed by buildings - he must get into my master's passage, and then into the street - there was a door in the yard which is not locked. He said he came to the window, and called watch, but none came; that he then ran to the window, and jumped out after the man, but he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the yard to see if there was any blood - A. Yes, I looked next day, there was nothing of the kind in any part. He said he got the watchman's light, but could not find the man, and then went to the livery stable to ask if the hostler might come, and stop with him until his fellow-servant returned.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time that day, which was Friday, did he go out - A. About eleven or twelve o'clock; he said he should return in two hours - he returned about seven o'clock, and asked me to go to the public-house and get some beer with him and a friend, which I did - a man named

               <p>Q. When did you see him with a watch - A. Not till that Friday - it was a good silver watch. I asked him how long he had had it? he said a long while, but it had been at Chelsea to be repaired - this was before he went to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was short of money or not - A. He borrowed 4 s. of me on Thursday morning to pay his expences to Egham, as he had forgot to ask his master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. Q. Are you in Mr. Parkins's service now - A. No, I have left him about a year - I lived about four weeks with him.</p>

               <p>JOHN BRENT. I am hostler to Mr. Hains, who lives in Riding-house-lane. On Thursday, the 5th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came to me, and said he was locked out, and could not get in, that the windows were left open, and he thought the house would be robbed, and he wanted to go home to sleep with his wife, at Pimlico; I told him by no means to do so, but get a ladder, and get in at the window. I went and found the casement open - it opens into the yard; I believe it is the room which is used as a kitchen. We got a ladder, and the prisoner got in at the window, which was open - I gave him a light, and left him - I took the ladder away with me. When he got into the house, he said he thought all was safe. In about an hour after I heard the report of a pistol, and my wife went to the gate; there was a cry of Watch! I heard Mr. Parkins's house was robbed. My mistress sent me there. I went, and found another ladder placed on the wall, against the same window; I got in at the window, and saw the prisoner; he wished me to go all over the house with him, which I did, and could see nobody. I asked him if he thought anything was lost? he could not tell, but there was a man burst out of the room as he got into bed, struck him on the head, and wished him good night; that he took a pistol off the shelf, and fired at him. After we had searched, he said,</p>
               <p>"Now we will go to bed." I said I should do no such thing, for I would have a fire lit, and sit up there all night - Parry came to the door, and let himself in; the prisoner said the house had been robbed through his not being there - I wished them good night. I looked immediately to see if there was any blood, as he said he was sure he had wounded the man, but could see none; some persons were collected out of doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You heard the report of the pistol - A. Yes, and went there. Parry knocked at the door; the prisoner said</p>
               <p>"You have got the key, let yourself in. I saw no other ladder in the yard when I went there with him - both parts of the window were wide open.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Riding-house-lane. On the night in question my attention was drawn to the house from eight till ten o'clock. I went out about eight o'clock, and saw Mr. Parkins's back-window open; it looks towards our street-door, the passage leading to Mr. Parkins's door, leads to ours also. I thought it was extraordinary for the window to be open - there was a great light inside; I heard the rattling of something being moved. About ten o'clock I was going to bed, heard the report of a pistol, and ran out immediately; the prisoner called out</p>
               <p>"Run to the bottom of the gate, I have shot a man." I ran to the gate - it is a very heavy gate, and was just ajar - it was not sufficiently open for a man to run out. I called for a watchman who came; the prisoner said the man jumped out, and came on the stones, and that he must have shot him in the back; he said</p>
               <p>"Let us look if we cannot find some marks of blood;" there was none, which there must have been if the man had fell as he said. He said the man he had shot had on white trowsers and jacket, but no hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he at this time - A. He had climbed down out of the window, which was open, and come on the pavement into our garden; he had just jumped down when he called me - there is a partition to the stable, which would assist a man in getting down from the window, it is slanting, and about six or seven feet high. He said the man came across the room as he was going to bed, and said good night, and he instantly took Mr. Parkins's pistol, and fired at him. He afterwards said the man laid six or seven minutes on the stones, which was impossible, for I got out half a minute after I heard the report.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next day - A. About ten or eleven o'clock he came to our house, and said he was afraid Parry was the robber, for he had come with his head tied up, his jacket on, and his back appeared to be swelled. He came again about two o'clock, and said twelve or thirteen men had come to the stable, and Parry was gone off with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170008"/>them. He said he told Parry to take off his jacket to clean the horses, but he would not. I never saw him after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Parry - A. Two or three days after, I think, on the Sunday, he then appeared as he always did - I could see nothing on his back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You ran out immediately on hearing the report - A. Yes, and came to the spot immediately, the prisoner was then getting down from the window.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'CARTY. I am watchman of Riding-house-lane. I heard the report of the pistol - I was then on the other side of the way, opposite. I saw nobody run out of the house; nobody could run out without my seeing them, it was impossible - nobody came out whatever. I heard watch called, ran to the spot, and met a man at the door; he said somebody had been there, and told me to go in - I went into the passage and sprang my rattle. The prisoner said he had shot a man, and he was sure there must be blood in the passage - there was none. I am sure no man came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Did you know where the report came from - A. Not exactly. I could see the door from where I was. I heard the report.</p>

            . I am a pensioner of the 26th regiment of foot. I know the prisoner. I met him on a Friday early in February last, I believe it was the 6th. I met him between six and seven o'clock in the evening, at Chelsea, by the Orange Coffee-house. I went to the Hart, public-house, and had two pints of beer with him - we went towards Pimlico. He said he was going to Ireland that night - I said,</p>
               <p>"Why should you leave your master?" he said there was a woman with child by him, and his master threatened to put him in prison if he did not take her out of the country. I went on with him till we came to a watchmaker's shop, opposite the Bag of Nails, public-house, at Pimlico; he told me to stop till he came out - he came out in about half an hour, and said he had been in for his watch. We went to the Gun tavern, and had a glass of rum each. He then gave me 4 s., and told me to call on his wife, and tell her he would send for her as soon as he got to Ireland. He paid for every thing. He said I might help him out of town with his bundles - I said I would. We went to the George, and had a pot of beer; he told me to wait there while he fetched his fellow-servant. It was about a quarter after eight o'clock when he brought Parry in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of Parry's back being hurt then - A. No. We sat there, and had another pot of beer, and some bread and cheese. The prisoner asked Parry for the key a bit - he got it, and went out for a quarter of an hour; when he came back he appeared uneasy. We came out, he wished Parry a good night, and said he would be back directly. We then went to the Swan, public-house. He said to a man, who appeared to be the landlord,</p>
               <p>"Give me that bundle - you have often told me what Mr. Parkins was, and I am going to leave him to-night." We had a glass of gin each. I went a little way with him, and carried his bundle. When he got to the road, he inquired for Highgate. We had half a pint of gin at a public-house - a man came in, and sat by the prisoner's side; he pulled out the watch, and told the man he had bought it, and gave four or five guineas for it. He then pulled a large ring out of his pocket, told the man it was a diamond ring, and that he bought it for his sister; it appeared a large diamond. The man said,</p>
               <p>"It is a large ring, I don't think it is all gold" - the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"It is; I bought it as such, and am going to carry it home to my sister." He put it into his pocket, and pulled out a bunch of pearls in a cluster, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have bought these also for my sister" - there appeared a great many of them. The man said they were very nice things, but he did not know the value of them. He inquired for a lodging at Highgate, but could get none. He got a bed at the White Lion, public-house, at Finchley, and ordered the coach in the morning to carry him to Liverpool. I stopped there, and had some beer. As I was going away, he gave me 6 s. - I left him there, and saw no more of him. When he was at the public-house, he pulled out some bank notes, and said,</p>

               <p>"Ward, I have plenty of money!" The bundle was pretty heavy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORRIS. Q. You was taken up for this robbery - A. Yes; the man who took me told me I was implicated in it - I told this story.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no secret of leaving his master's service - A. No; he told Parry he was going to return.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you examined at Hicks's Hall, or put to the bar as a prisoner - A. I was taken to the office, there was nobody there. Mr. Parkins never charged me with the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever hear him say how his master treated him - A. He told me it was a good place. When he went into the silversmith's, he said,</p>
               <p>"I have been in there for my watch."</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Magene, of Prince's-row, Pimlico, opposite the Bag of Nails public-house. In February last the prisoner came to our shop - I am pretty sure he is the man, but will not be positive - it was in the evening. I do not remember what day of the week it was. He asked me if I bought old gold coin? my master said, sometimes. He produced a small Indian piece; my master said he did not know the value of it - he urged distress, and my master agreed to buy it. Next evening he brought several others, there were some Napoleons and pagodas - my master bought 9 l. or 10 l. worth. He received a silver watch, and I believe, a gilt chain and seal, and the rest in notes - I believe the watch was valued at 50 s. He produced a bunch of pearls, which he said he was going to give to his sister. He left no watch to be repaired, but bought one. When he came the second day, he said he had got a place, and was going out with Lord Cochrane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You are not certain of his being the man - A. I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you inquire how he got the property - A. He said he was a soldier, and come from abroad - he was very shabbily dressed; it is very common for soldiers to bring these things.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What room does this window belong to - A. A little pantry, which joins my master's sitting-room - it was shut and bolted inside when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170009"/>I went out. One of the panes, I think, was broken, so that a person could put their hand through and undoe it - it was not dark when I went out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at York barracks, Chelsea, and engaged with the prosecutor. I got some money at Cox and Greenwood's to take me to Ireland, and they desired me to go home with it - my master had engaged another servant; he was always bringing his servants into trouble, which made me anxious to get away. I gave him notice on Tuesday evening of my wish to leave him when the week was out; he refused to give me the testimonials of my character, which were in his possession. On the Thursday morning he was going out of town, he sent me with a letter to Sir

            , and told me to send Parry with the papers to Threadneedle-street. I found two strange men in the room with Perry; he said they were come to buy the old coach; he went out with them, and did not return until eleven o'clock in the morning. He then went with the papers, and returned about half-past nine o'clock at night; before he returned I saw the back-window open; I got Brent to bring a ladder, and help me into the house. I had not been long a-bed, when a man ran by me as I lay on the floor; I fired at him with the prosecutor's pistol, and called Stop thief! he jumped out of the window upon the wall - I thought he was either hurt by the fall or wounded with the pistol. I called Watch! no one came to my assistance, and he escaped - the watchman came at last. I got Brent to come and stop with me till Parry came home, which he did in about half an hour, and called out</p>
               <p>"Dan, open the door!" I was surprised he should know I was in the house; he was drunk. Next day I got everything ready for my departure for Ireland - I was four days at home, when I was taken by a constable. The prosecutor had given me the coat and breeches; he said if he could get no more of his property, he would swear to them - the constable taking him for a madman, would not hold me in custody. I have been in the habit of going to and from Gibraltar for nearly seven years, by which means I became possessed of a quantity of foreign coins. I was afterward apprehended again, and the prosecutor brought me to London. I was treated most cruelly on my journey.</p>

               <p>"W. Gough" on it - A. On the 23d of January, at the watch-house; there is Pocklington and Lacy written in my hand-writing. I took six 5 l. notes of them, and marked the name on all: I lost them all. I discovered the robbery about half-past eleven o'clock at night - the girl was at my house all day, and went home at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she out of the house all day - A. No, except on errands. She came as usual every day till she was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to keep her in your service if you suspected her - A. I kept her to see what I could find out.</p>

            . I am a fisherman. On the 6th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was at Limehouse Corner, the prisoner came, and asked me if I knew anybody who would buy some Spanish dollars? I took him to Mr. Dickens, a pawnbroker, at Limehouse. He unbuttoned his belt, and pulled out six Spanish dollars - he said he had some quarter dollars, and pulled them out - I found they were four or five English half-crowns. He put them into his belt, and sold the six dollars to the pawnbroker for 4 s. 6 d. each. He bought a pair of shoes, two cotton handkerchiefs, and about four yards of canvas there. He came out, and gave me a shilling for my trouble. He took the things, and left them at the Barley Mow, public-house, at Limehouse. He then bought a pair of pumps at a shoemaker's shop; he met a blind man, and bought a pair of garters of him. We then went to the Indian Arms - I left him there. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            , let them in. I heard them come. I met Field on the stairs, and he said he had let them in. I went down, and met Hines standing in the passage, I asked him if he was the only one - he said the other was down stairs. I went down, found Close there, and they both went into the kitchen with me. I stood there while they swept the kitchen chimney, and observed that their cloth was very bad, and would not do for the drawing-room chimney; they said they would fetch another before they swept that, but their master was very busy when they came out, and the cloths were in use. Close came down the chimney - I found afterwards that he could not have been up, as they never took off the fan of the jack, and he could not go up without taking it off. He came down much sooner than I expected, and I told him he had not been to the top - he said he had; Hines also said Close had been to the top. I took them into the butler's pantry to sweep it, it has a cupboard in it where the plate is kept. I stood there while they swept that chimney also. I went out with the housemaid to shake a green cloth, and left them in the pantry. I was not absent three minutes. I returned into the pantry, and met Hines coming out; he said he was going for a better cloth. I told him to make haste. He said he would return in five minutes. He went out, left Close there, and never returned. I sent Close after him in about five minutes - he seemed anxious to go to fetch him; he proposed going himself before I proposed sending him. They never returned. The plate that was lost weighed above 1 lb., and was worth more than 5 l.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to shake the cloth, where was Close - A. In the chimney. When I came back he was come down, and in the pantry - they had gathered up the soot and ashes while I was away. I am certain I was not absent above three minutes. The footman came down a very few minutes after they were gone.</p>

I went up stairs, and did not return till after they left. I went into the pantry soon after, opened the cupboard door, and immediately missed the plate - I had left the key in the door the night before; I found it in the door, and the lock was locked. I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I dare say they weighed a pound together. I observed black finger-marks inside the cupboard-door, they appeared sooty.

I keep my box there, under the bedstead in the front parlour, where George sleeps. The articles stated in the indictment were in the box, and three 1 l. bank notes - the prisoner lodged in the back-parlour - she had lodged there three weeks. She left the house on the 11th of February, and said she was going to the Brentford stage at the top of Sloane-street, to get a parcel - I did not understand that she was going away for good. She returned the same day, went out again about a quarter before one o'clock, and never returned. I missed my box about a quarter of an hour after she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you opened it - A. A little before she went away, every thing was then safe. The three notes were put by themselves, in a little dice-box in the large box. I opened the dice-box, and saw the notes safe a quarter of an hour before she left - I did not see her go out. The box was small. Mr. George came home about six o'clock in the evening, and went to Brentford after her.</p>

            . I am son-in-law of the last witness. I keep the house, which is in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. The prisoner lodged with me for three weeks before she left. I was absent when she went away. When I came home about six o'clock, I heard what had happened - I had left the house about six o'clock in the morning. I went to Brentford, as I heard the prisoner had a sister there - I did not find her there. On the Saturday evening I found her on the top of the Chelsea stage, in Piccadilly, coming to town. She saw me, and turned her head away. I went to the side of the coach, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are the person I want - come down, will you?" she then came down, and I took her. She asked me what I wanted with her? I told her she was my prisoner. She went quietly with me at first, and then struggled. I told her she should go, and told a person who stood by what was the matter. She denied doing any such thing. I took her to St. James's watch-house, and gave her to an officer, who searched and found a pair of stockings on her, which I claimed as my mother-in-law's - she did not deny it. I took her to Marlborough-street - she said the trunk was at her house, No. 10, Cross-street, Chelsea, where she had lodged since she left me. She went there with me and the officer. The officer called me into the house to see if the trunk was mine - it was in a room on the first floor; the prisoner said it was the box she took. The officer gave them to me at the office on the Monday - we opened it at her lodgings, and searched it particularly. Some of the things were gone, the notes were gone. I am certain it is my mother's box, I have mended it myself. She had a handkerchief in her hand when I took her, which is the prosecutrix's.</p>
               <p>MARY GEORGE. I remember the prisoner going out - I did not see her go. My husband is a carpenter. I had, I believe, two 1 l. notes, and about 1 l. in silver, rolled up in my mother's box, in a pocket handkerchief. I did not look into the box after I put it there.</p>

             re-examined. I saw my daughter's money safe in the handkerchief on the Saturday night before the robbery - there was a 1 l. note and some silver. I took 1 l. in silver out, and put in a note for it - there were 10 s. or 15 s. besides. I left two 1 l. notes and the silver in it. I saw the handkerchief safe on the Thursday when I went to the box, but did not open it. The box and all the things are mine.</p>

I saw the prisoner, in company with two others, on the opposite side of the way, standing at the corner of Lime-street, looking over towards my shop. My window having been frequently cut, I suspected them, returned, and cautioned my young man to be on the look out. I went away, called on the constable, and told him. I returned home about ten o'clock, found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170014"/>my window broken, and the property taken. I saw the prisoner at the watch-house - he denied it.</p>

It would require a small degree of force to push it in.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had been at the prosecutor's house, watching, for fourteen nights. On the 26th of January I was there, and stationed myself in the house, behind two rolls of green baize, so that I could see what passed at the window. I saw the prisoner come to the window three times in the course of five minutes. He came close to the window the first time, put his hand against the square of glass, and went away; he came a second time, put his hand against the glass again, and I saw a piece fall in. He went away, came again a third time, put his hand into the window, through the hole where the glass fell in, and began taking the handkerchiefs. When I saw his hand in I went out and took him. Just as I got to the door the bell rang, as the handkerchiefs were tied to a tape, which was fastened to the bell. I ran out, and saw the handkerchiefs hanging out of the hole - he had pulled three handkerchiefs through the hole - he was then about two yards from me, walking away very deliberately. I secured him immediately, and took him into the shop. I am sure he is the man who put his hand in and took them out. He could not have got them away without breaking the tape. He said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The glass dropped when he put his hand against the window; it had been starred six different nights, in six different places - the glass was whole, and not loose - I examined it everynight, there was no hole in it; the piece would not have fallen out by putting a hand against it, if it had not been for the place he cut that night. There are five gas lights in the shop, and one over the window. I was within three yards of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. West. About half-past eight o'clock in the evening I went to the window to take the things out, and saw the prisoner standing near the window, looking down at it, where it was cut. I had seen the pane of glass at twilight, it had been cut then, but was not cut across as it was when I saw him looking in; I kept my eye upon him for about half a minute, and while I turned my head round to what I was doing the bell rang, I looked up, and saw him spring from the window, I still kept my eye on him, and never lost sight of him until he was taken. I went out of the door - he looked hard at me. I am sure he is the person.</p>

I had looked at the window about half an hour before; it was then dark - the pane was then entire, and not cracked; it had been fresh put in that morning, as it was cut the Saturday before, and three nights running. I observed that a piece of handkerchief had been moved, and drawn close to the square that was cut - there was about twelve of them; the glass was cut out four inches wide and eighteen long. I took the prisoner from Andrews, and as I took him through the passage he dropped a small wire with a hook to it; part of the handkerchiefs were through the hole - they are worth 14 s. the piece of glass laid inside the window.</p>

On the 10th of February Reed came with two other men, whom I do not know - I do not remember the prosecutor; they brought the chest and bag about eight o'clock in the morning, the chest was left in the passage, and the bag in the back-room. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the two prisoners came to fetch them - they were both very tipsey; I was at the bar; Reed asked me for them - Nutter was behind him. I told him to take them; Nutter took the chest, and Reed took the bag - Reed went out first, and Nutter followed. I thought they were Reed's.</p>

            . I am constable of Aldgate, the prosecutor brought Nutter to the watch-house about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, and said he suspected he had robbed him; he said he found a paper on him which he kept as a journal of the ship, and that Nutter was looking at it in the public-house. I searched him, and found a draft, for 11 l., payable at ninety days on him, a pair of razors in a case, two duplicates, a piece of a broken sixpence, and a shaving-brush. He said he was employed by a person who he did not know to fetch the things from Poplar, and the man gave them to him - he could not tell where he took them to.</p>

               <p>NUTTER'S Defence. Reed said he had a chest and bag, and wanted a man to help him; I went with him, he took the bag, and I followed him with the chest. He told me to leave them at a house in Shadwell, and gave me these things for my trouble.</p>

               <p>"You must know me, but you forget, I was a letter-man here once, and worked in the building - my name is Williams. I am just come from the East Indies, in the Moffat, and have a few things in a cart here, if you will be kind enough to lend me an old great coat, to lay over them for five minutes." I said I had no old coat - he said</p>
               <p>"Give me any old bit of a thing, and I will leave you a 5 l. note as security." He pulled out a pocket-book. I had an old coat of my own under the Company's coat - I took off the Company's coat to give him the under one; he took hold of the Company's coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"This will do." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, you must not touch that, it is the Company's coat" - he ran off with it, putting down a piece of paper, which he called a 5 l. note. It struck me so much I could not stir for half a minute. When I came to myself I went to the bottom of the yard to look for him, but could see neither him nor the coat. I returned to look for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170017"/>the 5 l. note, and found it was an old duplicate, out of date. He never returned. I had to replace the coat. On the 3d of February, 1819, I saw the prisoner at the Mansion-house, and knew him again. I had not seen him before.</p>

Yes; I cannot recollect the time or the conversation exactly - it was in the shop; Mr. White had done business with him before this firm existed; he said to me, I suppose the credit is the same as when it was only White; I told him the credit was the same with Edenborough, White and Edenborough as it was with White, for when I entered my masters' service they told me their credit was three months.</p>

Reynolds, Chambers and Hickey were present, they qualified themselves by taking the usual oaths to each other; they then took the deposition of the petitioning creditor's debt, and signed the adjucation of bankruptcy; the act of bankruptcy was, that he had lain in prison for two months - the commissioners qualification was signed in my presence, and I witnessed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any order made for notice of the proceedings being given to the prisoner - A. Yes; he was summoned to appear personally on the 29th of August, the 19th of September, and the 3d of October, at Guildhall, at twelve o'clock, to make a full disclosure of his estate and effects. I produce the Gazette of the 22d of August, 1818, which contains notice of the bankruptcy - (read) - The commissioners met at Guildhall on the 29th of August; the bankrupt did not attend there that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he meet the commissioners any where else that day - A. Yes; he was brought before them at a private meeting at the Baptist's Head coffee-house, but refused to take the oath.

I am going to petition the Lord Chancellor, or proceed at law, to supersede the commission, which I have good reason to think is an illegal one. If the decision is against me, of course I shall answer. Q. You are required immediately to state whether you have the 500 l. or not - A.

Do you decline to give any further answer respecting the 500 l. - A. I do; but I beg to be understood that I do not decline answering from any intention to retain property which my creditors may be entitled to, or to evade the claims of justice, but that it is my intention, under legal advice which I have received, to contest the validity of the commission which has been issued against me.</p>

             being sworn, and examined on his oath, states the following answers to the questions hereafter stated - We think to right to apprize you, that you are bound, under the peril of committing a capital felony, now to disclose and discover all your effects, real and personal; and that you may be aware of your duty, you are called upon to hear the clause in the Act of Parliament now read to you (which was read accordingly); and having now heard the said clause In the Act of Parliament read, you are called upon to disclose and discover your effects, real and personal - A I am wholly unprepared, not having had any notice of the meeting, nor having any opportunity of seeing my legal adviser. I am not enabled to enter into any examination. Q. You have had the notice required by Act of Parliament, you attended on the 3d of October, being the day on which you by statute were required to make such discovery and disclosure, you were brought before the Commissioners again on the 7th of November, why then are you not now prepared to make such discovery and disclosure - A. I did not suppose<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170019"/>that I should be under the necessity of entering into any explanation, until the validity of the commission is determined. Q. Do you mean that you refuse to make such discovery and disclosure, until the validity of the commission is determined: or do you wish for any time to enable you forthwith to make such discovery and disclosure, as we think it proper to apprize you you are bound forthwith to do - A. I beg further time. Q. Do you mean that you beg for further time to make such discovery and disclosure, or that you may try the validity of the commission - A. I beg for further time, to enable me to make an account out. Q. If this meeting is adjourned for a week, will you, at the expiration of this week, make out the best account you are able - A. That is a time in which I should not be able to do any thing scarcely. Q. Will you now discover or disclose any part of your estate and effects - A. I am wholly unprepared. Q. We wish you to understand that we do not now ask you to discover or disclose the whole of your estate and effects, if you are unable so to do, but we repeat the question, Will you now discover or disclose any part of your estate or effects - A. Before I give any further answer to that I beg to see my counsel. Q. Time has been so often given you without success, that we must again repeat the question, Will you now discover or disclose any part of your estate or effects - A. I cannot at present, still I request it may be fully understood, that I by no means decline answering at present, from any intention to withhold property which others may be entitled to, neither do I wish to evade the claims of justice, but it is my intention, under legal advice which I have received, to contest the validity of the commission before a Jury, which has been issued against me, and for which purpose I have given my solicitor directions to commence a suit. Q. Was there not a sale on your premises the latter end of March last - A. Yes. Q. For how many days did the sale continue - A. Altogether three days. Did you not receive, after the second day's sale, the sum of 800 l. on some, and what other sum of money - A. It might be something of that kind, but I cannot say exactly. Q. Where is that money which you so received - A. I am not prepared to give an account at the present time. Q. Is it in your possession or under your control - A. I cannot answer it at the present time. Q. When you say you cannot answer it at the present time, do you mean that you are unable to say whether you are possessed, or have the control of this sum, or do you mean to say that you decline to answer the question, or have you any other meaning - A. I do decline for the present. Q. Did you not, after the third day's sale, receive a further sum of about 800 l. - A. I don't recollect the sum. Q. Did you not, after the third day's sale, receive a further sum of upwards of 500 l. - A. I did receive a sum of money, and it might probably be that amount. Q. Is that further sum of money in your possession, or under your control - A. I beg leave to decline answering for the present. Q. Such leave cannot and is not now given you, and you are now called upon to answer the question - A. I am not prepared to answer that for the present. Q. When you say that you are unprepared, do you mean to say you are unable or decline to answer - A. I do decline for the present. Q. Are you unable to answer that question - A. I am unable to give a particular account. Q. You are not asked to give a particular account; you are asked whether that sum is in your possession, or under your control - A. I should wish to see my solicitor before I enter into any further answer. Q. Was not your stock in trade valued, early in the present year, under prime cost, at the sum of 8000 l. and upwards - A. I believe the Accountant did make it somewhere near that amount. Q. Was not such stock sold off in the month of March last - A. It was thereabouts, I believe. Q. What sum did you actually receive from the produce of such sale - A. I do not recollect. Q. Did you not receive upwards of 3000 l. - A. Certainly not. Q. Did you not receive upwards of 2000 l. - A. I cannot say now. Q. Will you say you did not receive that sum - A. I cannot tell. Q. Where is the money you did receive; is it in your possession, or under your control - A. I beg leave to decline further explanation at the present. Q. Leave is not given you, and you are called upon now to answer the question - A. I must beg leave to see my advisers before I say more. Q. Do you then refuse to answer the question - A. I do decline at present.</p>

             be discharged from custody as to the commitment of the commissioners, and the warrant of Mr. Birnie, dated 4th of January, 1818.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter, whose hand-writing is it - A. It is the hand-writing of a clerk in our office - it applies to another order - (read).</p>
               <p>Sir - If the same anxiety existed to discharge Mr. Page, as procured and continued his illegal and unjust imprisonment, he would have been released on Saturday, when all the Commissioners were in town. You are well aware that an instrument, signed by only two commissioners is of no use, and we are advised it is in the power of the Commissioners to release Mr. Page, without further trouble or expense; we will, however, attend the Judge, and give every assistance in our power to release Mr. Page, as he considers every hour's imprisonment a great aggravation, and it is to be hoped a day will come when this oppressed individual will have justice done him. A petition was yesterday presented to the Lord Chancellor for a habeas corpus, and you will be served this day with a copy.</p>
               <p>ROGERS AND SON.</p>
               <p>To MR. G. ADAMS May 13, 1818.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Justice Holroyd's order for the prisoner to be brought up to be discharged from the commitments of the commissioners, in consequence of the first commission being superseded, was then put in and read, dated May, 14, 1818.)</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. When was the order that you produced, obtained - A. It was drawn up on the 5th of June; the term ended on the 10th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Tilleard attend on that occasion - A. Yes, and said he had no objection to the order. Mr. Justice Holroyd requested him to attend the Judge, or sign on the back of the order that he had no objection to it, both of which he refused to do. I, in consequence attended before Mr. Justice Abbot, made an affidavit of the service,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170020"/>stated what had passed between me and Mr. Tilleard, and obtained the order.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that order ever made a rule of Court - A. No, it was not proceeded on, nor made a rule of Court, in consequence of an opinion which I obtained from Mr. Cullen, whom I consulted on the prisoner's behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that opinion taken by the prisoner's desire, to govern his conduct - A. It was, and I communicated that opinion to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you employed as solicitor for the prisoner - A. In January, 1818, my father was employed and interfered respecting the prisoner's proposition to his creditors. I first interfered in the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. The verdict in the prisoner's favour was on the 9th of May, on the 19th of that month was any offer made to his creditors - A. Yes, I advised him to make a proposal to his creditors, and a circular letter was sent round to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner instruct you to bring any action to try the validity of the present commission - A. Yes, it was determined early in November that an action should be brought.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason why it was not immediately brought - A. It was considered as a local action against the commissioners, and the imprisonment being in Surry, it was thought proper to bring the action in Surry. There was a consultation under the first commission, with two gentleman of the Bar, and it was thought by them that it was a local action, and therefore I acted on that opinion in the second action. I could not proceed to trial until the Spring Assizes, and I brought the action sufficiently early for that purpose. I commenced proceedings on the 12th of January, as far as I am able to judge, it was determined to bring it on then. I exercised my own judgment as to when it was to be brought, and did not consult the prisoner. I engaged counsel to attend him at his third meeting, to guide him as to the conduct he was to pursue.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you mean to swear that counsel advised him not to answer - A. I do not know, I was not there. We thought it important that we should not advise Mr. Page.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you consult about laying the action - A. Mr. Sergeant 
               <persName id="t18190217-29-person337">Onslow</persName>
             and Mr. Barlow.</p>
               <p>Q. The commissioners' commitment was to Newgate - A. Yes, there were two actions brought against the commissioners, one was for Middlesex, and the other for the commitment at the Baptist Head, it was thought proper to lay the venue where it took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that apply to the first or second commission - A. To both; it was in consequence of 42 
               <persName id="t18190217-29-person338">Geo. III</persName>
            . c. 85.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were advised to bring it in London. how came you to bring it in Surry - A. We were not advised to bring it in London; the consultation was on the first commission.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the answers you have been giving apply to former actions, which were never proceeded on - A. We have not been to trial yet; they were brought after the first verdict.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you bring the last action in consequence of the advice of any counsel - A. No, I took the opinion I had received, on the first commission, thinking it applied to the second also.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the commitment in the first case, on which you received the advice of the learned Sergeant, was in the King's Bench prison - A. No, I believe you will find it was in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any act done by the commissioners except in Middlesex or London - A. No; I know of none; we considered the imprisonment in Surry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the act charged in the action now pending - A. For the commitment by the commissioners, the first time he was brought before them, and for the imprisonment in the King's Bench. He was brought from the King's Bench to be examined, and taken back there.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Have you any commitment of the prisoner on the 29th of August, 1818 - A. I have - it is the commitment to Newgate - I produce it.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. He was brought to the King's Bench under that commitment - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. H. EDENBOROUGH. I am one of the petitioning creditors; I attended the meeting of the prisoner's creditors, in the early part of January 1818, at the Baptist's Head coffee-house; the prisoner was in an anti-room waiting. He came in before his creditors - Mr. Rogers, Sen. attended in his behalf; an account of his effects was produced, of which I took a copy.</p>
               <p>(read).</p>
               <p>LOSSES AND EXPENSES. - Going in, 100 l. Bad debts, 1,500 l. Lost by sale of goods to Smith, Islington, 3,000 l. Ditto Foster, Robins, Machin, and Eddes, 380 l. Ditto by exchange of lace, 60 l. Cash lent Murt, 90 l. Ditto by forged notes, 80 l. Lost by goods sold in shop, 350 l. By goods stolen in the shop 400 l. Rent and taxes, 270 l. Law Expenses, 120 l. House Expenses, 400 l. Wages, 140 l. Personal Expenses, 170 l. - Total, 7,060. Stock in hand, 9,525 l.</p>
               <p>Q. At that meeting were the amount of the prisoner's debts stated - A. Yes; Mr. Rogers undertook to say that they did not exceed 13,000 l. The creditors requested Mr. Rogers to withdraw, while they considered the statement; the prisoner was then called in; 5 s. in the pound was offered on his brother's security, and his own note for 1 s. 6 d. - making together 6 s. 6 d. in the pound; it was calculated that that was not half of what he made there were assets to pay, and the offer was not accepted. He had been in business about fifteen months. I called on him two or three times, with the other creditors, to induce him to make a better offer - he said he could make no better offer than he had done. He said he kept no books. He was asked to produce bills of parcels, they were not forthcoming. Corfe, the shopman, said in his presence that the goods were ticked off when they came in, and the bills were afterwards destroyed. The prisoner did not contradict it. I believe this was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the goods furnished to him such articles as he dealt in - A. Yes; he dealt considerably in lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. Did he not say that he could not obtain security for more than 5 s. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, I will give you so much in the pound, or you shall take all the effects on giving me a release - A. Yes, the proposition was made, but on this condition, that he would not give up the property unless every individual creditor had signed the release, and it would be impossible to get the signature of every creditor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170021"/>Q. Was it not proposed that an execution which was in the house, for the stock taken of his brother, should be withdrawn for the benefit of the creditors - A. Mr. Rogers said, he thought if the creditors would accede to the proposal, it might possibly be done. I think he said he would try to persuade

             to forego the execution. He made out that he had 9,525 l. to pay 13,000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. How was his stock taken - A. At prime-cost, and those articles that were depreciated in value were rated under prime-cost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not offer to give up the stock to his creditors after the commission was set aside - A. A circular letter was sent round, and Rogers and Son desired to have a meeting, but the creditors would not meet him, considering the proposition so fraudulent. This was after the trial, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. The circular letters were dated May 19 - this was a long while after the property was all sold by auction - A. I believe it was. My brother was assignee under the first commission. There was not a halfpenny to be got on the 14th of May - none of his property was to be got at.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the terms upon which he proposed to give up all his property - A. He said he would not give up a farthing until every individual creditor had signed his release. It was suggested to him that he should deliver up the property to three or four of his principal creditors, but as many creditors lived in the country it would be impossible to get them all to sign.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose they did not all sign, what was to be done - A. We promised to endeavour to get them to sign, but as he refused the offer, no further proposition took place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he insist that delivering up all his property would be an act of bankruptcy - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. Did you accompany Mr. Adams to the prisoner with a deed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it stated to Mr. Page that Mr. Rogers had approved of that deed on his part - A. I do not recollect that it was. He said he could not sign it until he had consulted his solicitor.</p>

The third day about the same sum was received - I paid that also to the prisoner, in his own house - (looks at a 100 l. note, being one of those produced from the Bank.)</p>

               <p>Q. Were you examined before the commissioners - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose hand-writing do you believe it to be - A. The question was almost extorted from me, and I said it bore a similarity to

               <p>Q. On your oath do you or do you not believe it to be his - A. My belief is that it bears a similarity.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it such a similarity, that you believe it to be his - A. I should rather believe it was; I paid him the same note that is now produced. Every thing was sold off that was on the premises, both stock and furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the notes, do you see any of them you paid to him among them - A. Here are two 40 l., three 20 l., a 15 l., a 10 l., and a 5 l. note, all of which have gone through my hands - they have my mark on them, and are the notes that I paid him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive any money himself from the sale - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT COPLEY. Q. Did not the sale commence under an execution - A, Yes; the amount of the levy was 800 l. The prisoner succeeded his brother in the business, and took the stock at a valuation. The execution was to secure his brother payment for the stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then why was not the money paid to the Sheriff - A. The produce of the sale was more than the levy - the business was put an end to by the execution, and the second and third day's sale was for his own benefit.</p>

             I am an auctioneer. I was employed to sell the prisoner's stock on the 26th of March; I only sold the first day. The produce of what I sold, was, 1241 l. 10 s. 3 d.

I returned to my room a little after four o'clock, and found the door open - it had been opened with my own key, which I had put on a shelf on the landing-place. I found my boxes open, they were shut when I left the room. I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of them; they were worth 23 s. I found them the same day, with the prisoner in custody. She was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            , he rents the house, which is in the liberty of the Rolls, Attridge lodges with us - the prisoner is quite a stranger. On the 22d January I came home at half-past two o'clock, and did not go out after - I am sure I came home as early as that. About twenty minutes after three o'clock I saw the prisoner come into the house, and go up stairs - I have other lodgers. In about twenty minutes she came down and went out. As she passed the parlour window I saw she had a large bundle in her lap, and a hat-box in her hand - she brought nothing in. I suspected her, and gave the alarm - my street-door was open. I described her to Haston, and we both went after her. She was taken at the corner of New-street, Shoe-lane, with the property; she was brought back, and the prosecutrix claimed it. I asked her what she had done with the hat-box which was in her hand? she said she had none.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the horse and cart in Tottenham-court-road. I thought if I sold the wood I should get something for taking it home.</p>

            . In February, 1818, I was midshipman of the Magician frigate, which was stationed at the Island of Mauritius - we laid off port Jacutos. On the 21st of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, we perceived a schooner standing off and in Suriac, which is a harbour of the island - the wind was against us; Mr. Evans, the master, ordered Mr. Jarrat, another midshipman, and myself, to go over land to intercept the schooner - we went with a party of seamen - we had to go eight miles. We got to Suriac about half-past four o'clock, and saw her endeavouring to get out of port, in so doing she ran on the reef of the rocks; we all boarded her, and found twelve or thirteen persons on board, among whom were the three prisoners - Phillibert appeared to be the master, and the other two mates. Phillibert gave the papers to Mr. Jarrat, and said they kept no log-book - they spoke in French. I went into the hold to examine the vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fitted up - A. With a loose deck, or platform, about four feet from the upper deck; there was no cargo on board, except water. I examined three of the casks, two of which were filled with salt water. There were above twenty casks on board, which was much more than sufficient to supply twelve men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did the ship appear to be fitted up - A. For the slave trade. The schooner went down before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170024"/>we left her. On the 24th of February we searched a storehouse close to the bank of the river, and found yards and sails, and about a dozen pair of shackles, or irons, of different sizes, as if for women and boys; they were taken on board our frigate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before you boarded the schooner did you first see her - A. About an hour and a half, or two hours; she was about three miles off at sea, when we first saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have landed 92 slaves without your knowing it - A. I do not think they could, it would take a long time. I was never on board but one slaveship that had no moveable deck. There was not room enough to carry bullocks. The storehouse belonged to Madam Munroe, who has, I believe, about four hundred slaves. The island is about nine months voyage from here. We brought the prisoners home with us.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What ship did you return in - A. The Prince Regent merchant ship. The prisoners were treated kindly on the voyage.</p>

            . I was a seaman on board the Magician. I was one of the party on board the tender, on the 21st of February, we were directed to go by land to intercept the schooner - our party consisted of nine. When we got to Suriac we separated, one party went in a boat to go on board her, the other went on the hill, to fire into her. I went on the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you fire into her for - A. She tried to get out, and struck on a reef of rocks. We boarded her, and saw the three prisoners there, and eight or nine sailors - the prisoners appeared to be officers. The schooner went down in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoners - A. In confinement at the hospital of Port Louis. After the schooner was wrecked I went on board, and brought some spars and tackle away, and took them to Munroe's storehouse, where I found about thirty-six bags of stuff, like rice, and a bag of irons, large and small - they appeared to be for peoples' legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I found the things at the storehouse the first time that I went, which was the day after the schooner went down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you compare the tackle you brought from the schooner with that in the storehouse - A. Yes, they were the tackle of the same ship.</p>
               <p>LISE VICTORINE (through an interpreter). I was slave to Madam Lebrun, who lived at the Hermitage, at the Mauritius.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a quantity of blacks being brought to your mistress's - A. Yes, the prisoners and Le Tountaine came with them, and two or three sailors - they were put in the storehouse - there were men, women, and two or three children. They remained in the storehouse about three days. They could not speak French. There had been a hurricane in the island.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoners remain there - A. About three days; they lodged in mistress's house. They went out with about half the blacks, and returned with them, the same day, and put them into the storehouse again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Monsieur Cavilla - A. Yes, Quanto was his servant; they came in while the prisoners were there, and brought the provisions and clothes with them for the new blacks; they both slept at mistress's house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a party of soldiers coming at night to the house while the prisoners and blacks were there - A. Yes, about three days after the blacks arrived, Cavilla and Quanto were also there - the soldiers were not admitted. Madam Lebrun said she would not open the door unless the Commissary came; he came next morning with Mr. Campbell, and the door was opened. The prisoners, Quanto and Clerensac, were marched away with the blacks - some of the blacks were left, as they were ill. I never saw the prisoners at my mistress's house before. Polydore, who is my husband, came to see me while the blacks were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoners came at the time of the hurricane - A. Yes, the hurricane began on the last Saturday in February, on which day the prisoners came - it lasted two days. My husband is his mother's property - he lived about five leagues from the Hermitage; he came on the Monday, and saw the blacks - he did not ask me about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Cavilla - A. He died in prison in the Isle of France.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not your husband been made free in consequence of the information he gave - A. Yes.</p>

I walked about the yard, and saw the storehouse full of blacks. Cavilla asked me what I wanted with the blacks. I remained there till the next day, and then went and gave information to the captain of one of his Majesty's ships. The Governor sent me with Captain Campbell and some soldiers, to Madam Lebrun's house, we got there between ten and eleven o'clock at night.

             were part of the detachment - Pollydore went with us as a guide, by the Governor's order. We arrived about eleven o'clock at night. He pointed out a wooden building, and two small huts about fifteen paces from the building. I divided my detachment into two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170025"/>parties, and surrounded the wooden building with one, and the huts with the other. I had a lanthorn with me - I went into the huts, and found both of them filled with blacks; there were seventy-two men and boys, and seven women and girls - the greatest part of them were naked. Besides these, there was one dead, another dying, two were covered with the small-pox, and nine were so very weak that I could not remove them - they could neither stand nor move. The greatest part of them were covered with the itch. They appeared quite astonished when the soldiers surrounded the huts; they came up to us, and examined our clothes and arms - they appeared quite savage - they were Mosambique blacks. I spoke to them in the Creole French, which is the language we talk to the blacks in the Mauritius, they did not understand us, nor could I understand them. I am positive they were newly imported. I secured the huts for the night, and then went to the building, knocked at the door, and requested admission - a woman's voice answered, that she was alone, with her two daughters, and would not open the door at that time of night. I desired the soldiers not to allow a single person to escape from the house. I then went about the plantation, and found a hut some distance from the principal building, with eight or nine blacks in it - I spoke to them in French, they answered. They must have been sometime in the island, or they could not have understood the language. I returned to my detachment, and remained there till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any boilers near the huts - A. I saw three large iron boilers before the doors of the huts, which are generally used to boil victuals for a number of blacks - one of them had something like a decoction, which they generally give the blacks for the itch. Next morning, about eleven o'clock, Mr. Casso, the Magistrate, came in a palanquin. As soon as they heard the noise which the bearers of the palanquin make, they opened the windows and threw the doors open, which Mr. Casso and myself entered, and found the three prisoners, Cavilla and Quanto, Madam Lebrun, her two daughters, and Victorine. I shewed my orders to Mr. Casso, and told him I was to take the persons prisoners to Redwhee; he requested I would leave M. Cavilla behind with Madam Lebrun - I consented, as he said he would be responsible. I then took the prisoners, seventy-two of the blacks, and Quanto, to Redwhee. I left twenty-one negroes behind, as they were not able to march. Madam Lebrun's house is twenty-two miles from Suriac, and is in a large forest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the island governed according to the terms of the capitulation - A. I should think so. I had not been a fortnight on the island. Madagascar is five or six days' voyage from the island. The slaves on the island are constantly in the habit of seeing soldiers.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week did you go to Madam Lebrun's - A. On Tuesday - the hurricane had subsided on Sunday.</p>

            . I am a private in the 22d Regiment of Foot. I went to Madam Lebrun's; the prisoners were there, and ninety-two blacks in the huts.</p>
               <p>PHILLIBERT and TRESGROSSE jointly put in an exceeding long written Defence, in which they stated that the ship was laden with a cargo of forty-eight oxen, which they lost in consequence of the severe weather, and the vessel was run ashore; the sailors came on board, and they delivered their papers, and advised them to sure themselves, as the vessel was sinking. They came ashore and lost their way, but meeting Clerensac, he took them to Lebrun's as they were fatigued; they meant to continue their journey next day, but the roads were so very bad, in consequence of the hurricanes and rains; that the soldiers surrounded the house and secured them. (The defence then went on to complain of ill usage in the island, and denying all knowledge of the blacks.)</p>
               <p>CLERENSAC'S Defence. Two days after the hurricane, I met the two prisoners, who appeared fatigued; I took them to Lebrun's - we found Cavilla there. The house was surrounded by soldiers that night, and next morning we were taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>- QUANTO. I am a native of the Isle of France. I was at Madam Lebrun's house when the soldiers came - the prisoners came there that evening alone - they brought no negroes - I never was there before; I cannot tell whether they were there before or not. I was brought to England as a prisoner with them, and discharged by the Privy Council.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL. Q. You was Cavilla's servant; what quantity of provisions did you carry that day to Madame Lebrun's - there was some rice. I went to conduct some old negroes there.</p>

On the 12th of February, about half-past six o'clock at night, I was in the shop - it was quite dark - the lamps had been lit above an hour. Thompson came in, and said he had got two boys for breaking our window, and had taken them to the watch-house - we knew nothing of it ourselves. I had seen the window in the morning, one pane was cracked quite across, from side to side, but the glass was quite fast, and not at all likely to come out - the crack had been there for near a month. When Thompson came in I went out, and found the pane broke and cracked all over - one piece was out; I had not been in the shop ten minutes before Thompson came in - I did not hear it break - it might have been broken before I went in. I observed the handkerchief hanging about half a yard out of the window - one part inside and the other out; they were full a yard from the window when I saw them before. There was a piece of cloth behind the glass, which prevented them from coming quite out; there was a quantity of glass in the window, when we cleared the things away.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre's. On the 12th of February, between six and seven o'clock at night - it was quite dark, I was informed there were some suspicious persons in St. John-street, I went there with Morgan, the patrol. I saw the two prisoners there in company with another, (who had an umbrella,) against the prosecutor's shop - I was in a house on the opposite side of the street. I saw them all three go up close to the window - they appeared to be covering each other, so that nobody should notice them - the middle man appeared to be doing something to the glass; I do not know whether it was the other man or the prisoner Williams; they all immediately left the window, and crossed over to my side of the way - nobody had given any alarm. They joined, went back to the window again, and still appeared to be employed as before; somebody came by, who appeared to look at them; they all left the window again, and crossed over to my side. They repeated it three or four times. At last I saw Jones go up to the window by himself; I saw him put his left hand into the window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170027"/>and pull something - he remained there about a minute; they crossed over the way, and saw me knocking at a shop-door; Jones looked at me, and crossed over immediately, as I suspected, to give the others a signal that I was watching. I followed, got on the opposite side, and collared both, as they appeared to be making off; Williams made a desperate resistance, and got from me. I called for assistance, and the patrol stopped him in the middle of the road, before he got out of my sight; I put them in the watch-house, which is about 150 yards off, and returned directly to Mr. Hawkins - I could not have been gone above two or three minutes. When I came back I observed the glass had been broken - the putty appeared to have been cut with a small knife; there was a piece of glass quite out, and taken away; a small piece of glass was left sticking to the putty. Drakefield said two handkerchiefs had been taken out - I did not see them.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was coming down St. John-street, about half-past five o'clock, and saw the prisoners looking in at several shop-windows; I watched them. At last they went up to the prosecutor's window. I gave Thompson information, and we both went to the shop - it was then about a quarter before six o'clock - you could not distinguish a man's features by the natural light - the lamps were lit in the street and shops. I saw the prisoner, Jones, with two others go up to Hawkins's shop; I then saw the man with the umbrella push the corner pane of glass with his hand; then all three went from the window up the street. I went and called Thompson to my assistance - we went and found them at the window, Jones was in the middle pushing the glass with his hand. Two persons went into the shop; the three prisoners immediately crossed over the way; Jones came and stood before me, looking me full in the face, the other two stopped. Directly Jones saw me, he went and spoke to them, and they all went away together. They came down St. John-street again, went to the window, and I saw Williams pulling at something. I went down the street, and stood at the end of Swan-alley, and saw all three at the window. Jones walked away, and crossed to where Thompson was hiding himself - a waggon came by, and I saw no more until Thompson called out, tyo, which is my watch-ward; I crossed over, and saw Thompson had hold of the two prisoners; Williams struck him and got away, another patrol came by, and struck him with a stick; I seized him, and immediately took him to the watch-house. I went to the window, and saw two handkerchiefs hanging out of the broken place - it was near seven o'clock when we took them.</p>

            . On Friday, the 12th of February, at full half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was coming out of Swan-alley into St. John-street; Thomson stood at the end of the passage; he pointed three men out to me at Hawkins's shop - they were the prisoners, and another who had an umbrella over his shoulder; he desired me to go beyond them, and assist in securing them if they went from the shop. I went directly opposite to them, about 15 yards off on the other side - all three stood abreast the window, the middle one seemed to put his hand to the window - at that time a person hastily passed by, he has hastily took his hand from the window, and rose it to his face. I distinctly saw a piece of glass in his hand, about as big as my four fingers. All three instantly walked from the window up the street, crossed over, and came close by me. I heard the alarm, and afterwards saw them at the watch-house. Williams had an apron on when he came to the watch-house, he doubled it round him; and I think the man who rose the glass to his head had an apron on.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoners were brought to me - I think Williams had no apron on, Jones had one. I found a comb on Jones. Before Williams was searched he sat down on a form; soon after, I took a candle, and under the form I found a knife, exactly under where he sat. I went next day to look at the window; it appeared as if a knife had been run down between the frame and the glass - nobody had been in the watch-house before this. I cannot say the knife was not there before.</p>

On Saturday, the 13th of February, I had ten sheep safe in my field; on Monday morning I was informed one was lost; I went and found the whole carcase of a sheep at Payne's shop, the butcher - it was hot; the watchman, Hall, shewed it to me; it appeared to be very badly cut up. I went to my field, and found the skin. I am sure it was the skin of my sheep. The carcase was compared with it - I am certain the carcase belonged to the skin. The head was left in the skin, and so were the feet. The bones of the legs corresponded. The prisoner said he found it in his road from Colnbrook.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 15th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at Hounslow, with a bag on his back, and asked him where he came from? he said from Colnbrook, and he was going to London; I asked him what he had got there? he said it was only a few blankets which he was going to take to his wife. I told him to put them down for me to see them - he did so, and said,</p>
               <p>"Watchman, I have only got a bit of meat, which I found in the road; I have got the price of a glass, you may as well take it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170028"/>and let me go." I secured him, and took the bag to a butcher's shop, where Keene saw it; there was the carcase of a sheep in the bag - it was quite warm.</p>

             was under my care - she was about two years and seven months old. I first saw the prisoner about a fortnight before Cormack died; he came to me under the Piazza, at Covent-garden, where I sell soup in the morning - I keep a fire there to keep it warm, He told me that I lost my customers by not coming earlier; I said I could not get my boys up to help me out sooner; he said he would help me any morning; I told him where I lived. Next morning he came and helped me to market - he came three mornings running; I gave him his breakfast for his trouble. On the third morning I missed a brass cock from my water-but; I did not see him again until the night before the child was burnt - he then came. I asked him what brought him back to my place the last time that he left? I told him the cock was stolen, and I thought it was him; he said he returned for his stick, and he did not know what to do with a brass cock - I told him to come no more. Next morning, about seven o'clock, he came to me in the market, and said he had got some composition coal for me; I said I never heard of such coal; he said it was what gentlemen burnt in their parlours, as it made no smoke, and was like Kilkenny coal, and that it would make up a fine fire without any smoke. I told him to put it in my basket; he emptied my charcoal, and put it in my basket - there was about a hatfull of it in one lump; he had it in a butter-flat - he behaved as usual, and I gave him a bason of soup.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the stuff like - A. It was black, it did not shine like coal, it was soft, and not heavy. I went home about ten o'clock, and took it with me. I put the fire which I brought from market into the grate;

I put the basket about half a yard from the fireplace, and put a little piece of the stuff, which I broke off, about the size of a hen's egg on the fire; the moment I laid it on, it went off with the greatest report, and flew all about the place; it caught the rest in the basket which went off immediately, caught the childrens clothes, and mine was all on fire in a moment - our clothes were all blazing.

            . In the early part of November Eliza left my house; I afterwards found she was at the prisoner's house, and I went to him on the subject. I asked him if he had made the young lady his wife? - he made a bow, but said nothing. I asked him again - he said he was not accustomed to answer questions put to him in that kind of way. I then appealed to Eliza, who was present, and asked her if she had been in that house ever since she left mine, which was about ten days; she cried a great deal, and said she had. I said</p>
               <p>"Are you married?" She was going to answer me, but looked at the prisoner, and he said,</p>
               <p>"You must ask me any questions you have to ask." I then told her she had left her home, and was gone into the paths of wretchedness and misery, and that the villain who had now got her, would keep her a few months, and then return her upon my hands - she was then just turned sixteen years of age. I then told the prisoner he had been the means of making two unfortunate orphans completely unhappy, in separating them in this kind of way, and requested her immediately to leave the villain; she still cried, and said I cannot leave him. The prisoner observed that it was impossible for me to say that they were not married, and that no one should put their feet between Eliza and him. I requested her again to leave him and go home with me, telling her, that as long as I had a home it should be her's, while she remained in the paths of virtue - I was very warm. The prisoner arose, and seemed to put himself in a posture of defence between her and me - I suppose he thought I was going to take her away. He said,</p>
               <p>"If you get her away, I will be the death of you;" and that he would give me satisfaction at any time, or any other gentleman that would come to him. I thought he might mean money, and told him money would be no satisfaction to me, and I disdained his purse; he said sneeringly,</p>
               <p>"I have no purse, I keep my money in my pocket." He pointed to the door, and said he did not wish to see me, and he was sure Eliza did not. He then said he felt for Emily, her sister and that she might be under his roof with Eliza, and then the sisters could be comfortable together; he made a great many promises to Emily, who was with me, that he would be her father and protector, and that he would give every satisfactory answer to her if I would leave the room. I went out, leaving Emily there, and he said I should not come in again. Emily soon after joined me, and we went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Eliza come home after this - A. Yes, on Monday, I think, and remained till the Sunday week following, which was twelve days. The day after she returned I heard that he had called, and promised her any recompence. I went to him, and asked him if he would marry her? for nothing else would be a compensation for the injury done; he said he could not marry, for he was under a 600 l. bond not to marry, and that he never intended, nor ever would marry her. I told him her father was a man as high in rank as himself, under his Majesty, and that the young ladies had been brought up quite different to what he imagined, seeing them in an humble situation with me. Her father was a purser in the Navy. He then said he could not be accountable for his conduct in seducing her, for if it was the daughter of the Prince Regent, or the first Lord of the Admiralty, it would be the same thing to him - nothing more particular passed; Eliza left me again in about twelve days. I requested Fleet to go with Emily to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner offered no violence to you - A No; he said if I got her away he would be the death of me - he was an officer, and has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170030"/>lost a leg and an arm. I am a married man. I told the prisoner the young women were relations of mine.</p>

            . I have a sister named Eliza, we lived together with Mr. Gittens. In consequence of Eliza going away, I went with Mr. Gittens to the prisoner's cottage, and saw her with him. There was some conversation between the prisoner and Mr. Gittens, after which he left the room. The prisoner then desired me to take a chair, and said he would tell me the particulars, and not to make myself uneasy; I asked him if he had married my sister? he smiled, and asked me if I did not think it equally solemn to be married in that house, as to go to church? I said certainly, if by a proper person; he said soldiers never went to church to be married - nothing more particular passed; I went out, and went home with Mr. Gittens.</p>
               <p>Q. After your sister returned, and went away again, did you miss any thing - A. I missed a letter, and went with Fleet to the prisoner's cottage about half-past six o'clock in the evening; I knocked at the door, and heard Captain Royal say he would answer the door himself; he requested to know who was there. I said my name was Neysmith; he said he did not know such a name or such a person. I said I had merely come for a letter, which my sister had taken away in her box, as I supposed, by mistake. He said my sister was gone to Dover, and he had got no letter of mine. He asked me if I was alone? I said yes, in hopes I should obtain the letter, upon which Fleet said,</p>
               <p>"No - she is not alone." The prisoner immediately said,</p>
               <p>"It is that villiain Gittens, I will shoot him, and send him home without a leg, or a wing." I said it was not Gittens - it was Fleet. He said Fleet or Gittens he did not care for he would shoot them, or twenty more. I heard him go up stairs, and call for his pistols - he opened the window, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now I am ready," put the pistol out of the window and fired - I was at the door; it was not fired towards me - Fleet was by the garden railings. He called for more powder and ball, came down, and said if I did not go from the door, he would pepper me also - I went away very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Fleet was never at the prisoner's before - A. No, he merely went to protect me. The letter I wanted, entitled me and my sister to a small pension - I do not suppose he meant to injure me.</p>

On the 11th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour behind my shop, the prisoner came in, and asked to see some seals, my wife was attending to him; she showed him a tray, which contained eight dozen. He asked for a blood-stone seal, saying it was for a very fine engraving. I went into the shop to inform him what were the best stones for engraving. I returned into the parlour, and heard him say,</p>
               <p>"I will take this - it is 30 s., is it not? You must send it to Tower-street." My wife answered,</p>
               <p>"Oh, send it!" I said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Sir, we will send it," as he appeared a gentleman. My wife then said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, you have got another seal in your other hand," which he held down by his side. He then lifted up his hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I hope, Madam, you did not think I meant to steal your seal!" - it was in his left hand. It was a red cornelian seal, not the sort that he enquired for. He stood at the rail, not at the counter. He asked me if I wished to search him? I said, No, but I would take the liberty of walking to Tower-street with him. With some reluctance he took me to Tower-street, to a respectable boot-maker's shop - I asked him if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170031"/>lodged there? the master said No. I asked him if he would pay 30 s. for him if I sent an article there? he said,</p>
               <p>"Certainly not," and said he had not seen him for five years before. He gave me his name, and said he was a surgeon. Mr. Helmsley, the boot-maker, said,</p>

               <p>"You had better tell the truth at once - you know you have been in two or three different situations since you was a surgeon. He then said he was in no employ at present, and that</p>
               <p>"the seal was for Mr. Charles." I gave him in charge. There was only 1 d. and a duplicate found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Have you not since found he has been a surgeon - A. Yes. He produced the seal immediately my wife charged him with it. Mr. Hemsley offered to pay me for the seal - I refused.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, and live in Tower-street. Hatton brought the prisoner to my shop, he did not live there. I said, I thought he could not be guilty of such a thing, and offered to pay for the seal, the prosecutor refused. If he had come to me, and said he had ordered a seal to my house, I should most likely have paid for it.</p>

On the 13th of January he left work about four o'clock, and brought the key home as usual - I kept it in my bed-room. Next morning he came to work at half-past six o'clock, which was rather earlier than usual. I gave him the key, he returned in about five minutes, and asked me if I had been in the barn since he left? I said No. He said there was a sack of wheat stolen - I went to the barn, found it was so, and told him to clean up another sack in its place - I did not suspect him. I sent him round to the mills with samples of the wheat, and told him if he found any that corresponded with it to give notice of it - he said it was the sack that he had cleaned up last. While he was gone to the mills, I searched, and found the sack, with about two bushels of wheat, in the calves' pen in the cow-house, covered with hay - the rest must have been taken away - I left it there. I did not tell the prisoner of it, but watched in the evening, with my nephew and brother. The prisoner left work between four and five o'clock, I gave him no orders to watch. I went to watch about half-past five o'clock, came back to the house for my gun, returned in about five minutes, and found the sack had been removed about three yards in my absence. I went away about seven, leaving my cousin to watch, and heard the prisoner was taken. His house was afterwards searched - six bushels of flour, and a peck and a half of wheat, were found there.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's cousin. I watched while he was gone into the house, and heard a rustling noise in the calf-pen - the door of the rick-yard was open. I was within three yards of it. I heard a man walking softly out of the cowhouse, and being quite dark in the cowhouse, I could not see him - he rushed out of the door, and I endeavoured to lay hold of him, I could then see his dress. About a minute after I found the prisoner in the rick-yard, under the haystack, within ten yards of the cowhouse door - he stood up under the haystack, and was dressed the same as the man that ran out. I have not the least doubt of his being the same man - I found nobody but him there. It was about half-past seven o'clock - he had no business there. I collared him, and said, Now I have got you, you must go with me. He said,</p>

Feasey came in in June, and Knight in January; I believe, they were both sent by the Lord Mayor - one was employed in the needle-room, and the other in the school, only to learn to read. On Wednesday, the 17th of February, between nine and ten o'clock, I was informed of their absence, and of the loss of a quantity of silk handkerchiefs. On searching the premises, ineffectually, for sometime, I watched in the street, and saw the prisoner, Feasey, jump over a gate of the premises belonging to our neighbour; I secured her, went over the gate into the neighbour's premises, and found the prisoner, Knight. I brought her into the house, and was informed that the property in question was in the yard where they jumped over from. I went there with a candle, and found it in the neighbour's yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get over - A. They got over at the end of the committee-room, by means of a short ladder - they must have got on each other's shoulders to get up - they must then have gone over the tiles, and dropped down near the front of the house.</p>

On Friday evening, the 22d of January, between eight o'clock, and twenty minutes after I was setting in the bar, I thought I heard a noise up stairs, took the candle off the table, went into the passage, and listened for a short time at the foot of the stairs - I did not hear any more noise.

               <p>"What is the matter, mistress?" and the maid-servant came out. In the mean time the prisoner came down stairs. I stood with my back against a pair of folding doors in the passage, he came up to me; I said to him,</p>
               <p>"Where have you been?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Up stairs." I said,</p>

               <p>"You shall not go till you have told me who you have been to." In the mean time the servant girl had come out of the tap-room into the passage; she likewise laid hold of him, and said,</p>

            , who was sitting in the tap-room, he came out, and laid hold of him - the bustle and confusion became general. A young man, who lodged up stairs, came down - he fell over something on the first landing-place, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Here is a table left in the passage!" By that time the prisoner was taken into the tap-room. I told them to hold him fast, and sent the maid up stairs to see if my room was safe - she ran up, and in less than a minute called out,</p>
               <p>"Mistress, here is your room-door open, and the club-box standing in the passage!" I ran up, and found it standing on the landing-place - it was removed from my side of the bed, where it always stood, and on to the landing-place. I ran into my room, and missed a small red trunk, with its contents, which was the plate - they were gone entirely. On the bed I found a small Tunbridge-ware box, which was emptied of its contents, which were a watch, a picture, necklace and lockets, and my husband's will, which was thrown on the bed with it. I then went down stairs, and said I was robbed. In the mean time Hooper had searched the prisoner in the tap-room, and found ten skeleton keys, a dark-lanthorn, an iron crow-bar, and a phosphorus bottle. He was brought into the bar, stripped, and searched further; a skeleton and a picklock key were found on him, with 1 s. 2 1/2 d. None of my property was found. There were marks of the iron crow-bar on the club-box, as if he had attempted to open it - it had not been opened. There was another club-box in the room, which had marks of the crow-bar on it. I sent to Marlborough-street for an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. I had not been in my bed-room after half-past three o'clock. We have a great many lodgers in the house. None of the property was found on the prisoner. Hearing a noise created my suspicion. I have found none of the property.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Persons going up and down stairs would not have created your suspicion - A. No, it was the noise. I lost all the plate stated in the indictment out of the red box, and have never recovered it. The money was in the club-box.</p>

I was at the prosecutor's house - I went there about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and saw a man very much like the prisoner, standing at the door as I went into the tap-room; he stood outside the house. I went out again in about ten minutes - he still stood there. Dean asked me what that man was looking over at the house for? I told him it was nothing to him, and to come in and have some beer. We went in, and was there until a quarter after eight o'clock. Mrs. Stevens came to the door, and called out

I went into the passage shortly after, and saw Mrs. Stevens, the prisoner was coming along the passage from the stairs - she and Mary laid hold of him. I got behind them, to prevent his getting out of the street-door - I collared him, and told him to come into the tap-room if he had done nothing amiss - he said he would not. I told him if he was the d-v-l he should come in. I pulled him in, and sent out to Mrs. Stevens, to go up and see if she had lost any thing. While they were gone up stairs he tried to make his escape. I threw him down by the fire-place; he then said,</p>
               <p>"Don't ill use me." I told him if he offered to move again I would knock his brains out. I then sat down by him, and took hold of his right-hand coat pocket, in which I found the crow-bar. Mrs. Stevens came in, and said she was robbed. I then searched him, and found a dark lanthorn in his left-hand coat-pocket, and took ten skeleton keys and a crow-bar out of his right-hand coat pocket. We afterwards took him into the bar, stripped him, and found another skeleton and a picklock key, with a phosphorus bottle and matches. Jeffries came in, handcuffed him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 19th of January, about half-past ten o'clock, I was at the corner of Gardiner's-lane, York-street, Westminster, where I live - I was going home. I went into the Blue Anchor public-house, about eight o'clock, and had a pint of beer; the two prisoners and another came in, and sat by my side - while they sat by me, I thought once or twice that they were trying to pick my pocket - they could not do it; as soon as my wife called for me I went home with her - the two prisoners and the other followed me. Armfield was on one side, and Frost was behind with M'Bride, who is not in custody. Armfield got hold of my arm, and said he wanted to see me home; my wife told him to let me alone; I had been drinking, but was perfectly sensible.

Just as we got to the gateway, and turned the corner, the three men surrounded him; he said he was robbed - it did not last a minute; they immediately went up York-street as fast as they could go. We returned to the public-house, and told them he was robbed, then went to a public-house at the corner of Queen-square, where the officers are, and gave information.

I saw Armfield try two or three times to rob Burt in the house. Next morning I saw Frost go into a house; I went and told Burt, and he went and took him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of January Frost was given into my charge, by a man named Green. In consequence of what he said, I went to the Crown, in Pye-street, where I expected to find Armfield and M'Bride together. Before I had got within fifty yards of the house, an acquaintance of Armfield's saw me, and ran immediately into the house, so that when I got there I could find neither. I went several times to Armfield's lodgings, but could not find him - he was afterwards taken to Bow-street, and given into my charge.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged with me - he slept with my sons. On the 2d of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, he came home, and went up stairs; he came down soon after, and asked for alight, as he said he had a job to do, and was going to light the fire - he went up again. I heard the window open soon after, and the street-door shut; he came in again and went up stairs, came down again about six o'clock, and went out with a bundle. I went up stairs, saw there was no fire, but found my sons' boxes open, and the property gone. I got a constable, and found him smoking his pipe, about seven o'clock, in White Lion-street, Oxford-street; he had my son's coat, waistcoat, trowsers, and neck-handkerchief on - he was wearing them; I also found my son's seal, chain, and 1 l. 15 s. 6 d. on him. He said the money was my son's, and he took it out of the box. He afterwards told me he had pledged some of the things at Turner's.</p>

On the 22d of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my own front parlour, which is used as a shop. The house was let out in lodgings; the landlord lives in a separate house. I heard a window break; turned round immediately and saw the prisoner draw the wire out on which the watches were suspended, with both hands, it was fastened by a screw about six inches from the window; the screw was completely torn out; the other end remained fast; part of the wire was completely out in the street. I got up immediately he attempted to take the watches off the wire. I put my left hand through the window, and saved some of them. The prisoner, after standing about two minutes before the window, left it. My wife ran to the street-door, hearing the window break. She could not get out; it was fastened outside by a piece of string. The prisoner left the window. I went to the door, and found it was fastened outside, but by pulling very hard I opened it. The prisoner ran across the road; I saw no more of him that night. I ran across up Blue Anchor-yard, but could see nothing of him. I returned, and found my wife had picked up two watches and a watchcase from under the window. I immediately went to Queen-square Police Office, gave information, and returned home. I found I had lost a small gold watch, and an old silver one; the outside case of the silver one was found in the street. I went out with the officers, but could not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing him - A. Yes; there was a candle close to the wire; I am certain he is the man. There were two candles and a gas-light opposite. I am certain he is the man. The next morning as I was sitting at work, the prisoner passed by with another man. I said there is the man who robbed me. I went out and followed him for two hours and a half to different places. I was afraid he would get away if I attempted to take him. I got a neighbour to assist me, and we secured him, and took him to Queen-square. I have never found the watches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. I live and sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe the man to the officers - A. Yes; to Gillmore and another man. He was dressed in a blue coat, with gilt buttons; he had white stockings on and breeches. Next morning he was dressed in the same, except having trowsers on. He was taken at the end of York-street and James-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come off a hackney coach - A. No.</p>

            Has he any thing remarkable about his legs - A. He wore trowsers, because both his legs are bandy - I never knew him wear any thing else. He generally wore laced shoes. In January I met with an accident, and employed the prisoner to assist me. He went with me, to get up and down off the box, as I could not - he rode behind. He first began to work for me on Wednesday night, the 20th of January - he was out with me on Wednesday and Thursday nights; he left me about six o'clock on Friday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170036"/>morning, and had been with me both nights.

               <p>Q. Then you stay out twelve hours - A. Yes, and sometimes fifteen. I generally come home about nine o'clock. My brother has two pair of plates and three coaches - he only works two in the day, and the other at night.</p>
               <p>Q. If you go out regularly the other must come home regularly, or you cannot get the plates - A. We do not go out till the other comes home; sometimes sooner, sometimes later, and sometimes not at all; then I stop at home.</p>
               <p>Q. If that is the case, how can you say he was with you on the 20th - A. He was with me; I recollect it by his being taken up. I attended before the justice, but was not examined, they would not let me speak. He was not with me on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of his being tried - A. No, I never heard that he was tried last June - I am certain of it.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. My father lives in Duck-lane, Westminster, near Stretton-ground; my brother lived with my father ever since he was born; he always sleeps there when he is at home. He was taken up on Saturday, the 23d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he been the night before - A. In bed; he had been out with Haydon on the Wednesday and Thursday nights, he came home about six o'clock on Friday morning; I was a-bed at the time, he came up into my mother's room, my mother struck a light and gave it to him - I sleep with her; he lit the fire, and then went to bed in the one pair back-room, which joins ours - his brother John was in bed at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner get up again - A. He never rose till about eight o'clock that night; I then went up to awake him for me to make the bed, that my father and brother John might go to bed - they sleep in the same bed - the prisoner was then a-bed, I called him twice before I awoke him - he merely got out of bed, but put no clothes on; my sister Emma assisted me in making the bed - he got in again. I took him up some tea and bread and butter afterwards - he was then in bed; I did not go to bed until between one and two o'clock on Saturday morning - I did not see him after I took him the tea; I am certain he did not go out that night. I got up at eight o'clock in the morning, he was then up and dressed, at breakfast with my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the key left in the street-door - A. Yes; nobody could go out without my hearing them, it is impossible. The room where I work is on the ground-floor, under the room he sleeps in; the foot of the stairs come to the room door, which is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother has a defect in his legs - A. Yes. Ever since he left the Blue-coat School, he has constantly worn long trowsers, with high shoes or half-boots - he never in his life wore breeches and white stockings; he did wear a blue coat with gilt buttons. He was in bed at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the matter with his legs - A. He was rather bow-legged, they are getting much better than they were. He was brought up to the brush-making business, he has latterly been a hackney-coachman, and drove for Mr. Morris. He very seldom drove a night-coach.</p>
               <p>Q. He came home at six o'clock in the morning - A. Yes, and laid till six the next morning. He had nothing to eat but a little tea and bread and butter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever lay in bed so long at any other time - A. Not so much. He was not well; he was over-fatigued, and felt himself very poorly next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of any thing happening at any time - A. Yes, there was something in this Court - he was indicted for house-breaking, and had eleven persons to prove he was as innocent of that as he is of this.</p>
               <p>Q. All his friends, and Haydon, knew he was charged with the offence before - A. Yes; he had twenty-two witnesses - eleven were to prove facts, but not one of them was asked a question.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father, and am hostler to Mr. Morris. On the 20th and 21st of January, the prisoner was out with Haydon and his coach; he came home on Tuesday morning about six o'clock - I let him in, as I was going out to my employ - he sleeps in the same bed with me and John; he was lighting the fire as I went out; he went to bed before he had any breakfast as he was tired. I came home about half-past seven o'clock that evening, he was then in bed. I usually go to bed about eight o'clock, or half-past eight, I went to bed to him about five minutes after eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had anybody been to make the bed before that - A. My eldest and youngest daughter, they also took him up some tea; he had been a-bed all day. I remained in bed with him until six o'clock in the morning - he was never out of bed. I am troubled with a complaint, and do not rest half the night - I went to work, and after dinner heard he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the magistrate to tell what you knew - A. No, I did not hear of it until after the first examination; I went to the second examination, but was not allowed to speak. My son always wore loose pantaloons down to his ankles, and high shoes - his legs are rather crooked.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the matter with his legs - A. He is rather weak-ankled and bow-legged.</p>

               <p>Q. You swear he laid in bed from between six and seven o'clock in the morning till six o'clock the next morning, without taking a morsel of any thing, except a little tea and bread and butter - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. He lived at home. He came home on the 22d of January, which was Friday morning - I did not see him before he went to bed. He was at home and in bed all day on Friday. My husband came home about eight o'clock at night, Emma went up to make the bed - some tea was sent up to the prisoner. My husband went to bed about half-past eight o'clock; the prisoner was then at home and in bed. I went up to bed about eleven, and saw him still in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. He was at home from the time he came home on Friday morning until Saturday morning - A. That I swear. I work at a mangle, in a room close to the street-door; the room-door is never shut, it is fastened back - I can see everybody that passes in the passage. He could not go out without my knowing it. He usually wore a blue coat, trowsers, and high shoes, which lace up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was you not uneasy that he should be in bed so long without any refreshment, and after being out all night - A. I have a large family; my time is occupied with my work. He has often been in bed all day. He was tried here before, and all my family were witnesses then, except myself, but none were examined, except to character.</p>

            . I am servant to John Davis, and live next door to the prosecutrix. On the 28th of January, about five o'clock in the evening, as I went into the shop I saw the prisoner go out of it. I saw her put a bundle on the counter, I found the property in it - she said she was going to take them to be washed, had forgot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170038"/>something, and left them while she went back. She came in again, I detained her, and sent for Mrs. Jewell.</p>

On the 29th of January I missed a piece of French cambric - I accused Elliott of robbing me, which he denied for a considerable time, but afterwards said he had stolen that and several other articles, of which he gave me an account - he said he had delivered them over to Osband. I went with an officer to the house of one Mackintosh, in Sun-court, which is by the side of my house, and took Osband there. I charged him with receiving the goods from my servants - he denied it for sometime, then said he had done it, and took me and the officer to his lodgings, three or four doors off, and in his box we found the articles stated in the indictment - I knew them all to be my property. I never saw Osband in the house. I dare say the things were taken at different times.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite Mr. Fairey. On the 27th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, I saw the prisoner, Gray, take the knives out of a paper, and put them into Sweeney's apron - he held them while Gray went for more. He returned in two or three minutes, took more out of a paper, put them into Sweeney's apron, and went over a third time for more - I did not see where they got them from. My house is about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's. Gray returned in about two minutes with more - they then saw me looking at them, and removed themselves from there into Prince's-square. I looked out at my door, and saw Sweeney come up the court again - he thought I was watching them, put the knives under his jacket, and then went round the other way. Thinking they came out of the pawnbroker's shop, I went in, and asked him if he had lost any such things? he said No. The prisoners left the court, and I saw no more of them. I am sure they are the boys; nobody else was with them. They threw the papers away - Fairey picked up one. Next morning Gray was brought to me; I was asked if he was one of them? I am certain he is.</p>

I was sent for, and found it in the possession of the prisoner in Queen Ann-street; he said it was his, and that he bought it in Smithfield for 10 s. It had fresh wheels on it, also a fresh bottom and sides. I asked him to go with me to Mr. Bolton's, who had repaired it for me - he went willingly with me. I let him go as the constable was not at home, and found him at home about two hours after, at his mother's, where he lived.</p>

On the 20th of January, I went to bed about twelve o'clock at night; I was called up by the watchman, found the cellar doors open, and a trap-door, which leads from my shop to the cellar, also open - nothing was broken. It was all safe when I went to bed. We went into the cellar, found the brandy, rum, and gin casks all left running - they were thirty gallon casks; there was a gallon bottle under the rum cask. I suppose about six gallons of rum, five of brandy, and seven or eight of gin were gone. There are also cocks leading from these casks into the bar - these were also left running; a stone bottle, full of rum, was left on the cellar steps, which was not there when I went to bed; they all hung up empty the night before. One bottle full of gin stood on the window, and another half full, was on the floor - my name is on all my bottles. I missed 4 s. in copper, 1 s. 6 d. in silver, and a metal watch, out of the till.</p>
               <p>Q. How could they get into the cellar - A. I cannot think how, unless they concealed themselves under a bow-window in the cellar the night before, which they could easily do without my seeing them - they could then open the doors inside. About seven o'clock that morning I found the three prisoners at St. Giles's watch-house - my watch, and two bottles were produced to me, one contained rum, and the other gin. I know they were in the house the night before.</p>

On Monday the 15th of February, the prisoner called on me; he said he had seen my mare, that he liked her, and wished to have two day's trial; the price, 55 guineas, was mentioned to him, he said that was rather high. I told him two day's trial was out of the question; I had not known him before, He asked what trial I would allow, I said I was going to ride out myself on another horse, and if he would accompany me he was welcome to any fair trial. We rode out together, and first went to Tattersall's, as he wished to meet a friend there, whom he wanted to see her. He went into Tattersall's, gave a person the mare to hold, returned in about five minutes, and stated that his friend had been there, but was gone. We then rode into Hyde Park, he said he wished a friend of his in Gloucester-place to see her; I offered to accompany him, he observed that it was very late, he would not detain me, and he would either bring the mare back himself, or send her by his servant. It was about four o'clock. I said I wished him to bring her back himself, as his servant might over-ride her. He brought her home that evening, I saw him, and he observed to me, that he had been disappointed in not finding his friend in Gloucester-place at home; that he wished his friend to see her before he bought her, and asked if I would send her up to Parliament-street for his friend to see. He had given me his card the same day, it was</p>
               <p>"J. Doran, 28, Parliament-street." I said his friend had better come and see her in my stable. He said he could not come there. I at last agreed to send her to No. 28, Parliament-street, to Mr. Young's. He asked what was the lowest price I would take? I said 50 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever intend to part with it without the money - A. Never, it was understood to be for ready money. I did not tell him so, but he was a stranger to me. Next day I sent the mare by

               <p>Q. When was the mare to be returned to you - A. It was understood that he was not to keep her out all night. I told the groom to knock at the door, and ask if Mr. Doran lived there? and to say, if he liked to ride her he might. It was a little before three o'clock when he took her. I have never seen her since, nor have I been paid for her. My bridle and saddle were on the mare. The prisoner was apprehended on the Thursday, about twelve o'clock, and a little before four o'clock on that day the bridle and saddle were returned to me - I did not intend to sell the bridle and saddle. Before he was apprehended I went to No. 28, Parliament-street, and found he did not live there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. On Monday, at four o'clock, he took her to go to his friend - A. Yes; he returned her a little after five o'clock. I never intended to sell either the bridle or saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. If the groom had brought you back the money for the mare, you would have been satisfied with that - A. I should have put it in my pocket certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Your servant had no authority to sell it, nor had you sold it yourself - A. No, certainly I did not mean to trust him, as I did not know him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHURCHMAN. I am groom to the prosecutor's brother. On Tuesday, the 16th of February, I took the mare to Mr. Young's, No. 28, Parliament-street; the clerk came out, and said the prisoner was not there, but would return there in a few minutes. I walked the mare up and down, and in a few minutes the prisoner came to me from towards Westminster Abbey; I told him he might make a trial of the mare if he liked, and show it to his friend in Gloucester-place. I said nothing more to him. He got on the mare, and said he would take care to return it by half-past four o'clock in the afternoon - she was not returned; I have never seen her since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Tell us exactly the words that passed - A. I said my master said he might take her to his friend in Gloucester-place. He said he would either return the mare at half-past four o'clock, or a note to say that he would keep her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he not permission from you to have letters and messages addressed to your house - A. It was only letters from a Mr. Sard that were addressed to my house, not messages. He occasionally called to see if there was any letter.</p>

On the 20th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in High-street, Shadwell, with the jacket under his arm; knowing him before, I asked him where he got it? he said his shipmate gave it to him at Limehouse, to take on board a ship at the London Docks. I asked him if there was any thing in the pockets? he said No. I found a tobacco-box there - Harper claimed it.</p>

I was on Tower-hill, about six o'clock, and saw a scuffle there; I found the prisoner, Wilson, in custody of an officer, making a great resistance - the mob wanted to rescue him; Skinner was in custody of another officer. When Wilson saw me, he said he knew me, and would go quietly with me - Skinner had the beef tied up in his great coat; Wilson said he was going to take it to his father - I locked them up; the prosecutor claimed it. While they were in the watch-house they changed jackets - Wilson claimed that the beef was tied in, and said that a gentleman gave him a few halfpence to carry it.</p>

On Saturday, the 9th of January, the house was secured at eleven o'clock, when I went to bed - I sleep in the house. I did not discover that the house had been robbed until Monday morning, when I went down with Mr. Evans, and found one of the rails over his warehouse door had been cut, by which means a person could unbolt the door, and get over the top-door into the warehouse; it must have been broken open on the Saturday night, because the front-door was not opened at all on the Sunday. I came home about half-past five o'clock on the Saturday evening, and saw a man standing in the passage - it was dark; I asked him what he wanted? he said he wanted to see Mr. Evans; I went up stairs and left him. I went out again about six o'clock - there was nobody in the passage then; the street-door was put to, but not shut.</p>

            . I deal in Welch flannels, and occupy a warehouse in Stone's house. On Saturday, about five o'clock I left my warehouse in the care of my brother William - every thing was then safe. I returned on Monday morning, and missed two pieces of flannel, containing about 146 yards each - it was worth 40 l. I found a piece at Mr. Purse's, London-wall that night. On the 19th of January I saw the prisoner in Aldersgate-street; I laid hold of him, and said he was the man who had robbed my warehouse - he denied it. I gave him in charge of Taylor, who took him to the Compter; 13 s. 6 d., and three knives were found on him - one was a very strong knife. The prisoner had been to me on the 7th of January, and brought an order for some flannels - I gave him 6 s. as a reward.

            . I am a watchman of St. John's, Clerkenwell. On the 30th of January, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Knight, passed me at the end of Parson's-alley, St. John's-lane, close against St. John's-gate, with a flat of butter; he put it down by the side of the Jerusalem tavern, St. John's-gate - I said there was nobody up; he asked me what time I thought they would be up? I said about half-past six o'clock, and asked him if it was for Mrs. Walters, who keeps the house? he said,</p>
               <p>"No, I am going to leave it here for a man who used to be in your box." I asked him if the man's name was Woolley? he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have brought it for him, but I don't know what to do with it as he is not here, and I want to go back to Holloway with my waggon, but will you take care of it till he comes, or the woman of the public-house gets up?" He left it with me. As soon as the public-house was open I put it in there, and said it belonged to Woolley. When I went to the watch-house I saw Woolley there, and told him - I went over to the public-house with him. He put his foot on it, and said it was all right, and he knew where to take it to. I left him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Knight said he brought it from the country - A. Yes. Poor people often have butter from the country to sell in town.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. I was informed the butter was lost, and apprehended Knight. He denied it several times - at last he said,</p>
               <p>"I own I had lump of it, and sold it to an old woman." I said he must tell where the other was. He said</p>
               <p>"There was another man in company with me; he took it out of the waggon, and sat it down by the Bull public-house door, and I took it away from the door to a watchman." I asked him where the watchman's box was? he said,</p>
               <p>"He used to stand in the box at the corner of Parson's-alley, but now he stands in St. John-street." He said he had seen him in the morning, as he came down with the waggon, and he asked him if he had got anything for him? I desired him to go with me. I went to Woolley's house about seven o'clock that evening, and found him at home. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am come to know about that flat of butter which you had last Saturday morning." He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, the flat of butter, do you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you done with it? he said,</p>

               <p>"No, I did not sell it, the waggoner did;" and after that he said he had sold it. I asked him where? he took me to Aylesbury-street, where I found the flat - he had sold six lumps there.</p>

            . I live in Aylesbury-street. I know the prisoner, Woolley; he called and asked me if I wanted half a dozen lumps of butter; having known him for sometime, I bought them of him for 15 s., that was 15 d. per pound - it was fresh butter. He brought it in the flat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said he had it from a waggoner, and was to have it every week. I used to employ him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is he - A. He does any thing to earn sixpence - he had no employ that I know of - he was in distress. The market price was 15 1/2 d.</p>

               <p>WOOLLEY'S Defence. About five o'clock in the morning Knight passed me in St. John-street, and asked me if I knew anybody who dealt in butter? I said, yes, if he had got it honestly.

I got near the centre, in front of the hustings, and was hustled; a party rushed on both sides - one arm was held up, and the other quite close to me - the two prisoners were near me. As soon as I could get my hand down, I found my watch was gone; I got out of the mob, and found my pocket-book was also gone - both my great, and under coat were cut through to the pocket. It was a gold watch, and cost me eighty guineas; I had a 10 l. a 5 l., and a 1 l. note in my pocket-book - I have never recovered it. While I was examining my coat Mason came up, and with his assistance Alexander was immediately apprehended, and taken to Bow-street - my right arm was held up. I felt no particular pressure till the prisoners came up.</p>

I saw Alexander put his hand into his Lordship's pocket; I watched them for ten minutes, and then saw one of them put his hand into the other gentleman's pocket, who was with his Lordship - there was nothing in his pocket. The gentleman turned round, and laughed at them; I heard Alexander say to Phillips,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you make haste." I am sure they were in company; Phillips had been feeling me just before his Lordship came into the crowd. I followed his Lordship out of the crowd, saw him examining his pockets, and told him. I got King and Shaw, the officers, and took Alexander - Phillips escaped, Next day I went into the crowd, with the officers, and took Phillips there; he was then with two or three others, hustling people - a very small knife was found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not not know when the robbery was committed. His Lordship might have passed several thieves in the crowd.</p>

I I collared him, and took him to the door of Mr. North's shop, one of the shopmen opened the door; I took him in, and charged him with stealing the seal, which he positively denied. He said he was the son of a gentlewoman, living in Coleman-street. I desired him to deliver up the seal; he said he was not the person, who took it. A lady came into the shop, and said, in his presence, that she saw him cut it off. He said she must be mistaken, for he had not got it - it was afterwards found by Mr. North's door, in the area, where I first detained him - a knife was also found in the door-way, where he was detained - my seal and key were cut from the ribbon.</p>

            . I am a marshalmen. On the 6th of February, about six in the evening, I saw the prisoner in Whitecross-street, with the firkin of butter on his shoulder. I followed him through several courts into Golden-lane. A person was following him, which increased my suspicion; that person seeing me made off. I stopped the prisoner in Golden-lane, and asked him what he had got; I asked him if he had any bill of parcels; he said he had no bill, but a man got him to carry it, and he brought it from a man at a public-house door in Petticoat-lane, and he was to give him 1 s. for his trouble; the man's name was Davis, and he was to take it to Mr. Elliston, Bull-alley, Golden-lane. I took him there, but could find no such person. I advertised the butter; and found the owner.</p>

He had four sheets, and an apron; I asked him where he got them? he said they were his own, and that he lived at No. 17, Craven-street. I asked him if he kept the house? he said No. He then said he had a sister, who lived servant there, and he had been concealed in the night-house all Saturday and Sunday, when he went into the back-room, and took the things - I went to the prosecutrix, and she claimed them.</p>

On the 4th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I went into the area, and found one part of the pipe separated from the other, but not taken away - it was bending over the rails in the front area. I went into the dining-room to watch, and in about three minutes I saw a short man by the rails, apparently watching, he beckoned to the prisoner, who came on the steps of the next house, stood on the scraper, which would enable him to reach the pipe; I spoke to him, he jumped off the steps, and ran off - I followed, and secured him in Charlotte-street. I never lost sight of him. The pipe was separated from the house.</p>

I looked round, and saw one of the prisoners, I do not know which, reaching his hand to a person behind him - I saw my handkerchief on the ground which the other person was picking up. I seized the person which was nearest to me, and took the other as he passed me, with my handkerchief - they were the prisoners - they were close to each other. I gave them in charge. Nobody was near enough to take it but them.</p>

She said her husband was out of the way for debt, and she had 50 l. a year from the East India House. On the 16th of January, I found she had robbed her lodgings - she said she had been out a little way to pledge her bed-tick; that her 50 l. would be due next day, and she would pay me all - I had lent her 9 s. She went out again; I thought she was gone for good. I saw some feathers on my oil-cloth. I went up stairs, and found a candle on the landing-place, stuck in a bottle. I went out, and met her - I said I was ruined. She brought me back - I sent for an officer, who took her. I went up to the room, missed the bed, and every thing except the mattress and bedstead; she had taken the articles stated in the indictment. She said she had sold the feathers to Myers. I am a widow, with two children. She came to me by the name of Parsons - her real name is Wall.</p>

On the 23d of January a boy ordered a shoulder of mutton, to be sent to Mr. Spicer's, No. 7, Charlotte-street. I sent my son with it - he returned for change for a 1 l. note, which I gave him. He returned with the mutton, but not the money.</p>

            . I went with the meat. I met the prisoner - he asked me if I was going to No. 7, and said the mutton would do, and I must get change for a 1 l. note, and get the bone broken. I returned, and met him again - he took the change. When I got to the house I found no mutton had been ordered. It was a dark night, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Smith. About eight o'clock Dawson alarmed me. I immediately unlocked the gate, and heard a truck go out of the gateway - I followed, and overtook it in Holywell-lane, with the mahogany on it; three men were with it. I took one, the others ran away. He said the other two men employed him to drag it - it was Bryant; I do not know the other two.</p>

               <p>"You scoundrel take your hand out." I was then hustled ten times more than before - they pressed against me with their elbows, and I was almost choaked; one of them took my hat off. I was then quite of my feet, and felt a hand working my watch about - I had twisted it round, so that they could not get it out; both my pockets were turned inside-out.</p>

            . I am a piano-forte-maker. I was at the hustings; the gang were round the prosecutor; he said he was robbed. I saw his pockets turned inside-out - he was pulled about a great deal; he pointed the prisoner out. I secured him, and took him to Bow-street; he was searched - he had three handkerchiefs round his neck - one of them had a 1 l. note in it; two snuffboxes, and a cotton handkerchief were found on him - the gang tried to rescue him.</p>

            . I am a weaver in the employ of Cook and Co. In December last I went to the warehouse for work, the prisoner gave me about a pound and a half of puce silk to get warped, and make into velvet; he told me if I could get it done that day in time, to bring it to the warehouse, if not, to bring it to his house. I could not get it done; I took part of it to his house. I went to Mile End that evening, it was weighed to me; I took it away again. On Monday I took the rest to him at the warehouse - he weighed it, and I took it back, he told me to make it into velvet - this was about five weeks before Christmas. He came, and told me to bring it to his house when it was finished, if I could not get it done before Christmas, as he did not wish it to be entered to the year's account. He said he did not wish Mr. Warren or Mr. Cook to see it. I took it to his house after Christmas - he was not at home - he paid me for it at the warehouse. I took the bobbins to the warehouse. My wife afterwards told this to a man named Gredus.</p>

             re-examined. Mr. Warren told the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170055"/>about five weeks before Christmas, not to have any more velvet made. On the 12th of February Gredus gave me information, I sent for the prisoner, and charged him with having made away with this piece of goods; he hung down his head, and said nothing for sometime; I said he had better tell all about it, for there was the man who had made it. He then said he had made away with it, that it was his first offence, that he would ask our pardon, and pay double the price for it, if we would forgive him; I said I could hear nothing of the kind. He said he had sold it in Petticoat-lane, and he thought he could take us to the house - he afterwards said he could not. I sent for a constable - he went down stairs twice to make his escape - I went after him, called out Stop thief! and he was stopped in Bow Church-yard. When he delivered out silk, he ought to enter it in a book, and what was made of it when it returned - there was no entry whatever of it.</p>

             WARREN. I am one of the firm. About the middle of November, Newbon finished a quantity of velvet; I then observed to the prisoner that we should have no occasion for any more. I saw some ends of silk, which Newbon produced - they exactly corresponded with the silk. I examined the account, and found a deficiency of 1 1/2 lbs of puce silk. There is no entry of money paid to Newbon for the silk.</p>

            . I am a silver plater, and live in Waterloo-street, St. Luke's. I was a silk manufacturer. About the middle of November I delivered the prisoner one pound six ounces of puce silk to warp, and about one pound two ounces undyed, to make into a piece of puce velvet. He returned it to me, manufactured, about the beginning of January. I am certain nobody can swear to the shade of silk after it is manufactured. I have brought a sample of what I gave him - I think it agrees with the ends of the silk produced.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When did you leave off being a silk manufacturer - A. About two years ago. I have had this silk ever since - I then lived at Macclesfield. I became acquainted with the prisoner at the Dog, public-house, in Widegate-alley. I gave him the silk at a public-house in Old Bethlem.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the prisoner send for you - A. Last Monday - a friend of his lit on me at the Dog. I exchanged the velvet for some silver with a stranger. I wanted to sell the silver - I said I had a piece of velvet, and would swap with him. There were twenty-eight yards of velvet I got it at the rate of 15 s. 6 d. each yard. I do not know the quantity of plate.</p>

He got up with a knife which he had in his hand, eating some bread and meat, and stabbed me in the left side of my head, close to my eye; it penetrated to the bone. I was so weak I was not able to do any thing for myself. I said nothing more to him than that which I have stated. As soon as he stabbed me he put the knife into his left hand, and then struck me with his fist. He got me down on the floor, and began beating me.

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Brown's-buildings. I went to the public-house about six o'clock. The prosecutor had been drinking, but was sensible. He asked if Mackenzie was there? - he was not then come. He went out about three minutes. Before he returned the prisoner came in. The prosecutor came in, went to him, and said,</p>

               <p>"We have quarrelled - you are a Scotchman, and I am an Irishman, let us have a pot of beer, and make it up." The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"No, I'll never drink with such an Irish rascal as you are - go away!" he did not go then. He rose from his seat with a knife in his hand, and stabbed him in the side of his head. The prosecutor said he was stabbed. I told the prisoner to put the knife out of his hand, or he would commit murder. He put it into his left hand, and then struck him on the left breast with his fist. He fell - the blood ran rapidly. I went for the landlord, he was not in the bar. I returned, and found the prisoner beating the prosecutor more like a savage than any thing else - he could not see for the blood. I seized the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"For shame, countryman! for using the man so." He said he was sorry he had not ripped his g - ts out, and that if he had had a pistol he would have shot him. I washed the prosecutor as well as I could. The prisoner went out of the tap-room.</p>

               <p>"You rascal, are you taking his part? I will serve you as I will him." He was quite drunk - he struck Leonard twice; he then went out, and while he was absent the prisoner came in.

            . I am the wife of Israel Ottolanglie. On the 24th of January, the prisoner came into our service - next day I missed this property. When she went to bed she dropped two duplicates, I picked them up, and found they related to my property; next morning I gave her in charge. She said she took them, but she was rather tipsey.</p>

On the 1st of February, I missed a parcel of wool-cards; I went to Giles, and asked him to go to Smithfield with me, to ask the prisoner if he had taken any away or not.

               <p>"Are you sure of that." He said</p>
               <p>"I am sure I have no cards, belonging to any one." Giles then said,</p>

               <p>"No; me rob Mr. Fairburn - I would sooner loose my last drop of blood, than rob him." He said he was sure he had no cards belonging to me - I remained with him, while Giles went for an officer. Harker, the officer, asked him if he had any? he said No. The officer then asked whose chest is this? he said it was his; the officer told him to open it, to let him see if there was any cards in it; he said he could not, for he had not got the key. Harker pulled out a hand-cuff; and said,</p>
               <p>"If you do not let us look into it, I must take you to the Compter, box and all, and I can get the box open there." Seeing the hand-cuffs, he asked to speak to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have some cards in my box, but I will show you how I got them." He opened a trap-door, and said,</p>
               <p>"I got them out of here last Sunday - Mr. Fell put them here." The trap-door leads to Fell's room. He said he put them into his chest to secure them for me. Harker said he had better open the chest, and let us see them - he said the officer might break it open - the prisoner took the screw-driver, and broke it open himself, and there were seven pair of wool-cards. He was taken to the Compter, and gave 
               <persName id="t18190217-144-person1254">Cameron</persName>

The prisoner, Dodd, sat by his side, with his two hands rummaging about the waistband of Rowe's breeches Lynch was sitting at the end of the table, to prevent the people from seeing what Dodd was about; he was looking at him. As soon as I took notice of Dodd, he jumped up and left the room - Lynch jumped off the table immediately to follow him. I caught hold of him, as he was the last, and said,</p>
               <p>"Stop, my good fellow! you are not gone yet." He turned round quick, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, what do you want with me? The landlord and myself awoke the prosecutor - he found his breeches cut, and missed his watch. Lynch said it was not him who cut off his fob, it was Dodd. Maidment came and took Lynch.</p>

On the 30th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was walking outside my premises, saw my back-door open, and one of my servants come out with a sack of potatoes - the prisoner appeared to be waiting for him; he had a donkey and hampers. He took something out of the hampers, my servant shot the potatoes in, the prisoner covered them with the hay, and my servant went away. The prisoner was going away - I went up, and asked him what was in the hampers? he said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all." I removed the hay and found the potatoes; he said he bought them - I asked him of whom? he then said he supposed somebody had put them in. I took the potatoes from him, and pushed him and my servant away, as I was busy. The prisoner returned, and demanded the hamper - I gave him in charge. I cannot find my servant.</p>

On the 8th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was alarmed, got up, and missed two fowls out of the hen-house in my yard. I saw a man getting over the wall. I went to the street-door to call the watchman. The prisoner stood just below the door, I collared him. He used very improper language, and threw off his great-coat, and in one of his pockets I found one of my fowls just killed. The man who was in the yard got away. I found the other fowl by the shop-door. I knew them to be mine. The prisoner was wearing the coat.</p>

               <p>"Oh G - d!" I came from under the bed, followed him into his own room, which was on the same floor, and said,</p>

I found a purse on his bed, containing a gold watch and three duplicates, he said they were his. The duplicates related to the articles stated in the indictment, which were pledged at Townsend's. I took him to the watch-house. I laid the duplicates on the table then, and missed them all at once, purse, money, and all - he stood by. The purse was afterwards found in the privy. He had no money when he came in; he afterwards spent 2 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I am the prosecutors' servant. About half-past seven o'clock I saw the things safe in the loft - the gates were fastened. About ten o'clock I was sent for, found two trusses of hay gone, and the chaff-box moved away to the gate.</p>
               <p>ELIZA WEEKS. I am the prosecutors' servant. About nine o'clock at night I was going down stairs, and heard a noise like persons attempting the gate. I went into the yard, and saw two men trying to open the large gates to get out with the things - they had got the little gate open, but it would not let the hay out; they were trying to force it out. When they saw me, one ran out, and shut the door; the other had a difficulty to open it, by which means I could see his face, and am certain it was Clements - I had a candle. I ran out, and called Stop thief! he was stopped, and brought back in about two minutes.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 9th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my master's shop, Mr. Sowerby's, in Chiswell-street, and offered to pledge a silver watch, three seals, a gold and a metal key, which were fastened to the watch by a ribbon - he wanted 3 l. 10 s. on them. Upon looking at them I thought two of the seals were the prosecutor's property - he was an intimate friend of my master's - I had often seen them. I asked him how long he had had them? he said he had had them six weeks, and had redeemed them from Barker's, in Shoreditch. This induced me to look more particularly at them, and I was positive they were the prosecutor's seals - I had not heard that he had been robbed - I told him that could not be true; he then said he bought them that morning of a groom, and he knew him and the house he used, that he gave 55 s. for the watch and two seals, and 7 s. for the other seal. I detained him, and got an officer. He said he bought them that morning, before the officer came - he told the officer he bought them of a groom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you sold the prosecutor the seals - A. No. I sold him the key.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought them that morning. At the time of the robbery I was in company until half-past one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>AUZEL BENJAMIN. I sell glass and plated articles, and live in Bedford-court, Catharine-street. On the 8th of February, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner bought a frame of me - it was silver edged, with glasses - I have known him three years. He gave me three guineas for it, and I gave him a receipt - (looks at one) - this is it; I was at tea at the time - his wife came with him. My wife asked them to take tea, and they stopped till very near half-past one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why stop so long - A. The ladies were playing at whist. The prisoner, his wife, Eve, and

             played.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it any particular day in your family - A. I think it was my birth-day, but am not positively sure - he was not out until he went home at half-past one. The watchman was going one, when young Miss Myers got up, and said she was going home - they stopped to have another game. He went out with Miss Myers to see her home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you expect them that day - A. No - he lives at the back of my house, I believe they call it Swan-yard, where he lives - we did not visit - I was never at his house. He has been to me merely to ask me how I did - I did not play at whist myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not keep a shop - A. No; the frame was bought up stairs; nobody was in the room but him and me when he bought it.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote the receipt all at one time, I suppose - A. Yes, with the same pen and ink. I put some water to the ink as I had not enough. I am not certain whether Miss Myers played at whist or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the receipt again, and tell me whether the figures 1819, above the date, were written at the same time, and with the same pen - A. I will swear to it. I dare say I mended my pen to write the figures - I will swear I mended my pen at the latter end. I packed up the cruets - he tied them in his handkerchief up stairs. I never had any dealings with him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then nobody had an opportunity of seeing the cruets, or admiring them - A. Miss Myers saw them. I do not know whether he showed them to her. I was there all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you hear he was taken up on this charge - A. What, for this offence? I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear he was taken up -

               <p>Q. You told your husband of the prisoner being in custody the same day his wife informed you - A.

On the 16th of February, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I and Cook were on duty on Mr. Dancer's premises - two persons came along from the stables; Cook wished them a good night - nobody answered, which excited my suspicion. I followed, and overtook the prisoner with a sack on his head, which contained the beans. He begged hard to be let go, saying it was his first offence.</p>

On the 14th of February, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I had been with some friends, and on leaving them, I went to a coffee-shop, in Wych-street - I was quite sober; the prisoner came in, and sat down. I gave her some coffee, and then went to <placeName id="t18190217-182-crimeloc1060">No. 10, Charles-street</placeName>

I got up between eight and nine o'clock; she was still in the room - I missed my watch - the door was bolted inside; she denied taking it; the landlord and landlady also said they knew nothing about it. On examining I found a hole in the wainscot, over the head of the bed - it communicates with the landlord's bed-room; any thing could be slipped through; there was a matting behind to receive any thing. I put my watch under the pillow safe at night.</p>
