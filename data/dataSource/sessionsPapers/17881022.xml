            , went from the other parlour to the kitchen to fetch some rubbers to rub the furniture; she came up from the kitchen, and said, sir, there is a man getting out of the window; I directly sprung from the sofa, and opened the door.</p>
               <p>How was the door then? - The street-door was fast; I opened it, and pursued, and called stop thief! twice; and I saw the two prisoners run towards Kingsland turnpike, and when I saw them run, I called, fire, fire, says I, with a bold voice; for in the room where they committed the robbery, there is a number of fire-arms; then they turned round back at me; when I called fire, they threw the property from them.</p>
               <p>You said that to intimidate them? - Yes, Collard was the right-hand man; he threw the property away which he had; and Andrews was the left-hand man; he had property, and threw it away likewise; then they crossed each other; the property was taken up by the pursuers; they are here; I think we run near half a mile; I pursued them myself; I called stop thief till they were pursued; we lost Andrews, as we supposed, in a ditch; we over run him; Collard was taken, I suppose, in twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Was he out of your sight? - In the last field that we went over he was out of my sight, I suppose, for seven minutes, or hardly so long; I am certain of him; I knew the man before.</p>
               <p>Did you know Andrews before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was Andrews taken that day? - Not till the day following; I saw him then at the Magpie, Clerkenwell; he was in custody; they had taken him that morning; I knew him again well, by reason, when I called fire, I brought him round three times.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220013"/>Have you so full a knowledge of him, as safely to swear to him? - Yes, I had a full sight of him; this is the implement, that we suppose, they opened the window with; this is the piece of the sash that was broke at the bottom; I suppose, I had been in the parlour ten minutes before; for it was a rainy day; I had been in the garden with the gardener; and I went into the parlour; and seeing the guittar, I played a tune; I observed the windows then, they were down.</p>
               <p>Were they fastened? - Why there is a doubt, whether the window, that they came in at, was fastened or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow objected that the indictment did not charge this witness to be in the room, where he said he was, but it was over-ruled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Season. This screw-driver, which was made use of, as it appears by the sash, to wrench the side sash up; this we found on the road that they went.</p>
               <p>Are you clear the window was down? - It was, but I cannot say for the screw.</p>
               <p>Who took up the property? - The different people that are here; I took up some of them; this cruel was broke before; and when we took Collard, his hand was bloody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Andrews was not found till the next day? - No.</p>
               <p>What distance had the persons got from the house before you came in sight of them? - I suppose ten yards; these are the shoes we picked up in the road; Andrews was without shoes; he runs lane.</p>

               <p>You was present when Andrews was examined the next day? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you examine his stockings? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was it you, or your brother, that had the prosecution here lately, for stealing a spoon out of his house; your brother is a thief-taker, that lives on Clerkenwell-green? - Exactly so; I saw Andrews and my brother the next day.</p>
               <p>Do you remember your brother examining his stockings, to see if they were muddy? - I do not recollect his examining there, but at Justice Blackborrow's I do, and they were not dirty; that is what you wish to know; I see your object, he had a new pair of shoes on which I told him he was wrong in wearing.</p>
               <p>I dare say you was as witty then as you are upon all occasions? - Upon my honor you are very polite.</p>
               <p>I wish to know what you are; you say you are of no trade, business, or profession? - I supplied the army with marquee tents, shirts, shoes, stockings, and sundries, &amp;c. during the war.</p>
               <p>A contractor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your brother perhaps took Andrews? - He did.</p>

               <p>I am a day-labouring man; the prosecutor came through the fields where I was sitting eating my dinner, he was crying, stop thief! I jumped up, and the prisoner Collard came across the fields; I did not know him before, I know him now, he is the same man; I saw nothing found upon him after they look him; I saw nothing thrown away.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When the hue and cry was, they were picked up by different people; I picked up one silver table spoon; I kept my eye upon the prisoner in the pursuit; I do not know the spoon among the rest, these different things were brought in by different people in the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Chapman. While we were in pursuit of the prisoner several people picked up different things, and I picked up these candlesticks; they are two plated candlesticks, they were in some old buildings that was broke down by Mr. Season's, in the lane.</p>
               <p>How far were these old buildings from the path that they took? - It was just by Mr. Season's house.</p>
               <p>What distance? - I do not think above twenty yards.</p>
               <p>What distance was the place where you found the things from the path where they ran? - Not above a yard; these are my master's candlesticks, I have known them above nine months, I have been used to clean them, there is no mark upon them; and this set of glass castors with silver tops and silver stand, and these two table spoons I found in this pocket handkerchief; in the next building adjoining it is some old stables which have been pulled down.</p>
               <p>Did this empty building lay open, so that any thing could be thrown into it? - Yes, the front of the building was wide, and mostly down; it was near the path where the men went, close by; I saw such things as these on the side-board in the parlour; I missed them on giving the alarm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. About what time was this? - As near twelve as could be.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220015"/>How long have you known the defendant Andrews? - For these seven, eight or nine years to the best of my knowledge; on the 26th of September and the 25th, I know where he was; Thursday was the 25th and Friday was the 26th; on Thursday, the 25th of September last, the prisoner Andrews and me went to Waltham statute, or fair; we had not an opportunity of coming back that night, we were obligated to lay there that night; on Friday morning the 26th, we had our breakfast there, and we set off for town from Waltham between eight and nine, I think, to the best of my knowledge, we walked all the way; we breakfasted on the road between Waltham Abbey Church and the Cross, at a private house, where they accommodated people going to the fair; the name of the place was Waltham Abbey.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave that? - I believe it was about half past nine; we came on towards Enfield Wash; we stopped when we came to the other side of Enfield highway; I cannot recollect the sign.</p>
               <p>When did you leave the prisoner Andrews? - After we came out of this house, we stopped and had a pot of beer, and bread and cheese, and smoked a pipe, it was about ten, I think it was just upon ten, and we staid there till near eleven; I came with him over Enfield highway, and about the middle of it I met a friend of mine, and returned, and the prisoner Andrews at the bar, walked on; I did not think of staying, when I returned with this acquaintance, but I did not return to him; I parted company with him about eleven.</p>
               <p>Do you know the other prisoner Collard? - No.</p>
               <p>He was not in company at that time? - No.</p>

               <p>You had no business there? - No, only out of frolick; I never had been to see the fair.</p>
               <p>Did you ever appear before the justice? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When did you first know of his being taken up? - I heard of it on the Saturday, I believe, or Sunday morning, I will not be sure.</p>
               <p>When was the first application made to you to come here, and by whom? - I believe it is four or five days since.</p>

               <p>"Pork chops and veal cutlets, and coffee and tea;" I did not say so to Mr. Dunn; Dunn came out at the time, and asked me what rascal I was, and he told me, if I did not go about my business, he would kick my a - ; and I immediately went on, and he followed me; I turned back and said to him, if you want to kick my a - , you may do that as soon as you please; and he went in doors, and fetched out an old umbrella.</p>
               <p>How came you to turn back? - He was not above five or six steps on from the door, and he asked me if I would not go with the old umbrella; I do not know whereto; I asked him what I was to go with it for; and he said, d - n you, if you don't like that, I will fetch something that shall make you; and he went in again, and fetched out a pistol, and concealed it under his coat, and with no ceremony at all held it up to my head, and fired it at me immediately.</p>
               <p>How near did he clap it to your head? - As near as I can guess, it might be within half a foot, the powder is all lodged in my face.</p>
               <p>Did he point it towards your head? - Yes, close against my head, pretty well, and he said, d - mn you, if you don't like that, you shall have another; I immediately caught him by the collar.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220018"/>What became of the ball? - It hit the wall, because it made a hole, as the prisoner owned himself, it hit the wall; the pistol is in court; the pistol was fired with the cook upright, and the ball glanced; it was not so certain of hitting; I did not know there was a ball in it, till he took my hat off the next morning at the headborough's house, and asked me whether there was not a hole in it; I took him down to the constable.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to think there was a ball in the pistol? - He said, when he loaded it, he knew he had loaded it with ball.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, he knew when he loaded it, three months before, he loaded it with ball, and he did not take it out; if any body took it out, it must be somebody else, not him; he told me he expected me to drop dead at his feet.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before at all? - I have seen him by passing his house every day with my borrow of bread; I never served him with any thing, never exchanged a word with him. I saw the hole in the wall the next day; the justice desired me to look, and there is a hole quite fresh in the middle of the brick, I never measured it; it must be half an inch in.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you stand, and where did he stand? - It rather glanced on the right where he fired, not quite with an upright, where I stood; it hit me on the left side of my face.</p>
               <p>How far were you from the wall? - As far as the wainscot behind you; there was room, for one carriage to pass.</p>
               <p>Where was he? - At his own gate; there might be room for two carriages; the whole was right opposite his gate.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM LEADBEATER sworn.</p>
               <p>I was walking in the King's road, a quarter past ten, on Sunday morning the 21st of September; I saw something written on this Dunn's window, it was</p>
         
               <p>"Pork chops, veal cutlets, tea and coffee;" this young man, the prosecutor, came, and said, what do you read that for, I wonder who will trust him with a pound of pork chops or veal cutlets; the prisoner was coming from the milk-man's to his house; he says, what rascal are you? if you do not go about your business I will kick your a - e; Dunn followed him, and the prisoner turned round, and said, he should not have all the trouble himself, he would meet him; and instead of kicking him, he went into his own house, and brought out an old umbrella; says he, I will take you before your betters, you dog; will not you go with this? says he, why should I? then says Dunn, I will fetch something that shall make you go; he fetched a pistol, and put his hand out, and fired at him directly; I suppose it might be about four feet from him, with his arm; I suppose the pistol might be about a foot and a quarter from his check; he did not present it at him, but only pulled it out, and fired it directly strait at his head, as level as ever it could be; I do not know how it could escape; he said, he loaded it about three months ago, with ball, and he expected to see the man fall dead at his feet.</p>
               <p>But from the manner in which the pistol went off, did you conceive there was a ball in it? - I cannot say that I did; there was no appearance of a ball; I thought the young man was dead, but he rather recovered himself; Dunn said, he would go and fetch another.</p>
               <p>Are you any judge of firing off a gun or a pistol? - I never let one off in my life; I do not know from the report; I had no other reason for thinking so afterwards, but what he said himself; he said, the piece had never been moved; to the best of his knowledge, since he put a ball in it, that was three months ago; I never saw either of the men before to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I stood in my own defence; this man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220019"/>threatened to knock the down, and afterwards rob me of my pistol; he was rescued by another man of the name of Wise, a milk-man; I told him at first, if he did not go about his business, I would take him before a justice of the peace; he swore he would murder me; had he attempted to go away, I should not have fired at him; but he still was as fierce as a bull-dog; therefore I fired a pistol in my own defence; he accosted me.</p>
               <p>Court. But this young man was unarmed? - He offered violence, and bent his fist, and threatened me; I did not know what to do, any further than to fly to my arms; I loaded the pistol myself, to defend my person and property, three months before that, with a ball; and I slept with it constantly. I have been confined in prison four weeks last Sunday, with nothing to lie on but the ground; I have no money, no friends, and no witnesses; I knew a great many gentlemen in town; I think I have done what I had a right to do against any thief or murderer that came to my house; I think every person has a right to guard their own property, and particularly at home against strangers; I told him to go about his business; I threatened to take him before a justice of peace; when I took out the umbrella, which was as much as a bludgeon, he made no defence; when I fetched out the pistol, he never resisted; after I had fired at him, I saw I had not hurt him; I took him by the collar, and one Mr. Wise came and kicked up my heels, and was thrusting his hand into my breeches pocket, where I had a gold locket; I gave charge of the man to the constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Leadbeater. Did Everton the baker offer to strike this man, or offer any violence? - He never offered any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You seem to have been totally insensible of your danger? - Every person has a right to guard their own house.</p>
               <p>Court. You have made a fatal mistake in the law, I am afraid? - Let the law take its course then; there had better be no law if that is the case.</p>

            , with a pistol, loaded with powder and ball; three things are essential to this offence; first, that the shooting should be at the person, with a manifest intention of killing him; next, that the pistol should be loaded; and in the third place, that it should be maliciously done; if it was done with a manifest intention of doing a bodily harm to the person, and without any provocation, sufficient to justify such an act; if a person shoots as another, under circumstances which would make it murder, if the consequences of that shooting was the death of the party, then that shooting at him, with a pistol, loaded, and under such circumstances, will be within this act of parliament, but if the shooting was accompanied with circumstances that if it had produced death, would have reduced the crime to manslaughter; then I am of opinion, that it is not within this act of parliament; and that is the only reasonable construction that can be put on the word maliciously; for if we were to receive any stronger construction of the act than that, this monstrous absurdity would follow, that if would be a capital offence if the man was not killed, when under the same circumstances, it would not be a capital offence if the man was killed; under that direction, in point of law, you will attend to this evidence: the unfortunate man at the bar, seems to have been, down to the present moment, from some cause or another, very much misled, and very insensible to his present situation; and not to have considered that his life was in imminent danger, and to have had recourse to no friends; and he is under a fatal mistake in point of law, in supposing that the misconduct, for such it certainly was, in the prosecutor, who behaved saucily and impudently without cause, would justify the killing him; but there is no degree of compassion to the state of the prisoner, can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220020"/>possibly lead us so far as to give him that indulgence which he has taken in the construction of the law.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have had a very narrow escape of your life, and are considerably indebted to the clemency of the jury for your acquittal; if they had found you guilty, you must have suffered death for it; for the law does not mitigate an offence of this kind upon any provocation less than that which renders self-defence necessary; I hope therefore, you will in future, correct that mistake you seem to have laboured under, and will restrain your passions within the bounds of the law.</p>

               <p>Who lives in the house besides yourself? - Tenants up stairs.</p>
               <p>How do you know none of them were at home? - That I cannot say; I have no acquaintance with the people up stairs; I am but a tenant, no more than they; I had the lower part of the house.</p>
               <p>Whose house is it? - The landlord's; I forget his name I declare; he does not live in the house; it is all let out in different tenements; they have nothing to do with one another.</p>
               <p>What rooms have you? - Only one room; the door was locked, and the window shut.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was shut? - I believe the window was shut; for they did not open the window for two or three days before that, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>What time did you come home? - Between eight and nine, when I found my door locked as usual; I lost the things in the indictment; I went out to sell my goods; I left them in the room; it was a wet morning; I hung the coat on the back of the chair; the handkerchief and the stockings laid loose on the chair; I sent after the prisoner, and found him; I had a suspicion of him, because he did not come near me that evening; I knew him before; he lodged with me in the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220023"/>room; he is a sea-faring lad; I let him lay out of charity, because I thought he was out of bread; he had no key to the room; I never let him have any key; when I came home the window was as usual, shut down again; I suppose he went in at the window, and when he came out, he shut it down again.</p>
               <p>When you went out, was the window shut or open? - It was shut, but I do not know whether it was fast; it was shut; he was taken in Gravel-lane, with my handkerchief, on the 22d of September, and he owned the fact; I was not present when he was taken; the man that took him sent for me to Gravel-lane; I went to the justices; there I found him, and my handkerchief upon him; he owned to the coat.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said, he did take them things.</p>
               <p>What excuse did he make? - I believe, he said, he took them for want, he did say so.</p>
               <p>It was near nine when you went home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was between four and five when you went out? - Yes, I cannot tell when they were taken out, but he said, he took them between six and seven.</p>

             Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>I was robbed on the 26th of March between nine and ten in the evening; I was coming from Barnet to London, two men passed me on a light easy canter; I was in a post chaise; they overtook, and past me just by the seven mile stone on <placeName id="t17881022-19-crimeloc91">Finchley Common</placeName>

               <p>Court. He did not present a pistol when he first came up? - No; then I gave him my watch; driving on, at a small distance on the left hand, I perceived immediately another man on horseback standing by, which I supposed to be the man that rode in company with him; the other man was near the chaise, he was on horseback standing still, seeming to be looking on.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon-light night? - No, I think not, it was not so light for me to ascertain the person; I cannot ascertain the person; I described the prisoner and the other man as to his dress, which I drew out the next day, but not to speak to his face; I gave information the next morning to Bow-street, and had this handbill printed, (handed up to the Court) the hand-bill was taken from my instructions; on and the 4th of October, I had notice that the prisoner was taken; it was on the Saturday; and on Monday the 6th, according to appointment, I went to Sir Sampson's, the prisoner was at the office, at the bar there; I described one man that robbed me, rode a light bay or man horse, with a blue surtout, and buttons of the same colour; and another man of shorter stature, who rode a bay horse, with light coloured clothes and metal buttons, they had both round hats; another man was produced to me of the name of Barret, who was shewn to me as the accomplice of this man, and my watch which was taken from me, at that time was produced, which watch I swore to, it is the same I lost; it is not exactly in the same state, the outside case is gone, and one seal, but the chain and two other seals, and the rest are the same; they correspond exactly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Thornton, you gave the information to Bow-street the very next day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And of course to publish the hand-bill as effectually as they thought necessary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was the 27th of March? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From that time till the 4th of October, you never heard any thing of your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there any advertisement in the newspapers? - I believe not; not as far as I know.</p>

            ; we took him there, and kept him till his master came; on the 3d of October I apprehended the prisoner on Barret's information; I did not know any thing then of Mr. Thornton's robbery: on the same evening, I told Sir Sampson I had taken a watch; and he referred to the book, and found the name, seal, and every thing corresponded; I got the watch from the prisoner; in endeavouring to take him we had a scuffle; he was down, and I told him to get up like a man, and we would not hurt him; we took him by the collar and got him up again; it was near dusk; Macmanus says, Archy, he has a knife; I put my other hand to wrest his right hand away from the knife; some man took the knife out; during the scuffle the prisoner by some means whipped his hand behind him, and I got hold of a chain of a watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the watch in his hand then? - Yes; there was some other person had hold of his hand at the same time, but who he was I do not know; this is the watch I got hold of; it was as it is now, without an outside case; it has been in my possession ever since; I never saw it only during the time I was putting it into my pocket; when Sir Sampson asked him whose watch it was; he said it was his grandfather's; then Sir Sampson asked him how long he had had it, and he said, in March last, that his grandfather had given it to him; we went to the lodging immediately, and on his wife we found this green purse; we watched him out of the house; he acknowledged her as his wife in the publick-house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot pretend to swear to the purse, it was such a purse as that, of that shape; it was a close purse; there is one particular circumstance about the watch, which is, the cap is silver; it was a silver watch, and I had it cased with gold; the seals, two of them, and the chain are mine; I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Barrett was in custody for robbing his master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of a saddle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was charged with many other robberies? - He was.</p>
               <p>When he was under examination, I take it for granted, he was advised to make an ample confession, and become a witness for the crown, to save himself from being hanged? - He was.</p>
               <p>Then he charged the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Barrett appears to have been in a constant course of highway robberies? - Before he was apprehended, for four months back, he had been out of town with his master.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, whenever he was at leisure, he used to go on Finchley-common? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to me one night about the 26th of March, and proposed to me to go out robbing with him; likewise, we went on Finchley-common almost to the far side; and returning back, we heard a post chaise coming; I went on forward, and Softley staid behind me, and robbed the chaise; I was at a little distance before.</p>
               <p>Did you stand still, or go on? - Why, I kept walking on slowly.</p>
               <p>You did not stand still then? - No, I kept walking on very slowly; afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220026"/>the chaise passed me, and he gallopped up to me, and said, he had robbed the post-chaise of so much, but he did not know what he had got; he had got a purse: likewise, when he came home, he looked in the purse and found about twenty-five shillings, what he told me, and some half-pence.</p>
               <p>Any gold? - There was a guinea, some shillings and some half-pence; he did not shew me the purse, not then present, and then he gave me eleven or twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you see the gentleman that was in the chaise? - I saw him pass me.</p>
               <p>Do you know him by sight? - Yes, I think I know him.</p>
               <p>What sort of a light was it? - A lightish night.</p>
               <p>Moon-light? - It was a little; I could see who there was in the carriage.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the carriage? - I could not see hardly who there was in the carriage, but I could see that gentleman very well.</p>
               <p>Did you stop to observe who was in the carriage? - I kept walking on, but looked earnest at the carriage as it came by me; I went very slow, as slow as the horse could walk.</p>
               <p>Could you know the gentleman again at that time of night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of gentleman was it? - He was a fat gentleman.</p>
               <p>What coloured clothes? - I really cannot say what coloured clothes he had on, but I saw his face.</p>
               <p>Do you see the gentleman here any where? - Yes, there he sits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your Lordship recollects he was in Court when Mr. Thornton began to be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner shew you any thing else he had taken from that gentleman? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did he ever? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the purse that the prisoner had? - Yes, I saw it in his hand the same night, but I never had it in my hand.</p>
               <p>What sort of a purse was it? - As near as I can guess, but I will not say for certain; I think it was green.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Barrett, I think you was in Court when the gentleman was examined to-day, when he began? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have seen him since the robbery in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was a very fine bright night? - So fine, that I could observe the person of the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Was there much moon? - It was not a great deal up, but was visible enough for me to see the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the moon that night or not? - I cannot say I saw the moon, but it was quite light enough to see the moon.</p>
               <p>Did you meet the carriage or overtake it? - I overtook it.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was not the 25th? - No, sir, I am sure it was not the 25th.</p>
               <p>Nor the 27th? - No, I am sure it was either the 26th or the 27th; I am sure the robbery was done, but I did not take down the time.</p>
               <p>That was the first robbery that you and he did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not say at Bow-street, that it was either the latter end of March, or the beginning of April? - Me! sir.</p>
               <p>Aye, me, sir; will you swear that positively? - I swear positively as to the time, I knew the time very well that the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrate at Bow-street, it was either the latter end of March or the beginning of April? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long did you live with Mr. Hartley? - I lived with him, I believe, about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>You was his coachman, and you had a helper under you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These were your master's saddle horses, which you used on Finchley-common? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember robbing me on Finchley-common? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>In a chaise and four? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear whether I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220027"/>the person you robbed in the chaise and four? - No, sir, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the persons that were in the two chaises that you robbed one night? - There was a man and woman in the first, and in five minutes after we robbed another, with another man and woman.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole how many robberies might you have committed? - Four or five, I have quite dropt it.</p>
               <p>And have taken only to steal your master's saddles? - The saddles went out of the stable, while I was in the country.</p>
               <p>But you was accused of stealing them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have turned an honest man all at once? - The first time I ever did any thing was going out with Softley.</p>
               <p>What Jew did you sell your watches to? - I cannot say who he is, but I did sell a watch for two guineas and a half, I took it from a gentleman upon Finchley-common.</p>
               <p>How many months were you in this business? - About four months; I never robbed any where else.</p>
               <p>Did you make any confession of this till you was taken up, till they told you, you would be hanged? - They did not tell me that I should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that now? - Why, yes, they might say so.</p>
               <p>Had you said a word about this, or charged Softly with this till after that? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. How were you dressed the night you committed this particular robbery? - I had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>A dark or light one? - A lightish one.</p>
               <p>What horse did you ride? - A roan horse.</p>
               <p>What sort of horse did the prisoner ride that night? - It was a bay mare.</p>
               <p>A light bay or dark? - A lightish bay.</p>
               <p>Was yours a darkish roan, or light? - A dark roan.</p>
               <p>Had you buttons the same as your coat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A round hat, or a cocked hat? - A round hat.</p>
               <p>How was Softly dressed that night? - In a blue coat.</p>
               <p>What sort of buttons? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Had he a round hat or a cocked hat? - A round hat.</p>
               <p>What arms had you? - A brace of pistols.</p>
               <p>Who carried the pistols? - He had one, and I had the other.</p>
               <p>You are sure you did not stop at all? - No, I did not stop, I kept walking on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He heard that part of Mr. Thornton's examination.</p>
               <p>Barrett. The chaise was coming on: he called to me, says he, stop a bit; I went forward, he stopt behind, and robbed the chaise; we drew out of the road, and let the chaise pass us; then we overtook the chaise again, I went before, and he stopt.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner stop or turn back again? - He turned his mare round.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had either of you a grey horse? - I had a roan horse, but he gets rather lighter as he changes his coat.</p>
               <p>You called him a grey horse before the magistrate? - He is betwixt the two.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner with you in all the robberies you committed, Mr. Barrett? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>You went by yourself sometimes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you always ride the same horses? - No, I rode the bay mare; that was the bay mare; I had had a horse in Tottenham-court-road, that was rather a darkish bay.</p>
               <p>Had your master any other horses but this bay mare and grey horse? - No, not besides coach-horses, they were grey.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had he lived with your master? - He was with me about half a year.</p>
               <p>Did he live with your master at the time you went out on this business? - He did.</p>
               <p>At the time you robbed Mr. Thornton, did he live with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Let John Bates come in.</p>
               <p>Court to Bates. What coloured horses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220028"/>were they of your master's, that Barrett and Softly used to take out? - One was a chesnut mate, and the other a grey horse; my master had no dark coloured horse.</p>
               <p>Nor a roan horse? - A grey horse, he was between white and black, a roan horse.</p>
               <p>How came you to think of a roan? do you know what a roan horse is? - I do not know rightly and properly.</p>
               <p>Do you know it when you see it? - Yes: a grey horse is a kind of all white partly.</p>
               <p>White mixed with what colour? - With black.</p>
               <p>Now what is a roan horse? - A roan horse, I believe, is white mixed with red.</p>
               <p>Now was this a roan horse or a grey horse? - It was a roan horse.</p>
               <p>Why did you call it a grey horse? - I could not tell properly what it was, but the colour of the horse was white and red.</p>
               <p>Is your master here? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. As far as you recollect, what coloured horse was it? - I wish to refer to the handbill, because that was faithfully taken from my memory.</p>
               <p>(Reads):</p>
               <p>"a single highwayman, he</p>
               <p>"was well mounted on a light coloured</p>
               <p>"bay or roan horse." - But I cannot take upon me to swear to the colour of the horse; so it appeared to me at the time; the other man was on a dark horse.</p>
               <p>I think you described the other man as standing still like a looker on? - I did; he says he was going slow as he possibly could; I cannot be sure as to that, whether he stood still, or whether he went a foot's pace.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Barrett step out a moment.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Thornton. When this man left you, did you drive on directly and quickly towards town? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The chaise did not stop afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see the man that robbed you after he had taken your watch? - No, they fell back, I went on.</p>
               <p>Is the postilion that drove you here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Call Barrett in again.</p>
               <p>To Barrett. How long might the chaise stop that you robbed? - I cannot say; a very little time.</p>
               <p>After the robbery did the chaise come on towards London, or turn back again? - It came on past me to London.</p>
               <p>Which way did you and Softly come? - We came all round Tottenham; we did not follow the chaise.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Between nine and ten, as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>Court to Ruthwin. Barrett was first taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And it was on his information that you took the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The substance of that information was, that the prisoner had committed robberies in his company, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Well now, did he before the prisoner was taken, particularize any robbery in particular? - Upon my word I cannot tell; Sir Sampson took down all his examination.</p>
               <p>Was his examination taken down before Softly was taken? - The examination was taken down, Sir Sampson told us to use our own discretion, in going to seek for Softly.</p>
               <p>Was that before Softley was taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I shall be very ready to recommend him.</p>
               <p>Court. The circumstance that induces Mr. Thornton and the jury to recommend him is, that there is no circumstance of cruelty; but on the other hand, it is to be considered, that the prisoner had been concerned in several other robberies, and that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220029"/>at a time when he was under no temptation so to do; for it was at a time when he was actually a <rs id="t17881022-19-deflabel94" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Mr. Justice Heath. The accomplice has told you, that they went out for four months, therefore this can hardly be called the first offence; it is a matter of very dangerous and aggravated nature; the servants of this man had always an opporportunity of commanding their master's horses.</p>
               <p>Court. You will judge whether you will persist in making the recommendation to the King.</p>
               <p>Jury. You have given a good reason for it; we leave it to your lordship to do as you please.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall communicate your recommendation, as there was no circumstance of violence; but the other circumstances will also appear to the King.</p>

               <p>You are very sure they were not pointed out to you, but that you pointed them out? - I did not see my body to point them out to me.</p>
               <p>Were there other persons there at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you fix on these men among the other prisoners? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In general I know, (do not suppose I am trifling with you, or making game of you, I should be above it) I know in general, persons in such a situation, their sight is weak? - It is as strong as any body would expect.</p>
               <p>From the ball of your eye being turned so much inward, it requires more exertion in you, and therefore exhausts the power of vision, more than in persons who look strait? - I can see to work at my business.</p>
               <p>What is that? - A <rs id="t17881022-23-viclabel108" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

               <p>That is not a business that requires very strong sight? - Yes, it does.</p>

               <p>And you had not seen either of the persons before? - No.</p>
               <p>Before you saw them at justice Wilmot's office, you had seen some of the thief-takers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first see them? - The next day after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Was Shakeshaft one of them? - Yes.</p>

               <p>To see the two men that they had found? - Yes, we went to see the watch first.</p>
               <p>Then of course, when you went to the justice's, you expected to find the two men that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were told so by the runners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You fixed on these two men that were there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you equally sure to both the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might this be transacting? - The space of three minutes or more.</p>
               <p>You are equally sure to Pace, as you was to Scamp? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though he, according to your account, was the man that was engaged with your brother? - Yes, I was not quite so sure, but I knew him again.</p>
               <p>What sort of hats had the men on that robbed you? - Round hats.</p>
               <p>Court. But if you was not quite so sure as to Pace, before the magistrate, as you was to Scamp, what makes you quite so sure now? - I should not pretend to swear to the other, because I was not so much with him as I was with the other that robbed me, but I knew his face again.</p>
               <p>But you say, you was not quite so certain as to Pace as you was to Scamp, was you quite so certain then? - No.</p>
               <p>What makes you then quite so certain now? - I shall not take an oath to the man.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that now you do not swear to Pace positively? - I swear to George Scamp.</p>
               <p>But you have already swore to Pace as being present when Scamp committed this robbery; are you sure that Pace was so present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you was not so sure as to Pace? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you are not quite sure as to Pace? - I know it is the man.</p>
               <p>Then you are now sure that Pace was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But before the magistrate you was not quite so sure? - I did not pretend to swear to that man.</p>
               <p>You did not swear to him then before the magistrate? - No.</p>

               <p>What happened to you in Islington-fields? - Two men met us; the prisoners are the men; Pace took me by the collar, while the other robbed my Brother of his watch; the first which they said, was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220032"/>Pace asked me where I was going, and laid hold of me by the collar, and held a stick over my head, while the other robbed my brother; I saw the other run up to my brother, and I heard him say, give me your watch; I saw him attempt to take his watch; Scamp is the other; my brother scuffled with him, and got away from him, and ran a little distance from him; Pace said to the other, after him; and Scamp then followed him, and got the watch from him; it was at a distance; I did not see him take the watch; Scamp came back to me and Pace; and Pace said to Scamp, have you got it?</p>
               <p>Did Scamp say any thing to that? - I will not be sure whether he did or not; Pace let go of me directly; and he asked me whether I had any money about me; I told him I had not; Pace said, we will shake hands with you; and he shook hands with me and went away.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoners, or either of them again? - On the Saturday following, this was on the Sunday; I saw the two prisoners on the Saturday following, at Mr. Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>Were they in custody? - Yes, I knew them again when I saw them; I swore to both of them.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, and say whether you took such observation of them at the time, as to be able to swear that these two prisoners are the men? - Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to observe their faces? - Yes, I saw them at the time, Pace had hold of me by the right arm.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Pace had got a blue coat on, and the other had a lightish coloured coat on.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed when you saw them before the magistrate? - Scamp was dressed as he is now, and Pace had a blue coat on then.</p>
               <p>So that you have no doubt at all of the two prisoners being the men? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They were not with you above two or three minutes? - About five minutes; I was a little frightened; I had been told by the runners, that they had taken two men up; and I went, and saw them there.</p>
               <p>Have you heard of any reward, in this case, if they are convicted; did the runners tell you that? - No, they did not; I never heard of it; but I have had no talk with the runners about that.</p>

               <p>Were there any goods of Mr. Allman's brought into the house at that time? - Yes, there were to the amount of some hundred pounds; they were silk for waistcoats; and different kinds of men's mercery goods; I left it about nine on the Sunday morning; and I left nobody at home; I secured the house, by double locking the door that comes into the shop, and likewise the street-door, and the door that parts the shop from the passage; the street-door opens into a passage, but then there is a door out of the passage into the shop; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220034"/>spent my day from home; I returned to the house, as near as I can recollect, about ten minutes before seven in the evening; the shutters of the windows were all secure; when I returned to the house, I observed the windows safe; I had uneasiness in my mind, or I should have staid supper in the city; I found the windows were safe; I put my elbow against the street-door; it was safe, but I had an idea that I heard something of rustling in the passage of the house; I went on a few yards further, and I could not be satisfied but something was amiss; I returned again to the door.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light? - It was, to the best of my recollection, a fine night.</p>
               <p>Was the evening so far advanced as to be dark? - Why, it was dark to be sure; on my return to the door, I stood opposite, and I felt in my pocket for my keys to open it; while I was feeling in my pockets, the door opened; the situation of our passage is such, that the great wide part of the stair-case comes immediately to the opening of the door; the door opens inside; the prisoner, Messenger, must have stept up in the situation we found the passage afterwards with bundles; he must have stept up the first or second stair to have got an opportunity of coming out; upon the door opening, I saw Messenger's face close at the door; he must have been on the first or second step of the stairs leading up stairs; I was so surprized at seeing a man genteely dressed coming out of the house that I had not the opportunity of seizing him; he passed me, and run across the street; I immediately called out stop thief; and immediately the other prisoner came out in the same manner that the other had; and in attempting to follow the other out of the house, I seized him by the collar; he struggled with me; and I still kept calling out stop thief; I said to him, what business have you in that house? he replied, he was not in that house; he was then off the pavement opposite the door; we were struggling in the street; after we had struggled some time, he then struck me violently on the face; there were a number of people standing by, and I begged of them, for God's sake, to assist me in taking him.</p>
               <p>Did you secure him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time lose him from you? - No, never till he was secured; I have no sort of doubt but he was the man that came out of the house; the other man, I could not tell any thing concerning him, till they brought him up, that was, I suppose, seven or eight minutes after; I do not think it was more than that; he was brought back in the custody of Tucker and others; I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Was you sure of him? - I was sure of him; I said, that is the man.</p>

               <p>Are you now, upon your oath, sure that he was the man who passed out of the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt upon it? - None.</p>
               <p>What lamps are there at your door? - The lamp over the street-door comes exactly over the opening of it; and opposite, or nearly opposite is a tavern, which has two large lamps.</p>

               <p>What distance is that from your door? - Why, it is a narrow street.</p>
               <p>From the assistance of those lamps are you now able to swear positively that Messenger was the person that came out? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Were either of them searched in your presence? - No.</p>
               <p>Where had you left the goods when you went out of the shop? - They were not packed in the situation I found them in.</p>
               <p>What state did you find the inside? - On going into the house, or at least on opening the door of the house; when I found that Pocock was properly secured, I went and pulled the door to, and got some friends to assist me in searching the house.</p>
               <p>Was there a spring lock? - There was a latch which this key opened, and by pulling it to, it becomes fast; we got lights, and went over immediately to the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220035"/>and opened it with this key that opens the latch, and got admittance; but we found, in pushing the door open, it was incumbered; we could not enter but one at a time; when we entered the house, we found three parcels in the passage; and the shop door was quite open, and one parcel ready packed up, which was thrown on a bed in the shop; I immediately searched round the shop to see that nobody was concealed; I searched the cellar, and went up stairs, but we found nobody in the house.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of those goods that were packed up in the different parcels? - I suppose upwards of a hundred pounds; they are here; they have been secured from that time to this; they are exactly in the same state they were found in; they were in four bags.</p>
               <p>Whose property are those things that you so found packed up? - The property of Mr.

            .</p>
               <p>Did you see the keys afterwards examined with the door? - No, I did not then, but I have afterwards; they opened the door; the bags were not Mr. Allman's property.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Sheppard.)</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Allman? - Since the Tuesday before this.</p>
               <p>Where have you lived before? - I have lived in Milk-street, and in New-street, with Mr. Burnell, near a twelvemonth; he is in the hardware way; I lived before that, with Mr. Gray, in Milk-street; before that, I lived with Mr. Lane, in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Have not you lived with Mr. Starkey? - Yes, near a twelvemonth; I quitted that six years ago.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit his service? - I lived with him, as collecting clerk, near a twelmonth.</p>
               <p>Then tell the gentlemen of the jury for what reason you quitted his service? - I went down into the country to my friends.</p>
               <p>The reason of your quitting his service? - The reason was, that there was some little deficiency in the cash that was not made up; the cash accounts were not so correct.</p>
               <p>There was a deficiency? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Then he turned you out of his service? - No, sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he turn you out of his service, because there were deficiencies in your cash accounts? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not Starkey turn you out of his service, because there were deficiencies? - I never saw Mr. Starkey but once after the time I left him.</p>
               <p>Did not he turn you out of his service because you embezzled his cash? - I left his service, I imagine, for that reason, I suppose it was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was? - It was the reason, no doubt.</p>
               <p>After having been turned out of Starkey's, where did you go to live afterwards? - With Mr. Lane, at Leadenhall-street, near a twelvemonth; he was a bookseller; I was there as shopman.</p>
               <p>Did you manage the till there? - No, I had no management at all there; I received the money sometimes; I quitted his service merely on disagreement.</p>
               <p>About what? - Why, about coming home one night rather later than usual.</p>
               <p>That was not the first time? - Yes, I believe it was the first time; I staid in his service for about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>But were you not turned away? - I went away not disgracefully.</p>

               <p>Was you turned away? - I was: I was in Milk-street with Mr. Gray for three years.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit him? - Why, upon a disagreement.</p>
               <p>On which side did it begin; was not you turned out of his service? - I was.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of being turned out of his service? - Why, I had rather drank too much.</p>
               <p>Was there no other reason assigned, upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220036"/>Was there no other reason assigned? - No.</p>
               <p>Was there no dispute about cash accounts there? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then getting drunk was the only reason? - The only reason.</p>
               <p>Did you never live with any body in St. Martin's-street? - I never did live with any body in St. Martin's-street; I lived in St. Martin's-lane, with one Mr. Hall; I lived there eight years.</p>
               <p>How came you to quit that service before you went to Starkey's? - It is so long time ago I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Why, I believe, it is a circumstance which you cannot easily forget; was it not about a money account there? - No, it was a disagreement between Mr. Hall and me.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of this? - Through words.</p>
               <p>Did not you quarrel with him on account of monies that you had received? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>On account of any effects then? - No.</p>
               <p>Not in consequence of a dispute relative to some of his goods? - I swear not; after that I went to live with Mr. Grosvenor, in Foster-lane; I quitted him on the failure of business; after that, I went to live with Mr. Lockwood, in St. Martin's-lane; I was not turned away by him; I quitted him to take Mr. Starkey's place; I had no dispute with him at all.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Allman before? - Some years.</p>
               <p>Who lived with him in the capacity you afterwards did? - He had only opened the shop on the Monday preceding; there was a young man that he had there; his name is Urry.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Lee? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has he any concern with Mr. Allman in business? - None that I know of, nor Urry.</p>
               <p>Are you sure neither of those gentlemen are concerned with Mr. Allman in business? - I do not know that they are.</p>
               <p>You were put into this house to superintend and take care of those goods, and to manage the business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody lived there but yourself? - None, excepting Mr. Urry; he attends as shopman; he is to receive wages; I had the custody of the goods; I went out at nine in the morning, to Mr. Gray's, in Milk-street; I set off from there about six.</p>
               <p>This was an odd sort of prepossession of yours; you say, your mind was uneasy? - It was.</p>
               <p>Are you subject to those prepossessions? - I do not know; I was then; I mentioned it at the place where I was at.</p>
               <p>When you went out in the morning, did you lock the door, or only shut the door after you? - Yes, I locked them both.</p>
               <p>I think the first thing that occurred to you, was, you thought you heard a rustling in the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you knock at the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you walk away? - I walked away five or six yards, with an intention to go to my brother in the neighbourhood; but I immediately had an idea that I was not sufficiently easy in my mind, which made me return; my intention to go to my brother continued but very little time; then I saw the door open; I was on the same side of the way.</p>
               <p>What way did the person you took for Messenger go? - Across the street, towards Bedfordbury; I saw nobody else near the door.</p>
               <p>Did nobody pass you but Messenger? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>I think you say, you was surprized to find a person of so decent an appearance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When Messenger went out, and Pocock came out you collared him directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him? - No further than after I had laid hold of him, I asked him what business he had in the house; he said, he was not in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220037"/>Upon your oath, did not he tell you, he would go where you pleased, but that he would not be dragged and pulled about in this way; and before he struck you, he said, I will not be dragged? - I do not recollect ever hearing any such word mentioned; with my endeavouring to secure him, I might not pay attention to every thing he might say.</p>
               <p>Then you do not mean to deny that he did say so? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Messenger, in a little while was brought back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you return? - It was six o'clock when I set out; I drank coffee at Mr. Gray's; and staid from two till six; I had occasion to call to deliver a message for Mrs. Gray, and I called there; Mr. Gray wanted particularly to go out; he was going out of town; he drank tea rather sooner than usual.</p>
               <p>Then what makes you so sure that you got home between six and seven, that it might not be earlier; how are you sure that you left his house at six? - It was a fine evening.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear it was in the twilight, that the sun had actually set, and that the darkness of the night had came on? - Yes, I look upon it it was; it wanted about ten minutes to seven; the lamps were all alight.</p>
               <p>How long had you staid it the place, at which you had called for Mrs. Gray? - Not, I suppose, above five or six minutes; it was about six when I left Mrs. Gray.</p>
               <p>Having this strange prepossession that all was not right, when you got home, how came you to be satisfied with barely pushing your elbow against the door; why did not you go into the house? - I thought it was safe then, but hearing the rustling in the passage made me return.</p>
               <p>Did you push against the door so as to make a noise? - I pushed it with my elbow.</p>
               <p>Could any body hear you on the inside? - Yes, I suppose they could.</p>
               <p>Still this door opened almost immediately, and these people went out? - No, sir, it was by my going.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Every thing appeared to be right when you came back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You left one place because you drank too much? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And another because you kept too late hours; and a third, because having a great deal of money to collect, at a brewer's, there was a deficiency? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You say, that was afterwards made up to Mr. Starkey? - It was.</p>
               <p>What might be the amount of it? - I cannot rightly tell; my father settled the deficiency; and so far from any differences, my father dealt with him for twenty years, and my brother deals with him now.</p>
               <p>Did you apply to Mr. Starkey for a character? - I did not.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Are you sure that the lanthorn dropped from under Pocock's coat? - I am sure, I picked it up; and it was very warm; I felt it through my gloves; I supposed it had been lighted; it might be a light then for aught I knew; Pocock was secured then; I did not go home to the house at all; there was a crowd; I never saw the other prisoner till I saw him at Bow-street office; I am a shoe-manufacterer; I live in Cheshire; I was a stranger, accidentally passing by; I should have been at home but for this business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. How many men were struggling together? - There were but two when I came up besides Pocock; they had hold of him, and they said, for God's sake, help; there were several people standing by when I came up to them; when the lanthorn fell numbers interfered.</p>
               <p>There must have been a great confusion? - No, there was nobody near, they stood at a distance, except these two that had hold of him; I went to Bow-street office next morning, to know what was become of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You have been promised of course, a part of the reward? - I have not, and I declare to God, I would not take any reward if it was offered to me.</p>

               <p>Was it dark? - It was just to say dark; Oh, no! it was moon-light; the first thing that I heard as I was going out of Bedfordbury, was, I heard the cry of stop thief; that appeared to come from New-street then; I looked up Bedfordbury, and I saw a gentleman running down Bedfordbury; I was on my ladder with a light in my hand; I saw Mr. Messenger running down New-street, on the opposite side of the way to that I was upon.</p>
               <p>Was there any body else running at that time, in that direction? - Not a soul; I crossed over the way, and caught Messenger by the arm; and I said, sir, I hear stop thief, and I do insist on your stopping;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220039"/>Mr. Messenger made me answer, that he was the person that called stop thief.</p>
               <p>Were you able to tell whether that was true or not? - I am very sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Did he cry stop thief? - I do not know that he did; I said, I did not know that, but I wished to detain him; Messenger, as I had him by the arms, he threw him- himself from me, and gave me a blow on the side, and knocked me down backwards; I got up again as fast as I could, and called, stop thief, stop thief, and I ran after him; there was a young man that was in a public-house, about three or four doors down, and he ran after him; I never lost sight of him till he turned the corner to go up Chandos-street; he was not a minute, nor half a minute out of my sight, only till I turned the corner; the taylor, this man that is a witness, Ross, was close by him; I saw him turning towards Round-court, in the passage that goes to Round-court; I ran immediately up to him; when I came up to him, Ross had got Messenger by the collar; and an iron crow Ross had in his hand; says Ross, I have the bird in my hand; either d - n him, or something, I said, well, let us bring him up Bedfordbury; we shall soon find what he has done; coming up Bedfordbury, we met Wilson and a number more, and the other man; and he, asked if we had got the other; we said, yes; and as soon as Wilson saw him, he said, aye, that is the man, I will swear to him; he was taken to the watch-house; I saw him searched, and there three pick-lock keys, which are to be produced, and some silver and halfpence were found upon him.</p>

               <p>Is the man you saw Ross pursuing in Chandos-street the same man that gave you the blow? - Yes, I am very sure of it; he was not out of my sight half a minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was some time before you got him to the watch house? - Yes, the clock struck seven when we were in the watch-house; he was searched immediately.</p>
               <p>He was some little time out of your sight, and out of the sight of every body? - No, for Ross, who stopped him, was close to him.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor; I was standing at the Scotch-arms door, on Sunday night; I heard the cry of stop thief at the top of Bedfordbury; I saw a multitude of people standing there; the Scotch arms is the second door from May's-buildings, which goes through from Bedfordbury into St. Martin's-lane; presently I saw Mr. Tucker get up, and cry stop thief; then I pursued Messenger down Bedfordbury and along Chandos-street towards Covent-garden; he then knocked down a man just at the broad part of Chandos-street, and turned down Round-court.</p>
               <p>Was there any body before Messenger, running? - No, sir, not one; he was the first man I saw run; I saw him knocked down by this man; I pursued him down the court, and took him at the end of Vine-street, which is in the court; I threw him down, and when he fell down the crow was thrown from him; (A crow produced.) I have had it ever since; I never parted with him till I got him to the watch-house; going along we met Wilson at the top of Bedfordbury; I recollect somebody saying, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheppard. How far was the man off, that Messenger knocked down, when you came up to him? - As nigh as I can recollect, about twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>How far had you pursued him; how long might you be? - I cannot justly say to the time.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with? - I cannot rightly say at present; the last master I worked with, was one Mr. Williams, in Featherstone-buildings; I only worked two days with him this last time.</p>
               <p>How many different masters have you worked with this last twelvemonth? - That I cannot tell you; consider this is a dead time of year; may be twenty in the last year.</p>
               <p>Did you go with them to the watch-house? - Yes, the last that I saw of them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220040"/>was, they was put down in the black hole after the charge was given.</p>

               <p>This is a false key; the misfortunate men term them dubbs; on Monday, the 13th, I went to Mr. Allman's house in order to take an inventory of all the property that was in the bags; seeing much such a key as this hang up in the shop, it struck me; there was much such a one produced before Sir Sampson; and I sent to the beadle to have them tried at the door; I took the two keys; I first tried this backwards and forwards, before I put the other in at all, and it opened the street-door exceedingly well; then I tried them both together; they both belonged to one door; I desired the door to be locked just as it was when Wilson left the house; and I went in exceedingly well; one is a pipe key that opens the latch inwardly; and the other is the key of the main lock of the door. (Wilson produced the true key to it) The bags are all sealed up, with the initials of my name upon them.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Allman called in to depose to the property, and deposed to also by Mr. Wilson.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Allman. They were in that house; I have the bills of parcels of every one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have not any person concerned in the trade with you? - I have not, nor ever had.</p>
               <p>Do you know Lee? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I leave it to my counsel; coming up New-street, between the hours of six and seven, a man run violently down Bedfordbury; I pursued him; he threw a crow and two keys away; the other is the key of my own street door; I picked them up; Tucker stopped me; I considered him as an accomplice with the man; I went on in pursuit of the man that was running; I had these things in my pocket for a quarter of an hour in the watch-house; likewise the distance I was, I could have got rid of them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER POCOCK's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>As I was going promiscuously by, and promiscuously it was, I saw an alarm; I turned my self about, and was looking round; and I was suddenly seized by Wilson; I asked him the reason; he gave me no answer; I told him, I would not be torn about by him; I had done nothing; he gave no reply; but insisted on laying hold of me, and called out, stop thief; then there was a scuffle ensued; I got from that door to the end of Bedfordbury in a great crowd; whenhe crowd was very thick there was a dark lanthorn produced, which the witness declares, he saw drop from me in the middle of a great crowd.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Pocock called nine witnesses; who had known him a great many years, and gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Messenger called five witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Is it possible that a sober man could lose his handkerchief, without feeling it taken off his neck? - My lord, she struck me on my breast, which took away my attention; when I got my handkerchief, I charged the watch with her, and she was taken to the watch-house.</p>

            ; I went up stairs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220053"/>and called the prisoner up, and paid him his fare, which was 5 s. the prisoner then went down again, as I understand, to his coach; I had some olives in the coach, which the gentleman and me had been eating, and I desired the maid to take them out, they were taken out; I then took the bracelets, which I had in my pocket, and was looking at them, when I remembered the pin, which I had left there; I then went down to see if the coachman was gone, and I found he was; it was not longer than eight or nine minutes; I did not know his number, and I went to the coach office to find him; I was advised to take a coach and drive after the prisoner, and I found the prisoner at the stand at the Mews; it was not more than two hours and a half after; I knew the coach by the horses, having observed their harness; when I found the coach, I opened the door and looked into it, thinking, perhaps, the coachman had not seen it; the coachman was at dinner, and a waterman fetched him; I recollected the prisoner, as coachman, and I asked him for the pin; I recollected him, because he had on a pair of red breeches, and a yellow edging round his hat, I will not say it was gold, and a mark he had over one of his eyes; I described his hat at the office; I asked the coachman if he had seen the pin? I think, I asked him if he had seen a pin, that I left in the coach? he then denied his having it, or having seen it; I then, I think, offered him a reward, or if not then, I did sometime afterward, and to think nothing more of it; he said he knew nothing of the pin, and had taken up a gentleman and set him down, since me; I think he said, the corner of St. James's-street, or Pallmall; I then left him on the stand; he told me I had called him from dinner, and prevented him from finishing a pot of beer; I went to some friends at George's Coffee-house; and afterwards, I think, I found his No. was 945, and I got referred to the master of the coach, in Rupert-street; while I was speaking to his master, desiring him to persuade the man to return it me, the coachman, with the same coach, drove in; I then again asked him after the pin, and offered him a reward of four, five or six guineas; he again denied having it, or having seen it; in about seven, eight or nine days after, a man, like a coachman, came to my lodgings, and gave me some information, in consequence of which, I went to Sir Sampson Wright's, this coachman was there; I think the pin was not then produced; I desired another day might be appointed, and on the 7th of October, I went to the office, where the pin was produced; I think, I saw it in the hands of the pawnbroker. I never got my property.</p>
               <p>This diamond pin, you had in charge from a lady, to have repaired? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This you say, sir, was the property of a lady in the West-Indies. - Yes, a relation of mine, I am a West-Indian myself.</p>
               <p>You entered into no engagement to return the value of this pin, if lost? - No.</p>
               <p>If you ever return the value of this pin to the lady, (supposing it to be lost) I dare say, you will look upon it a matter of honor, not of legal obligation? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I have had the buttons fifteen years; I bought them in the Strand, with that devise upon them; I have had the buckles five or six years; they were whole when I had them.</p>
               <p>Paul. I broke the buckles after I weighed them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of October, I apprehended the prisoner; I believe it was at his lodgings; I searched him, and found two guineas and a half in his pocket, and some new cloth, a new pair of shoes, some stockings, and handkerchiefs in the room; when I spoke to him, he said, he had robbed his master of five guineas; I said nothing to him; the prosecutor's wife was in the lodgings; she asked her husband not to hang him; and desired he would tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this in the hearing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutor say, he would, or would not hang him, if he would tell? - I did not hear him say any thing about it; he said, I have not had six guineas, it was only five; he did not say, particularly, how he got them; he said, he had thrown the trunk, but he had not opened it, into an area, in Jermyn-street; the lad began crying, and the old gentleman said, he did not so much care about the money, if he would tell him where the child's trunk was; then we went, and took him with us, to the house in Jermyn-street, where he had thrown the trunk; and as we were going along, he said, several times, he had never opened the trunk, and did not know what was in it; we found the trunk there; it was cut open behind; there was nothing in it; the prisoner continued denying the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220057"/>taking the money; and as we came back, I told him, as he had told his master so much, he might as well tell where the rest of the things were, as he must have cut the trunk open; he did not tell me for a good long while; but just as we got to the place, he said, he had sold them in Long-acre.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Guilty, my lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses? - I have not a friend in the world, but a poor mother; it is the first time I was in custody; I served seven years to his wife before.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it is the first fault he was ever guilty of, if you can shew him any favour.</p>

               <p>And the street-door, and the one pair of stairs-door open? - Yes.</p>

The mark on the silk handkerchiefs was W. W. no part of the property has been recovered, but one waistcoat, which was made; and my sister's handkerchief, which is unmarked; I left my trunks safe at five o'clock; and saw all the clothes; because I had the waistcoat in my hand; the reason I searched the trunk, was, my sister and I were going out, and she wanted her gown; we went up in the garret to get my sister's gown, which had been laying in the trunk, under the waistcoat; we took out the gown, and put the other things in; I saw the waistcoat in the custody of Mr. Armstrong the officer; I missed all the articles to the value of thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. Then this policat was brought to you by Armstrong, before you went to the justice's office? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I take it, in looking into this trunk, you were more attentive to find your own clothes, than to observe any other? - When I went to the trunk, I went to take out this gown; I was not looking for the waistcoat.</p>

               <p>When did you give the information to the officers? - The very night it happened.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you recollect the hour at which you fastened your door? - I do not know to the minute, but it was nigh that time.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for recollecting it was about the hour of seven? - Because I know it was but seven; when I was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220059"/>house it wanted but a few minutes of seven; I took notice of it from a clock in the house; we came down from the place where we was, just as the eight o'clock bell began to ring eight; the bell at St. George's; I heard the eight o'clock bell ring before I left the house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When had you received this information respecting Mrs. Hall's burglary? - On Thursday, the 8th of October, I was going down Spital-square, between ten and eleven, in the forenoon, in company with Harper and Shakeshaft; I stopped the prisoner, and searched him; and in his coat-pocket, I found this handkerchief and waistcoat; he was in company with another person, who separated; the waistcoat was wrapped up in the handkerchief; I asked him whole the waistcoat was; he said, it was his own, and he was going to pawn it; he said, he had had it two months; I then told him, we should take him to the justice's; and in company with the other officers; and on my returning, I received this hand-bill, which led me to Mrs. Hall.</p>
               <p>Does that hand-bill describe any such waistcoat? - It says here; one green sattin waistcoat, spotted.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they describe the waistcoat before they saw it? - Mrs. Hall, and her sister, and another, were in the room; they said, they should know the things; the little lady, on seeing it, said; oh, my God, that is my handkerchief! I know it; I hemmed it; that waistcoat has been in my possession ever since; I am sure it is the same that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner told you the waistcoat was his own, and always persevered in that story? - Yes, he was taken immediately; when the things were found upon him; and he said, it was his own; he said so when I apprehended him, and also when I took him before the justice.</p>
               <p>(The waistcoat shewn to Mrs. Isabella Hall.)</p>
               <p>This is quite new; it was never worn; when the taylor brought it home, I looked at it, and said, I was happy they had put such buttons upon it, which were the same as the waistcoat; because it was genteeler than metal buttons; I knew the pattern, which me and my sister chose out of three; Mr. Wilson at that time was at my house; he is not in England now.</p>
               <p>Were there strings at the back of it? - Yes, there were three strings on each side.</p>
               <p>Have you any sort of doubt, that was the one you saw at five o'clock? - No.</p>
               <p>Look at the policat handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. This is the same.</p>
               <p>To Hall. Was it such a sort of policat handkerchief, as was lost? - Yes, I cannot speak to the hemming, I could if it was to my own; there was one in the trunk, one of that sort unmarked, and new; this is unmarked and new; upon looking at it now, I am sure it was never washed from the hemming.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The policat handkerchiefs are not at all uncommon? - No.</p>
               <p>To Margaret Hall. Look at that policat handkerchief, do you know your own work? - This is my work.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear positively? - I am able to swear it is my own hand work, I hemmed it myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you distinguish your hemming from another persons? - I can, by the way that I hem in general, I could not distinguish it after it had been washed, but while new, and before wetted, I could.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know your own hemming? - Because I always fasten the end of my hemming at the bottom, instead of the top.</p>
               <p>Court. Now look at this waistcoat? - This waistcoat is a sort of sattin, like that of Mr. Wilson's, that was lost; and he has another, exactly the same, unmade; the buttons were covered with the same silk; I observed these strings behind, I think it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Other sempstresses may fasten down at the bottom, as well as you? - They may.</p>

               <p>Does a mischance of that kind, often happen? - The mischance is not common at all.</p>

             made this waistcoat; I cut it out, and covered the buttons; I know it by a particular mark, by a cut in the lining. which is not very common, which Cavernor has spoke of, it was near to the bottom of the back, on both sides of the waistcoat.</p>

               <p>A good character through life, to this time? - Exceedingly so; I will promise to receive her into my own service if she is discharged.</p>

               <p>What o'clock at night was it? - The moon was, I think, eight days old, and it was a clear night, but a few light clouds, but so light, that I think, if I had opportunity of attentively observing any person, I could have done it.</p>
               <p>Had you such opportunity as enables you to speak to the person? - Not with absolute certainty; but when I was told the man was in custody, the moment I saw this young person, now at the bar, it occurred to me, that he was very like the man, and so like the man, that if I had been walking any where, and had met him I should have said, he is very much like the man; I stopped the carriage at the first public-house we came to, and informed the waiter of what had happened; the man was dressed very much as the prisoner is.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you, to be same dress this young man was in when you saw him? - The whole together was such, that I was very much persuaded, I should rather conceive he was in the same dress; a dark coat, and light waistcoat; it appeared to me the same kind of dress; he had a round hat, not very low over his face; when he turned his head to the coachman, I could see the hat was above his brow; the purse was such a one, as I think, I might have known again; it has not been found; but in the purse, there was, to the best of my recollection, seven guineas.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - A little before ten; allowing for my stopping at this public-house about a minute, and going to my house at Hampstead; probably that might take a quarter of an hour; and when I got to my house at Hampstead it was ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Dr. Reynolds; I drove him the night he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Do you know the man that robbed him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing his person? - Yes, I had very much so.</p>
               <p>Where have you seen him since? - At Mr. Read's office twice.</p>
               <p>Look at him now? - That is the gentleman there in the striped waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man? - I am very clear of it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt in your mind of it? - I am very clear he is the man that took the purse and presented the pistol to me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe how he was dressed at the time? - In a brown coat, metal buttons, and striped waistcoat; I believe the waistcoat to be the same, if not the coat; it was metal buttons, and a brown coat;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220066"/>it was one very much like that, if not the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Was his face much turned to you at the time of the robbery? - He came up first sideways, but the horse turned about; and when he put his pistol into his pocket, then he turned round, and I had a full view of his face.</p>
               <p>What sort of a horse was it he was mounted on? - I look upon it, to the best of my knowledge, it was a dark bay horse; I saw another man come up to the off side of the carriage, but my attention was to this prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, he said, before the magistrate, the man that robbed his carriage rode towards town, and that they came up to the carriage, and ordered him to look towards the horses heads; accordingly he did so; and after they had robbed the carriage, they rode towards town, and he went to town; he said at the office, he never turned his head round.</p>
               <p>Did you say so? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. When you first saw this man at the office, did you know him immediately to be the man? - I went into a little room where there were two, and I immediately knew him.</p>
               <p>Was you as sure of his person then, as you are now? - I was.</p>
               <p>Had you ever any doubt? - No doubt in the least.</p>
               <p>Because I observe, that when examined before the magistrate, you did not swear positively to his person? - I did not, I was very unwilling to swear.</p>
               <p>Had you any doubt, that made you express, that you verily believed him to be the man? - I had no doubt at all, but that he was the man, the very first sight I had of him.</p>
               <p>Court. He says before the magistrate, that he verily believes the said

               <p>Dr. Reynolds. I was robbed on Tuesday night; and I think it was on Thursday, or Friday se'nnight following, before I saw the prisoner.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was at the time at the New Theatre; I have witnesses to prove where I was at the time when the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Court. If you can prove that you really was at another place at the time of the robbery, it is undoubtedly the best defence you can possibly set up; but if you attempt to bring perjured witnesses, you may depend upon it, that they will be detected, and that will render your fate more certain: we have had many instances of unfortunate men here, whose ends have been rendered certain, by attempting to impose on the court.</p>

               <p>Court. If any body is in the gallery, or in the court, that means to be examined for the prisoner, they must withdraw out of the court.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is very likely he is at Covent-Garden house, for I see he comes out in a new dance to night.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you stay till the play was over? - I staid till about nine o'clock, and then Mr. Burne and me went out to get some refreshment; and then we went to another part of the house; he was there when we went out.</p>

               <p>Did you see any body else, in any other of the boxes, that you knew by sight? - I cannot recollect; I suppose he told a person that he saw me there, for they came to me; I suppose he saw me.</p>
               <p>You was in the boxes? - Yes, so was he in the next box; I was in the side boxes, on the left hand, and he was on the same side; a young man came to me, to ask me to come this morning.</p>
               <p>Who was that young man? - He was in court; he lives in Wardour-street; I do not rightly know his name.</p>
               <p>When did he apply to you? - About a week ago; I met him in Leicester-fields, and then I did not see him any more, till this morning; he said there was a young man taken up, for a highway robbery, and that he was at the Royalty Theatre, the night of Mr. Keene's benefit, and that he sat the next box to me.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - I do not rightly know his name; he lives in Wardour-street; his father keeps a hair dresser's shop.</p>

               <p>What day of the week was this? - I believe it was on the Tuesday.</p>

               <p>How lately before, had you been to that theatre? - I had been once, or twice, the same season.</p>
               <p>What was there remarkable, to fix this particular day in your own knowledge; because the house was pretty full, I take it for granted? - Yes it was; Mr. Keene called upon me and asked me to take some tickets; he knows me very well, I cannot say I saw any other that I knew there.</p>
               <p>What was there so remarkable for your seeing the prisoner there? - Why I thought he looked rather dirty.</p>
               <p>He was in company with some ladies I think? - I saw three in the front seat, and if I am not mistaken, there was one in the next seat to them.</p>
               <p>Was there any gentleman with him? - I cannot say indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you attend before the magistrate? - No, I did not know any thing about it, till some time after he was taken.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Your acquaintance was with Mr. Smeaton? - I lodged there one quarter of a year; I never knew him till I took the lodging there, which did not suit me altogether so well.</p>
               <p>How came you to call there on this day? - I thought the people behaved civil to me, and it was out of civility I went there, to call on Mrs. Smeaton, and seeing Mr. Simpson there frequently, I had a ticket to go to the Royalty Theatre, and I called there by accident, and meeting Mr. Simpson, and he saying he was going, ask me to accept of a part of his coach, which I did; the coach consisted only of Mr. Simpson, and that lady of the name of Lewis, and myself.</p>
               <p>Did you know Smeaton three or four years ago? - I did not, I never know him till I came to the house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lewes and you was not at all acquainted? - I do not know that I should know the lady, if I was to see her; I saw her only at the play that night, and once before.</p>

You did not know this young man at all? - I have seen him pass my house frequently, to come to Mr. Smeaton's, and he called once or twice at my house, with Mr. Smeaton, to speak to a young lady, in my first floor; I am sure it was that night, I never was at the Theatre before; I was with a good deal of company in the front boxes.</p>

               <p>Who where you in company with? - Mr. Tosh, Mr. Day, Mr. Levington, and three or four more of us, in the pit; I saw the prisoner, in one of the upper boxes, on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>What drew your attention to him? - He was pointed out with two men, not of the most respectable character, by a Mr. Day; on account of those two characters that were with him, that were pointed out, not to be very respectable; there were some ladies there, that I knew.</p>
               <p>Do you know who either of these two men were? - I do not.</p>
               <p>What time did he draw your attention first? - I take it, it must be between eight and nine, near nine I should imagine.</p>

               <p>Did you miss him at all? - I do not recollect that I did, and I kept frequently looking to that box.</p>
               <p>What time did you come away? - At the end of the performance; a few minutes after eleven; he was pointed out by Mr. Day; Mr. Day would not come here on account that he was a clerk, at the Museum; and that his master was very intimate with Dr. Reynolds, and therefore he could not obey the subpoena.</p>
               <p>Court. He did not know Dr. Reynolds, or he would not have judged so; some people judge foolishly, judging by themselves.</p>

               <p>Did you say any thing to induce him to say so? - Not a word, I told him he behaved like a villain to me.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him any favour? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. The prisoner and you were intimate? - Very, he was a servant out of place, and he used to be at our house off and on.</p>
               <p>Serve in the shop? - He never was allowed to do so, he sometimes of his own accord served a farthing candle.</p>
               <p>Did he take the money? - He very seldom took any money.</p>
               <p>You was not at home? - I knew the nature of it very well.</p>
               <p>You go to work of a morning? - Yes, and when I think proper, I stay at home, my wife conducts the business of the shop, I know she takes the money; I know he was not permitted to take money.</p>
               <p>He was very intimate with the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This money you and your wife had marked on the Sunday night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you told us all that passed? - As far as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>I understand then, that the whole of this business you have told us, as far as you can recollect? - I do not know but I have.</p>
               <p>What think you of compromising? - It was proposed to me; I said that twenty guineas would not satisfy me for the injury he had done me.</p>
               <p>How come you to send for a man of the name of Medley, you know Medley? - Yes, why his brother proposed giving me a note; the prisoner acknowledged while he was in prison, that he had taken ten pounds of my money, and Mr. Lawrence and his brother both told me that he had that sum of my money.</p>
               <p>Had not he this money from your wife at different times? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was not that the acknowledgement, upon your oath? - No, it was not, not at that time, I heard of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>When was it? - The Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Then you agreed with Mr. Medley? - I sent for Mr. Medley to make an agreement between us, that he was not to hurt me for making it up; I understood by a particular friend, that it was compounding felony, and therefore I set it aside.</p>
               <p>Court. You understood when you sent for Medley, that you was compounding felony? - Not so clearly as I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220074"/>Not so clearly, but you did by your own account? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>How came you to prosecute? - On that account I altered my mind.</p>
               <p>Why did you alter your mind? - Because I found it was compounding of felony; and another thing I heard, he said he had laid with my wife.</p>
               <p>Have not you carried on this prosecution in consequence of a letter which was written by the prisoner to your wife? - Partly on that account.</p>
               <p>Mrs. UPJOHN sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner about four or five months; on Friday evening last was a week, I put six guineas and a half into a bureau in our back parlour, in the bottom drawer of the bureau; and on the Sunday following I told my husband if he put five guineas more, there would be eleven guineas and a half; I locked up the bureau, I never saw the money again till my husband opened it; I was present, then he put in five guineas in my presence, after that he told it over, and he could find but ten; that was in my presence; my husband said there certainly must be somebody who has taken this money from us, and in the afternoon my husband took eight guineas, he marked them in my presence, and the four half guineas he took the account of them, he told me he had taken the dates of them; I did not see what he did to them, I should know the mark again of the guineas, I saw one or two of them were marked, then my husband put the money into the bureau, I never meddled with it, then the next day in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the house between twelve and one; after that I went into my shop to serve my customers as usual, and the little girl was up stairs, and the prisoner was in the room alone, eight or ten minutes, then he came out into the shop and said to me, good by mother, I have but so many minutes to go to do my duty; I had a suspicion, and went to the bureau, and found the bureau open, and I could find but eight guineas and a half; that was a guinea and a half short again, less than what I left there; then I immediately sent to my husband, he came and went in; he said he would apply to the justice immediately, and the prisoner was taken up, I was not present, I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This young man you knew very well, did not you? - Yes sir, he was an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>What we call an intimate acquaintance? - Yes, we looked upon him as such.</p>
               <p>You in particular? - Yes, he always behaved very well to me and my husband.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before the justice? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>How came that about, they never thought of producing you as witness, did they? - I do not know what they thought, he did not tell me any thing about it; I dare say I was to be a witness, but nothing was said.</p>
               <p>Look up, and look the jury in the face? - I do not know what you mean, I can look anybody in the face.</p>

               <p>This man was taken up, carried before the justice, and committed, and you was not examined? - Yes, I was at the justice's, but not examined.</p>
               <p>You used to call him Billy generally I think, and Billy used to serve in the shop, now and then? - Yes, he has, and my husband knew of this.</p>
               <p>You used now and then to give him money? - I never gave him money in my life.</p>
               <p>To go to market? - No, never, yes he has been to market, and bought a joint of meat of a Saturday night, he never went above once or twice, and then he told me what he gave for the meat, and I paid him.</p>
               <p>You had a key of this bureau? - Yes; my husband and I could go at any time to the bureau, and take what money we liked; I had the command of the shop.</p>
               <p>This young man was very good natured in the shop? - He was too good natured.</p>
               <p>And you was too good natured; you would now and then sit on his knee to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220075"/>oblige him? - I never sit on his knee to oblige him nor myself; I will not swear I never did, because he would pull any body on his knee, he was impudent enough.</p>
               <p>How came you to deny the fact just this moment? - I did not deny it</p>
               <p>You know Mrs. Smith, do not you? - Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>She came one day at an unlucky minute? - I don't know that it was an unlucky minute; I know when he came, that it was an unlucky minute.</p>
               <p>You know she saw you come from an oddish kind of a place? - Where did she see us come from?</p>
               <p>You know as well as I do, you know what I mean! there was a little bit of bed in the room, now can you guess? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember her seeing you a coming out a little ruffled or so? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Take care what you say, she is here? - I do not care who is here.</p>
               <p>Why you know you applied to her, and she told you what she could say; do not you remember that? - No, I never asked her any questions at all.</p>
               <p>Now good woman, for God's sake, do not add one crime to another; do not you know you did, and that you said you recollected very well, but you believed he had been to measure some coals; now, what say you to that? - I do not know what you mean about measuring coals.</p>
               <p>Did not you apply to Mrs. Smith, to know what evidence she could give, and when she told you that she could prove the great intimacy between you two; you then said he had been to measure coals? - I never mentioned coals to Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with her? - Oh! yesterday morning she called upon me, and she Wed me the subpoena, and said she had nothing to say, but that she saw me come out of the room, and him after me.</p>
               <p>Why just now, you said you did not recollect that? - No more I did.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you never at any time gave him any money? - I will say that I never gave him any money, nor moneys-worth in my life.</p>
               <p>He was welcome to any thing the house afforded? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know of your husband sending to this man's brother, to make it up? - He sent to him to know what he should do, but he did not send to make it up; my husband sent for the young man's brother, to tell him where his brother was; not to make it up, but to let him know that he was in Tothill-fields; he came to our house.</p>
               <p>And your attorney Medley was there? - He is not our attorney, I did not know he was an attorney, he was sent for by somebody, he was no particular acquaintance of ours.</p>
               <p>Was you present, when Medley drew up those releases? - I was in and out serving my customers.</p>
               <p>How came that agreement broke off? - He wrote me a letter in prison, that letter I shewed to my husband myself.</p>
               <p>That made him break the compromise? - I do not know it was that letter, I said I would persuade my husband not to make it up.</p>

               <p>He was on that footing of intimacy, that Mrs. Upjohn used to call him my dear Billy? - I never heard any such thing; I never saw them any further than seeing them in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Peatt. You have a right to ask her as to the conduct of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Did you ever see any improper conduct in Mrs. Upjohn? - I never did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Was you at any time employed to apprehend the prisoner? - Yes, on Monday, the 20th of October, I went to the Birdcage-walk; he was at exercise; I had a warrant; I apprehended him; I searched his pocket, and found one guinea, one half guinea, and nine shillings in silver, one sixpence, and one half crown piece; I have the guinea and a half; the silver I gave him again; I have had the guinea and a half ever since.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say to you when you apprehended him? - After we went to the justice's and could not have a hearing, just then we went to the public-house, and the prisoner said to me, what shall I say in my defence? says I, that is best known to yourself; in general, prisoners make the best defences themselves; and when he came before the magistrate, he pretended to say, he had sold a pair of breaches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was it taken down in writing, what he said before the magistrate? - No, not there, not by me.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was it not taken down by the justice, or his clerk? - Yes, I believe the justice's clerk took it down; I called for a pen and ink for him to write a note, and he wrote a note, and gave it to me to carry to Mr. Upjohn.</p>
               <p>Should you know the note again, if you saw it? - No, I cannot say I should; I did not read it; he did not tell me the contents of it; I believe there was no information taken down.</p>
               <p>Was there an examination taken down in writing? - Not any information taken down to send into court that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. What was taken down in writing? - The brief that the clerk made out afterwards; the justice's clerk did take down the brief.</p>
               <p>Court. Was what the prisoner said before the justice taken down? - No, not what the prisoner said; I did not rightly understand it.</p>
               <p>Did any body take any thing in writing? - Not that Monday that I served the warrant; I though Mr. Silvester meant the brief that was drawn upon.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this examination that you are talking of before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I am in the judgment of the court whether what is said, is an answer to my question.</p>
               <p>Court. Let us hear your final explanation of it; at first you said, this was taken down by the clerk? - What I meant, was here, at Clerkenwell; the clerk took it down; that is what they call the brief; that was justice Packer's Clerk; that was concerning this business.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present? - No, Sir, it was when we went to prefer the bill.</p>
               <p>Was that the only time that the clerk wrote any thing down? - That was the only time, except making out the warrant and commitment.</p>
               <p>At the time the prisoner was committed, did the clerk take any thing down? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are the same Mr. Gough that attended at Hick's hall the other day, to prove that there was no letters on a cart? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>When you was examined before, and was giving an account of his being apprehended and carried before the magistrate, you said, that when he came there, after having asked you in the public-house what defence he should make, you told him, he knew lest; and when he came before the magistrate, he made a defence about some breeches; you began, by stating what passed before the magistrate, did you not? - Yes, that was his defence before the magistrate</p>
               <p>I then asked you, whether that defence before the magistrate was not taken down in writing? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards, you said, it was taken down? - Because I meant in that brief</p>
               <p>My question did not relate about the brief; I did not mean any information; but my question was, what passed when you came before the magistrate, when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220077"/>charge was then made against the man? - No, Sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>How came you to swear yes before? - Why in a mistake; I meant the brief.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, upon your oath, that no minute, no account of any thing that was done, was taken down before the magistrate at the time? - Not any further than the commitment, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Were they not writing at a table? - Not that I saw.</p>
               <p>No examination in any book, nor on any paper? - There was nothing written but the commitment.</p>
               <p>Was not the examination taken of the prosecutor? - No, not that I know of; I saw nothing taken down more than the commitment.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear then, that no examination, either of the prosecutor, or the prisoner, were taken down before the justice? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not? - Nothing more than the commitment.</p>
               <p>Then you will swear, that nothing was taken down before the magistrate? - Not to my knowledge; not of an examination; it was on Monday the 20th.</p>
               <p>And no information from the prosecutor, nor examination of the defendant, was taken down in writing, by the magistrate, or by his clerk? - Yes, the examination; he was examined, but not taken down in writing, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>When did the clerk take the information? - I do not know that he took any information.</p>
               <p>When did he take the examination? - On the Wednesday; and there was no information, or examination, taken down on any book or paper.</p>
               <p>How long have you been an officer? - I believe, going of twelve years.</p>
               <p>Of what place? - Of St. John's.</p>
               <p>And yet you swear you misunderstood my question, which is a plain one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What was it the prisoner said before the magistrate? - The prisoner, in his defence, said, he had sold some breeches; nothing more that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say nothing more than that? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he charged with stealing that money? - Yes, and somebody bid him be quiet and say nothing.</p>

               <p>(The Money produced.)</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Is that, or is it not, one of the guineas which you put in the bureau? - This is one of them; I know it by a private mark which I put upon it.</p>
               <p>What is that? - It is a cross, just by the E and the T.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were all the eight marked so? - No, four of them were marked another way.</p>
               <p>Look at the half guinea? - The half guinea is the same date as that I lost, but I cannot swear it is the same.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of the rest of the money that was found? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. How came you not to mark them all alike? - I do not know; but here is the paper I drew out at the time they were marked; the date of the half guinea is 1786.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am innocent; I leave my case to my counsel; the woman gave me the guinea and a half on the Monday; she put her hand to my pocket, and said, my dear, how does your money stand? I said, very low; I put it into my pocket; I am a soldier; says I, my dear, I cannot stay now, I must go; she put her hand round my neck, and said, my dear, let me have a kiss; she has given me ten shillings; fifteen shillings; a guinea; a guinea and a half; and the most she gave me, was thirty-six shillings; I had been to Guilford with an acquaintance that lives opposite; I knew this woman five or six years ago, in Dorsetshire; we both came from there.</p>

               <p>Have you seen any thing particular? - All that I can say in it, is, I went to Mrs. Upjohn's for something that I wanted, and I went to the front door; that was bolted, as it commonly is, when nobody is in the shop; from there, I went to the back door; I opened it, and went in, and could see nobody; I went into the shop; presently Mrs. Upjohn came from this room and served me; before I came out of the shop, the prisoner,

            , came from the same place, that is the room where the bed was; Mrs. Upjohn seemed rather intimidated; she has had no conversation with me since; I mentioned it to her yesterday morning; and she recollected the time perfectly well; for she believed, she was backward measuring coals; upon my oath, them were the words she said; Mr. Upjohn made answer, and said, Mrs. Smith, was the girl present; I said, no, Mr. Upjohn, the girl was not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any money pass between them? - Never but once; that was of a Saturday night; she gave him half a crown out of the till; and said, Bill, buy a loin of lamb; that was to go to market to buy a loin of lamb.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What are you? - My husband is a journeyman carpenter; I have known Mrs. Upjohn about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>What was you doing in the shop when she came out of the room? - I went in to purchase something.</p>
               <p>What room was this, that you saw them come out of? - The door faces the street-door, the one door is the shop-door, the other is the parlour-door; there are two parlour doors, a front door, and back door; the back door goes to the place where the coals are, but that door was shut.</p>
               <p>This parlour she came from is a common sitting room? - She did not say any thing, but asked me what I wanted, and seemed rather intimidated; there is a passage parts the shop from the parlour.</p>
               <p>Was there any difference between you and Mrs. Upjohn on any subject? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You never suspected her of talking about you? - Never, but she always seemed very friendly, and very sociable; I do not say she was frightened, but she seemed rather intimidated, rather flurried.</p>
               <p>You understand what it is to be flurried, do not you? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. There is a bed in that room? - There is, the bed goes in with two folding doors.</p>
               <p>It is their sleeping room, is not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. And it is also their sitting room? - The bed shuts up with two folding doors, that you cannot see there is a bed in the room.</p>
               <p>Was the bed down? - I did not go into room far enough to see.</p>

               <p>Did he ever pull you on his knee, or did he ever kiss you, at any time? - I have seen him in the shop; I have seen him serve, and give change.</p>
               <p>Did he ever take you on his knee? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you are a little jealous, may be?</p>
               <p>Court. You say he pulled this woman on his knee; when those liberties were taken, were they in the presence of the husband? - No, I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any romping between him and the wife, in the presence of the husband? - Not so much as when they were by themselves.</p>

               <p>I live near the Middlesex Hospital; I am a servant; I know those parries; I have seen them playing together, and sitting on each others knees; I never thought any harm.</p>
               <p>Was the husband by? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You have seen them play together? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How came you there so frequently? - I went to a lodger, that lodged in the house; and when I have been out of place, I have been there three or four days together; I knew the young man, the prisoner I did not know her long.</p>

               <p>I know Upjohn, the prosecutor, I called in by accident that day; when I came in, there was the money upon the table; and I said, why you are getting on in the world; no, says he, my property is wasting; he went out after the prisoner, as I suppose; and Mrs. Upjohn desired me to stop; I said the prisoner is a countryman; it is a pity but it should be mollified; Upjohn was agreeable; and the same evening, Upjohn sent for the brother; the letter was sent by a person.</p>
               <p>How came it to be broke off afterwards? - There was a letter which came from the prisoner, which came in the morning; and the letter was kept private from Mr. Upjohn; he came home to breakfast, and in the same way to dinner; the letter never was given; then I went to see the prisoner and his brother, to know what he had taken, and when I put the question to the prisoner, he said, he was innocent of the affair, and that he had it intirely from the wife; and likewise made mention of the connection; and said, that every farthing of money he had, he had from her; the brother and me came the next morning, and after agreeing to take twenty guineas, they were to take ten pounds; but when he came to see this letter, the prosecutor insisted on going on with the prosecution; he said, he would not believe that she would do so, and therefore the law should take place: the night before we went in the morning, there was a six shilling stamp; and every thing was partly written, to my opinion of it, except the prisoner at the bar, signing of it, so that nothing should come against the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It seems that Upjohn did not send for you? - No, Sir, I came there by accident.</p>

               <p>And you also say, that you proposed this matter to Upjohn? - Sir, I first stated the subject; I said, it would be the best way, as they were friends, and country people together; but they advised him to take the advice of his uncle, who was the constable; the thing appeared to be broke off; the next morning, in consequence of a letter, which the prisoner wrote to Mrs. Upjohn, in private, by all appearance, it was given to him, as they said to me; I believe he had some letter, which irritated<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220080"/>the man so, that he determined to go on with the prosecution in defence of his wife's character.</p>

               <p>Where is your stand? - On the other side of London Bridge, in the Borough; I have a daughter lives in Oxford-street, a servant, and I repair her clothes; at my return I went to Covent Garden market for some walnuts and apples; I lay down my goods, and saw the prisoner at the bar, with a blue surtout; he turned round and looked towards me; he set the gun upright in his hand, and pulled out an old bit of red and white handkerchief, and rubbed it; the gun lay in the highway in the main street, by where he was standing; and after I stooped down, I saw the thing across the street, a matter of twenty yards from the place where he stood; I stooped and raised my head, and saw the man lift up the piece. it was a gun.</p>
               <p>Did you know this man before? - The way I came to know him was, on Sunday morning pulling out some goods in the Borough, in an entry, I saw a woman telling her complaints, that a man had been taken up for stealing a gun; and I came over to her, and asked her what sort of a man he was; a young man says she; says I, I saw a young man on Saturday night, the 18th, lifting up a gun; says she, come with me; and I was here yesterday and to day, and I have staid without see or reward.</p>
               <p>Atkins. When I asked the prisoner how he came by the gun, he told me he won it at a raffle in Rosemary-lane; and before Sir Sampson, he said, he had it of his father in Ireland, that his father won it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I found this gun, I went to the first public house I met with; I carried it publickly in my hand, and left it at the Nag's Head; I neither asked for any thing on it, nor offered to sell it.</p>

               <p>What is the reason that your witnesses did not attend, pursuant to the notice? - I do not know, they may be here now, they were not come when I came in; I thought as I had received two notices of trial, the court would indulge me 'till tomorrow. </p>
               <p>Have you given them notice to attend? - I did give them notice.</p>
               <p>When? - Last night I desired them to be here at nine this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your name Samuel Ravenhurst? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Relate in what manner you lost your property? - On the 9th of September: I am not possessed of the paper now; I have neither counsel or attorney.</p>
               <p>Why have not you? - It is so early in the morning, that I thought the court would indulge me till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. The court never indulges any body without a proper reason assigned.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - Between one and two in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was it the morning of the 10th or the 9th? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I forget it now; I have it down in writing, but I am not possessed of my writing now.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - Tuesday I believe; I have it down in writing at home.</p>
               <p>Was it Tuesday night or Wednesday morning? - I think it was Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Was it Tuesday morning or Tuesday night? - I think it was Wednesday morning, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>You think it was Wednesday morning? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Where were you at that time? - I was at Mr. Jenkins's, that is the gentleman who ordered me to bring the oysters and the fruit; he is not a house-holder, he is a lodger.</p>
               <p>I ask you where you was? - I was in Mr. Jenkins's house.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - In <placeName id="t17881022-67-crimeloc309">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>To do what? - To come to bring the oysters there; tell me what you want, and I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. I want you to tell your story? - I came there at eleven, to Bradbury's-house; Jenkins was the person that ordered me to come there; I came to Mr. Jenkins's where he lodges; where this dance was; where this grand company was; about eleven on Tuesday night I came to the lodgings of Mr. Jenkins in Holborn.</p>
               <p>What did you go there for? - In order to bring two hundred oysters, one hundred pears, and one hundred apples, according to order; I delivered them, and they gave a general satisfaction; I had no complaint; as soon as I had opened the oysters, I ordered my servant to take and clear all the shells and throw them away; then I applied for my money, to Mr. Jenkins; it was in the passage that I opened them; and he took me into a room, where there was nobody but me and him; I sat there for the space of half an hour; then I told him I must go to Billingsgate in the morning, and I should be much obliged to him to discharge me, and let me go home; then I applied again to him, and told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220087"/>would be very much obliged to him, if they would pay me; then he said they were at supper, and he could not speak to the master of the ceremonies; in short supper came out, and he asked me to eat a bit of supper with him; and I told him I could not eat any thing at all; I applied the third time; he begged I would not be angry, and he would get me the money; then Jenkins's wife went in and fetched out this Mr. Frazier from the room where they were dancing; she called him by his name; I knew no more of it; when he came out he called me every thing but a gentleman, a damned scoundrel, and villain, a damn his eyes if he would not knock my head off.</p>
               <p>What provocation had you given him? - None at all, I never spoke to the gentleman in my life; says he d - n your eyes you scoundrel, you have no business here; Sir, says I, I ask pardon, I was asked up here by Mr. Jenkins to be paid; I will go down immediately; and I got up to go down stairs; he kept swearing and cursing me, and saying he could have credit for five hundred pounds; Sir, says I, I have no demand upon you, I agreed with Mr. Jenkins for ready money; and I should be glad to have it, as I go to market; then when I came to the landing place of the stairs, he struck me over the eye, and knocked me from the top to the bottom; I dare-say, there were eighteen or nineteen steps; but luckily, as it pleased God, I caught hold of the rail, or else I cannot say what the consequence would have been; then he came down to me, and I got up; and he said d - n you, you scoundrel, what is your demand? Sir, says I, it is seven shillings the oysters, and two shillings the fruit; then he gave me, to the best of my knowledge, two half crowns, three shillings, and two sixpences; then when I had the money in my hand, he d - d my eyes, and bid me look at the money; accordingly I did look at it; then d - n your eyes you rascal, says he, you shall not have a farthing, and he gave me a blow over the nose, it spun of blood, and down I fell; and he took the money from me, and kept me down; one of the ladies had some humanity and mercy and came and took him off, and begged he would not murder me; my little girl cried murder; and as they were kicking me, I bid her call the watch; accordingly she did; then this lady came down, and took him round the waist, and begged for God's sake he would not strike me, but let me have my money; he said no, d - n his eyes if I should have a farthing; then he pushed me out of the door, and I called half a dozen watchmen in a very little time.</p>
               <p>Court. This was a gentleman that Mrs. Jenkins brought out, and called Mr. Frazier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know him again? - I do not know that I know him, but I think that gentleman in green is him; to my knowledge; I cannot say that I am sure; another gentleman struck me beside him, but I do not know him; I found out where he lives; I had not put up the money, I had it in my hand; he laid hold of the money with one hand, and struck me with the other; he took the money out of this hand; he took two half crown pieces out, and the other fell to the floor; I was down, my nose bled so, you would have been surprized.</p>
               <p>You had no demand upon him? - No, I made no bargain with him.</p>
               <p>Then by your account, he put some of his own money into your hands and took it away again? - Yes, I would have given it to him again, if he had asked me for it; he did not give me time to speak, I just clasped my hand, and he directly d - d my eyes; and I wished myself out of the company; his hand was not two inches from my face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. So you are a <rs id="t17881022-67-viclabel310" type="occupation">dealer in oysters and fruit</rs>

                        targets="t17881022-67-victim571 t17881022-67-viclabel310"/>? - Yes, upwards of six years.</p>
               <p>You have had no other business for the last six years than that? - Yes, I <rs id="t17881022-67-viclabel311" type="occupation">sell bread, fish, rabbits</rs>

               <p>That is the way you have got your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220088"/>bread for the last six years? - Yes, I mean to swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Then you have never acted as solicitor, within the last six years? - Solicitor! No.</p>
               <p>Carrying on suits, and hunting after causes, and carrying them on? - I am not admitted an attorney.</p>
               <p>You have never attended courts of justice, in the character of a man soliciting causes? - No, I do not say I have not, I say I have, I do not practice in any courts.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not you got your living the last six years in attending at the New Sessions House Clerkenwell? - No, Sir, I never attended there, I attended Mr. Jackson, whom I am with; he lives in the Fleet Market, he is an attorney; and he lived and boarded with me at that time.</p>
               <p>Then you acted as his clerk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then of course you never put your name to the back of briefs, as an attorney? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you never deliver a brief in your life, with the name of Ravenhurst on the back of it, as an attorney? - Never in any court; nor I never attended without Mr. Jackson; he never tried a cause; he has sued out writs; I never attended the prosecution of any cause in this court in my life; Mr. Jackson never had a cause here.</p>
               <p>You never attended any in your life? - Yes I have attended to some but not here.</p>
               <p>Where? - I attended one when Mr. Eccleston was the attorney, if you remember before the recorder of the city of London; I occasionally act for him, a friend of mine I recommended to Mr. Eccleston; you and Mr. Silvester were both employed, at the Sessions of Peace for London; the brief was indorsed Eccleston the attorney; he attended and I was there with him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that in the course of the last six years, that is the only cause you attended? - Yes, I do not recollect any other, I do not believe I ever did any where.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider, if he acts as an attorney, without being one, he is subject to the penalty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Perhaps in the course of the last six years, you may have had other occasions to attend courts of justice, have you been a good deal at Westminster, in term time? - Yes, I have been at law with my brother for fourteen years; every body knows me; I certainly have a good deal of law of my own.</p>
               <p>Is that the only business you have at Westminster-Hall, for the last six years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, how often have you justified bail, in the course of the last six years? - I do not suppose I ever justified bail in my life, I do not know I ever did within six years, I do not believe I ever did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively, that you never did? - I do not know that I ever justified bail in my life in Westminster-Hall; I do not know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Court. It will be mis-spending the time of the court, to go on further in this business, I have stated the whole of the evidence to the learned Judges, and they both concur with me, that however violent the assault, there is no pretence to charge a felony: the case is this; the prosecutor is employed by another, who was to pay him for his oysters and his fruit nine shillings; the prisoner, Mr. Frazier, who had nothing to do with the employment of him, and owed him nothing, comes out; attacks him, whether with or without provocation does not signify any thing here; d - ns him, abuses him, and beats him, he pulls out nine shillings and put it into his hand, then takes the money back; we are all of opinion there is no foundation for a felony, the assault was very improper and violent, he changed his mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. We were perfectly assured of this, but I venture to pledge myself, if you will only have the goodness to examine one or two witnesses, on the part of the defendant; I will prove this to be the most diabolical business that ever entered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220089"/>into the mind of man; and then your Lordship may grant us a copy of the indictment: Mr. Frazier is of as high reputation as any man in town; I wish it in order to shew you the depravity of the prosecutor's mind.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you any further witnesses? - Yes,

               <p>What are you? - Servant to Mr. Ravenhurst.</p>
               <p>Where did Mr. Ravenhurst live at that time? - In Blackman-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Now take care to speak the truth; tell us the whole truth and nothing else; if you do not tell the truth, you will be in danger of a prosecution; do not let any attention to your master, or any other motive induce you to conceal the truth, or go beyond it? - My master was in the house at eleven o'clock, he went with some oysters and fruit; the fruit was sent first, and my master and I went with the oysters; when we went with the oysters, Mr. Jenkins said, it was time enough yet to open the oysters, he did not open them; then afterwards he was called up to open the oysters, he opened them all; then he went up stairs and asked for his money; he asked Mr. Jenkins for his money; he said how much is it? my master said seven shillings the oysters, and two shillings the fruits that was nine shillings; he asked again for his money; they bid him stop, and he did stop; then the gentleman went into the dancing-room, and called a gentleman out; and he knocked my master all the way down stairs; when my master went to the bottom of the stairs he got up; the gentleman followed him; he asked him his demand; my master said seven shillings the oysters, and two shillings the fruit; he then pulled his hand out of his pocket and gave him the money, and d - d his eyes for a rascal; he said look at your money; he would not let him have time to look at his money; but he took hold of his hand that had the money in it, and knocked him down with his other hand, his nose spun blood; my master told me to scream out murder, and I did.</p>
               <p>What did your master say to this gentleman, tell the whole truth; did he say any thing to him before he struck him? - No, he did not; he said do not d - n my eyes Sir, d - n your own eyes; that was before he struck him.</p>
               <p>After the gentleman gave your master the money, what did your master say to him, when he had the money in his hand? - My master did not say any thing then.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, you know you have not heard your master examined, you was not in court; now the minute he got the money into his hand, what did your master say? - I do not think he said any thing; he gave him the money, and snatched hold of his hand that the money was in, and knocked him down, and his nose spun of blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long have you lived with this man? - Past three years.</p>
               <p>He is very good to you as a master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you breakfast with him? - Some times I do.</p>
               <p>So then of course, as you was coming here, you breakfasted with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he take care of you as you came along the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know he swore he did not know this girl was attending.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now as we have examined your master, we know a great deal more than he has told you; when you was up stairs with him, was you up stairs all the time that he was there? - I cleared all the oysters.</p>
               <p>Where was you when the oysters were opened? was not this man extremely drunk at that house? - No Sir, he was not.</p>
               <p>Did not he make a great noise, and behave very rudely, and the gentlemen there wanted him to go down stairs? - No Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is almost a shame to ask the poor child.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220090"/>Court. She is under the influence of this man so much, I think you will do better, not to lead her further.</p>
               <p>What age are you? - I am turned of sixteen.</p>

               <p>During that scuffle, where was Frazier; - Up stairs, I left him there dancing, and I was not two minutes below, when I went up stairs again, I found him dancing; presently, indeed it was, I believe, as I was walking up stairs, I heard a terrible loud rapping at the door; that was after the fellow had been turned out, and it was repeated often; I know that the oyster man was delivered over to the watch, on account of this noise, and rapping at the door; I also know that during the whole of this scuffle, and his being delivered over to the watchmen, Mr. Frazier was in the room; he might have stept out for all I know, the moment I was down, but I am positive sure he never was down at the door.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. May not I ask this gentleman a question or two? I have no counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. State them to the court.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. Do you remember Mrs. Jenkins's calling any gentleman out of the room to the oyster man? - No, I did not see her call any body out, but I understood she called out a Mr. M'Cree; I should suppose I must have been then in the dancing room, but I cannot just tell where I was.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the justice's the next morning when Mr. Jenkins declared it was Mr. Frazier? - I was not at the justice's at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Stockton. Was not you talking to Ravenhurst before he came into the court to day? - I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Then you saw him at the door, before he came into court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. I want the chief man, he is not here, his name is

               <p>M'CREE sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you was at this house? - I was; there was a little dance, and a dancing master; there were three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220091"/>four and twenty couple; I remember Ravenhurst being there that evening.</p>
               <p>What was the first part of the evening in which you saw him? - I did not see him till after supper.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he? - Some time after supper, after having finished a dance, in the hall room, Mrs. Jenkins came in to me, and told me a man was behaving very insolently, and riotously, in the supper room, and had frightened her, and begged of me to go out; I went out into the supper room, and found this man, Ravenhurst, sitting at the supper table, with his hat on; and speaking very insolently, and speaking to the ladies as they passed backwards and forwards; I went up to him, and asked him what he wanted? and he said nine shillings; I put my hand into my pocket and found I had not silver enough to pay him; he was going to follow me; says he d - n me, I want my money, and will have it; he pushed me on my left breast, in order to get into the room; I pushed him backwards by the breast, and that sent him two or three steps down the stairs, on his hands and feet; I went into the room without taking any other notice, and borrowed two half crowns, of the first gentleman I met; I went down, and I found him at the bottom; he said it was nine shillings; Mr. Jenkins, I believe, said it was only eight shillings; however, I said, I will give you nine shillings, if you demand it; I gave him three half crown pieces, a shilling, and a sixpence, and bid him to see whether the money was good; says he, tell me whether it is good: I could not bear this man's affronts without defending myself, I struck him, that sent him reeling against the passage; in order to save himself from a fall, the money dropt in the passage, I heard it fall; it was picked up by the girl; Sir, says the girl, when I struck him, my master will go; I paid him the money; Mr. Frazier was at that time in the dancing room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship permit us to call another witness, in order to commit this man.</p>
               <p>M'Cree. The door of the passage was quite shut, nobody was admitted.</p>
               <p>Who were the gentlemen of your party, that was present? - Mr. Jenkins the dancing master and Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Jenkins or Mr. Williams here? - Mr. Jenkins is here.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst to M'Cree. Was you the gentleman that Mrs. Jenkins fetched out of the room? - I have told the court I was.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room when you came into the room to me? - I cannot recollect who were there,</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. Nobody was there but you and me. - Mrs. Jenkins was reasoning with him at the time, he was thumping with his hat on the table, she told him the company had not yet settled the business.</p>

               <p>JENKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I understand you were the dancing master, at whose apartments these gentlemen and ladies met? - Yes; after supper I asked him, and his little girl, to sit down with the servants, to eat a little supper; he asked for porter; I desired them to help themselves; after some time, he saw some ladies coming out, whom he made some rude observations on; my wife said, what is the matter? she went into the room, and brought one Mr. M'Cree.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. M'Cree the person she brought out? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Was it Mr. Frazier? - No, it was not; he said nine shillings; says Mr. M'Cree, come out and I will pay you; the man went out of the supper room, to the top of the stairs, Mr. M'Cree, put his hand to his pocket, and went into the room; this man followed him in; says Mr.

            , you are not to come in here; the man turned round and said d - n me I want my money; he slipt down upon his toes, on the stair; then Mr. M'Cree went into the room; the man by this time was at the bottom of the stairs, and M'Cree, came out and stood on the two last steps of the stairs; the man held out his hand, and he gave him three half crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence; says the man, is it good? says Mr. M'Cree, make use of your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220092"/>own eyes, I am not obliged to look at your money; the man pushed him, and said, d - n your eyes, and a scuffle ensued.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Frazier in the passage, during any part of that transaction? - No, positively he was not.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Frazier take him by one hand, and take the money out of his hand, and strike him with the other? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any person take the money out of his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But in the scuffle the money dropt out of his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Mr. M'Cree. Upon the oath you have taken did any person take the money out of Ravenhurst's hand? - No, Sir, certainly not, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. How came the money out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Ravenhurst, Mr. M'Cree has already told you.</p>
               <p>Mr. M'Cree. In addition to that he was so completely drunk, that the smallest push I gave him knocked him down; I gently touched him, he fell down, he was so completely drunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When we have the good fortune to call such a witness, we need not trouble your Lordship with any other gentleman; Mr. Attorney General happens to be here on another prosecution.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Frazier? - Several years; I have had occasion to know him in two different capacities; first, as clerk to Mr. M'Kenzie, a wine merchant, with whom I dealt; and as secretary to a society, which is a large subscription; and I believe every gentleman of that society, beside myself, will say, that he is exceedingly honest, and a reputable man.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, Mr. Ravenhurst, you see that gentleman, Mr. Frazier, in green, and that other witness; now which of them was it that took the money from you?</p>
               <p>I told you at first, I could not tell; he did not let me look at him; if I was to die I cannot tell which it was; but the good woman swore before Mr. Walker, that it was Mr. Frazier; Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins's wife, I asked her in particular, what the gentleman's name was; when she was upon her oath, before Mr. Walker, and she told me his name was Frazier; I did not know the gentlemen or lady neither; and I wish I had not seen them then.</p>
               <p>Another thing; did she call the gentleman Mr. Frazier, that night? - Yes, she did say so; she went out and said, I will fetch Mr. Frazier, the master of the ceremonies; that gentleman that swore last, said he was to pay me</p>
               <p>She told you she would call out Mr. Frazier? - Yes, and he was the master of the ceremonies, and he would pay me.</p>
               <p>Did she speak, when she brought him out, did she speak to him, or call him by his name, after she brought him out? - No, I do not believe she did, for he would not let us stop a moment; he came as hot, as ever was a Scotchman; I expected I was not to live a moment.</p>
               <p>What situation was you in, when this person, that Mrs. Jenkins called, came out? - I was then sitting nigh to the door, and my servant girl was close to me; and there was not another soul in the room but we two, not at that time; they were all dancing; and a vast deal of company was gone; I suppose it was near two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Were you sitting at the supper table when he came out? - Upon the seat by the supper table, but I never tasted any thing, my servant did, but I did not; I was ordered to sit there by Mr. Jenkins, to be paid; and this gentleman was called out to pay me; I immediately went out of the room, and when I came to the top of the stairs, he knocked me from the top to the bottom against the rail.</p>
               <p>Then there was nobody in the room when that gentleman was brought out by Mrs. Jenkins, except you and your girl? - No, Jenkins was not in the room at that time; when he knocked me down to the bottom, there were several people there then.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Jenkins. Was you in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220093"/>room when your wife brought out Mr. M' Cree? - I was, and at the same time, I said to the man, how dare you sit with your hat on in this room?</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. I never had my hat on after I went up stairs; I never spoke to any man living.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence, I believe I need not trouble you with summing it up.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. May it please your Lordship, and you gentlemen of the Jury; I was brought here to serve these oysters, I did do it; after this I was beat; my money was taken from me; as for the gentleman that struck me, I did not know him; the lady told me at Mr. Walker's, his name was

Some of them I took out of the pawnbrokers, and some I stopt; I am sure all the books that I have here, he either brought me or sold me; I believe he first came to me about the 22d of September, and two or three days after, he brought me two or three odd volumes more.</p>
               <p>Did you keep these books by themselves, or mark them? - When he brought me some, two or three days afterwards, I had a suspicion, and I marked them; and the first I kept by themselves, as I always do, when I buy a lot; I put a cross upon them that I stopt upon him; after those I took out of pawn, there were thirty-two volumes of one sort, running numbers; and there were some odd volumes which I put my shop mark on.</p>

               <p>Are you concerned in carrying corn from the ships to Queenhithe? - Yes, any where; I am very largely concerned; I have a great many craft, and a great many hands; I have known the prisoner some some years; the prisoner was employed by one Goldhawk, a large master, to take the wheat from my barge higher into the country; he was so employed in January last; he came to my house and had his Christmas-box; I gave him half a crown; I put it on board the 14th of January, and in the morning of the 15th of January, I missed a sack of wheat out of my barge, which lay a long side the barge of Goldhawk's; there was only that one; it was about half past seven in the morning, when I saw my barge, a long side that barge; on the 15th of July I received information from one Clerk; I took him to Guildhall, and Alderman Curtis was in the chair, he examined him. This prisoner was then at Guildford on a trial; I got a copy of the indictment to take him; if he was cleared of that there; and we took him, he was taken there and nailed; and then he flew from his bail since, from that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220099"/>time till this; I did not see him till last Thursday; he came to my house about ten at night; and he came and cried, and owned every thing to me; he said he robbed my craft, and his master's craft; and one Cooke was the ruin of him; and that he took one sack of Mr. Ashby's; I made his bail take him away.</p>
               <p>Before this, had you held out any promise of favour to him? - No, he begged for favour.</p>
               <p>Did you hold to him any hope or prospect of mercy for any thing he should say? - No, I did not; Ashby's are Quakers.</p>
               <p>Should you know your sack, if you was to see it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. I suppose you have seen a great many hundreds of the same sort? - Yes. I cannot swear to the sack.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Field? - Yes, I know Field very well; he is a barge builder.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Nelson? - Yes, he is a lighterman.</p>
               <p>There was a word or two said to you, about a Mr. Cooke; what way of life is he in? - He is a barge builder.</p>
               <p>I believe this said Mr. Cooke happens to have some actions depending against Field and Nelson? - That I knew nothing of till to day, only what I have heard.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear it till to day? - Not the contents of it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never heard that Field and Nelson were defendants in actions brought by Cooke, till to day? - I have heard it in our market several times, but I never saw the actions; I had no business with any actions.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that these actions had stood for trial, for months past? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear any thing of it till to day? - Not that the trial would come on to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you know that that these actions stood for trial before the last sessions here? - No, I did not then; I have no business with any of their actions.</p>
               <p>Was you here at the last sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder, who now sits here, that these actions were standing in Lord Kenyon's paper, for trial? - I do not recollect any such thing.</p>
               <p>Oh, mighty good, mighty good. Will you dare to swear you did not hear me state that distinctly to the Recorder of London, who now sits as Judge. Were not you standing here, within three of me? - I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not standing within three of the people? - I was sitting there.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder of London, that that application was made in order that these actions might be postponed? - I do not recollect it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear the Judge say, that on that ground he would postpone the trial? - The trial was put off on account of their witness being out of the way.</p>
               <p>You know that was not the ground upon which it was put off? - I know he was not in the way.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, were they put off on your application, upon the motion of your counsel, and upon your own affidavit, Sir? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder, that that application was made, only because these actions were remaining for trial in Lord Kenyon's papers? - No, I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you did not hear that? - Yes, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard it this very sessions, within this week past? - No, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Was not you here when your counsel moved, to put off the trial of Mr. Cooke? - I certainly was.</p>
               <p>Was not you within reach of me at the time when your counsel moved to postpone the trial of Mr. Cooke to the next sessions? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state to the Recorder<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220100"/>of London, in the hearing of this Jury, that this trial was to be postponed again, because these causes were remaining in the King's Bench? - You never said any thing to me about the trials.</p>
               <p>Will you dare deny it? - I cannot recollect any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Will you dare to deny it? - I must deny it.</p>
               <p>Why it is in the memory of every man that heats me now; deny it if you dare, and I will indict you the next sessions; I will have you now tell me the day it was made? - Last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, upon last Thursday, did not you hear me (standing in the place I am now in) talk of these actions? - I have no business with these actions; I believe there was something mentioned; I am not interested in these actions.</p>
               <p>Did you hear me talk of them, yes, or no? - You was saying something to the Judge about them.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you hear me distinctly state, that the object of postponing Mr. Cooke's trial, was, that Mr. Cooke's action in the King's Bench might be tried? - I have nothing at all to do with Mr. Cooke; I am upon my own bottom.</p>
               <p>Court. You appear an honest man, in a reputable situation, without considering the consequences of the questions that are asked you; you should answer them? - I heard him say something about the trial last Thursday, but not before.</p>
               <p>How was it that you never heard of these actions till to day? - I said, I do not know what they are for; I have heard to day that they were actions brought by Cooke against Field and Nelson, for defamation; nobody applied to me to prosecute.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Neither Field nor yet Nelson applied to you? - No, never.</p>
               <p>You say, you obtained a warrant against the prisoner while he was at Guildford? - Yes, he was tried there for some wheat at the Albion mill, I heard; I do not know that Field and Nelson prosecuted this man at Guildford, I never heard so from them; I was not down at Guildford; I understood that the proprietors of the Albious mill prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Who acts as your solicitor? - His name is Lloyd.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, have you ever seen Mr. Lloyd on the subject, in the course of your life? - Yes, when I first employed him, and I saw him this sessions over the way, at the Bell; he has a clerk here, that attends him; his name is Turner.</p>
               <p>You know better, Mr. Lyon? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that that affidavit, that you yourself swore not three days ago, was in his hand writing? - Yes, I saw him write it.</p>
               <p>You was the prosecutor against Mr. Cooke? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you represent to the court, that this man was at that time in custody, and would be here by by five o'clock that day? - He was on the road, and was in custody of my bail; and was at my house that night? I lent his own bail three guineas to fetch him up.</p>
               <p>Who was present at the time he begged mercy! - One Mr. Berry; he is out of doors, a friend of mine, he happened to be at supper with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I mean to shew that this is a wicked and infamous charge against this man, for the sake of involving Cooke, who has two actions in the court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am precluded from mentioning the name of Cooke; I forbear to mention the name of Cooke; I think it my duty, when a man is discharged from an indictment, studiously to conceal from the court the name of the man.</p>
               <p>Court. As far as it is proper, and as far as it is admissible, the name of Cook may be brought in; but farther than that it would be wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. By whose advice did you indict these two people? - By my own, or else I should lose all my employ.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to any body that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220101"/>you never missed any wheat, and that you were very sorry you had got into the scrape of prosecuting? - I will swear that I never said so, because I had lost it.</p>
               <p>Did you never say, you had never missed any? - No, I never said so, because I did miss it.</p>
               <p>You never said so to Mr. Fosgate then? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - I do.</p>
               <p>You was present the other day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, after all that passed then, when it was by your own advice, that this indictment was prefered? - Sir, it was my own.</p>
               <p>Is not young Nelson here? - He may be; yes, I believe he is here.</p>
               <p>Did not he join with you in every affidavit that has been made on the subject? - No, I can not say he has, he has in some affidits, but all I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not young Nelson join one of the defendants in these actions brought by Cook, and join you in every affidavit you have made on the subject here? - Not in every one, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Did he join you in more than one? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you made any affidavits in this court, in which young Nelson did not join you? - I cannot; recollect that.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you made any one in which Nelson did not join you? - Upon my word I cannot say; I know there was an affidavit to move the court, there was two or three I suppose.</p>
               <p>Did you make any one in which young Nelson did not join? - I know there were some affidavits of young Nelson's.</p>
               <p>Are there any one in which young Nelson was not a party; young Nelson, I mean the son of one of the defendants? - He was at Guildford, and heard this man's confession, that was my reason for subpoening him.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have made any affidavits to the court, in which Nelson has not joined? - No, I cannot swear that, because there are five affidavits.</p>
               <p>Who else joined you in these affidavits? - I am sure I cannot give an answer to that; oh, Sir, Pedley, one of the bail for Akers.</p>
               <p>Who else is there? - There was Nelson one, I was two, I think there was five; upon my word I cannot tell their names, they are people that I subpoened.</p>
               <p>More reason by much to know who they are? - I do not know any one of the others names, they were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>What in a criminal prosecution against Mr. Cook, an eminent bargeman, as eminent as you, at least? - I heard they could give some informations.</p>
               <p>Did you ever read the affidavit? - I heard it read over; but I cannot recollect the names; one lives over the water, he kept a public house; I believe he did keep a public house by Mr. Cooke's.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that this man was tried at Guildford upon an offence to affect his life, for a crime committed six months before; that he was taken up the very day before he was tried, and acquitted, without calling any witnesses; and that he was instantly admitted to bail on your prosecution? - I was not there; it was at the prosecution of the Albion mills.</p>
               <p>Have you never been told so by your co-affidavit man, Mr. Nelson? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Was not it stated in the court, that they were imposed on, and were ashamed of the prosecution? - I know nothing at all about that affair.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that you sent down a constable with a warrant in his pocket, with instructions not to give it to the goaler? - I sent down a man with a warrant of detainer.</p>
               <p>Was not he instructed, in your presence, by one of your sollicitors, not to give it to the goaler? - I did not instruct him.</p>
               <p>Had not your constable his detainer in his pocket to deliver it to the Judge? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know that this man is a witness for Mr. Cooke in these very actions that are to be tried tomorrow?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220102"/>- I do not; I never heard so, never in my life, from Nelson.</p>
               <p>Do not you know this indictment was prepared in order to prevent his being a witness on these actions? - No, I do not, deny it.</p>
               <p>Now you have sworn, in the hearing of these gentlemen, that it was by your own advice that this indictment was prefered? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Recollect what passed here the other day; will you venture to swear that still, after knowing what was stated? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean still to swear that this was by your own advice? - Yes, it is by my own advice.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear me state that this prosecution was commenced for the sake of taking off the evidence? - No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear another person standing in court, whose name I will not mention, state that it was brought under his directions? - I employed Mr. Chetwood to assist me.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - Since July.</p>
               <p>Did not you, sitting in court, hear him state that this was commenced under his advice and directions? - What under Mr. Chetwood's? why yes Sir, Mr. Chetwood is employed; I was speaking of the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you hear Mr. Chetwood state in the court, that it was by his advice and direction; did not you hear that learned gentleman say, it was by his advice and directions? - I do not understand what you say; I was talking to him at the time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to state that you was talking to him at that time? - I believe I was talking to him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you never had a consultation at Field's house on this subject? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>You never was at Field's house? - Yes, I was there about three days ago.</p>
               <p>Since the sessions commenced? - Yes, last Friday; my business led me there.</p>
               <p>Was that after the trial of Cook was over? - Yes, the day after.</p>
               <p>Field is one of the defendants in the action that is to be tried to-morrow? - So they tell me; I heard so to day.</p>
               <p>Are not you a witness in that action? - Not that I know of; I have no subpoena.</p>
               <p>Have not you been told to attend tomorrow? - No, not that I know of; I have had no notice to attend; I have not been desired to attend; I do not mean to attend; I know nothing of the cause without I am subpoened.</p>
               <p>After Cook was acquitted here upon your prosecution, the next day you happened to be at Field's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing said about Mr. Cook and Akers? - Yes, I told them that Akers was at my house the night before.</p>
               <p>Who was present? - Pedley, the man that joined in the affidavit; I went in; there was one Artis there, he is another witness; nobody else as I saw; nobody else besides his wife.</p>
               <p>Were none of your lawyers there? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were they? - How do I know.</p>
               <p>Was not Field present at any consultation on this prosecution; has not Field been attending this sessions in order to wait for the trial of Cook and this man? - I never saw him in here yet.</p>

               <p>Have not you seen him at the public house in the Old Bailey? - Oh! yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Has not he been here every day at the public-house you have been in? - No, I deny it; I believe I saw him twice; I saw him to-day.</p>
               <p>How many hours is it since you saw him? - Three hours ago I suppose.</p>
               <p>This is the very Mr. Field who is defendant in the action brought by Mr. Cook? - Yes, I suppose he is like other people, come here to hear what he can hear, and to see what he can see.</p>
               <p>Did he happen to be present at any conversation about this prosecution, on the day after Mr. Cook was tried, when you and Mr. Chetwood were together that day? - I was not with Mr. Chetwood that day at Field's; Mr. Field was not with me and Mr. Chetwood that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220103"/>day; I saw Mr. Chetwood this afternoon; we have not been together to day.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - I might be in the house, not upon any business.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have you been together, yes or no? - I did not come here till seven.</p>
               <p>How many hours is it since you three were together? - Near an hour; I saw Field about seven o'clock.</p>

             went in, and he carried in the sack on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Did you see what was done with that sack of wheat? - Mr. Cook held a sack of his while the other sack was on Mr. Akers' shoulders; and these three put the wheat out of that sack into Mr. Cook's sack, and set it behind the door; other people saw it besides me, whom I can mention. After the wheat was just out of that sack William Akers put it under his arm, and shut the door, and attempted to chuck it into Mr. Cook's loft, and it fell from the loft into the street, and I took it up, and have had it ever since; here is the sack.</p>
               <p>Did you know the person of Akers at that time? - Yes I knew him, I had seen him often before that.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by any body in the hearing of Akers at that time about the sack? - That very evening Mr. Cook said to Akers, I heard him say so; I am speaking what I know of my own knowledge, and nothing else he said to Akers, where did the wheat come from, d - n my blood, says he, where did the wheat come from, out of Lyon's barge, says he, d - n my blood, says he, that is right, bring as many as you will, and I will give you half a guinea a sack for them.</p>
               <p>Did you see Akers go after this? - He went out of the skiff; into Morris's causeway; young Clarke was then waiting for him in the skiff; I did not see which way they went, whether up or down the e.</p>
               <p>Did you see Akers at any other time? - Yes Sir, on the 18th of February; I saw him bring another sack on the 13th of February; the skiff came into Mr. Cook's yard; I saw

             bring another sack; and he was with Akers, and deposit it under the barge's bottom.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body say any thing on that occasion? - Some of Mr. Cook's men held the candle, but who they were I do not know; I know very well that they were Mr. Cook's men, they were employed by him.</p>
               <p>Did Akers or Clarke, in the hearing of Akers say any thing on that occasion? - Akers went in to Mr. Cook as soon as he delivered it; and some time after I heard him say, in the course of a quarter of an hour, Akers was along with Mr. Cook in the road, close by the house.</p>
               <p>Did Akers say any thing then, or did Mr. Cook say any thing then to Akers? - Akers then told him he took it out of Lyon's barge, I did not hear any reply.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It was no secret whose barge it came from? - Only Mr. Lyon's barge; that was mentioned publickly and openly, two or three times over.</p>
               <p>How came you to begin by saying that you came to speak the truth, and nothing else, how came you to call out whore first? It is an aukward thing when a man's conscience lies in his face and he thinks every body suspects him? - I mean nothing else but to speak the whole truth.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I keep a chandler's shop, and sells coals, and that is all at this present time.</p>
               <p>What was you before? - I was a sawyer formerly to many persons and before that I was a coach wheeler. I was a sawyer to Mr. Cook.</p>
               <p>Did not he discharge you? - No.</p>
               <p>What was that dispute about stealing the nails and the stuff? - I never heard any such thing; I took a chandler's shop, and left him freely and willingly; he never charged me with any thing; he and I parted very friendly. Do not you speak more than you know, for I shall not. I do not come here to be brow-beat by any body.</p>
               <p>How came you not to lay this information before?</p>
               <p>Court. When did you first mention this? - The first information that I laid was at Sir Sampson Wright's, a good while ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220105"/>Do you hear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why do you not answer the question? - The first information that I laid against this very indictment - I have not the day down particularly, I cannot recollect the time; I am sure I do not recollect the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Was it the 15th of January? - No Sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>The 16th; you are an honest man I suppose? - No man ever alledged any thing against me.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose as an honest man you discovered it in the month of January? - No I did not.</p>
               <p>Then I suppose you discovered it in February? - No.</p>
               <p>Not even then? - No.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in the month of March? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did your honesty rise up for half a year for you to give evidence against this man? - I think it was some time in January; no I am wrong now.</p>
               <p>What made you discover it at last? - For the good of my king and country.</p>
               <p>Then you kept it a secret for the good of your king and country all January, all February, March, April, May, June and July? - I do not think you are far off the month now. Am I obligated to tell you the time.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes you are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You kept the sack snug all this while? - Yes.</p>

             I was subpoenaed up on the piece of business. I heard of the actions some time standing.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, man, when you gave the first information of this upon your oath, and I advise you to take care; do you mean to swear that you laid your information before the magistrate before ever you heard of the action brought by Cook against Barrett? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you tell us when it was that you first thought proper to lay this information? - When I was first subpoenaed.</p>
               <p>How long was that after the action was brought?</p>
               <p>Then you never laid any information till after you was subpoenaed as a witness in these actions? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not usually keep sacks of other people's? - I never did before.</p>
               <p>You was subpoenaed before August then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>These causes stood for trial in July, you know, at Westminster hall? - I was not there.</p>
               <p>Why you was seen at Westminster hall? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not there? - Yes; I was never subpoenaed at Westminster hall, I was to the Old bailey.</p>
               <p>When was that? - In the last sessions.</p>
               <p>Then am I to understand that you never gave any information till the last sessions? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>What before last sessions? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - Some time before then, I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say you never was examined against either Mr. Cook or Akers till the month of September? - Oh yes! before then long enough; I was examined before Sir Sampson.</p>
               <p>And you told the whole then as you have now? - No Sir, quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>Yes, but it was about stealing sacks? - Yes, but it was another part of the business; that was another indictment.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say when you was examined before the justice against the prisoner and against Mr. Cook, you told but half your story? - I told nothing of this piece of business, this is quite another piece of business; I was examined as a witness, that was another affair.</p>
               <p>Did you charge them with this robbery? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>How came you not to charge them with this robbery at that time? - Because that was since January; it was another piece of business; it was not brought from the same place.</p>
               <p>What was the oath you took then before the magistrate; was not it to speak the whole truth against the prisoners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220106"/>The man was tried in Surry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you examined to all you knew against the prisoner? - No, only to that very fact, that it was about then.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say this, that at that time you had the sack, you knew of this offence, and you never charged him with it before the magistate? - No, Sir, this sack was not concerning that business that I went before Sir Sampson Wright.</p>
               <p>How came you not to charge him with it, was it not the same day? - That was the 15th of January in the morning.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell before the justice the whole that passed on the 14th, if it was true? - I know it was the same day, the 14th of January, I do not dispute it.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not the 14th of January? - No, I will swear it was the 14th of January, of the Albion mills business, in the morning; and the landing was at Morris's causeway.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, will you swear that? - I have swore it before Sir Sampson Wright, that that landing was not at Morris's causeway.</p>
               <p>Will you swear now, that in your information before the justice, they did not charge this man with bringing a sack to Mr. Cook's on the 14th of January from a skiff, and landing it on Morris's causeway? - No Sir, it was not done so, on my oath; it was not at Morris's causeway.</p>
               <p>Or did you discribe yourself standing at the time? - You are sensible I did not take that oath.</p>
               <p>Good God of Heaven! where did you describe yourself as standing? - In Mr. Cook's yard.</p>
               <p>Then you did not say that you was standing in Morris's causeway? - I was sitting there the same morning.</p>
               <p>Did not you describe yourself as standing. at Morris's causeway, when the Albion mills were taken? - I believe you are rather too sharp upon me; I believe you would, if you could; I was down at the causeway, to be sure, when I heard the boat coming up with the wheat, and my curiosity led me to see what was going on, it was in the morning about six, or between five and six.</p>
               <p>Will you give an account, will you give some reason to the gentlemen, why, when you was examined against this prisoner, and against Mr. Cooke, for a charge of receiving a sack on the 16th of January, and at the time you had the sack in your custody; why you kept that secret, and laid nothing of it? - It was not a piece of business of that indictment; it was about the Albion mill business.</p>
               <p>Will you say this, that you did not charge him with it, because it was not the charge against the prisoner? - It was at Guildford.</p>
               <p>Was you the person that brought down the warrant? - No.</p>
               <p>You know of his being tried before Lord Loughborough? - I do not know any thing of that; I was in court, and was not called in court; I was before the Grand Jury.</p>
               <p>How came you not to prefer the indictment till September; because you had had the sack in your possession ever since January? - I was here last sessions.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go before a magistrate and make this charge? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Did you ever attempt to prefer your bill, till after his acquittal at Guildford; and that not till September sessions last? - I never was before any justice here.</p>
               <p>You was in Surry? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard this man tried? - I was not close enough to hear what Loughborough said.</p>
               <p>Court. I think I understood you to say, that when Clarke and he brought the two sacks on the 13th of February, on Morris's causeway, Akers went into Cooke's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And each of them put the sack under the bottom of the barge; Clarke and Akers? - Yes Sir, they did indeed.</p>
               <p>Then Akers went into Cooke's house? - Yes, they both went in.</p>
               <p>And then I think you said, in about a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220107"/>quarter of an hour, you saw Akers and Cooke together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you say, it was, that Akers told Cooke, that the wheat came out of Lyon's barge? - Yes, about a quarter of an hour after.</p>

               <p>Did you hear the prisoner say any thing on that occasion? - He begged for mercy, and said he would throw himself entirely into the hands of Mr. Lyon; that he hoped he would shew him mercy.</p>
               <p>Did he say that he should shew him mercy for? - No, he did not; he said he would throw himself upon Mr. Lyon's mercy; and that old Cooke was a villain; and he was the man that led him into the error; that was all I heard him say.</p>
               <p>Before he said that, had Mr. Lyon said any thing to him to induce him to talk in that way? - Not any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That old Cooke had led him into the error? - Similar to that.</p>

               <p>I believe the prisoner came there with one of his bail? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your friend Lyon had paid the expences of one of the bail? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I am very sorry the brewhouse should be deprived of your services, they must be very important, I will not detain you any longer? - You are very obliging; I wish you a good night.</p>

             and I took a sack from Mr. Lyon's barge; and we carried it up to Morris's causeway; I helped him with it; I saw a man standing against the wall; says I, there is a man stands to watch us; says he never you mind that; Cooke opened the door, in we went; Cooke held up the sack; Akers shot it into the other sack; I helped it up behind; after that, he gave me a glass of Hollands; and I was ordered out of the house directly into the public house.</p>
               <p>Whose sack, and whose corn was that? - Mr. Ashby's; it was in Mr. Lyon's barge, at Paul's wharf in London: The next time, was the 13th of February; we took a sack of malt from Mr. Lyon's barge; and a sack from Mr. Randall's barge; both together; we took it to Mr. Cooke's; Akers and me; I stepped in the water, and he heaved; one of the men took hold of my shoulder and helped me up; the barge was building on Mr. Cooke's premises; I am sure Akers was the man that did it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Well, Sir, why they say you are a very bad man? - Yes, it is to be hoped this will be a great warning to me.</p>

               <p>When did you give information of this? - In July, before the alderman; I was examined before that, before the justice in in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the justice, in Bow-street, all this story? - I was not taken up; I came forwards myself; I told him the whole story from beginning to ending.</p>
               <p>You mean to swear, that you gave the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220108"/>same account about this sack, in Bow-street, that you do now? - Not as to particulars.</p>
               <p>Did you give the whole account of all your iniquity in Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you mean to swear that positively? - Not the account of all.</p>
               <p>Will you swear, that you said one syllable about stealing this sack from Mr. Lyon's barge before the justice, in Bow-street? - No, I did not mention it.</p>

               <p>Court to Lyon. What is the reason you moved to put off the trial of Cooke, and gave no evidence against him on Thursday last? - Because the two witnesses were out of the way.</p>
               <p>What two witnesses? - One Culloon and Ivey; and another thing, the prisoner was on the road coming up.</p>
               <p>Why did not you proceed against Cooke, upon your own evidence, and that of the two witnesses that have been examined? - I thought I had not witnesses sufficient without Ivey and Culloon; it was he that gave evidence before alderman Curtis; he was taken by Pedley: The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character; one of whom was Mr. Goodhawk, to whom the prisoner had lived servant four or five years.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Lyon say, whether he should appear, or give any evidence against him? - No, the next morning I took him down to Mr. Lyon's house; I took him first over to one Mr. Field, who is a little concerned in this matter; Mr. Field did not care much to see him; I took him to Mr. Lyon, and told Mr. Lyon that I thought it was a hardship to bring him up so far after the promises we had made; the promises were, if he would come forth against Mr. Cooke, Mr. Lyon would do all in his power to clear him; these promises were made me, before I went into the country; I had three guineas the last time, and six guineas before.</p>

               <p>Who furnished you with the money? - Mr. James Lyon.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the prisoner before? - I went to Poole, in Dorsetshire; but I did not find the prisoner; when I brought him, it was express under that promise of Mr. Lyon's; I carried him to Mr. Lyon the next morning, which was Friday morning; I took him to Mr. Lyon, and another person of the name of Booth; and Lyon and Booth went to Counsellor

               <p>Where was that? - At his own house, the other side of the water, somewhere by Union-hall, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to that gentleman? - We went with the prosecutor, to consult on the best manner of acquitting the prisoner at the bar; the words between Mr. Lyon and him, were, whether he could not come into court without any evidence against him, and then be acquitted, in order to come and be an evidence against Cooke, in another indictment.</p>
               <p>What was the answer to that question? - Mr. Lyon came out, and said to me, they were to meet at the Rummer, on Labour-in-vain hill; and there he was to consult about the business; that he was to come into court, and have no witness about him: we went to Mr. Field's, with Mr. Lyon, to acquaint him of the consultation; he damned Mr. Chetwood, and said he had been robbing of him, and putting his hand into his pocket, and taking his money from him; and he would have the advice of Mr. Fielding; we went away from there, and expected to meet them at four, according to their appointment; at eleven Mr. Field came over to my house, and brought Mr. Lloyd's assistant; they insisted on having the prisoner; I told them that Mr. Chetwood their own counsel, had given me to the last day of the sessions, to surrender him; I said I would surrender him at three o'clock, which I did:</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Lyon the man you have been speaking of? - That is the man, I swear positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was the prisoner in any employment at Poole? - Yes, in the dock, and received wages.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that the prisoner went out of town, entirely to prevent his being taken on this indictment? - I cannot say how he went out of town.</p>
               <p>Did he never say so to you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I say that is a most - I will not trust myself to say what it is, it is a question that never was put to the bail of any man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you never said to any body that the prisoner was kept out of the way, and supported by Cooke, to prevent his trial on this indictment? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Will you be positive you never said so to any body? - I am only saying I supposed it to be so; I could not have any other thought, when the man did not come on his trial.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say so to any person, that you believed the man was kept out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220110"/>way by Cooke? - It is very likely I may have said so.</p>
               <p>Court to Lyons. Upon your oath was you with this man at Mr. Chetwood's and Mr. Field's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say that they came too late, that Cooke was acquitted? - I never said so; he swore he would be d - d if he did not keep him till the last day, and surrender him; the man begged for mercy, I told him I could not say any thing about mercy, he must take his trial.</p>
               <p>What did you go to Mr. Chetwood's for? - To get his opinion about this man's coming.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then the application about this man, the evidence, came from Pedley? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes; I gave the money to bring him up.</p>
               <p>Court to Pedley. Is it true that you applied to the prosecutor to admit the prisoner a witness against Cooke? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Lyon. Did not you, after this conversation, go to Mr. Fielding? - Yes we did.</p>
               <p>Did not you appoint four o'clock to meet him, at the Rummer? - We did at first, but we contradicted it.</p>

               NOT GUILTY
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>As soon as the verdict was given Mr. Chetwood thus addressed the court.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I would not trouble you till the verdict was given, but I beg leave now to observe, that Mr. Lyon and Pedley, and the witness, called at my house on Saturday morning, the purport of their business was, knowing that I was a friend and acquaintance of Mr. Lyon, he had told me that he should be ruined by this recognizance he had entered into, and that he was sent out of the way: Mr. Lyon upon that, and to save his recognizance, and to bring back the prisoner, I believe, supplied him with money. Last Monday morning Mr. Lyon and Pedley came to my house to take my advice: Pedley there proposed to me that if it would be of service, for he said, though I have been bail for him, it cannot be imagined that I would go from one end of the kingdom to another to bring a man to be transported; no says he: he swore he would not. Is it possible, says he, to make Akers (for I have him in my custody) a witness against Cooke? It is impossible, says I, he has been before the Grand Jury. Then, says Mr. Pedley, I will be d - d if he shall be surrendered, for it shall never be said that I coaxed him to London to transport him. It was then mentioned, that as I think one Wilson had been concerned in this robbery, was it not possible to indict Wilson, and make Akers an evidence against him? No; says I, no such thing can be done; no tricks can be played in a court of justice. Mr. Lyon said I, I have nothing to do with it, I am to try to bring these people before the court. Pedley said, can you devise any way in the world that Akers can be made an evidence? Says I, there is no such thing as doing it. Sir, says he, would the court acquit him if he was to come to the bar and acknowledge his guilt, and charge Cooke? I said, God forbid any such thing should be done. This was the conversation with me, whether by any possibility Akers could be made evidence against any body else, as Pedley swore he should not be transported, as he had brought him to town.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Chetwood has done very right in coming forward, as his name has been publickly mentioned; and I must say he has done very right also in mentioning this at a time when it could not affect the the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. I waited till the trial was over, my Lord, for it would not have become a man that had been consulted and concerned to say any thing pending the trial: there is Mr. Pedley, he knows what I have said to be true.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. There is one circumstance in this cause; there has been too much of mystery and management in the conduct of the prosecution, too much seeming connection with other business, which had nothing to do with the administration of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220111"/>justice here: the effect that has produced on your minds has been, you have taken the cautious line, and if the prisoner is guilty, the prosecutor must thank himself.</p>

               <p>Did you taste them? - Yes, before I made the seizure. After I opened the door I found some Rum, Gin and Brandy; I took part of them across the way to the house of Jones, the publican, for security, as I had no boat to carry them away: I had seized the whole 60 anchors.</p>
               <p>What happened? - There was a large mob surrounded the door, and made a line for our people to come through, across from Jones's house to Prouse's, where I was: I stood at the door putting the broad arrow on them, and handing the casks to our people, to carry them across to Jones's; the prisoner at the bar was among the mob standing at the door; he was using a good deal of ill language; he said hold of one of the casks and was carrying it off. I am positive he is the man. I secured the keg and took it from him again; I presented a pistol to him, and told him if he did not put the keg down I would shoot him; he let it drop to stave it, I caught it by the slings to save the fall, and it was not staved; I then told him not to meddle with any more, for if he did I should shoot him. He did not attempt any thing more then till all the kegs were out of the cellar. When they were all out, one of my people called to me to come in to see that they were all out of the cellar: I went in to the passage, and left my assistant,

The stones were five or six pounds weight, some more and some less. We secured him in a small parlour; then the mob came and demanded him of me: they desired me to turn him out that they might kill him; they called him an informing rascal; I told them they could not expect any such thing while I was alive; and they said they would have him dead or alive. I was kept in that situation 4 hours. When they found they could not get him by fair means from me they knocked all the windows, front and back, in upon us: I saw the prisoner then at the window; when I could look round I could see him in the mob with the rest of them.</p>
               <p>What distance was he from the window? - Sometimes five or 6 foot, sometimes close: I did not see him heave any thing then, my attention was chiefly taken up at the door: I did not hear him say any thing; I was guarding the door. They kept us in that situation till I got help from the Custom-house, then we sallied out and carried him on board a vessel; I searched the other houses the next day: I could not search them then because my people that I had left to guard them houses were obliged to come down to join him.</p>
               <p>Then you could not execute the duty you came about? - No Sir, by no means.</p>
               <p>Did Felton receive any blow that you know of? - He certainly must, because I know his leg was bruised, and he could not walk some time afterwards: I received a blow with a large stone: I believe that was principally the object that was meant, to obstruct us while they carried off the goods.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw the prisoner taking one of the anchors, and afterwards about five or six feet from the window: did you see him at any other time? - I saw him when I came out of the house among the mob.</p>

I know the prisoner, his name is Edward Trough; I saw him at that time; he stood in the mob some time, then he took hold of one of the kegs that was in my custody, and was going away with it, and Mr. Bradley told him to lay down the kegs or else he would shoot him: he was going to heave it down, Bradley caught, hold of it to save it from staving, and he let go: and when Mr. Bradley caught the keg he opened his bosom, and said d - n you, you b - r, fire now: he continued abusing all the time.</p>
               <p>Were there any other persons assembling about him? - Yes, a great number; there might be a hundred or more, collecting all round as a mob: the man called down to Bradley to see that there was no more kegs in the cellar: he went down: I was still inside, with one keg between my legs: and these two kegs were without the door; the prisoner took one off Mr. Bradley's shoulders and put on

               <p>Among these people that were following you, and obstructing you, did you see the prisoner? - No, not at that place; when first I saw him again, it was at Jones's, a public house; I saw him with a great stick in his hand, threatening what he would do to me, if he could catch me; that was after I had been rescued from the mob; the rest of the boats crew and Bradley rescued me; he had the stick up in his hand, and was moving it backwards and forwards; says he, I will have the b - r out; if I catch him out, I will cut him in pieces; that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220113"/>I am very sure was said by the prisoner; he came to the window, and hallooed to me, and said, you b - r, I will have you out; I saw him all the time in the mob; now and then he came into the entry, and tried to rush into the parlour; he was very active in the mob; I continued about four hours in the parlour of Jones's house; the noise, and mob, and tumult, continued all that time, and was more increased; nothing more happened, that I observed from the prisoner, we got more assistance from the Custom-house; and got on board a Custom-house cutter.</p>
               <p>Was you hurt, in consequence of this? - Yes, I was hurt in the leg; and all my arm was quite black, by the stones that they have; I did not see this man heave any stones.</p>

            , that the name you went by, was not your real name? - Upon my oath, I never told him my name was any thing else but Cole.</p>
               <p>What name did he go by? - Hardman.</p>
               <p>He did not go by a nick name? - Upon my oath, I never went by any other name; I did not write the name of Cox, in my book.</p>
               <p>Did not some of you beg of us to keep the door shut, from the multitude of people that came demanding of money? - I swear that Hardman desired the door to be shut, on purpose that he might not be exposed.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. Was you at liberty to depart during that time? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner's Counsel. Freshfield came afterwards? - I really cannot tell which came into the room first, I was so intimidated; I do not know there were four came in.</p>
               <p>How many more than four? - There were no more than four, except Hardman and me, after the room was cleared; there were a great many people in the office; and then we were turned out; I cannot recollect who came in first; they might be all in the room before I saw one of them; being such a multitude of people; I never saw Freshfield before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- MARRIOTT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am employed at the assay office; I was informed that Cole was in custody; I went to the office immediately; there were about two hundred people about the door, and a coach waiting; I could not get admittance; this office was up one pair of stairs; I came, and the door was locked; I got in through the other house, and went up stairs; I knocked at the door where the officer and the clerks were confined; the door was opened of a jar, and I saw Mr. Foresyth, and one Mr. Newman, and Mr. Freshfield; Foresyth I understand is since dead; I did not see Wilson at first; I have known Freshfield a great while, and desired to speak with him; there was Mr. Cole, and Mr. Hardman; I was not admitted into the room the whole time; I particularly requested Freshfield; I told him I had a friend and a relation of mine, in custody, in that room where he was; I told him he had lived well in his life time; and had been in better employ, and I was very sorry to find him in that situation; I asked Mr. Freshfield what could be done? he told me he was only coming by; he had nothing to do with it; here were three constables; if he could render me any service he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220115"/>do it; nothing else passed; he went immediately into the room where the prisoners were confined; he came out soon afterwards, and returned for answer, that they would take ten guineas to discharge the prisoner; that he had consulted them; and they would settle it for ten guineas; I brought eight guineas, and gave it to Mr. Freshfield, and desired him to see if that would not do for their releasement; Mr. Freshfield went into the room again, and staid some time; he returned again seemingly angry; and said that they would not take less than the ten guineas; and that I had much better get the other two guineas, for they would not take less; I gave him the other two guineas; he went to the other constable again; and in a short time he returned with Mr. Foresyth and Mr. Newman, into the other room; I then went into the other room; they brought a tankard of porter into the room, and asked me to drink; he said every thing was settled; I then went into the other room, where the prisoner was; then I saw Mr. Wilson, never till then; Mr. Foresyth came into the room, and followed me; and immediately says to Wilson, lay down them papers and books that you have, and come along with me, every thing is settled; there is nothing to prove; we can prove nothing.</p>
               <p>Who else was in the room? - One Mr. Hardman, four constables, and Cole; not till the business was entirely over.</p>
               <p>Did you hear from any one of these constables, what their charge against Cole was? - I did not hear any particular charge, any further than that he was detained as a rogue and vagabond; the first that came out to me was Newman; and Freshfield told me he was detained for doing business contrary to act of parliament; that the officers had three or four in custody; he had nothing to do with it himself he said; there was no appearance of any riot or disturbance in this room, every thing was very quiet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Freshfield told you he was coming by, by accident? - He did.</p>
               <p>You looked upon him as a mediator? - I did.</p>
               <p>It was Foresyth asked you to drink, and said, lay the papers down? - That was addressed by Foresyth to Wilson; Wilson had some papers.</p>
               <p>Freshfield. Did any body binder your going into the room, do you recollect? - I do not know that they did.</p>
               <p>Did I desire you to get the other two guineas? - You appeared very angry with them, that they would not take the eight guineas.</p>
               <p>You have known me for years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What Character did you look upon me to have? - A very good one; I never knew any thing of him, I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Did not Cole go by the name of Cox? - I believe he might in the office.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I knew Mr. Cole by sight, I knew Marriott. On the 21st of February last I was in Aldersgate-street, and saw a mob of people about a lottery office; I went up stairs into the one pair of stairs room, the door was upon the jar, and Freshfield stood at the door with the door in his hand; I pushed into the room, there I saw Freshfield; I recollect Newman and Foresyth; I did not take Notice of Wilson: I asked what was the matter, and was informed there was an information against the office; I think it was Newman that told me; it was in the hearing of the others; I was then going out at the door, and Freshfield stopped me, and asked me if I belonged to the office, I told him no; and he turned about and asked Newman if he knew me, and he replied that he knew me by sight; accordingly Freshfield let me out: he stood with the door in his hand, and locked the door and opened it: after that I went down stairs, and I saw Mr. Marriott; I came up stairs and I saw him behind Mr. Freshfield in the back room, and I endeavoured to hear what they said, as I concluded they were going to make it up; but I saw that Freshfield avoided me as much<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220116"/>as possible: Marriott went down stairs and left me and Freshfield in the room together; I went up to hear how it was to be settled; I went into the room, but I could not hear the particulars of what they said: Freshfield told me he was very sorry to come there on such business, but that the other officers met him and obliged him to go with them; and he said he thought it was better to make it up than let the young man go to gaol, for he said the person who gave the information had a policy, and could swear to it.</p>
               <p>You are sure Freshfield said that? - I am: after that Mr. Marriott came up and gave him eight guineas, which I saw and heard: Mr. Marriott, in the presence of Freshfield, asked me to lend him two guineas, I told him I had not so much money, and he went down stairs and brought up four half guineas, and I saw them deliver up a parcel of papers and books, and things.</p>
               <p>Did you see where the officers went afterwards; - They went down stairs, I did not see them after I left the office.</p>
               <p>Did you see who delivered up the papers? - Newman delivered up some papers, and I believe Foresyth did, but I cannot positively say to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Boxley. I understood you that you did not know the persons of these two men? - I cannot say I know their persons, there were two hundred sworn that day, and two men of that name appear, by my minutes, to be sworn that day.</p>
               <p>To Cheesewright. You went of course into the front room; has it a door leading to the back room? - It has not; Freshfield was sitting inside the fore-room, and the door in his hand; I endeavoured to hear what they said but could not.</p>
               <p>And you give us this reason for it, that Freshfield purposely avoided you. - It seemed so.</p>

               <p>Then how do you account for this, that the very man who avoided you before should come up to you and say as you have said? - I cannot account for it, but so it was.</p>
               <p>You are landlord of this house? - No Sir; I did not let the first floor, it was let out, but unknown to me; I formerly, before Christmas, lived in these apartments; the man of the house had his goods seized on, and I moved out; I supposed I was to pay for the quarter though I did not reside in the rooms; but while I was gone to my new apartments the landlord of the house let them to the lottery office, without my consent.</p>
               <p>In what situation are you now? - I am a master taylor.</p>
               <p>I believe you was clerk to Blackburn, who kept one of the insurance offices? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>When might it happen to you to be so?</p>
               <p>Court. You are not required to answer any thing respecting yourself after the month of March last.</p>
               <p>For a few days before March last; I have acted so for an acquaintance, but I had no emolument for it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was going by the office when they were there; after I had been there a quarter of an hour I saw Freshfield; he was there I suppose settling the business; I saw Wilson there, I did not see him do any thing there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. I wish to ask Mr. Cole whether any person all the time came near me, or whether any thing was mentioned of me during the whole time I was there.</p>
               <p>Court to Cole. You was in the room all the time with these constables? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I think you say that Freshfield and Foresyth went out at different times? - They did so.</p>
               <p>The question is this, whether when Freshfield particularly came in, or Forsyth, they held any conversation with Wilson respecting any money? - I did not hear that any money did pass till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. Can you recollect that I went out of the room at all? - He never was out out of the room at all.</p>
               <p>Do not you remember when Forsyth came in and gave me charge of the two prisoners? - I cannot positively say to that.</p>
               <p>Did they take Wilson into any part of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220117"/>the room out of your hearing, so as to hold in private a conference? - I cannot recollect that they did.</p>
               <p>Court. What is become of Newman? - He was not a constable at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a question which a good deal imports the public, and therefore I shall send for Newman.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>Give me a true answer; You, I understand, was one of the persons who went to the lottery office to apprehend the clerks of the office? - Yes, I went under the command of Forsyth.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Foresyth, Wilson, and Freshfield.</p>
               <p>Freshfield. Did I go along with you? - I did not see him go in with us, he went with us to the house as one of the officers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Freshfield called six witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND, which is a sufficient Instructor of itself, is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also his Publication, entitled,</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System of ShortHand;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Short-Hand Alphabets, and</p>
               <p>"two Extracts by way of Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No. 35, Chancery Lane, will receive immediate Answers, and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law and others; immediately attended to: Addressed to Mr. Hodgson, at his House, No. 13, White Lyon Row, Islington, or left for him, at No. 35, Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on Mr. Hodgson's Plan, wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing: Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice, (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last sixteen Years, which he will dispose of; or any person wishing to see any particular Trial, may have an spection of the same, or take a Copy of it, at the usual Prices.</p>
