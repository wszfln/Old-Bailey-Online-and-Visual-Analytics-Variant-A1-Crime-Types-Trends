               <p>Dolling. He had the same clothes he has now, the other was a lustier man than he a considerable deal; he offered to send for a man, he called him his partner, to give evidence where he was at the time of the robbery; the woman would not go, we offered to let him go, and we would go with him; then he would not go, and said he had no partner belonged to him; he said he was either at the Spotted Dog at Westburn-green, or the Red Lion; we gave him liberty to go to either of the places, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you enquired whether he was at either of these houses?</p>

            . I am a watchman; I was going by Mr. Perry's window the night of the robbery between twelve and one o'clock; there came a man to me and asked me to let him light his pipe by my lanthorn; he asked me if any body was up; I said they were at the Angel; said he, will you drink part of a mug of beer; there came another man up at the time he was lighting his pipe; they went to the Angel, I went with them *; they called for a pot of beer, I staid and drank once with them, and then went about my business; when I came to the Pied Bull bench I saw something under the bench, I thought it had been a cat; I went to look, and found seven china bowls there; I took and carried them to my apartment, this might be about two o'clock, and about three I went round again, and found a great white drawer, I carried that home; as soon as I came back again I met a woman going a milking, she had found another drawer, I took and carried that home; when Mr. Perry gets up, which is generally about three, I usually go in for a dram or a pennyworth of beer; I went in that morning, and found he had been robbed of the bowls and drawers.</p>

               <p>* This should be a caution to watchmen not to neglect their duty, to go to drink with strangers at that time of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge of the men that took you in to drink?</p>
               <p>Good. I think he that asked me to drink, by his face and his wig was Dollanson, the other had a darkish coat on, and looked something like a smith.</p>

On Sunday the 28th of August in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070008"/> afternoon I was going out; before I went out I looked in my till, there were thirteen guineas and a moidore; in the evening when I returned, between eight and nine, I missed four guineas; I enquired where the prisoner was gone, and was told he was gone to take care of a horse; I got a constable; when the prisoner came home I got him into the parlour, I asked him what money he had in his pocket; he said he had none but his own; I said, I was sure he had more, for no body had been at the till since I went out but himself, and desired he would pull his money out; upon which he pulled out three guineas and two half guineas; I had marked the money in the till before I went out, with a scratch over the nose on the head; the three guineas and one of the half guineas were so marked, which the constable put in a piece of paper, and put in his pocket; I thought I had marked every guinea and half guinea in the till, every one of them left in the till were marked; I think I left the till locked when I went out, and at my coming home I found it unlocked; I usually kept it locked.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did the prisoner give of this money found in his pocket?</p>
               <p>Russell. He told me it was the first time he ever attempted any thing of that sort, and hoped I would not hurt him.</p>

Mr. More; I said, your servant; I never saw him before in my life: pray, said he, do you make watches and sell watches; I said, yes; said he, pray what might I have a good one for; I said five guineas, six guineas, or four guineas; he said, pray have you got a good second-hand watch; I said, yes, I believe I have; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070013"/> out of the chandler's shop through the kitchen into my watch-making shop, and took a second-hand watch and brought it out in my hand to him, and desired him to step backwards and I would shew him one; I asked him who recommended him to me, as he had my name so pat; he said it was a dyer in Fashion-street, but I did not ask his name; I asked him where he lived, he told me he lived in Bishopsgate-street, I think he said at an oil shop; then I shewed him the watch, he looked at it, and asked me the price; I told him two guineas and a half; said he, is that the very lowest; I said it was; said he, will it go well if I have it, and clapped it to his ear; I told him it would go very well, and as he was recommended, here is another 10 s. worse, you may have that if you will, but I put the best into your hand, and that watch that I would not recommend I hung up again; said he, use me well, because if you do I shall want another for a brother I have in the country, and if you use me well I shall come to you for another; then he said, I tell you what, have you got some silver chains or silk strings; no, said I, I don't much deal in them, but I believe I have got one; he looked into a glass-case, there hung some ladies chains, and also several watches; said he, let me look at some of them chains that hang there; I told him they were ladies chains; I had got a silver chain in my bureau, which I turned myself, and unlocked and shewed it him, and told him the price of it was 7 s. 6 d. he said he did not like it, it did not make shew enough. In the same drawer I had two or three steel chains which I had not thought of, I shewed him them; he looked at this chain, (producing a steel one) and asked the price; I told him 18 d. said he, I tell you what, as I did not beat you down in the price of the watch you shall give me the chain in, and besides I shall buy one for my brother, I may be a better customer to you; said I, I will not stand with you for that, you shall have it; said he, I tell you what, put the watch by for me, I did not think of buying a watch when I came out, so have forgot to put some money in my pocket; I took the watch and chain out of his hand, and laid the chain on the board and the watch by it, it had only a catgut string to it; there they lay for some space; he did not speak nor I did not speak; I wanted to go about my business up stairs, I was ashamed to bid him go away, as he said he would come again, I thinking him a customer; he stood close to my elbow; I turned round to go away, thinking he would follow me then to be sure; he did follow me out of my watch-maker's shop into my kitchen, in a little space where I stopped to let him pass by me to go out; at going out he said, Mr. More, be sure you keep the watch for me; yes, yes, said I, you may be sure of it; I then went up stairs, and was gone up I believe about ten minutes; my daughter was cutting bread and butter for tea; when he went out, she rang the bell for me to come down to tea; I came down and stepped into my watch-maker's shop again, there lay the chain upon the board as before, and the watch was gone; I said to my daughter, this rogue has stole the watch; no body had been in the shop but myself and he, and he was the last person out.</p>

               <p>More. After he was taken; as he denied having it I thought I might meet with it at some pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a watch in his pocket when you stopped him?</p>

I live with Mr. More, I am his daughter-in-law, my mother keeps a chandler's shop, and I attend it when she is not in the way; I was in the chandler's shop, the prisoner came in and asked me if I sold watches, this was on Thursday the 11th of August; I said, yes, Sir; I rang the bell for my father; the prisoner asked me what my master's name was, I said More; when my father came down the prisoner said, your servant, Mr. More, do you make watches or sell watches; my father went into his shop and said, yes; he came out and asked the prisoner to step backwards with him in the work-shop; my father went in first and he followed him, and I went into the kitchen to cut bread and butter for tea; the shop lies on one side of the kitchen, we go through the kitchen into the shop, I sat opposite the shop-door; I saw my father come out and the prisoner follow him, and went away; my father went up stairs, and came down again in five or ten minutes, it may be more or less I cannot say, I had rang the bell for him to come to tea; I never removed from my seat till I rang the bell, and nobody was in the kitchen but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any body could be in the workshop between the time of your father and the prisoner coming out of it, and the time of your father coming down stairs again upon your ringing the bell?</p>
               <p>S. Cope. No, Sir; when my father came down he went into the work-shop as he always does; he came out again, and said the man had stole the watch; I said, I wondered he should come out and leave the man to follow him; he said he could not bid the man go out.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Mr. More's name over his door?</p>
               <p>S. Cope. There is a board describing his trade, but there is not his name upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the chandler's shop situated?</p>
               <p>S. Cope. That is at the corner of Crown-alley, Moorfields, and no body can go out of the chandler's shop to the shop where the watches are kept without coming through the kitchen, and I sat with my face to the watchmaker's shop-door; they are two different shops, two different houses, the door that goes into the watchmaker's shop is very seldom open, it is generally bolted and locked.</p>

When the prisoner was taken up he was taken to a public-house; there were some gentlemen there said, if he had the watch he had better deliver it again, or he would get into trouble; they asked him what countryman he was, he said from Leeds; I observed he had a watch in his pocket; he said he had it of a shop-mate the day before, and that he had it to try how it would go against Mr. More's.</p>

               <p>Resback. I am a stay-maker, and live in Norton Falgate. I was with Mr. Edmonds on the 14th of August; Mr. Edmonds said to the prosecutor, what a cruel man you must be in depriving and keeping the young man confined so long, in keeping him from sending for any of his friends; Mr. More's answer was, he thought himself not at all to blame in this matter, but more his friend, for he wanted him to pay for the watch, that his friends might not know any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before or after the prisoner was committed?</p>
               <p>Resback. He was committed before this conversation.</p>
               <p>Edmonds. He refused him even pen, ink, and paper, I mean that he would not suffer him to send for his friends, on the Saturday night when he was taken into custody about five o'clock, and was kept at a public house.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did Mr. More say he said the oil-shop was?</p>
               <p>Resback. He said at an oil shop in Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Edmonds. Mr. More acknowledged the young man told him he worked with Mr. Debarty in Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. More mention what time it was he told him that?</p>
               <p>Edmonds. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Resback. When the young man came home on the Thursday night the 11th about five o'clock, he told me he had been to Mr. More to cheapen a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where Mr. More lived?</p>
               <p>Resback. He had asked me whether I had any objection to his going to Mr. More to buy a watch; I asked him how he came to know Mr. More; he said there were golden letters over the door; I said I had no objection, I did not know Mr. More.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to do about his buying a watch?</p>
               <p>Resback. Because he had a great necessity to buy one; he asked me the name first; I said, I believed the name was More, his name upon a sign, but not in golden letters.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Resback. This was on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say his name was there, or did he tell you so?</p>
               <p>Resback. He did not tell me, I knew it was there; the prisoner was just recovered from a fever, and the apothecary and his friends desired him to take a walk out into Moorfields, and he took a walk frequently two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Resback. He has a very deserving character as any man in the world, I never saw the fellow to him, he is a very diligent man; when he came in at the door he said, now I discharge you of calling me up in a morning, for I have bought a watch; I asked him if he had left any earnest for it; he said, no, but he had left word where he lodged.</p>

            .

I believe they had been removed out of their place in the night, they lay in a heap together: upon this alarm I began to think where the robber could get in; I went down the kitchen stairs, all the parlour-windows seemed to be fast; I observed the back kitchen-window was open, the upper sash was down, there appeared on the inside and outside ledges the print of a foot very clear, from thence I conjectured a person might get in there; I then sent for a watchman, and told him I had been robbed, and should be glad if he could give any account of any thing he had seen that might lead to a discovery; he said to me, Lord bless me, Sir, between two and three o'clock this morning a man came out of your house to light a candle; he told him he might light two if he pleased, he is here, and will give the account himself; I had at that time no man servant; this unhappy prisoner had lived with me in the year 1761, I believe he then might be 16 or 17 years old, he left me in April 1762; I could make no discovery, till on the 2d of August, about nine at night, or rather before, all of a sudden our maid came screaming up out of the area, and said, there is a man in the small-beer vault; I immediately unbolted the street-door, there were two chairmen, I desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070023"/> them to come in and assist; one stood to see that he did not get over the rails, and the other went in at the area-door; I stood at the top of the stairs, the chairman brought the prisoner up to the head of the stairs; I did not then recollect him, I asked him what business he had there, who are you, and what are you; he looked down, and said, his hat was throwed or blowed off, and he got over the rails to get it; I said, it would have looked better had you knocked at the door for your hat; he said, he was afraid of disturbing of me; I asked him what his name was; he said his name was

Dixon, a friend of mine, my name is Manners; I told him every thing his property should be returned him, but I had been robbed lately, therefore I should expect a good account of him before I parted with him; upon searching the place where he lay this instrument was found (producing a new tap-borer;) he was asked if it belonged to him, he denied it then; a person happened to come in, and said, Lord bless me, this is the young man that lived with you at the time of the coronation; I said to him, did you never live with me, and if he did not come from Lincoln; he said, no; I said, I believe you are the person; he was then carried to the watch-house, and the next morning before Mr. Welch; when I came there, I said to him, Will, I am very sorry to find you here on this occasion, you have very ill rewarded my kindness to you; he then acknowledged he had lived with me, and that he came from Lincoln, and his name was

His hair stood up, it was frizzled by the sides of his face; after that he came out of Mr. Stubbs's house again, and said, watchman, can you tell me where I can get a bit of candle, my master is taken ill, and I do not know where to find a bit of candle in the house; I said, if you will take mine you are welcome to it; he had my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070024"/> bit of candle, his coming without a hat I thought he was Mr. Stubbs's servant; he asked me if I would be so good as to go and light it, my candle was out then; there was a woman sold faloop just by, I went over to her, and light it; he took it, and carried it in, and shut the door after him; he said, watchman, when you come upon your stand at night I will make you drink; in the morning I heard that Mr. Stubbs had been robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. What money had your father about him?</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>In regard to this charge, I shall in the sequel satisfy the court and gentlemen of the jury that it is an unjust charge; this man says he had the misfortune to lose his money in this manner; I am taken up on the account of being in his company over night upon suspicion; the money that was found upon me I worked very hard for in time past; I was committed money less to prison without evidence against me; but to give an account of the scope and tendency of this unjust charge, it is as follows. On the 14th of July last I went to work at a cutler's shop, I usually earn 15 d. after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070027"/> two o'clock; I met a woman that I had been acquainted with, I took her to the Coach and Horses and had a pint of beer; we were there above an hour before this man came in; he came in, she being singing he called for a pot of beer, and after that two or three more; he paid his reckoning, and I paid mine; there was an odd pint, I paid it; the girl says she paid for six pot, that cannot be true; he went out with me and went up the street, supported by this creature; I parted with him directly, and went to the barrack between eleven and twelve o'clock. The next morning I suppose he missed his money; the next morning I was taken up, upon suspicion of taking this money; my Lord and gentlemen, because there was some money found which was my own undoubted right and property, that I saved up, intending to get a furlough in order to carry me on my journey to my own country and friends; thus I am accused with taking it from the man: in regard to this half guinea that is mentioned, that some soldiers said I had secreted in the barrack, why have they not these witnesses here; but they have no regard to me because I am a Scotchman; it is impossible to think I should secret half a guinea, and keep the rest of my money in my pocket, this half guinea I lost. Now, my Lord, upon the whole was it probable, this man lost two guineas in a purse, and that purse in a handkerchief, and I to take it, and neither purse nor handkerchief to be found upon me; it might have dropped out of his pocket, or the woman might have taken it from him, as that girl was importuning him for money; why is not that other woman taken up and searched for the purse and handkerchief, she was in company as well as me; how is it possible I could rob him of his money, there is no proof against me, neither by oath or party, or evidence of witness; it is very hard because a man is possessed of money that is his right and property, that he should be taken up upon suspicion, when another man loses his money. The prosecutor says we both went out of the public-house together, his daughter says I went out a considerable time before him; he says he paid for my reckoning, she says she paid for six pots of beer; he says he missed his money in a short time after he parted from me, the girl says it was two hours and a half after; the boy says he was extremely drunk, the daughter says he was a little the worse for liquor, he was not drunk; they say I was shewing my money, a man has a right to flash his money; but why did they not bring these witnesses here, here is no proof produced; thus I humbly submit my case to your Lordship and the jury.</p>

               <p>Q. Could he be honestly worth a guinea and a half, or two guineas?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I know at times he has saved a trifle, then he would break out and spend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever remember seeing him have a guinea?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I never did to my knowledge, he might be worth more.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you generally know the saving men, and those that spend their money?</p>
               <p>Wilson. We do; he would save a trifle and then break out and spend it.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not hear I lost half a guinea?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There was half a guinea found about his bed, but he did not make a complaint of losing it till it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner to prosecutor. Mention the pieces of gold and silver you lost?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had a guinea, a half guinea, and the rest in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. to R. Abbott. Can you tell what pieces there were?</p>
               <p>R. Abbott. I know there was one half crown piece.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Egham; I was called upon to examine this child, on Friday the 26th of August, about noon, I found there was a very great discharge at her private parts of the venereal kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was venereal?</p>
               <p>Barrel. I am positive sure of it, I have attended her, and given her medicines ever since till she came to town, she is not yet quite well.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of medicines did you give her?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Such as I generally give in venereal cases, and they have had the effect as they have in venereal cases, and the child would (I believe) have been quite well, had she been at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not children sometimes runnings from these parts, occasioned by strains and other occasions, that are not venereal?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Had the discharge been from any laceration, it would have been of a different quality.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the inside of the part?</p>
               <p>Barrel. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any extention of the part?</p>
               <p>Barrel. There had been no laceration made, the internal part was affected with the disorder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for a man to lie with a child of eight years old, without an extension or laceration of the part?</p>
               <p>Barrel. No, it is not possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070030"/>Q. Do you think a man's applying his prepuce to a girl of that age, might give her the foul disease without penetration?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Yes, the disorder is communicable, if the two parts touch one another, the disorder may be emitted by that means.</p>
               <p>Q. If the child had been penetrated two months ago, must not her parts have been so uneasy, it must have been discovered by the weakness of the parts?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Yes, it would.</p>
               <p>Q. If a child had been forced by a man, must it not be immediately found out?</p>
               <p>Barrel. Yes, it must.</p>

               <p>Butterfield. That was about the 11th of August; the prisoner brought them to Duke's-place; he was gone with a Jew to get some of the coral beads out of pawn while I was there; he coming to my brother's, my brother's wife said I might buy them as well as any body else; the Jew got them out of pawn, and he was to buy the whole lump, but he would not come to my brother's-in-law; the prisoner left them all with me in Duke's-place; I gave the Jew a guinea to get the beads out of pawn; he promised to come to my house, but never came.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you offer the prisoner for the whole of the goods?</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 20th of May was twelve months, the prisoner pledged this with me, (producing a table-cloth,) it was during the time she was Miss Elliot's servant; she pledged it as the property of Miss Elliot.</p>
               <p>Miss Elliot. This table-cloth is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give the prisoner directions to pledge it?</p>
               <p>Miss Elliot. No, I never did, to pledge any thing of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. to Priestman. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Priestman. I live at the corner of Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. As you knew the prisoner lived there, how came you to take it in?</p>
               <p>Priestman. She made a genteel appearance, and she had pledged things before in Miss Elliot's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there no other Miss Elliots besides this Miss Elliot here in court?</p>

               <p>Court. You said Miss Elliot's name was in your books.</p>
               <p>Priestman. Miss Elliot's name never was in our books as I know of, but on the account of what this prisoner had pawned for her; there was another servant told me she came in Miss Elliot's name, but they were all redeemed before this time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I frequently went to that pawnbroker; the first thing I ever pawned was my mistress's pair of buckles and rings, to the value of six guineas; I lived with her almost three years; the next thing I pawned was her diamond solitaire for ten guineas; the next was a cross and a pair of diamond ear-rings for five guineas, these were all pawned to Mr. Priestman; I have pawned them diamonds more than once or twice either; the last things that were pawned at his house were a gold necklace, some ear-rings, and a cross, for 30 guineas, about twelve months ago, since the table-cloth was pawned a great while; I pawned the tablecloth for Miss Elliot's use, as I did all the other things; she ordered me to make money of something, and I did not know of what to make it; I pawned that for a guinea, very often we had nothing better in the house, without it was linen; I cannot positively say whether I gave her the guinea whole, but she had it; she never made no odds, when I had money she had it, and when she had I had it; the thirteen huckaback towels belonged to the man I lived with, named W. Langley; I don't know how he came by that marked with the letter H and a coronet, nor that marked E 6. I had a sister lay in there, and I took care of her the time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Priestman. Do you remember the prisoner pawning buckles and rings to you for six guineas.</p>
               <p>Priestman. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her pawning a diam ond solitaire for ten guineas?</p>
               <p>Priestman. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her pawning a cross and a pair of diamond ear-rings for five guineas?</p>
               <p>Priestman. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her pawning a gold necklace, some ear-rings, and a cross, for thirty guineas, after this table-cloth was pawned?</p>
               <p>Priestman. I do not remember she pledged them, whether they were pledged by the prisoner, or who.</p>

            . My stand is in Gerrard-street, I saw the prosecutor about half an hour after one that night, he came to me as I was between Gerrard-street and Princes-street; he asked me if I would drink a glass of gin; I thanked him, we went to the Two Blue Posts; by the time we had drank the gin, the clock struck two, then the two girls at the bar were standing by the door (I knew them before;) I went and cried the hour, and left him there; about ten or eleven in the forenoon I was told the prosecutor had been looking for me; he came again in the afternoon, and asked me if I knew the two girls, saying, they had robbed him; I found them the Sunday after at the King's Arms; I said to Tine, Sal, you must go along with me to the watch-house; one of them said, I suppose it is for robbing the man; I called another watchman to my assistance, they went very quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor drunk or sober when you first met with him?</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Give an account of what you come here about?</p>
               <p>Morris. I was going out of Oxford to <placeName id="t17680907-63-crimeloc340">Tyburn-road</placeName>

               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Morris. This was about nine at night, or a quarter after, I can't tell to a minute, on the 30th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a woman there?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, I did not to my knowledge, not till after I came to myself again; then I saw several men and women; I was bruised so that I could not feel any thing at all, nor could I cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Morris. I had had a pennyworth of bread and cheese and two pints of beer, and an acquaintance had part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell where you live?</p>
               <p>Morris. I live in Charles-street, Soho, near Brownlow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morris. I never saw her till after she was taken up.</p>
               <p>- Jays. I am a pawnbroker; this watch was pawned to me by the prisoner for a guinea on the 2d of August, (produced in court and deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>

I speak rather under than over, both times such sort of money as in the indictment; the first time I left my breeches on the floor, the second time I put them between the pillow and bolster, and the next morning I found them behind the board next to the head-cloth; I came down stairs, and asked my wife if she had taken any money out of my breeches-pocket for change; she said, no; I had not told her what I missed before; I told her the last time I believed I missed 25 or 26 l. I went up and examined all about, but found nothing; I concluded it was by some body in the house, the man lay in the garret; my wife said he went to bed when she did, and he had not been up stairs before he went to bed; she recollected that the prisoner went up stairs once after I was in bed; I got a constable, and called her aside into the dining-room, and said, here is a most terrible affair happened last night, and likewise that day week before, I have been robbed; robbed, said she, of what; I said, of a good deal of money, God knows whether you are guilty, if you are innocent I shall be sorry to charge you with it; she said, as to me I have no money, but a 5 s. 3 d. and some halfpence, which I had from the last place I was in; I said, I suppose you have no objection of being searched, you and your box; said she, I will go up stairs, and you shall search me to my shift; I said, that is not decent for me, my wife shall go with you; she said, with all my heart; I called my wife, and said, go up with her, and see if she has any thing about her; my wife refused going; then I sent for a neighbour, she came; I said to the prisoner, Hannah, there will be no indecency in my seeing what you have in your pocket; she said, no; she took off one pocket, and emptied it out, she did not seem inclinable to take off the other; immediately she took out what she had in her pocket, and held it in her hand, and turned her pocket out, she was for returning her hand to her pocket again; I said, put that down on the table which you have in your hand; she did, there were a 5 s. 3 d. some half-pence, and a 9 s. piece; I said, you told me you had only a 5 s. 3 d. and some halfpence; this 9 s. piece gives me a deal of reason for suspicion, tell me where my money is, that I may have it again, and you may meet with more favour; if it should be found upon you, you shall go about your business; she said she had not got it; I said, how did you come by the 9 s. piece; she hesitated a little, and then said she received it for wages at her last place; I asked her where was the last place she lived at; she hesitated, and said, she did not know; then she said, I forgot myself, I remember I was out before I came to you to buy me some things, and there I had this 9 s. piece in change; she had no sooner said that, but she said I was out on a Sunday at Mr. Dickey's, and he gave me change<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070043"/> for half a guinea, and in that he gave me this 9 s. piece, that was where I had her character from; I said, you tell so many various stories, I believe you are the person that has my money; she still persisted in it that she knew nothing of the matter; the gentlewoman being by, I said, go up stairs, and let them see what you have about you; they were gone up about twenty minutes; I went up, I said, have you found any more; they said, no; I heard her making a good many protestations, saying, I have not got it, I have not got it; I said, no, not about you, but you know where it is; while I was thus talking, my son called me down, I went down, there the constable said, here is your money, I have found it in the copper-hole in the yard; I took the money of him, and went up stairs, and said to the prisoner, here, do you know this, holding it up to her; said she, I am glad you have found it, I am glad you have found it; said I, do you know any thing of the taking it, it was wrapped in a coarse cloth; yes, said she, I do; I said, did you take it from me last night; she said, yes, I did; I said, did you take any money from me this day week at night; yes, she said, I did; upon that I said, I do not know what quantity of money you did take, but upon opening the cloth I said, that was like this; she said, I told the money the first time, which was 9 l. 13 s. 6 d. and what I took last night I do not know, for I did not tell it; she said, there is half a guinea among it that is mine, and all the silver, and a 6 s. 9 d. piece, but the 9 s. piece I had in my pocket, Sir, is yours. I talked to her a good deal, I asked her how she could think of committing a thing of that kind, not only a first, but a second time; she said she did not know, but hoped I would forgive her, and let her go about her business; she having been out on the Sunday, I asked her if she made away with any of my money then; she said, no, she had not, there was all my money; she went down on her knees, and asked forgiveness; I said, no, if the law will forgive you I will.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was there of it when you told it out?</p>
               <p>Harris. There was 23 l. 4 s. 8 1/4 d. that was the whole, with the money she demanded; I put it all together, and took her before the Alderman, there she confessed the same, and told the Alderman the half guinea and silver were her own; then the Alderman said, give it her, which I did; then she said a 6 s. 9 d. was hers; the Alderman said, you go on, but I will grant you no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the pieces?</p>
               <p>Harris. There were four guineas, ten half guineas, two 18 s. pieces, seven 13 s. 6 d. pieces, eight 9 s. pieces, five 6 s. 9 d. pieces, one 5 s. 3 d. two 4 s. 6 d. pieces, four shillings and four-pence three farthings. I should be glad if she could meet with mercy.</p>

On Monday the 1st of August my servant came up to my bed-chamber, and told me my house was robbed; I immediately got out of bed and went down stairs; I missed these articles mentioned in the indictment, all but the handkerchiefs and buckies; the spoons had my crest upon them, the other silver had my arms on them without my crest; they were taken from the side-board in the parlour; I immediately asked my servant how I could be robbed; she said she believed I was robbed about four in the afternoon, the day before; I believe the thief came over your garder-wall, and in at the dining room window; said I, what makes you think they came there; said she, the glass that was against the window I found on the floor; I said, where was I then; said she, you was then walking in the garden, but she said she then thought it was a dog came in; I took out a warrant on suspicion, and had her to Tothil-fields Bridewell; upon putting on my shoes I missed my buckles; I recollected I had put my buckles on the side-board on the Saturday night; when she gave up the charge of the linen, there were two handkerchiefs missing; I was soon told the thieves were found out, which to the best of my memory were brought before the Justice that day, that is Bush and Crookhall the evidence; there they both confessed the robbery, and mentioned the other prisoner as the receiver of the plate.</p>
               <p>Court. Give an account what Bush said.</p>
               <p>Morgan. When Bush had told of the robbery we did say he should be admitted evidence, but as the other boy sold the plate to the receiver, it was judged best to admit him.</p>

            . I was along with Bush at the time this house was robbed; there were only he and I, it was on the 31st of July on a Sunday, about four in the afternoon; I sent Bush to Capt. Morgan's to ask if he wanted a servant (that was to see whether he was at home,) there was a person did live servant there, that had a brother that used to go out a thieving, and he told me the way to get into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had Bush and you been acquainted before you robbed this house?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. I ran away from my father and mother, and he ran away from his master; we had been together about three days before we did this; I told him of this place, and sent him to knock at the fore door: the maid looked out at a two pair of stairs window, and told him the Captain was gone out, and would not be at home till night, and he might call again in the morning about nine; we went round to the back of the house, and over two walls; I lifted up a little window, there was a glass stood against it; I took hold of that, fearing it should make a noise and disturb the people, and laid it down, and got in at the window; Bush was leaning over the wall belonging to Capt. Morgan's house; I got into a room, it was a sort of a kitchen where dirty linen lay; then I went up into a one pair of stairs room and opened the parlour door, and took out two waiters, six tablespoons, two marrow-spoons, a head of a punch-ladle, and a large soup-spoon; out of the next room I took a pair of metal buckles, coming down stairs I took two silk handkerchiefs; I came out and wrapped the two waiters in them, and handed them over the wall to Bush, and the other things: then we went to Slavin's house in Rosemary-lane; I sold the two waiters to him for two guineas, and the spoons for two guineas and 5 s. 3 d. I sold the buckles to a man the Monday following for 18 d. near Temple-bar; one of the handkerchiefs I kept myself, that I lost, and the other Bush had, that he gave away.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of the money had Bush?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. I gave him a guinea, he did not require any more.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Slavin's?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. I had been at his house before.</p>

               <p>Crookhall. He is a shoe-maker, and keeps a sort of a shop, and sells handkerchiefs; I sold all the plate to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to his house?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. We got to his house about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after you had been there?</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Morgan; I missed the plate on that Monday morning; on the Sunday I went up to make my bed, there was a lad knocked at the door and asked if Mr. Morgan,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070045"/> wanted a servant; I told him it was not a proper day, but bid him come on the Monday at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. My master was at that time gone into the country; I told him my master was out; when the boy came into Bridewell where I was confined, I knew him again; I asked him whether he was not the boy that came and knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Morgan wanted a servant; he said he was; then I went to the keeper and told him, and he sent for the boy, and the boy confessed that Crookhall was with him; then they went and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate was missing?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. There were two salvers, eight spoons, a soup-ladle, and the head of a punch-ladle; I believe my master's buckles were in the other room upon the table; the two handkerchiefs were in my master's dressing-room even with the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the boy knocked at the door?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. I was up in a two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. I believe it might be about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you certain to the boy when you saw him in Bridewell?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. I would not then be positive to him, but I believed him to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the boy say?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. He said if I would not hurt him he would confess the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make him?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. I said I should not hurt him; then the keeper sent for him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the keeper say to him?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. I did not hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in that two pair of stairs room after the boy spoke to you?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. After that I sat in that room some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. No, I did not; when I saw the sash open, and there were dirt in the window, I thought the dog had jumped in.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you observe that?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. I believe I observed that about eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the linen lie?</p>
               <p>E. Bunn. That lay in the kitchen on the dresser, but I believe the handkerchiefs were left in the dressing-room, they were soul handkerchiefs.</p>

            . I belong to Tothil-fields Bridewell; I apprehended Slavin on Wednesday morning the 10th of August, in his own house; Crook-hall went with us to shew us where he lived; I told him I had a warrant against him; we took him to Tothil-fields Bridewell, and then to Justice Wright; the Justice granted a warrant to search his house, we found nothing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Crookhall say any thing to him?</p>
               <p>Wright. Crookhall told him he bought the plate of him that very night of the robbery about six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Slavin say to that?</p>
               <p>Wright. He said he knew nothing at all of him, he always said he knew nothing of the boy; Bush said he went with Crookhall to Rag-fair and staid there, but was not with him when he sold the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Crookhall. What conversation passed between you and Slavin when you sold the plate?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. I told him I was very hungry when I went in; he brought some cold breast of mutton, and I eat a great deal of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house at the time?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. There were two men there; one of them took the plate, and they went backwards and looked at it; he gave me 18 d. in brandy mixed with a little water, which he sent out for to the next door but one; he was to sell me a watch for part of the money; he advised me to break out of prison when I was there, and come to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. He was taken up the day after I was; then he asked me why I did not run away when I was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of Rosemary-lane is Slavin's house on?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. His house is on the right-hand side going from Tower-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the sign where you had the brandy?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. I think it is the sign of the Black Horse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070046"/>Q. Who fetched it?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. He went himself, and a girl brought it.</p>
               <p>Q. How big is she?</p>
               <p>Crookhall. Much about my own size; that house is over-right the sign of a man on horseback, where is wrote on it Cornfoot.</p>

            . On Sunday the 24th of July I was in the yard, I heard these two boys playing with the chain; a gentleman called out, Hunsdon, Hunsdon, I wish you would see after them lads, they have got the chain off; I got up a ladder and looked over the wall, and saw Gouge with a chain done round his arm, going to run away with it; they seeing me, the other boy said to him, d - n your eyes, drop the chain, run, run; I jumped from the wall and ran after them, and took them both, and brought them back to the chain where they had dropped it; I found they had been beating the hook of the other chain; I led them away with the two chains about their necks to the beadle's house; they owned as they were going along that one of them was going for a file to get it off, and that they had been beating it with a stone or a bone to get it off; they had got the hook off, but had hung it on again in order to fetch that chain at night.</p>

            . On the 24th of July about three in the afternoon, I heard a rattle of the carriage; I looked out at my window and saw Gouge unhook the fore chain; he went away and came again; Cox was in the carriage; they began to beat the other chain with a stone or a bone, they broke two or three stones at it; then one said to the other, here, d - n you, pull; they both pulled hard at it, it broke off, and they both fell in the kennel; then they put it to again, and said it will do till dark, then it was half an hour past six; they went away, and came again about half an hour past seven, and began to unhook the chain from the carriage; Gouge wound up one chain round his arm; then I called to Mr. Hunsdon, he got up upon the wall; the boy dropped the chain and they both ran away; Hunsdon jumped off the wall and ran and brought them back.</p>

               <p>Cox's defence.</p>
               <p>We had been swinging on the chain and it broke, then the man jumped off the wall, and said we were going to make away with it; they wanted to make it up for money.</p>

Mr. Hunsdon sent for me twice to his house, to ask me if the money was ready; I told him I could not get it ready till this day a little before ten o'clock, this was last Friday morning; he said then he must cast him; he said, if we brought him 15 s. he was a liveryman of the city of London, and it was only speaking to an Alderman and he would clear the boy; he drank six pennyworth of brandy with me on the account of clearing the boy, this was at the Pied Bull in Spitalfields-market; or he said he must ask for money of Mr. Trueman and must cast him.</p>

No; these two men came to my house when I was at dinner; they desired I would be kind enough to let him go, we had not then been before the Justice; they said, pray, we should be glad to be informed about these boys; I said, you must go to the caravan and you will see part of the things knocked off; they went; I went and listened at a hole in the wall, and heard them say it is too true; I said, I believe it is; they answered and said, yes, it is.</p>

            . I am a chairman, my stand is at the corner of King-street and Bury-street, I do not know the day of the month, this all happened on one day; I was sent for by a little child to a perfumer's shop to go of a message for a gentleman, there I found the prisoner, he was writing; he said, will you go of a message for me; I said, I would with all my heart; he desired me to wait till he had done writing; when he had finished it he came out into the street to me; when we came by ourselves, he asked me if I knew the Star and Garter, Pall-mall; I said, yes, very well; he said, go there, you will find a gentleman there from Cornhill with a parcel, go into a private room; he gave me this bill, and I was to pay for the parcel: I was to pay six guineas for the goods, and to bring him 3 l. 14 s. and if any body asked me where I came from, I was to say I came from St. James's coffee-house; then in a few minutes before we parted he said, if any body asked me where I came from, to say I came from Kensington; he gave me a 10 l. note or draft, I can neither write nor read; I asked him what I was to pay, he told me as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where he had that paper from?</p>
               <p>Matthews. No, I cannot, he was writing a cover to put over the note, as he told me; I observed, as he was writing, there were numbers of lines on that paper; I asked him where he lived, that I might come and return your change and the goods; he would not tell me, but took down my name, and where my stand was, and said he would come to me at my stand in the afternoon, or on the morrow morning; he walked down the paved-alley, and said he would wait there till I came back, there I parted with him; then I went to the Star and Garter, and asked if there was a parcel brought there from Cornhill; the waiter said there was, and directed me to Mr. Gloucester; I said to him, have you brought some goods; he said, yes; I said, what do they come to; he said, six guineas; I said, you was to bring change for a 10 l. note; he said, yes; I said, then give me 3 l. 14 s. here is the bill; he said, let me see the note; the prisoner had bid me not part with the note without the change; I said, give me the money you shall have the note; he took and looked at the note, and said, chairman, come along with me to my master's house, and you may have the change; I went with him, his master said the note is as good as the Bank, go and change it; he was gone about half an hour, the gentleman went to see why they kept him so long: after that I was sent for, and examined by Mr. Cole; he said to me, I was liable to be sent to the Compter or Newgate; said I, if there is any thing wrong it is not my fault; they went back to the counting house, and came to me again, and asked me who I knew in the city; I told them where I had brought papers and Bank notes, and gave a good account of myself; then they asked me which way I could take this man, or I must suffer myself; I said, if they would send a clerk with me to St. James's, the goods lay at the Star and Garter; they sent the clerk with me, we went up to the Swan about four in the afternoon; between eight and nine I was informed the prisoner had been at the shop to enquire for me, and had left word; I had left word I had the change and the goods; before I got to the door I saw him standing by the shop-door; he asked what I had done; I said, I had the change and the goods; he said, very well; I laid hold of him; said he, what do you lay hold of me for; said I, you are the King's prisoner, you must give an account of your hand-writing: Gloucester followed me immediately; the prisoner said, if you will go to St. James's-street I will pay you for the goods, and settle all the affair; coming into Great King-street I met the merchant's clerk, I said, this is the man, and I beg you will assist me, I had him by the arm; he begged hard for a coach; I took him into the house, we had a pint of wine; I asked him what was the reason he put me in such danger; he got out in a minute, and got as far as St. James's-square, this was about the hour of ten at night; I ran and laid hold of him again near the Duke of Leeds's, and sent for a hackney-coach, and brought him to Sir

               <p>The body of the bill in question is not my handwriting, nor had I any intention to defraud; I should therefore hope that the charge against me is not true; I have some time gone to the West-Indies with particular kinds of goods; being at the Island of Barbadoes I became acquainted with Mr. Harrison, he endorsed the said bill; I had not seen him till under the Piazzas in Covent-garden, on the 8th of July; he said he should be but a little time here, and he wanted three cloaks to make a present of to three ladies at Bath: he knowing I had carried on such trade in the West-Indies, he ordered me to get them, and to be left at the Star and Garter, Pall-mall, by the morrow morning, desiring me to order the person to bring change for a 10 l. bill: pursuant to his direction I went to the prosecutor, and ordered them; going to cross St. James's-square with a young woman, on the Saturday, I happened to meet Mr. Harrison, he took me by the hand; I told him the cloaks would be ready for him; he thanked me very kindly, and pulled out his pocket-book, and gave me the bill, and desired me to receive the change, and order the cloaks to be kept till called for, which he would do in two or three days, and I being engaged to go to Kensington, got that chairman to go. This is a true narrative of my case; I solemnly protest I had no intention to defraud any body, nor did I know it was a bad bill; I have not been able to find out Mr. Harrison since; I understood him that he lodged at Charing-cross, but he did not tell me where; he appeared to me in the West Indies to be a man of character and reputation; this was the 7th or 8th of July, I was committed the 9th; I have made all the enquiry possible I could for him; I hope from the nature of the case, and my general character, the honourable court will think I am not guilty; the chairman threatening me, I thought my life was in danger, was the occasion of endeavouring to get away.</p>

            . I am a warehouse man in Cateaton-street; I have known the prisoner some time, he has an extreme good character; to my knowledge he used to trade abroad, he has been in North America and places abroad; he has been trusted with large sums; had he applied to me he should have had twenty or thirty pounds, had he wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this bill.</p>
               <p>Reeve. (He takes it in his hand.) Neither the indorsement nor any part of it, I do not think bears any resemblance to the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen him write?</p>
               <p>Reeve. I have often.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner trade in?</p>
               <p>Reeve. He traded abroad; he was connected with Col. Tucker and Mr. Hunt of Aldermanbury, who recommended him to people here.</p>

I have a place in the Custom-house; my acquaintance with the prisoner first commenced in the year 1753; I never knew his character in the least called in question till this time, relating to this charge; I was acquainted with him very intimately for five or six years, he has continually paid me visits; I have known a number of people more intimate with him than I was, and had he been the least faulty I think I should have heard it; if he had come to me, so good an opinion I had of him, I would have let him have thirty, forty, or fifty pounds on his word; this I said before Sir

               <p>Child. I ran away from my master, a hatter in Water-lane, and strolled about, and got into Field-lane, and from thence to Chick-lane; there I got acquainted with the prisoner, and some more; I used to see them go out, and at last they asked me to go out with them, so I went out; we used to go out on nights a shop lifting; we went to the prosecutor's house on Christmas evening, Bagnell and Thorp were with me; the prisoner was apprentice in Field lane, he ran away from his master; we were walking by Mr. Harrison's, we saw Mrs. Harrison go down stairs to serve some coals; Thorp said, he believed no body was there, upon which Bagnell went into the house, the door was partly open; he brought out a paper snuff box, and gave it to Thorp; Thorp gave it to me, said Thorp, is this all you could get; he answered, no; there were a pair of blankets and a bed-quilt; Thorp said, go in and fetch them; he went in, and Thorp with him; Bagnell went to lay hold of the blanket and quilt; Thorp said, look over there, and pointed to the beauset; then Bagnell took out a quart silver mug, and the rest of the things were in it; I stood at the door, and saw them go cross the room; when they came out, they both told me what they had got; Thorp ran one way, and Bagnell the other; I went after Bagnell, and overtook him on Ludgate-hill; I said, what was the matter you ran so; said he, O! we are made for ever, we have got a quart silver mug, and some spoons in it; we found Thorp at Fleet-ditch, he had the mug and the spoons; we put them into a bag, and carried them into Black-boy -alley; we all lodged there in one house, and some others besides, all of the same business.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you?</p>
               <p>Child. There were five of us.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given information against the rest?</p>
               <p>Child. No, I never went out with them; Bagnell, I, and Thorp generally went out together; Bagnell got a young woman, a whore, in Black-boy-alley, to carry the things in her lap, to one Lyons, a Jew, in Duke's place, she did not belong to us; we all three went with her; Bagnell went up stairs, Thorp, I, and the young woman staid below; Bagnell brought down five guineas, we divided the money among us three, the young woman had none of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Bagnell to be taken up?</p>

On the 25th of August I missed a shift, on the 1st of September I lost an apron; I went to a pawnbroker's near the prisoner's house, I asked for a shift and apron pledged in her name; the pawnbroker refused producing them without the prisoner herself was there; then I went for an officer. After that we found an apron, not that which I had then missed; I went and fetched the prisoner from my house to the pawnbroker's, then the pawnbroker found four handkerchiefs; I found the stockings at the prisoner's house; she would not own to the other two aprons.</p>
