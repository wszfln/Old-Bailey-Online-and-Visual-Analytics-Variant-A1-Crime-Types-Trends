Mr. Edes depos'd, That there having been a Parcel of Guineas paid in at his Shop by a Stranger some few Weeks before, some of which proved to be light, having been filed, he gave Order to his Servants when any Stranger came to pay in Money again, to take particular Care to see that they had not been filed; that thereupon the Prisoner coming the 2d of July, brought the Sum of 303 Guineas, some new some old, desiring a Note for them in the Name of John Smith; that the Guineas having been told, they were brought to him in a Shovel into the back Shop, and having sorted them took ten of them together, rubbing his Finger over the Edges of them, and perceived some Gold Dust like fine Filings come off upon his Finger, and some Particles to lie upon the Board where the Guineas lay; that they weighed them and found 110 of the 303 to be light, wanting about 18 d. per Guinea. Whereupon he went to the Prisoner, who waited for his Note, asking him who recommended him to pay the Guineas to him; the Prisoner answer'd him, one John Smith a Clothier living at Beesely in Gloucestershire; to which he replied he did not know any such Person; to which he made Reply, he must know him, for he had paid Money in to him before. Upon which he told him the Guineas were many of them light and had been filed, and therefore he must detain him till he could give him an Account of himself and Satisfaction how he came by those Guineas. He giving him some unsatisfactory and evasive Answers, and being in some Confusion, was for going, saying he had some Business upon the Exchange; whereupon he told him he must detain him, and if he would not consent to stay, he must charge an Officer with him; Whereupon he did consent to stay; but desired a Porter might he called to send home with a Message to his Wife, which they did permit him; and that he desired him to send for some that could gave an Account of him, but he not doing it, he sent to Mr. Pinkley the

             and Mr. Rogers, who added, that upon Mr. Edes's enquiring of the Prisoner, as has been before related, he appeared to be very dejected, and trembled. Mr. Pinkley depos'd, that then mention being made of going to search his House, he having had the Opportunity of sending home a Porter before, it was most advisable to defer that for some time, till they should think they would probably take no farther Notice; and accordingly deferred the Search for 3 or 4 Days, when taking a Warrant and Officer they went to his House, found it, an House of small Appearance, of about 5 or 6 l. per Annum; that the Window-shutters below Stairs were kept shutt, and that knocking at the Door a Lad came, who talking with them over the Hatch seem'd unwilling on let them come in till he told him he must come in, having a Warrant, and therefore if Opposition was made, must use Violence; whereupon they entring found the Furniture within meaner than the House without, the whole amount of the Inventory of the Furniture in their Opinion not to exceed 5 or 6 l. that going up Stairs there was a Loom or two, and a Lad puddling about something, but could find nothing of what they expected; that there was a Man who pretended to be Brother to the Prisoner, and that being in the Workshop they espy'd a Door that went out of it into another Room, they desired to see it opened; the Brother was very unwilling, saying, they could not, for he had not the Key, whereupon setting his, Foot against it, the Door flew open. And the Room was very dirty and dusty, land some small Parcels of Money lying in several Places, and the Furniture exactly answerable to what they had seen before; that there was in it a Bed, but a very sorry old torn thing, and an old Trunk; they desired the Trunk might be opened, but the Brother saying he had not the Key, they replied then they must break it upon; where upon he fetched a Key, which tho' not the Key of the Trunk they got it open; that in this Trunk in one Parcel was 93 Guineas, in another 193 and a half, in another 187 and a half, then searching about the Bed, there was under the Bed some old Bottles, and the Constable feeling with his Staff felt a Cloth, and found in it 346 Guineas, of which there were 20 that had been filed. And that all these Parcels of Guineas were fresh new Guineas, very fair, and either King George's or Queen Anne's, and that they found a Pair of Gold Scales, and Weights for a Guinea, a half Guinea and Grains, but no other Weights, and that they found a Paper upon which there seemed to appear among some Dust something to shine as if there had been in it some fine Filings of Gold or some other Metal, and that they found likewise a Subpoena in Relation to a Suit of his depending, which he carried on in Forma pauperis. These Circumstances were generally confirm'd by the Officer and those that were present at searching the House. Mr. Pinkley deposed, that afterwards going to him in Newgate, they desired him to give them Satisfaction how he came by the said Parcels of Money, to which he answer'd very evasively he had received it of various Persons in small Sums as 5 or 10 l.&amp;c. and that his way of getting it was by his Employments, sometimes as a Weaver. Sometimes as a Solicitor at Law, and sometimes in Stock-jobbing,&amp;c. But that they suspecting that he had received the Money from some Accomplices who had furnished him with it in order to file, or at least to put off, they promised him if he would discover that he should not be prosecuted, but he refused to make any, saying it was his own Money. Mr. Edes likewise deposed, that in order to inform himself who this John Smith was at Beesely in Gloucestershire, in whose Name he would have taken a Note for the Money, he sent to the Minister of the Place and received from him two Letters, which were produced in Court: The Import of which was, that he had made very diligent Inquiry, and that there was no such Person there. Several of his Neighbours appeared in Court, and deposed, that he had the Repute of a Man in mean Circumstances, among which were the Officers of the Parish, who deposed that about 2 or 3 Years since, the Prisoner being rated 4 d. per Month to the Poor, they could never get any Money, but always when they went found the Doors shut, and some body or another to answer him out of the Window, but when they were a going out of their Office had obtained a Warrant to make Distress, did with much Difficulty get into his House to distrain for 15 s.2 d. but when they came in found not Movables worth their taking, and that he said he was a poor Man and not able to pay, but they resolving to cut a Piece of Stuff out of the Loom, he said it was none of his own; but at last muster'd up 10s. which he said was all that he had, and engaged one of the Officers who was his Neighbour to lay down the 5 s. for him. Others deposed that his Trade he carried on was very inconsiderable; and a Lodger in his House said, that he seemed to be very necessitous, being always very pressing for his Rent as soon as ever Quarter-day was past. Several other Things were deposed that tended to prove that he was reputed a Man of mean Circumstances; so that it was more than probable that he must have Accomplices who had supplied him with this Money, in order either to diminish or utter, or both. This the Council for the Prisoner endeaveor'd to obviate by producing Witnesses how he might come by this Money, and that consequently it was his own, that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171709110003"/> it was what he had been scraping together for this 15 to 16 Years by working hard with his Hands, racking his Brains and starving his Belly, and likewise urging that a Man might put away false Money unknowingly. They called a great many Witnesses, some depos'd that they knew about 13 or 14 Years ago he came to Town and brought with him Cloth which he sold here to the Value of 70 l. that he had since that worked Journey-work, and afterwards traded for himself; that he had the Repute of a Mony'd Man; that he had lent Money upon Pawns, to be paid by weekly Payments; that he had discounted Notes: And one said he had lent 100 l. upon Security, which Money was paid again not long before his Apprehension for this Fact: and another particularly testified, that 5 or 6 Years since he' desired him to look out for a Purchase for him worth 5,6 or 700 l. and that he showed him the Money to pay for it. Another said he had offered to buy some Houses for 200 l. that he had the Reputation of an honest fair-dealing Man; that he was very frugal and saving, making Advantages of his Money every way he could, contenting himself with bare Necessaries at home and abroad, and many Things of the like Nature. T o which the Council reply'd, that the Prisoner had produced no such Person as John Smith a Clothier of Beesely in Gloucestershire, who recommended him to pay the 303 Guineas to the said Messieurs Green and Edes; that an honest fair-dealing Man had no occasion to make use of such Falsifications in paying his own Money into a Goldsmith's Hand; that he had yet made no Proof how he came by these Sums of Money, inasmuch as excepting the 100 l. said to be paid to him; the Notes said to be discounted, were most of them some considerable time before, and the Sums themselves but small, and together amounting to no Sum comparable with 1100 l. which Sum of Money was found upon him in Gold. They observed likewise, that this could not be likely to be Money that he had boarded up, because they were all of them new Guineas, sit for filing: They observed likewise, that he had no Proof of any considerable Dealings in this Trade, whereby to procure such a Sum; that he had produce'd no Proof of his dealing in Stocks, Exchequer-Notes, or any thing relating to Publick Credit, no, not so much as his having bought or sold one single Exchequer-Bill. As to his taking in Pawns, they observed likewise, that the Persons who search'd his House had deposed they found no such Pawns (except a Gold Chain of small Value, a Gown and Petticoat,3 or 4 Rings in the Trunk aforesaid) nor no Books of any Account of any such Dealings in any of these Occupations. They likewise observed, that this Action of uttering the Guineas was very unlike an Old Gripe, as his Council had been labouring to prove him, in that no Man that was Convetous in improving Money would pay Money into the Hands of a single Goldsmith upon his bare Note which allows no Interest, when he may for it have Exchequer Notes on Parliament Security,&amp;c, which bear Interest. They observed likewise, that such Persons did not use to leave such a Sum as 470 l. so carelesly as in old Clouts under a Bed. They observed also, that tho' the Prisoner said before the Lord. Mayor that he never weigh'd a Guinea in his Life, yet a Pair of Gold Scales and Weights were found in his Room; and many other Things by which it appear'd highly probable that it was Money he was furnish'd with from some other Persons, for the said fraudulent and pernicious Intent and Porpose: and however, were it his own, the Suspicion was the stronger upon him, in that he had given no Proof of whom, when or where he receiv'd them, or what honest Intent he could have in paying them to Messieurs Green and Edes.

He swore positively the Prisoner was one of them that rifled him he sent to a Friend's House, one Mr. Nicholas, that lived about 3 quarters of a Mile off, to borrow a Horse to ride and that the said Mr. Nicholas would have him drink a Tankard of his Ale and smoak a Pipe of Tobacco, which he did, during which time he gave him on Account how he was robbed, describing the Men and Horses, staying there about 3 quarters of an Hour. Afterwards Mr. Nicholas going with him to the Door to see him take Horse, espied three Men such as he had described coming along, and there being a Gate that they must go through, he went and shut it; they finding the Gate shut, attempted to go back, but Mr. Nichols and the Prosecutor endeavouring to stop them, two of them got away, one of them giving Nichols a Cut on the Head with a Hanger, but he laid hold on the Prisoner's Bridle and held him, and that the Prisoner struck Mr. Nichols several times with a Whip, but he secured him, dismounted him, took the Whip from him; that he had likewise a Hanger at his Girdle, but without a Scabbard; that there was a Wig found in the Road that some of them had dropped, and likewise a Pistol charged with Powder and Ball. All the Circumstances after the Prosecutor came to Mr. Nichols's House were likewise sworn to by Mr. Nichols. The Prisoner denied the Fact; and being asked how he came to be in the Company, he said he was going to one Capt. Scroggs at a Town not far from the Place, he meeting with the other two Men on the Road they undertook to put him into his Way, and that when they robbed the Prosecutor they threatned him that if he offered to stir they would shoot, and that he was at a considerable distance off. He gave no Account how he came by the Prosecutor's Whip. A great many Persons appeared to his Reputation who gave him a good Character; that he hadlived with his Father at Knight's Bridge, who kept an Inn there (and as one said used to draw his Father's Liquorments) and that now his Father being dead, and his Mother being a Woman of an Estate, he looked after it, collecting her Rents,&amp;c. that he had always behaved himself well, and that they never heard of his having committed any such irregularity.

That it growing Night, she began to be in Fear, and the Prisoner bid her not be afraid, he would take Care of her, and knew the Way; that coming to a Lane this side Stains, three Miles long, there was a Foot-path in the Field on the inside of the Hedge; that going along, she was overjoyed that she happened to be in the Company of a Man in Years, and a sober Man, and her Townsman too. But having walked a pretty Way together, he on a sudden put his Foot before her and threw her down upon a Hillock, so that her Body lay over it, and her Heels higher than her Head, and fell upon her, getting between her Legs, lying with his Face upon hers so close she could scarce breathe; that she cry'd out for Christ Jesus's sake to him not to injure her, but that he holding her down in that Posture that she could make no use of her Hands or Feet to get up, put his Finger into her Body and tore her very much, and afterwards lay with her. That afterwards they went together to Stains, and the next Day took another Road; that she was very much injured, bled very much for a long time after; and that coming to Salisbury she apply'd her self to a Surgeon, had Medicines, from him, had been in a very ill Condition eversince, was So now and under a Surgeon's Hand, was intirely ruined, and never like to recover her Health again. That she told the Doctor how she had been served, and that he knowing the Prisoner, told her, if she swore it against him, she would take away his Life, and persuaded her to make it up; that accordingly he had endeavoured to make up the Matter between them. That she remaining still very ill, and hearing he was come to London, came up and prosecuted him.

            , the Surgeon deposed, That she did make Complaint of such Usage to him two Days after her coming down, that she was very ill in her private Parts, and that the Prisoner had offered her Violence as she was coming from London, and that upon Examination, he found she had an Excoration in the Parts mentioned, that he gave Medicine, accordingly; that afterwards she complained of fainting Fits, for which he applied proper Remedies, and that after that she complained of a Pain in her Head; and that he was of Opinion her Illness might proceed from Heat of Urine. He deposed likewise, that he did, by her Consent, speak of it to the Prisoner, and that he said, if he had done her any Injury, he would pay for her Cure; that he brought the Prisoner and the Prosecutor Face to Face, and that there were Offers made to make up the Matter, and that she insisted upon 5 l. She being asked of the Court, when she made this Matter known first, she owned she did not to any Body till she came to Salisbury; she said, she was afraid to tell her Mother of it, she being sick, and distemper'd in her Head some time before, supposing it would have put her into Fits, and been the Death of her. It appeared that the Prisoner and Prosecutor after the Commission of this Fact walk'd together to the same Inn at Stanes, and lodg'd there that Night, and no Mention was made to the Carrier, nor any Body else, and that she afterwards went on Foot great part of the Way, as the Carrier deposed, that the Weather was very bad, and that might probably be a great Occasion of her Illness.

Phillips, Master, a Passenger from Holland, and brought on board the said Ship a Bag marked S. J. with 150 lb. of Human Hair in it, and left it on board the said Ship; that he going to fetch this Bag on shore could not find it. The other Evidences, who were Passengers likewise, deposed, that they saw such a Bag on board, and the Prisoner and one Jebone carried it towards the Cook-Room in the middle of the Day, and that they afterwards went on Shore; but they could not tell what became of it afterwards. The Prisoner denied the Fact, and called several to his Reputation, who gave him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171709110007"/> good Character. Mr. Philips, the Master of the Ship, deposed he had sailed with him for six Months, and that he never knew him guilty of the least Dishonesty; that he had served an Apprenticeship to his Father, and he had known him all the time, and as an honest Fellow had employ'd him. He deposed likewise, that he did not believe there were any such Goods brought on board; that he nor any of his Ships Crew had never seen any such Bag; that the Prosecutor had never given an account of any such Goods to him, or to his Mate, or to his Steward; and added, that the Prosecutor pleaded so much Poverty, that he would have begged his Passage. Another Person deposed, that the Prosecutor came to him to go with him to the Ship to fetch a Bag and a Basket; that he asked him what was in it, and he answer'd, nothing but his old Clothes; and pleaded so great Poverty, that he told him he had not Six-pence in the World. The Tide-Surveyor deposed, that when he went on board the said Ship he saw no such Parcel there; that if he had he should have taken an account of it, it being Merchandize, and such as pays 20 l. per Cent. Duty; and that there was no such Goods enter'd at the Custom house; and added, that he thought it was impossible that a parcel of that Bulk and Weight could be carried out of the Ship at Noon Day, as had been deposed, when there were several Tide-Waiters on board.

             deposed, the Prisoner came to her, telling her she was ill, and had not the conveniency of lying down on the Bed at her Lodgings, it being a Press Bed and turned up; and therefore desired leave to lie down upon her Bed; which she granted. That she lay there five or six Hours, during which time she went in several times, and asked her how she did, and she said she was very ill; that she did not perceive her to be with Child, that she went out, and when she came home found her sitting upon the Bedside; that she said she was very ill; and she taking notice that her Sheets were in an odd pickle, asked her how they came so: she made her an Answer as proper as the Case would hear without telling the Truth, and took the Sheets away with her, wash'd them and brought them again the next Day. But suspecting there had been a Child born, search was made, and the Child found in the House of Office. The Constable and others deposed, that at her Apprehension she first deny'd the Fact, but afterwards owned it: and being asked why she put the Child there, she replied, Because she did not know where else to put it; that she did it to conceal her Shame, and that by so doing she had brought her self to more, and was now heartily sorry for it. The Prisoner pleaded that the Child was Still born, and came before its Time; and that she had made her case known to a Midwife, and several other Persons, and that she had provided Necessaries for it. There were some Persons that confirm'd these Circumstances; a Midwife, an experinc'd Nurse, and some other Women, who saw the Child, gave their Opinions that it came four, five or six Weeks before its full time: and a Bailiff's Wife deposed, she came to her about 4 Months since, giving her 3 s.6 d. for a Writ to arrest one who she said she was with Child by, in order that having by that means secured him she might oblige him to provide for it.

            </rs> The Prosecutor deposed, That the Prisoner pretended to him he was Lieutenant Governors of the Tower and Warden of the Mint; he using to frequent the House of a Woman that was his Neighbour, took Acquaintance with him, asking him how Trade went, and what be made by his Business, telling, him be appearing to be an honest industrious Man be had a mind to be kind to him, and would help him to a Store-keeper's Place in the Tower, which would be 60 l. a Year for Life, but that he must furnish him with Money for taking out a Deputation and such incident Charges; that he thereupon, being elevated at the hopes of his Preferment let him have Money in order thereunto; that the Prisoner often came and sent to him for more Money, pretending that he met sometimes with one Obstacle and sometimes another, but a little more Money would remove all, and he would he put into the Possession of his Office; but at last perceived he had been trick'd out of his Money. The Prisoner denied the Fact, saying he never made any such Pretences; that the Prosecutor had lent him the Money, and that he never had any Mony of him but what he took Notes of his Hand for the Payment of. The Prosecutor reply'd to this, that he never took any one Note of him for his Money, but only that the Prisoner had put a Note into his Hand to go and receive 5 l. for him of a Hoy-Man, but would never let him go to receive the Money upon the Note. And that he had also given him a Note to go to his Sister's Steward and receive of him 151 l. but could never hear of any such Person. It appeared that the Fact was committed before the Act of Grace and so the Prisoner was entitled to a Pardon; but upon this Condition, that the Prosecution being begun before the Act commenced, he was obliged to pay the Prosecutor his Charges, which was about 50 s. and accordingly he was informed by the Court that if he did so he might lay claim to the benefit of it; but he pleaded he was so poor he had not 50 Farthings: Upon which the Court asked the Prosecutor if he would take his Word for the 50 s. to which he replied, no, not for a crocked Pin. The Court ask'd him how he could suffer himself to be so imposed upon from time to time by him, he reply'd, because he thought he was bewitch'd.

            </rs> The Prosecutor deposed, the Prisoner using to come to the Tilt Yard Coffee-house, where he lived, took an Opportunity of telling him that he was a pretty Fellow, and it was pity he should spend his Time in filling out Dishes of Coffee,&amp;c, and that he took such a liking to him that he would prefer him, telling him he had a great Place in the Treasury, and was a Commissioner of the Customs, and would put him into a Land-Waiter's Place, and wheedled him under this Expectation out of Money at various Times to the Sum of 40 l. making the same Excuses as he had done to the other Person for the deferring his being put into Place; one time it could not be till Term, and then he should be sworn in the Treasury, and another time another Hinderance; and that he told him he should go down with him to his Estate in Kent, where he was to receive a 1000 l. And this was within the Limits of the Act of Grace, as well as the other; but he could not comply with the Conditions of the Act, by paying the Prosecutor his Costs, as before, and so the Tryal went on. The Prisoner, as before, denied his Pretences, and said it was Money lent, and what he would pay whenever he should retrieve his Misfortunes. He said likewise it was a Debt, in that he had given him Notes of his Hand for it. The Prosecutor acknowledged he had a Note for 20 l. and that he gave him a Bill to receive 150 l. of his Sister's Steward (in Nubibu) as he had done the other Prosecutor. The Prisoner alledged that he had unkind Usage, in that the Prosecutors had contrived to defer his Tryal to this time, when those Persons who would have spoke in his Favour were out of Town; and being asked who they were, he answer'd, the Lord Townsend, Mr. Walpole, and some other Great Men: The Court told him, that was a very pernicious Contrivance indeed, if it were so; out however since these Great Men did not appear in his behalf, desired him if he had any Persons of less Figure to speak in his Reputation, challenging him to find one in the whole Court (which was then very full) to do it; but none appearing, the Jury found him <rs id="t17170911-51-verdict263" type="verdictDescription">

The Hostler deposed, That the Prisoner came into the Yard, about 2 of the Clock, and called for his Horse, and wanted his Boots. But he told him the Chamberlain had lock'd them up, and he must call him up to help him to them; to which he seemed unwilling, telling him he would not have him disturb'd; but if he could get them without him, he would give him something for himself, and also leave something for the Chamberlain; he told him he could not, and so called the Chamberlain, who gave them him, and he was putting them on, and that in the mean time the Chamberlain went up Stairs, and he heard him talk with the Prosecutor, and what he said, and he believed the Prisoner did hear him too. And that while he was putting on his Boots, he starts up on a sudden, and said he must go into the Yard; that he wondering at this sudden Motion, look'd after him, saw him go to the Stones, put his Hand in his Pocket, heard the Stones rattle, and that he came in again immediately, and staid not to make Water or do any thing else; that when he was come in again, the Prosecutor and Chamberlain came down immediately, and taxed him with the Money, which was found as aforesaid. The Chamberlain deposed, The Prisoner came in about 7 of the Clock that Night to lodge, said he should stay 2 Nights, and was going to Canterbury. That when the Prosecutor went to Bed he attended him, lock'd his Chamber Door, and put the Key under it, and that being call'd up in the Morning, he admir'd that the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171709110008"/> was going away so early and in such a Hurry, therefore having given him his Boots, went up to see all was safe in his Chamber, and going by the Prosecutor's Door, saw it had been forced open, and waked him, as has been before related.

               <p>THE Child of Mr. Hillyard Glasier in Baldwins-Gardens near Holbourn, having been in such extream Danger by the hard Breeding and Cutting of its Teeth, that it was given over by every one as a dead Child. All Means that could be thought of were tried to relieve it, but to no Purpose; it lying as every one thought ready to Expire. At last the Celebrated NECKLACE for Childrens Teeth was sent for: It was no sooner put about its Neck, but a very sensible Change visibly appeared, the Child presently grew better, cut its Teeth easily, and by the Blessing of God is now perfectly well, to the Amazement of all who saw it. Of the Truth of which any Person may be farther fully satisfied at the Place abovementioned. This wonderful.</p>

               <p>For the Good of the Publick.</p>
               <p>WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex, in this Kingdom, have contracted an evil Habit of Body, wherein the vicious Humours, at first dispers'd thro' the Whole, come at length to be lodg'd in one Part or another, and many times, for Causes too long to be here mentioned, are thrown down upon the Womb, occasioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part, which being neglected, at last turns Cancerous, and often proves Fatal. I cure the Diabetes when given over by all other Persons. This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion, that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc'd Midwife, dwelling at the Sign of the Queen's Arms, a Watch-Makers, near Excter Exchange in the Strand, who perform'd a Cure upon a Lady at the Bath, after she was given over by the Physicians, and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and Suburbs of London. I should not have put my self in Publick Print, but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have present Ease and Relief.</p>
