I had not occasion to change money again till I went into the Prince of Wales in the evening, so I most have taken that half-crown where I took the other. I was not aware I had it in my pocket.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the messengers to the Court of Bankruptcy—I produce the proceedings against William Buckwell, the prisoner—the petition for adjudication is dated 1st February, 1862; it is the petition of Messrs. Bowstead &amp; Co., of 34, Craven-street, Charing-cross—the adjudica<lb/>tion is dated 4th February—it is my duty to see that the adjudication is duly gazetted, and it was so—the choice of assignees was to take place on 22d February, at 11 o'clock; that would be the first meeting—the second meeting, appointed for the last examination was 1st April—the bankrupt surrendered on 5th February—I find a memorandum on 1st April, that In consequence of his not having filed his accounts, it was adjourned to 23d April—the memorandum is this: "The bankrupt, not having yet filed his accounts, and stating that his books and vouchers were in Italy, and that he could not prepare his accounts until they had been sent over, the exami<lb/>nation was adjourned till 23d April, at half-past 12 precisely"—on 23d April the bankrupt had not filed his accounts, and was not prepared to pass his last examination, whereupon the examination was adjourned till 14th May next—I have no doubt I was there on 23rd April; there is nothing upon the proceedings to show me that I was there; it is my duty to be there daily, and I am there daily—I sometimes prepare the protection order, but sometimes I never see it—it is given to a bankrupt upon his first sur<lb/>render—the day of adjournment is endorsed upon it, and signed by the registrar, and he has protection from time to time—the bankrupt was there on 23d April.; I know that by his examination and his signature; it was a private examination, which was taken down and signed by him—he did not appear upon the adjournment-day, the 14th May—the record of that day is signed by Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque—he states, "Although I sat from the hour of 12 o'clock until 2 in the afternoon, for the purpose of receiving such surrender, he did not attend"—there is on the proceedings a duplicate of the protection order which was given to the bankrupt—I know that a protection paper was given to him—I did not compare that with any other; they are usually made out together; they are taken from the docket-book, and one is a copy of the other, or ought to be—this has Mr. Hazlitt's the registrar's, signature—this and the one given to the bankrupt, would both be originals; both would be signed by the registrar—I think this is the handwriting of my clerk, who is here—it is the usual practice to serve a docu<lb/>ment upon the bankrupt, in reference to the adjourned meeting; on the day of the choice it is usual for the bankrupt to get his protection paper filled up with the day appointed for passing his last examination; that is always done, and it is usual to have it endorsed at each subsequent adjournment—the prisoner was present on 22d February, when the adjournment to 1st April took place—I do not find anything on the proceedings to show that he was present on the 22d February, but I find a summons to him similar to</p>

               <p>what was first given to him; we give the bankrupt a second one on the day of the choice, to remind him of the day of the last examination—that would not be given to him if he was not there; it would not have been made out—I find that he was there on 26th February; he submitted to a private ex<lb/>amination that day—he was present on 1st April—I find an examination here on that day signed by him.</p>

I am one of the firm of Johnson, Cooper, Wintle &amp; Co., accountants—I was first employed as accountant to the bankrupt imme<lb/>diately before the choice, and afterwards I consented to act as accountant to the estate—it is the practice at the first meeting to see that a bankrupt has protection—the first meeting was on the 22d February—as his accountant I should see that he had protection on that day—here is a paper on the pro<lb/>ceedings in my own handwriting, dated 22d February; it is a summons to the bankrupt to appear on 1st April, and is signed by Mr. Hazlitt, the registrar—to the best of my knowledge and belief, when I filled up this one I also filled up a second one, and upon the back of both the protection would be endorsed—one would be filed on the proceedings, and the other given to the bankrupt, but not by me—to the best of my belief I have seen that document in the possession of the bankrupt; he would produce it for the purpose of having the protection subsequently endorsed on it—that is the only way in which, in accordance with the practice of the court, further protection would be granted—I was present on 1st April; protec<lb/>tion was then accorded to him—I have looked through the books and Papers produced by the messenger—I have here a bill-book—I was present when the bankrupt was examined on 23d April; I think I remained to the end; I have no doubt of it—I believe the bankrupt was present when the day for the adjournment was fixed—between 23d April and 14th May I had interviews with the bankrupt—I can't say whether or not I called his at<lb/>tention to the meeting of 14th May; I can't call it to my memory—the protection was until that day—to the best of my knowledge and belief, there was an endorsement made on 23d April on his protection-order—I think I made it myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). There are summonses which would apply to the bankrupt or any other witness—I am not quite sure that that has not got the word "summons" printed in the margin—the protection-order is made out at the end of the meeting or examination—the day for the next examination must be fixed before it could be made out—it is made out and the projection put on the back to save him from being arrested during the adjournment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say you gave it to Mr. Martin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we are referring to the 22d February—that was not the last occasion—to the best of my belief, the last time I saw it in possession of the bank<lb/>rupt was on 23d April, but I can't swear positively—to the best of my belief I saw it then in the Court of Bankruptcy, at the meeting, in the bankrupt's possession—the endorsement would be made on it at the close of the meeting—it was at the close of the meeting that I saw it—after that it would have to be re-endorsed, and re-signed by the registrar in attendance—that would be done at the end of the meeting—I cannot state positively whether the bankrupt left before the meeting closed; I do not recollect that at the close of the meeting there was no registrar there to sign the protection for some time after the bankrupt had left—I do not remem<lb/>ber at what time I left; I have such a multitude of these matters, I could not say without a reference—I have referred to the minute of adjournment, and I cannot say positively that the protection was given to him on that day; but to the best of my belief, I endorsed the date upon the back of it, and gave it to him—I should get it signed by Mr. Hazlitt—it is the custom for the accountant to get the renewal of the protection signed, but not the original protection—I believe I did it, but I won't say positively—my memory is a blank as to what hour the bankrupt left; his examination that day must have taken some considerable time—it must have been late in the day before his examination was over—as a rule, the registrar sits until 4 o'clock—I do not remember that he went away that day—as to the pro<lb/>tection, I can't state positively, but to the best of my belief I endorsed it and gave it to him.</p>

               <p>he have to be taken before the registrar to acknowledge his signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He would, and the registrar has signed it—I think that was signed at the time; the examination would be acknowledged before the registrar by the bankrupt—that would be the last thing done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Gazette of 7th February, 1862, was put in, containing an advertisement requiring the bankrupt to surrender and be examined on 22d February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I have to submit two objections, which seem to me fatal to this indictment. The first is, that the Registrar, whose power and jurisdiction is defined by the 52d sec. of the Act, had no power to adjourn, except for the consideration. of the Commissioner, and here the adjournment was by the Registrar; that objection, if it prevails, goes to the root of the whole matter, because the adjourn<lb/>ment-day is the one relied on as to the non-surrender. I contend in the first instance that the Registrar had no power to make the adjournment; and in the second place, if he had such power, he has not exercised it in due form of law, at provided for by the Act. The document, by, which the adjournment was directed, is headed, "Before, Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque;" that is struck out, and Mr. Registrar Hazlitt's name inserted; subsequently Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque's name it again put in, and the document concludes thus</hi>—"<hi rend="italic">where—upon I" (that is, Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque, the name last mentioned) "do adjourn the examination," and that is signed by Mr. Hazlitt, the Registrar. The second objection is, that the non-surrender here has been misconceived; it clearly points to the case of a bankrupt who does not submit himself at all to the jurisdiction of the Court. Now, whatever other offence this prisoner's may be, it is not an offence within this Act of Parliament if he has once surrendered (see Reg. v. Kenrick</hi>, 1 <hi rend="italic">Cox's Criminal Cases, p.</hi> 146). <hi rend="italic">I further submit that, in order to make this an offence at all, notice in writing must be served upon the bank<lb/>rupt or left at his last-known place of abode, to submit himself to be examined before the Court at the particular time limited by the proper authority; there is no distinction between the notice described in the first part of the section, and that described in the second, and the same ingredients are essential in both.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Mr. Hazlitt is in attendance, and can prove that in this instance he acted in the unavoidable absence of the Commissioner.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I am quite prepared to contend that we were not bound to give notice in writing, after notice had once been given of the two first meetings, as directed by the Act; the bankrupt himself being present, verbal or any other notice would be sufficient; the case of Reg. v. Kenrick has been overruled by the subsequent case of Reg. v. Hilton</hi> (2 <hi rend="italic">Cox's Criminal Cases</hi>), <hi rend="italic">tried before Lord Chief Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice Cresswell, in which the Court clearly drew a distinction between a non-surrender and a not-submitting to be examined.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">In this case it appears that the bankrupt has complied com<lb/>pletely with the requisitions of the Act of Parliament; he has surrendered, and he has submitted to be examined from time to time, as appears by the three diferent examinations put in.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">But he does not file any accounts, in consequence of which the Registrar could not pass his last examination; I contend that there has been no real statutable examination until he has filed his accounts, and the court has no jurisdiction to examine him under the Statute until that has been done; it is a sine qua non; if that be so, then he does not submit himself to be examined if he does not appear on the day expressly appointed for finishing his last examination, the adjournment to that day being on the express ground that he has not filed his accounts.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RECORDER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I think these objections are fatal; I am inclined to think that both are so, because it does not appear to me that the prisoner is shown to have committed an offence under the particular section of the Act upon which the indictment is framed. He has submitted to be examined from time to time, he has not passed his last examination, and he is not in a condition in which he could do so; but supposing it was required that there should be a further examination which he was called upon to attend, after having already sub<lb/>mitted, in the words of the Statute, to be examined from time to time, then I think that express notice ought to have been given to him to attend.

                  <hi rend="italic">this indictment, for not submitting to be examined upon the further occasion, it must be shown that there was a legal adjournment of the Court, with notice of which he was effectually served. The only evidence that we have of that, at it appears to me, is this particular document, and in that the hearing is alleged to be before Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque, and he makes no order whatever; the order is made by somebody else, who, although he might have authority to act in a matter which was before him and not before the Commissioner, was not the proper person to decide upon this matter.</hi>

I was the assistant-manager to the bankrupt, in King William-street—I took the financial department—I was there from the middle of February, 1861, till February, 1862, up to the bankruptcy—during that time materials to a large extent were sent out to Italy for the purposes of the railway; iron, timber, and fastenings, to an amount ap<lb/>proaching 20,00<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—money was also sent out to Italy to a large amount, for the use of the railway—it was sent out to the bankrupt, and to his agent there, Mr. Charles Collins, for the purpose of carrying out the railway con<lb/>tract—more than 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went through my hands to Italy, in cash—that extended from the month of May until October—I think it ceased in October—I had the obtaining of the money on shares and debentures on almost all of them, and the money that was obtained came into my hands—all the money that I have spoken of was raised on debentures and shares, by sale, loan, and deposit—all the business in England connected with the railway was carried on at the office in King William-street, and in Italy, Charles Collins represented the bankrupt—Frank Collins was associated with me, as a manager—I found him engaged in the office when I went, and he continued there—he attended to all the correspondence, and to the shipping of the goods to Italy—Mr. William Collins, another brother, was also engaged there, and one or two other clerks—the bankrupt was con<lb/>tinually passing to and fro between Italy and England—when in England, he was constantly at the office in King William-street—we did not keep books of account there—there were really no proper books kept—there was my own account, which I have delivered in—that contained all the cash raised upon the securities—there was also a telegram-book, a letter-book, and a bill-book; there was no cash-book—my cash account was mere ab<lb/>stracts from my private banking account—I was careful to pay everything through a banking account, that I might at all times prove it—I made out the account I spoke of from the bank-book—the account was kept in my own name; it was my own private account—I had strict instructions from the bankrupt to pay all moneys into my account, and draw from it any moneys that he required—it was very soon known what was mine and what was his—mine was limited—the whole did not belong to him—there was no difficulty in knowing about that, whether it was large or small—I could tell by marking my entries in my books, that was all, in the banker's pass<lb/>book, and in the cheque-book—I looked after the bank-book; it was in my</p>

               <p>that was merely in waiting to see Mr. Preston; my eye caught upon it—I had never seen it before, and knew nothing of it—I spoke to the bankrupt about it afterwards; he told me it was to prevent the Railway Company getting possession of the goods that he had given this lien upon them—he told me that the company were making a claim against him, and that he was making a large claim against them—I have heard that the amount of their claim against him was fifty odd thousand—I think that was before he spoke of this deed; that is my impression—I think the bankrupt went to Italy about 21st December, and then returned, and went again about 6th January—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of my book—Mr. Buckwell went to Italy either on 21st December or the day after—he returned very quickly, I know—to the best of my belief, it was about the 8th or 9th of January that he went to Italy again—he was here on 5th February, and he was here the first week in January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not on the 1st of January that you received the paper, that you spoke of just now, which made you more attentive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What makes me rather careful about it is this: there were two papers on bankruptcy, one just previous to the other, within a fortnight of each other; the first was settled by the bankrupt before he went to Italy the last time but one; and this one, on which the bankruptcy was really completed, came within a week or two afterwards—I have no actual recollection of calling his atten<lb/>tion to that piece of paper when he was in England the first week in January, but I am sure to have done it—the second paper of which I spoke was delivered between 8th and 9th of January; I must have called his attention to that if I saw him—it was either that or the previous paper that made me more particular—he had the papers in the bag on one of the two journeys; but the difficulty in my mind is, to say whether it was the one or the other—I know it was within a few weeks of the actual bank<lb/>ruptcy—at the time the papers were put in the bag, there was this dispute with the company—the bankrupt was being pressed by them—he was pressed by this notice in bankruptcy, besides the dispute with the company—he was pressed by other persons—I am not aware that Mr. Wood was pressing him—he had a loan with Mr. Wood, but I don't think he was pressing him—he was paying off that loan by small instalments, but in a friendly manner—I gather from my books that he was paying 60 per cent on that loan; he was paying it off by degrees—Mr. Wood was a creditor when I first went to Mr. Buckwell's, and he continued so up to the end—there are several entries of payments, the last one is on 2d January, 1862; bills were renewed for one month, and the interest was 5 per cent. for the month—the whole amount of the debt was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I first went, and it was reduced to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 2d January, it was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not all paid off; there is a claim now of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last payment was on 2d January—Messrs. Price and Bowstead, the petitioning creditors here, were also pressing him, on account of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was by letter, and they also applied to me personally for money—that was three or four months before they issued out the bankruptcy proceedings—I gave them debentures and shares, and they gave some three months time or something of that sort; that time expired, the money was not paid, and they took proceedings in bankruptcy—they could get the debentures registered, but the company would not allow the shares to be transferred; they would not register the transfer—at the time these papers were put in the bag, the bankrupt's credit was stopped, from his dispute with the company; they had refused to go on with their advances to him—subsequent to the bankruptcy, they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020023"/>
               <p>alleged that the shares were improperly obtained; I did not hear that before—he was being pressed for money at that time, and could not raise it with<lb/>out securities; he had not securities—I was the recipient of a gratuity of 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of shares—I was to have had 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year salary, but I never received 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I have only received, as my books show, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the other goes into a matter of account; I have an account against it—the shares that I had were to the nominal amount of 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was not the market-value.</p>

Price and Bowstead were not pressing the bankrupt for a large amount on 26th November, nor was Sewell—I think Sewell had been settled with at that time; he was pressing before that—on 7th December, Anderton was pressing him—that was the one I was mentioning last night, as having served a notice of bankruptcy or something of that sort; that was arranged—I know nothing of Giles and Co. pressing for money—I think the General Discount Company were pressing for their balance about that time—I think there were some pro<lb/>ceedings in that case; I think I remember paying some costs—Clemow was Anderton's solicitor—Captain Jameson was pressing—I don't exactly know the date; it was just before this—that was a claim in writing, not on behalf of the Railway Company; it was a loan made on the debentures of the Com<lb/>pany—I attended to these matters—that was the entire business, getting money for the affair—Jameson was pressing some time before Christmas—Captain Hay was also pressing, by the same solicitor, on another loan—there were some bills for timber, which I think were overdue—I know that appli<lb/>cations were made at the office, to Mr. Buckwell, for the payment of those bills—I was present—securities were given to the parties who held the bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not so much pressure, that on 16th December, you and Collins were present with the bankrupt when the clauses of the New Bank<lb/>ruptcy Act were read over and explained to the bankrupt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Really I cannot remember that—I can remember on one occasion Mr. Preston de<lb/>scribing the effect of the Act; the Act was referred to, and certain clauses picked out and read—I should imagine that was before Christmas—it was at the time we were being pressed by these different persons; that would be the cause of it—the telegrams from Charles Collins always came to Mr. Frank Collins, not to me—I should see them when I went into the office; but my duty was to be out all day lung, getting money on these securities</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020024"/>
               <p>—Collins would be more familiar with that part of the amount of shares was given to Mr. Hoffman, as security for the timber, and that was arranged in that way—Anderton's claim was arranged by deben<lb/>tures, and with regard to Captains Hay and Jameson, they have debentures in their possession to twice the amount of their claim—the General Discount Company had no security, but it was a very much reduced account; it was nearly paid off—Sewell has been settled with, Masterman's not, but they have a very large quantity of shares deposited with them, representing in value the full amount, supposing they could be sold at their nominal value—Captains Hay and Jameson's security was debentures—they were pressing for their money, notwithstanding they had been deposited—the Novara and Lake Orta Railway Company have refused to allow the shares to be dealt with, not the debentures—there was a dispute between the bankrupt and the Company as to their right to interfere—the bankrupt claims a large amount of the Company, and the Company make a claim of him of about the same amount—he disputed their right to interfere with the transfer of the shares—if his claim on the Company had been paid, there would have been plenty to discharge all these claims.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed by the bankrupt, at 26, King William-street—my duties chiefly referred to the contracts and correspondence, from the commencement of Mr. Buckwell's contract for making the railway—I was acquainted with him before; I had some few dealings with him, that was all—I corresponded with Charles Collins, who represented Mr. Buck<lb/>well in Italy—I corresponded with him under the control and with the sanction of Mr. Buckwell—that was for the most part of 1861—I received not only letters but telegraphic messages from him, and also frequently sent them to him in the middle of the year—some of the messages received from him were kept in the office, and in some instances copies were kept of those I sent to him—there was a telegram-book kept in the office, supplied by the telegraph company—letters which came from Charles Collins, on Mr. Buck<lb/>well's account, were also kept in the office—copies of some of those sent to him were entered in a letter-book, probably the great bulk of them—I very frequently used to write without keeping a copy—if I sent any letter of importance, of course I should have it copied—the letter-book was kept in the office—there was no other book kept in the office besides the tele<lb/>gram-book and the letter-book, except the bill-book; I mean in my office, in the office generally—Mr. Buckwell had a banking account at Master<lb/>man's; that was besides the one that Mr. Cadogan had; it was at the same banker's, Masterman—the account was in Mr. Buck well's name before Mr. Cadogan was associated with him; that was up to the spring of 1861—Mr. Buckwell's account then virtually ceased, and Mr. Cadogan's account commenced—I had an account at the Bank of London—there was money which was paid on Mr. Buckwell's account, paid into my account; it was my account—money received for matters connected with Mr. Buckwell was very frequently paid into my bank—as I received them I paid them in to my account, some sums; and then I drew out that account when I wanted to pay matter for Mr. Buckwell and for myself—the account was so situated that generally the moneys I received on the part of Mr. Buckwell were, in fact, due to myself; therefore it was my account—I don't say that was always the case—he was generally in my debt, for advances and salary—my appointment with Mr. Buckwell was at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, at first—my position was improved nominally afterwards—I tendered my resignation to Mr. Buckwell on two occasions, and at the time of the formation of the</p>

               <p>remained in the office, or when I last saw it—I cannot say how long before the bankruptcy; it might have been four months, I really can't recol<lb/>lect—the letter-book had got overlooked when the messenger came—my attentioon was particularly drawn to it by a letter from Mr. Dangerfield—the messenger might be included amongst those who overlooked it—if it was my duty, or Mr. Buckwell's, to deliver up the papers in his possession, it must have been overlooked by each party—they were small books—there was more than one; I don't know how many there were—there must have been two or three—they all had letters torn out of them—that might have been a few weeks after the messenger overlooked them; the messenger did not remain in possession, nor any one—the messenger did not apply to me personally for books; I was not there when he came—I don't recollect his applying to me for books to be given up; he may have—at all events, if he did, I did not give him the letters; I overlooked them; I did not think of it—I did not continue to correspond with Charles Collins after the bank<lb/>ruptcy, not for the first few weeks—I have corresponded with him occa<lb/>sionally since the bankruptcy, but not for some weeks after, because Mr. Bucker well conducted his own correspondence; I think not at that office—I can't say whether any letters on business were written there after that—no letters, to my knowledge, were entered in the letter-book after the bankruptcy—the letters of Charles Collins, sent to me after the bankruptcy, were not kept in the office—no telegrams were entered after that, to my knowledge, nor any telegraphic messages kept—I did not interfere so much with Mr. Buckwell's business in 1862, and I am not, perhaps, capable of giving you the information which you think I am; I had other business to attend to, new business to me—I do not remember attending a meeting when the Bankruptcy Act was read over to Mr. Buckwell—I have no recollection of having heard it read at any particular time—I think I remember some clauses being read over; I think that was about a month before Christmas—there were some claims being made upon Mr. Buckwell at that time—I think I had some communication with him on the subject of the demand in bankruptcy; that was, I think, at the end of 1861—there were one or two matters of the kind, and it is probable that I consulted with him, or communicated the matters to him, at the time of the occurrence—I may have spoken to him about it in 1862, I should think it very likely; but these things referred more to Mr. Cadogan—I don't remember whether I brought to his attention the fact of a demand in bankruptcy having been made in 1862—I am quite sure that I was in communication with him in some way or other upon this subject, but I ban no particular recollection of bringing to his recollection, in 1862, the demand made by Mr. Dangerfield on behalf of his client—I recollect Messrs. Price &amp; Bowatead pressing; I went down to Mr. Preston's about that—I think it is very likely that I mentioned that to Mr. Buckwell as soon as he came from Italy, but I have no particular recollection of doing so—I was very little with Mr. Buckwell at that time, and saw very little of him—I don't know what has become of the letters since the bankruptcy; they came from Charles Collins, addressed to me—I gave them to Mr. Buckwell from time to time, as they arrived; I would rather not specify the number; there were a number, twenty or thirty probably—I handed them all over to Mr. Buck<lb/>well without reading or opening them; they were for him under cover to me—I handed him the telegrams also, if there were any—when he was in England I did not open the letters—he was occasionally at the office after the bankruptcy, and elsewhere among his friends—part of the time he was living with me—a considerable part of the time he was in the North—his</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you mean that it was your office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had an independent business besides my connexion with Mr. Buckwell—he had the greater part of the office—I considered one room mine more especially, but he had the run of the whole—before he was engaged by this railway, we occupied these rooms, each paying a moiety of the expense, and so it re<lb/>mained until he took other offices at the same place; he had some additional rooms, still continuing to have the use of a portion of mine and to pay half the expense, in fact, he undertook to pay all the expenses; as he went on a little further in 1861, the business got more flourishing—to the best of my belief a great number of the letters which had been in the letter-book were handed over to the assignees—my attention was drawn to it by a letter some time after the messenger had been—I then gave the letter-books bodily to Mr. Buckwell, who I heard give instructions to his clerk, Mr. Raftery, to endorse them and send them to the assignees—I do not know of any letters which at that time were not sent to the assignees—I have not since seen what letters were in the possession of the assignees—I don't remember any particular occasion when the bankrupt took away letters with him to Italy; he took some on all occasions—I did not mean to infer that there was one occasion in particular—I don't remember any particular time when a large number were taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to state, from your knowledge of the letters, whether there was any necessity for those letters in Italy in consequence of any disputes he might have with the railway company there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe that was the intention he had in taking those letters out—I knew it to be the fact that he meant to prosecute claims and rights which, as he imagined, he had against the company out in Italy—he had a <hi rend="italic">status</hi> there which he felt he had not here, and he thought it was necessary to have some of the letters in order to prosecute those claims with effect—I should think that would be so from what I knew of the nature of the letters; I should think every information he could get would be necessary for him.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were these measurements made under your super<lb/>vision? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was an agreement entered into in writing—that is in Italy—it was made with the bankrupt's agent, Collins—the works were commenced on many parts of the line, but in no part finished—there was about five miles not commenced—there was nothing done, but the works were commenced over a large area—work was done over somewhere about eighteen miles—I don't know whether the contract is in Court—I believe Mr. Buckwell had to supply the land in parts, and pay for it—land is expensive in Italy; it varies from half a franc to a franc per lineal metre—I had furnished to me receipts of land that he had purchased, and they amounted to about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not included that in the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor save I included anything for plant and materials on the line—there was a large quantity of plant at Novara.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">MR. METCALFE. Q.</hi> Was there anybody who surveyed the line on the part of Charles Collins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there was a measurement made by a person on behalf of Collins—I did not see Collins myself—a measurement was taken by some other person than myself; I was not present when it was taken—the whole length of the line, according to the contract, is something like twenty-seven miles; of that no part was done; but over the whole of the line some works had been commenced by Government, but they were in an unfinished state—the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have spoken of refers to the works on the line alone, works actually done—there were no materials used in making it—there was the earthwork and such brickwork as was done, the repairing of the road, which was a portion of the contract, and there was a little ballast—there were about 130 tons of rails lying on the line near Borgo Maniero—there were no other materials on the line, not placed ready for laying—I can only make a very vague statement as to the whole amount expended, including the purchases of land, plant, and materials; but I should think there might be about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I should be sorry to state that as the outside—I have included rails, timber for sleepers, some waggons, a certain amount of bolts and other fastenings, chain, fishes, and so on, the general plant for making and laying a line of railway, every source of expenditure connected with a railway.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the company's office on 10th September—I did not receive any debentures that day—they were not delivered till some time after; it may have been four or five weeks after—I received them, and signed for them—it is my belief that I received 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—a few days prior to 10th September, or on the morning of that day, the pri<lb/>soner told me that he was required to furnish a certificate—he said he could furnish them with the certificate of the Government engineer if they desired it, he was so confident of the work—I heard from him that the debentures would not be issued without a satisfactory certificate, a certificate of some extra amount of work done on the line subsequent to the last—about 52,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of debentures had been issued previous to this 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—those were the last debentures I received; and there had been sham to the amount of 59,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but they were issued by the old company, pro<lb/>moting, not the present company—that is 59,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in nominal value—I knew they had been issued to Mr. Buck well—I think I went to the office about a week after 10th September—we were waiting for this certificate—he went there, in pursuance of some request, to see the directors about the issue of some more debentures, to satisfy them as to the work done—I under<lb/>stood from him that he could give them a satisfactory certificate of the work done; if they required it, he could give them the Government engineers—I was in the room on one or two occasions; but I never heard any promise of that kind in the room, or any resolution about the issue—the prisoner after<lb/>wards told me that 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of debentures would be issued, and he desired me to look after them when he went to Italy—he left directions for them to be given to me—I merely understood that he had satisfied the directors to induce them to issue them—there was some delay in getting the certifi<lb/>cate; it was mislaid in the company's office, and I remember directing a telegram to be sent to Mr. Buck well to forward it—I had no conversation</p>

               <p>with him about it afterwards, he went away to Italy so quickly afterwards to go on with the work—I understood he was going to send a certificate; he told me so—I can't remember how shortly after that he returned—he was very seldom away more than three or four weeks—I had no further conver<lb/>sation with him about the certificate soon after his return; I had subse<lb/>quently, a considerable time afterwards, when there was some dissatisfaction at the office about it—he then said that the two men signing the certificate were the best men to certify to the works that were done there; one was an engineer, and the other had charge of the goods, and knew the value of the goods that were put on the line—I did not learn from him, in the first instance, who Harry Fisher was—I think I mentioned to him who I had heard he was; that I understood he was the son of the sub-contractor, not an engineer, and that he was described as a very young man; I don't know the age—it was then that he said he was a very fit man to certify, because he had charge of all the goods on the line, and knew their value—I think he admitted that he was the son of the sub-contractor, but I really don't remem<lb/>ber exactly what he said—he did not deny it; he tacitly admitted it—I have seen Harry Fisher once within the last six months; I should fancy he was more than 19, I should say from 20 to 22—he is not an engineer that I know of—I have no knowledge—he certainly could not be the Government engineer—I do not, of my own knowledge, know who Del Papa is—I knew from Mr. Buck well that he was employed by him on the line as an engineer, and had been for some time—I have heard more than once from Mr. Buck<lb/>well, that he was employed on the line as an engineer or a surveyor; I do not discriminate between the two; he was engaged upon engineering works—the certificate was shown to me at the office some month or two after the date of it, after I had received the debentures—Mr. Buckwell was not then present—I am not aware that it was shown to him on any occasion—I have no recollection of mentioning to him the fact that I had seen it—I do not remember being present in the board-room when there was a conversation about a telegram—I remember taking a telegram which they said was insuf<lb/>ficient; Mr. Buckwell was not there then—I don't recollect Mr. Buckwell laying anything more about Fisher than I have mentioned—I remember calling his attention to the certificate signed by Fisher, and that the com<lb/>pany were not satisfied with it, and it was then he said that Fisher was the proper man—I don't remember that he told me who in particular had sent over the certificate, or who had obtained it—I think I understood from him that it was Charles Collins.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 141 <hi rend="italic">H</hi>). About half-past 6 on the morning of 29th December I was on duty in Bethnal Green-road, near the Bell beer-shop, and saw the prisoners Attill (that is Goodland), Crane, and Lawrence; I cannot speak so confidently of Wright, because he stood in the shade, bat I can swear to the other three—I had never seen them before—when I first saw them they were about 200 yards off, close to the beer shop; and when I went along they divided into twos, just before I got opposite them, on the opposite side—I went down as far as Abbey-street, crossed the road, and they got together again, but divided before I got up to them—I went up as far as Tyson-street, thinking to meet some plain clothes men, but did not—I returned as quick as I could, ran down Orange-street and Satchwell-street—this was about half-past 6 in the morning—I got into a narrow place, where there is a narrow path, at the back of the beer shop—I had my hat off, and crawled on my hands and knees eight or ten yards behind the beer shop wall—I saw Goodland on his hands and knees nearest to me, and Crane next to him; there were only two on their knees—Lawrence was standing two or three yards off, looking into Bethnal Green-road; Wright was in the shade, I did not see his features at all—Lawrence gave a low whistle when any one passed—Crane got up off his knees, just straightened himself, and went on—I heard the door of the beer shop go, and ran out and struck at Crane with my truncheon, as he was on his knees, but missed him—Lawrence started across the road, and I saw no more of him; but he looked after me, to see if I followed him—I got hold of Attill and struck him, either on the shoulder or head—he had hold of this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and struck me with it; then my hat fell off—I am not certain whether I hit him—I then closed with him, expecting to get another—we got down, and he got uppermost; I threw him off—he had hold of the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and I caught him by the throat—by that time the others came back; I could not say which, but two or three; and I can say that they were these men—I was then on the ground, but uppermost—they kicked me several times on the legs, but I cannot say which of them—I then wrenched the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> out of his hand—I lost my staff, and was bleeding very much—I called out for assistance, as I found myself getting much weaker—an old man came, and caught hold of Goodland—I let him get up, and took him as far as Gibraltar-walk, which is 200 yards—Crane and Lawrence were hustling me and trying to trip me up—I tried to get them into the coffee-shop, but could not because they got round the door—I got very weak, and could not stand—I received a fresh cut, and became so weak that I fell, and recollect nothing for a couple of days, when I found myself in bed at the station-house.</p>

               <p>before and sometimes after me—one of us is usually left in the shop while the other is at dinner—after writing "registered" on the letter, I put it in the till-drawer, where I put registered letters—it remained there till 2 o'clock, at which time I sent the letters from our office to the Western office—I made up the bag and a bill of the registered letters that are dis<lb/>patched—this one, with "Mrs. Taylor, Beverley-terrace, Colchester," on it, was made up by me, and dispatched about 3 o'clock to the Western office—I tend a list of all registered letters—I tied up the letter with green tape, longways and across—I should have done that before I went to dinner—I had not bad my dinner when the letter was brought to be registered—I tied it up before I went to dinner—I never left them untied before going to dinner—the tape is easily slipped off by doubling the letter; it is not fastened to the letter—we keep a quantity of that green tape in the shop, and alto a bottle of gum,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where is the gum kept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally in a cup<lb/>board behind the counter—I should not think that a person going to that cupboard must be observed by any one else in the shop—I cannot remember whether the prisoner went to dinner before or after me—he would go out at the shop door when he went to dinner—I do not recollect his ever going to dinner at the same time as myself and leaving Mr. Stevenson in the shop—I do not remember whether I left Mr. Stevenson behind the counter when I went to dinner that day; I believe he was there—it is usual for him to be there at the time I go to dinner—he carries on the business of a stationer and bookseller—what with that and the post-office business there it pretty full employment for the persons behind the counter—Mr. Stevenson occa<lb/>sionally goes into the little compartment where the registered letters are—with close observation he has, while serving behind the counter, the oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing what I am doing at the registered letter drawer—there is glass round the compartment—another registered letter went by that same post; I am not sure whether I received that one—the prisoner has been about twelve months in that employment with me—I know he was engaged in similar employment before that—I am generally absent about half an hour at dinner.</p>

I am a bookseller, at 99, Oxford-street, and keep the post-office there—on 5th January, I had only Fuller and the prisoner employed in the shop—it was the prisoner's duty to be in the shop while Fuller was at dinner—I have no recollection of the 5th January, or of this letter being registered—it is part of the prisoner's duty to attend to the registered letters—I do so myself occasionally; all are obliged to assist occasionally—I never heard from the prisoner on 5th January, or on any subsequent day, till he was taken in custody, that he had found any 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes.</p>

I am a clerk in the service of this company—on 10th February, a communication was made to me by Mr. Herring, and I went to look for Coppins' cart, but could not find it—I then went to the window of the counting-house, and found Coppins waiting there for his change—I asked him where his cart was—he said, "In Crawshay's yard?"—I then requested him to come with me to where his cart was—I went to Crawshay's yard, and it was there—I asked him what metal he had in his cart, and he said, "Seven hundred weight"—I then requested him to take his cart back to our premises and have the metal re-weighed—I saw four hundredweight weighed, and then there was a surplus left in his cart—I said, "You must have known eleven shillings would not pay for seven hundredweight"—he said, "It is not my fault if you don't take enough"—Crawshay's yard would not be an improper place for the cart to wait—he Would not go there unless to had some business there—it is a private yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and assist him in his business—on 14th August I had an interview with the prisoner and New<lb/>man at our warehouse in Bradford—Mr. Pearson said, "This is Mr. Newman, of the firm of Newman &amp; Co., of London, and be wants to look out a lot of winseys"; that is a sort of woollen goods—they both came in and looked out some goods—I said to Pearson, "Have you brought us any money down to-day?" and he replied, "Mr. Newman and myself have made arrangements for paying 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within a fortnight"—before they left Pearson said, "These goods must be sent off to-night, as they must be shipped to-morrow"—I sent the goods off the same night, amounting to 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion—on 27th September I came up to London, and went to Mr. Pearson's place in Noble-street—I saw him there, and told him I had come about some money, and I went down with him to Newman's—I don't know what the amount was at that time; we wanted about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I said to him, "We want 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to help us on for a week or two"—when we got to Newman's he said, "Stop there; I will tell you when to come in"—after waiting outside for about half an hour, he called me in, and Newman said, "I suppose you are after the money?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, I have got a tele<lb/>graph this very morning from Florence that a large sum of money is upon the road, and if you will wait a few days you shall have every farthing of your money"—I asked for cash, and he brought a drawer full of bills out, and put on the table—he said, we could have the whole account, if I had a mind to take it out of the bills—I said, we did not want any more bills, we wanted cash; we would have nothing but cash—he said nothing particular to that—I could get nothing—I afterwards came up to London again, saw Pearson, and said I had come up for some money—he told me to look in again in the morning—he said he could not get above 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day, and I saw him seal a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque in an envelope—I saw the cheque in his hand; it was one of his own drawing, on the London and Westminster Bank—he enclosed it in an envelope, and sealed it in my presence—he said he should be receiving a large sum the day after—the cheque was not pay<lb/>able in London; he was going to send it down to my father at Bradford—he said he would send another 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up in the morning—I was not going back the same day, the day after; that was soon after 27th September, the second time I came up—I came up in July first; nothing particular was said then—that cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid—we got nothing—when I got home, no cheque had come; it did not come at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, carrying on business at Earl's Heaton, in Yorkshire, about a mile from Desubpœnaedbury—I first knew Pearson in the last week in August, and in August and September I supplied him with goods to the amount of about 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newman was with him at the time—previous to their buying any goods Johnson came down—when Pear<lb/>son and Newman came, they said, "We want some blankets for Garibaldi's army"—I told them that Garibaldi was captured, and they would not require the blankets—they said that made no difference—the order would have to be completed, and they would get paid for the blankets the moment after the shipping-warrant was signed—they referred me to Bradford as a refe<lb/>rence—I was satisfied with the party they referred to, and I let one lot of blankets go, to the amount of 192<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and their payment was either four months' bill net cash, or payment on the second Thursday in October, at 2 1/2 per cent, discount—I sent that lot of goods up on 30th August, by Mr. Pear<lb/>son's order, to Alcock's, in Old Change—in the course of a few days Pearson sent down for the other lot by letter; I will produce it directly—I sent them to the North-Western Railway-goods station to my own order.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living at 12, King-street, Cornwall-road, Lambeth—in the summer of last year, I was in the service of Newman, at Fenchurch-street—I went there between May and June, and was there until he was taken into custody—I believe he was pressed for money at that time—people made applications for money at the office repeatedly—a sheriff's officer came amongst others—I remember on one occasion, when the sheriff's officer came when Newman was there, he got under the desk—I told the sheriff's officer that he was out; that was by his direction—he played hide-and-seek in that way on several occasions—I put off creditors in the best way I could—a great many goods came to the office from Mr. Pearson's, Noble-street—we used to have to go to Pearson's for them, and they were then sold to different persons—some were taken to Mr. Christy's, in Water-line, shipping agent—I did not receive any money from Mr. Christy—Mr. Newman was generally there to receive the money himself—I have seen Pearson at Newman's several times, two or three times a-week—he was not there at any time when there were applications for money—I never saw them go out together—Mr. Pearson used generally to come there in the middle of the day, and used to go out by himself generally.</p>

               <p>Pearson say to Newman, "If you will send me up the goods, I will get you the money"—I have heard them frequently angry with one another, high words sometimes—they used to send me out of the office—I think the last time I heard them having high words was in October—I believe after that Newman went down to Bradford and came back again—Pearson was at Newman's after that, late of an evening—I went away at 5—I cannot speak about the conversations—goods were fetched from Pearson's to New<lb/>man's after October.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, at Stutley-terrance, Camden-town—on 12th February, about a quarter to 4 in the morning, I was rung up by a policeman—I got up, went down, opened the front-door, and let him in—we afterwards went into the yard—the police<lb/>man looked in the dust hole, which is a kind of shed, and there found the Prisoner; I saw him bring him out—I had gone to bed at half-past 1, but at a quarter to 1, I went into the back premises and fastened it up—the house was all right—there was no one in the tap-room—the prisoner was not intoxicated—the glass of the fan-light over the back-door was broken; it was quite sound when I went to bed—the steps were in the yard when I went to bed; I found they had been moved and placed close to the fan<lb/>light, so that anybody at the top of those steps might have broken it—I had</p>

               <p>locked the parlour-door over night outside—I found that had been cut away to enable him to get the lock back, but he had not cut away sufficient to do so—he must have got into the parlour through the window; and as he could not open that door, he must have got out of the window again, and then broken the fan-light to unlock the top-bolt of the back-door—the parlour-window was open—no property was missing on this occasion—the house had been entered on the Sunday previous, and somebody had evidently been in the house on this night.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 17, Hertford-place, Com<lb/>mercial-road—on Thursday night, 12th February, at half-past 10 o'clock, I was called to a Chinese on the pavement in Narrow-street—a portion of his intestines were protruding through his clothes—I undid his clothes and found a large wound in his abdomen—I carefully put in the bowels and covered them, had him strapped to a shutter, and removed to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—the deceased was brought there about half-past 10 or rather later, with a wound in his abdomen—the greater part of the contents had already escaped; the intestines were out in three places, and in one place they were nearly severed—it is quite possible that those three cuts might be the effect of one thrust—there was a great deal of hemorrhage, and he died thirteen days afterwards, of peritonitis caused by the wound—there was also a trivial incised wound on the right shoulder—I have heard that the prisoner said he was endeavouring to wrest the knife from the deceased, and he turned it and cut himself—I think that is possible—the wound was three inches and a half long—this knife would not produce it.</p>

I am a Chinese Missionary—on 13th February, I went to the London Hospital to see the deceased, and while I was there Mr. Selfe arrived; the prisoner was also brought in, and there was another Chinaman present—the deceased then made a statement in English, which I interpreted to the prisoner, but not in his native dialect—he is a Canton man, and speaks the Canton dialect; the other was a Tonquin man, and I understood that dialect imperfectly—the deceased complained of not under<lb/>standing me in two or three sentences, but I continued to repeat untill he assented or denied; but his assent or denial was not taken down—he made replies to every statement, either assented or denied—what the deceased said was taken down in my presence—I do not remember seeing the Magis<lb/>trate sign it.</p>

I was going in a ship as cook to Shanghai; prisoner was going in our ship as cook; at 9.30 last night I went to prisoner's house; I saw him there; I asked him to come to my house in Limehouse; he said, 'No, not to-night.' I went back to Limehouse, and in five minutes he came to my place; the master of the house, his wife and two children, were there; his name is Blumber; prisoner said, 'Ahqui, you go and buy opium'; I said, 'No, I'll not go, you go yourself; I said, 'It's too late, I've walked till I'm tired, I'll not go'; the master was there at the time; prisoner asked me again to go out at half-past 10; I went with him; we were good friends up to that time; we walked four or five streets, when he said in Chinese, 'God d—you,' and he took a long knife from his pocket and gave me two blosubpœnaed, one in the belly and the other on the left shoulder. I had had no quarrel with him, no angry words, no blosubpœnaed; I ran away from him and called, 'Policeman'; I ran till I fell down; I never was in London before, and I don't know the street, but it was near some water where he struck me; the prisoner is the man. I had taken away a coat from his place last evening; it belonged to me; it had never belonged to the prisoner; I had lent it to him two weeks ago, and I took it back yesterday; he never said it was his coat: he didn't object to my taking it away; I don't know why he struck me; he said nothing; we had been good friends; I have never hindered him from going as cook in any ship; I don't know that prisoner was ever in the Strangers' Home, in the West India-road; the first time that ever I saw him was when he came to my ship; it is a very bad wound; I am in great pain; I don't know whether I shall get well again").</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follosubpœnaed</hi>; "It is the first: I have never been in England before; Ahqui has been in Eng<lb/>land several times; I came in the same week that he did; I came on Tuesday, and he came on Thursday; he came on Saturday and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the week after I lent him another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the third week, Saturday, I lent him another half-sovereign; the fourth week, Sunday, I lent him another half-sovereign; the fifth week he asked me to lend him a watch to go out in the street; he borrowed it, and went and pawned it; six weeks I got discharged from a vessel, and went to the Sailors' Home; Ahqui came again to No. 1, Lime house, and asked me to lend him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I went to the Sailors' Home and stayed there a fortnight, and got a steamer to take me home; I then went to Ahqui and asked him for the money and watch I lent him, back again; Ahqui said, 'You go home in that steam boat, I've got no money to pay you nor the watch'; Ahqui said, 'I'll find you another vessel to go home to China, then I'll give you back the money and watch'; I said, 'If I don't go home in the steamboat to China, Mr.—will not let me have my luggage to go anywhere'; Ahqui said, 'If Mr.—Won't let you take your luggage, you take it yourself'; I said 'if I move out I've no money to live by'; Alqui said 'You move out I'll give you money to * with.' I left the Sailors' Home and went to the Highway; then Ahqui never came ashore for a fortnight after this, and never gave me any money, and I had nothing to eat; then I went to his vessel and asked him for the money and watch; when I went into the galley to find him, Ahqui went into the cabin and told the captain and first-mate to turn me ashore; I went three times and they turned me out of the ship, and I went to the next vessel; I had no money and nothing to eat, and pawned all my best clothes to keep myself; then I went to the Dockyard to find a vessel</p>

               <p>to go to sea, and I found a Chinaman, called Chulau Fak; he introduced me to a captain, and wages as cook at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; then Ahqui went to the captain and told him not to have me; he told him I could not speak English, and could not do the work; then Ahqui got my place; Thursday Ahqui came to my home, and asked me to lend him some more money; I had only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket; I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he said, 'It's too little'; Ahqui went into the street and came back again; he then went to my room to got a coat to pawn, and took the coat away; I said, 'That coat does not belong to me; he took it, and went and pawned it; I waited till night and get it out again; I waited till 8 o'clock, and then I went to find him at 10 o'clock; I found him in the Highway talking to some girls, and said, 'Ahqui, get that coat,' and he said, 'Very well, I'll go with you'; we walked down the Highway to Limehouse, past the bridge, talking together, and I told Ahqui, 'You don't give me watch or money; you might get that coat back again for me'; then Ahqni said, 'That coat does not belong to you; I'll do nothing of the sort', and struck me in the face; then I struck him back again and knocked him down; then Ahqui got up and took a knife and tried to stab me; I defended myself, and got bold of his wrist and turned it back with the knife in his hand and out his belly; then I saw him fall, and took the knife out of his hand and gave him a stab in the shoulder, the left hand; if Ahqui was not dead, he could prove that it was his knife, and that he bought it before Christmas. Ahqui asked a Chinaman to lend him money; he would not, and Ahqui stabbed him in the arm; that Chinaman went away a month ago; the old Chinaman that lives under the railway arch can prove it; I have got nothing more to say."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Queen-street-place—between 12 and 1 on Friday morning, 30th January, I was in the Silver Lion public-house, Poplar—I came out with George and John Mann, and bade them good<lb/>night at the corner of Mary-street—five or six foreign sailors came past; Blanco and Paraleo are two of them—a piece of bread was thrown at me which hit a young man in the face, who said, "What is the meaning of that" and threatened to lock them up—the man halloed out to me, "Look out, Charley, they have got their knives"—the man then ran away, and they all ran after him—I tried to run, but had not the chance, for Blanco stabbed me on the arm—I saw a knife in his hand by the light in a coffee-shop window, which was open—Paraleo then came and stabbed me on the back part of the thigh, as I was making my way into the coffee-shop—I fell against some shutters—I saw Paraleo about an hour afterwards at the nation-house, but did not see Blanco till the following Friday week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Blanco.</hi> All that the witness says is false, I have not touched a knife for the last five months, not since I have been ashore; I threw mine over<lb/>board. He asked me whether I was a Spaniard or an Englishman; I replied, "I am a <hi rend="italic">Cherino.</hi>" Another man, Francisco, who was a little intoxicated, said, "I am a Spaniard." He was cutting a piece of bread. The witness spoke to him, and Francisco said, "What a fine mark I have!" and threw the bread at him, to show how well he could hit him, and walked with me down the street. The witness followed Francisco and hit him on the head with something, I cannot say what; and caught him by the shoulder and began to stab him. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, That is not true; you are the man that stabbed me, not Francisco.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bajadera.</hi> I was in the street with my shipmates, and the police ran after us and took us to the station; they searched us, but found no knives or daggers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Marcham.</hi> I came out of the Spanish boarding-house with Martinez, Blanco, and Francisco; there were three others behind them, about twenty yards apart; Francisco was a little intoxicated, and was making a noise. We heard some person shouting "Police 1 and Blanco came running after us; the policeman laid his hand on me, and I have had a month and six days' imprisonment, and do not know what it is for. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, Some were not ahead of the others; they were all together.</p>
               <p>

               <p>the charge was, that I might tell the commander of the frigate where they were; but they looked me up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Paraleo.</hi> After 12 o'clock I was by myself, going to the dock-gate. The second commander knocked at the gate, the policeman opened the wicket, and we both went in together and went on board. After I was asleep Francisco Leman came alongside my bunk and said, "I have my head all split; I have had a frightful row on shore." In the morning he had got the hair off his head, and had shaved his whiskers, leaving his moustache on; he hid himself in the hold, and no officer knew that he was on board. He had a pair of easy boots on, and a blue sailor's shirt. He took them off and put on a dress-coat, black-cloth trousers, and light boots, and went ashore, and I have never seen him since. Seven days after the police came on board, and I went and asked the commander whether I went on board with him or not. He said that I did. They asked the prosecutor whether he knew me or not, and he said, "I do not know, I think so." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I noticed as he walked up and down that he was knock-kneed—I was not uncertain; I saw his face before he ran away—he owned that he had shaved—(<hi rend="italic">The gaoler examined the prisoner, and stated that he had never been shaved on the checks and had never had whiskers</hi>)—the second man who stabbed me had whiskers on his chin—he did not wear a moustache on his upper lip, only on his chin—when I saw him at the station he had been fresh shaved—anything be<lb/>sides a moustache I call whiskers.</p>

On 30th January, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 1, I heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!"—I pro<lb/>ceeded to the spot, and saw all the prisoners—there were seven men altogether; five were close together, and were running; the other two were behind, and were walking sharp—I stopped Blanco and Marcham—Bajaders was stopped by a civilian—I received this knife (produced) from the female witness, and I got this other knife at the station—none of the prisoners had knives when they were taken—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Aricka</hi> next morning; it is a Peruvian Government transport—when I took Paraleo, I asked him to go and put his coat on—he did so, and was immediately apprehended by Holford—I told him it was for stabbing a man in High-street, Poplar.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R C. S. I live at 3, Eascott-place, East India-road—I was sent for to the police-station, and found the prosecutor suffering from two wounds on the right arm, and one on the right thigh; they were not dangerous—either of these knives would inflict them—the deepest was about half an inch deep, and an inch and a half long—they were not given with very great violence—there was no bone to stop them from going deeper; they were quite in the flesh—it is not a sharp instrument, but it went through the clothes—I think it was done by a quiet <hi rend="italic">job</hi>—if there had been a great deal of violence used, it might have gone through the flesh—the wounds in the arm were about the same, but they were not in dangerous parts.</p>

After me was coming Francisco, who is on board the <hi rend="italic">Aricka.</hi> Some of the men made a faint noise with their mouths at me and then the men began to cry out 'Police!' but I did nothing at all. Francisco was coming along, eating bread, and was wild that they made such a noise at him, and threw the bread. It was very dark, and some one cried out, 'Oh my God!' Some of them came and gave Francisco a blow on the head, and knocked him on the ground, and I was surprised. I had no knife, and I have witnesses to prove that I walked about without a knife and that I had only a pair of slippers in my hand on that occasion. Fran<lb/>cisco</p>

               <p>had a knife, eating bread, when he was knocked down; and when on the ground, he pricked the man that attacked him with the knife. I saw him stab him. I am sure it was Francisco. I have been only aboard a day and a half, and do not know his other name. <hi rend="italic">Bajadera says</hi>: I was walking with my comrades, and talking in our language. Twenty paces behind us somebody was running, and we heard voices cry 'Police!' and did not take notice, and they began following us up, and we were taken in custody. We gave our<lb/>selves up. <hi rend="italic">Marcham says</hi>: I left my lodging-house, in the Highway, with two of my companions, Bajadera and Martinez, and behind us was Francisco, who was very sick, drunk-sick, and Francisco was making a noise. As I wanted to get aboard, I was in front, no great distance off, and heard cries of 'Police!' and Blanco came up and joined us; and the police came up and caught hold of me and Blanco, and we went with them; I had no knife." <hi rend="italic">Martinez says</hi>: I know no more of it than what Marcham has said. <hi rend="italic">Paraleo says</hi>: I left the dock to visit the public-houses, and came up to the dock-gate, and after me the second commander. I had nothing to do with the affair. I went with my commander aboard. There is a man named Fran<lb/>cisco aboard; and while I was lying on my bunk on the Friday morning, with his head broken, and his clothes covered with blood."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Blanco's Defence.</hi> I have not carried a knife for the last fire months; the last I had I threw overboard. I know nothing about it; it was not me; it was Francisco. One of the sailors told me at the police-court that Francisco said he stabbed the man three times. On the night this occurred Francisco went ashore, and slept at the house of an Italian in the Highway.</p>

               <p>"Well, I will find you work for the purpose of stopping till this job is over"—I did not ask him for work then, nor when I met him coming from the factory—I had not asked his foreman for work before that time—I had not been in any work at all between leaving Mr. Bailey's and going back there again—I did not tell Mr. Bailey on that occasion that the foreman was a thief; I told him a trick that he had done; that he sold Ned Davis a pair of shoes, and credited him with the money three weeks, and when he could not pay him he raised his wages 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day for that week to pay for them, and then he took it off again, and he said there was no one like Davis in the shop; that is all I told Mr. Bailey about the foreman—Mr. Fairley is the foreman—I am at work at Mr. Bailey's now, and Mr. Fairley is still foreman—the last place I was at before Mr. Bailey's was Mr. Dudgeon's, the shipbuilder's—I had not been out of employment four or live weeks before Christmas—I left one place to go to the other—the conversation I had with Joe Davis going home from work was while I was working for Mr. Bailey—that was about a month before Christmas, when I had been there about a fortnight or so—I live in Poplar, and he lives in Limehouse, and we both had to come the same way—some scores of Mr. Bailey's men live in the same direction—there were only our two selves walking together on this occasion—we did not want any one else to hear us—if we met together at the gates we used to walk home together—sometimes it would be about once or twice a week that we went together—I was present when <hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Davis asked Joe Davis whether he had paid him for that 1 cwt., and he said he had—the conversation with Rosser which I have mentioned occurred a day or two after that; it was in the workshop; we work next to one another—about twenty men or so are working in that shop, I daresay—the whole of the conversation with Rosser was there—it was impossible for any one else to hear it; we were all six or seven yards apart, and Rosser and I were close together; and there is a large fan at work in the shop, so that they could not hear it—it was during work<lb/>ing hours—a foreman is present all day—we ceased working during the con<lb/>versation—we work by piece-work, and we often have a rest—it was before Christmas that I went to the Manchester Arms—we were in the public parlour there—I do not believe any one was there but the two Davis's, Rosser, Seagur, and myself—I saw Seagur given 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by each of them—nothing was said in the room about what that was for—going home I asked <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Davis what it was for—I did not ask either of the others—Seagur said before the Magistrate that the sixpences were a return of borrowed money—it was after that interview at the Manchester Arms, and before I went to the London Tavern, that I left my employment—I was not discharged—Mr. Fairley told me he was Black of work, and that I should have to look out another job at the end of the week; and at the end of the week he asked me to stay, but I would not—he did not give a different reason for my leaving—he told me if he had work he would keep me on as long as I liked to stay, and that if I liked to call at any time he would take me on—he said that he should not employ me, as I was too great a scamp—he never made any complaint against me—I know two persons named Belcher and Gregory—I did not send them to Joseph Davis, offering to stop away from this trial if he would give me a sum of money—Mr. Fairley has said that I lost a deal of time at my work—he has not complained to me while I was there of my mixing my day-work with my piece-work, and defrauding my employers—he has done so since this has been going on—he came up before the Magistrate and wanted to say so, but he never paid me for piece-work at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper to Messrs. West wood and Bailey—Seagur was assistant-storekeeper, under me—Davis and Rosser were rivet-makers in the same employ—Edward Davis was generally making bolts and nuts, but in the same department—these men would bring an order from the foreman for, perhaps, 4 or 5 cwt. of iron for each man to go on with his work, and then the iron would be taken from the store; not all at one time, but, perhaps, part at one time and part at another—having got out 4 or 5 cwt. of iron, they would make their rivets, and then they had to bring or send them down to me, and I should weigh them and book them for them, as they were working by piece-work—Saturday was pay-day—our week ended in the Wednesday night, and commenced on Thursday morning—from Thursday to the following Wednesday I should book the weights which come in on each day, and add up the totals which come in at the end of the week, and so make out the amount for them to send into the office to the pay-clerk—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing—the person to whom I give the account would go to the pay-clerk and receive the money—the book in which I enter the weights is kept in a little office in the store, not under lock and key; it is merely laid down with other books—I should not always be in that office; I should be away at meal-times; I live just by—Seagur's duty was to do anything that was required to be done—he had access to the room in which this book was kept—this original entry of 13th November is in my writing—I believe the entry of the weight of rivets, bolts, and things on that day to be 111lbs. it is now 211lbs.—it was not altered by me—the original entry on 21st November is 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 14lbs.; it now appears 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 14lbs.—that alteration was not made by me—the original entry on 24th November was 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 14lbs. the 1 cwt. is now altered to two—that was not altered by me—none of these alterations were made by me—on 1st December the original entry is 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 13lbs. it is now 2 cwt. 0 qrs. 13lbs.—on 6th December the entry was 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 12lbs.; it is now 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 20lbs.—on 3d January it was 1 cwt. 1 qrs. 20lbs.; it is now 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 20lbs.—I believe in several places where there were quarters a 1 has been added, but I cannot positively several to them—I think that the figures I have spoken to are not my writing—I used to com pare their book with mine on the Thursday morning before the pay came ON—I had to make a daily entry in my book—I did not compare theirs daily with mine—I should not get it above once or twice a week—I add up the whole sum on Thursday morning, and place it on the book to send it into the office—I did not observe the alterations when adding them up—they go into the totals—I then enter the totals into this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be taken to the pay-office—the person who is to get the money brings his book, and I see that his and mine correspond—he does not take this book to get the money; he takes a book that lie keeps, or a piece of paper—when an in order for iron is obtained from Fairley, I should see some of it go out at times, and when I was not there Seagur would.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you have been a long time in the service of this firm? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years last October—this book does not contains all the entries of those four years—I have had nothing to do with the iron</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020087"/>
               <p>till last October—I was storekeeper in another store—Edward Davis Was in the employment when I took to this department—the other men came just when I went into that department last October; I did not know any<lb/>thing about them before that—Edward Davis was a kind of head-man amongst them, the contractor—when Rosser and Joe Davis came, the foreman told me the work would be carried on, and Ned Davis would be a sort of foreman amongst them; the work would be all put down to his name, and the account made out in bit name—that was continued for about five or six weeks, and then there was a dispute amongst them—I should say Edward Davis was there at the time of these figures being altered, which I have pointed out—the account was made out in his name then—there would be a paper to show the amount of rivets brought in, after taking out the iron—that paper would not be left with me, they would take it away with them—I take the entry from my book and put it into theirs—it gets into—my book from the actual weighing—I won't say but what I may have made an error sometimes, and had to alter it—I am positive that the alteration on 13th November was not made by me—I am positive about those figures which I have spoken of—I cannot speak as to what the weights were but I see the figures are altered, and I know it is not my alteration—there are other figures altered in this book which I do not believe I ever altered, but I could not swear to them—I cannot point to any in particular that I have altered—here is one on 26th November that has been altered; I think I altered that—the summary which I made from the book I carried into the office to the pay-clerk—the entry in the cash-book is made from the sum<lb/>mary—the weight of the iron is generally put down according to the order not exactly as it goes out—as the order comes in from the foreman, for perhaps 5 cwt., there is generally an entry made of what iron has been ordered from the foreman, and then perhaps they may take out a couple of cwts., and then three—Edward Davis, the chief man, would not bring the order from the foreman; Rosser, or any other of the men, would bring it—it would not be in Edward Davis's name; it would be ordered out for the job—the men would draw small quantities till the whole amount of the order was out—they would not have any books showing the weights—of the iron—we should know when the amount of the foreman's order was—exhausted—I should not be always in the office, but Seagur would be there; and they would come and have their iron, and they would say, "We have had out that 5 cwt." and then they would bring another order—I should not say them that it was all out; they would say so to me—I did not keep an account exactly as they had it out; the account was kept from the order as it came from the shop—sometimes I have told the men I would let them have a cwt. on credit, and that they were to deduct it from next order—the rivets which came in were entered against the iron which went out—no deficiencies of iron brought back, as against the iron given out, would appear in this book—the office was open while I was away at meals—Seagur would have access to it; he was always there, and took his meals there—he had a little fire there—other people could go out besides him; he might come down while I was away—I have I heard that Edward Davis is cousin to Joseph Davis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pay-clerk to Messrs.

               <p>—this is the weight in this book—that includes the work of the two prisoners Davis and Rosser, not Edward Davis; he made bolts and nuts, and there would be another entry for that; this entry affects rivets only—Ed. ward Davis received their money, and his own also, for bolts—supposing these two "1's" to have been altered into two "2's," the excess is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per cwt.—the amount for the week ending 3d December is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid to Edward Davis for his own work, and the prisoners'; the weight corre<lb/>sponds with the entry in this other book—the excess received is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on December 10th the weight is 15 cwt. of rivets; that includes the altered item—the excess there is 1 cwt. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the rivets in that case are 7/8 rivets—on 10th December I paid Joseph Davis for his and Rosser's work only—on 7th January I paid to Joseph Davis, for 12 cwt. and 18lbs., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that includes the excess of 3d January, 1 cwt., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the weight is 16cwt. 27lbs., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that includes an excess of 1 cwt. paid to Rosser—I have contrasted the amount of rivets and bolts and manufactured articles with the amount of iron purchased—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is copied from the invoice—the iron purchased is 4 tons less than the rivets paid for—there is an excess of the manufactured article.</p>

"Police! and Police!" and while I was hallooing the prisoner tore out all my things, and snatched at my watch-chain and broke it in two—I had no watch—he got about four inches of the chain, and the key—the other man let me fall back after I had hallooed, and I came to the ground—they both ran away together till they came to the end of the alley, and then one went to the left and the other to the right—I got up instantly and pursued the prisoner, who was stopped by the policeman in my sight—I did not lose sight of him at all; I am sure he is the man—he had got about twenty yards when he stopped.</p>

               <p>in there were carpenters at work—there is no shop-front—Pettit had two small parcels in his hand when he entered—I saw him take them out of his pocket before he went in—they were wrapped in paper, but not tied up with string—one was in blue paper, and the other in light-coloured paper—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the parcels—I did not see Mrs. Thatcher on the 10th, nor did I know that the house was inhabited by her—I saw her on the 12th; I bad seen her before—I saw Crochevoix come out on the 10th in company with Pettit and another person—it was after they came out that Pettit gave these parcels over—I cannot tell what Crochevoix did with them—I was not watching him—I watched Pettit—they went together to Smithfield, and there they separated, and Crochevoix took the parcels away—I followed them to Smithfield—the parcels were in Crochevoix's pocket during that time—I did not take him on that occasion, because I did not know where Pettit was living; that was the reason I did not take Crochevoix, although I believed he had stolen property on him—I did not see him meet the other on the 12th—I saw Pettit go to the house again—I could not see inside on that occasion—I saw Mrs. Thatcher on that occasion—I went inside the house on the 12th, and also on the 10th—on the 12th I found Mrs. Thatcher and the servant there—Mrs. Thatcher was present when I saw the prisoner, and had the conversation which I have mentioned—I saw Pettit with the parcels before he went into the house; they were small parcels—he took them from his pocket—they were both wrapped, I believe, in white paper—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them, and these are the coverings—they were not both wrapped up together; one was in the brown paper, and one was in the light—I found these two in Crochevoix's pocket, both in the same pocket—I believe they are the parcels I saw Pettit take out of his pocket, but I cannot swear—I should think he was not three yards from me when he took them out—I do not know whether he saw me; be could if he had been looking—Crochevoix speaks very good English, as good as I do—I have not known him before, nor known anything against him—I might have seen him before, but not to observe him—I made a memorandum on the Tuesday and on the Wednesday, but not of the conversation—I can undertake to swear that the words I have used were the exact words used by Crochevoix—I could not have made a mistake; I have never made a wilful mistake in my life—I have never been certain of any statement that I have made, and afterwards found myself mistaken—when I took the parcels out of Crochevoix's pocket they were wrapped up rather more tidily than they are now; they were not loose—they contain one pair of elastic stockings, and two pairs of elastic knee-caps—he was wearing the same coat that he has now, I believe; it is the same colour—I did not find any money on him—another constable, who is here, searched him at the station—I do not know where Crochevoix lives; I believe he gave a false address—I have made no inquiries about his address—I did not find him lodging at Thatcher's; I do not know now that he was lodging there—I searched Thatcher's premises—I did not find any other things on them—I have seen Pettit meet Crochevoix when things did not pass between them—I have seen them meet two or three times.</p>

                  </hi> I lived at 53, Turnmill-street, at this time—I know Pettit well, and the other two prisoners a little—I have seen them frequently—I have seen Pettit and Crochevoix together at my house in Turnmill-street, but not Bruneau—I have seen Bruneau at times, but not there—I have seen him in company with Pettit—I have not seen any parcels brought to my home I did, on the Tuesday or Wednesday before he was taken in custody, receive a parcel from Pettit to give to Crochevoix; I believe it contained a waistcoat-piece—I did not open it—I gave it to Crochevoix that day—I received it near the Metropolitan Railway-station—Pettit said I was to give it to a person named Jules; I believe that is Crochevoix's Christian name—I gave it to Crochevoix as he was walking by the railway-station—I don't think Bruneau ever came to the house in Turnmil-street—the other house that I spoke of was where I lived before, a month or two ago—I have not known Bruneau visit Pettit at that house—he has not come to visit Pettit, he has come to visit me as well; I know his niece—I never knew of his meeting Pettit by appointment at my house, but he might have come there by appointment—he has never come to inquire for Pettit at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgical-instrument maker, at 239, Totten<lb/>ham-court-road—I have dealt occasionally with Mr. Laing—when I have wanted anything in a hurry, and could not get it from our makers, I have run in there and bought a single thing—I have not dealt with him as a cus<lb/>tomer—I do not know anything of Pettit—when I saw him at the police-court, I recognised him as having seen him at Laing's—I did not know him at a person in Laing's service; I only believed I had seen him there—I only know Bruneau by sight as the "Frenchman," not by any name—I have had dealings with him—I dealt with him two or three days before the police came to my place—I could not say whether it was the day before; I made no note of it—I am not certain of the day the police came—I bought from him a piece of oil-silk and eight dozen catheters—he came in the morning, some time before dinner, when I was engaged with a customer—he came up to the door, and a gentleman whom I had in the shop was showing me his artificial limb, and Bruneau could not come in at the shop-door—he went to the private door, and asked if he could see me; they said "No," that I was engaged; and then he left a parcel, and said he would call again—he give the parcel to my wife, who answered the door—she did not put it into my hands for about half an hour, for I was engaged—he came again in the evening, and that is the time he brought the catheters—I had not seen the Parcel and its contents till he came again; then I saw the contents—he asked me if I would buy it; I looked at it, and said, "How much for this?"—he said, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and at the rate of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross for the catheters—I paid him about a sovereign to the best of my knowledge—he did not come again</p>

               <p>at all after that—I should think I have bought little odd things of him, perhaps half a dozen times during the last year or year and a half; but I have bought of half a dozen different Frenchmen that have come during that time—I think, on one occasion, I bought two pairs of elastic stocking of him, but I do not remember the particular articles—I bought of the Frenchmen without asking their names, or taking any particular invoice, for sometimes they are men who come over to London and bring a few odd things to get their expenses for going to and fro—I do not ask them their names—I never received a parcel from Bruneau in the passage—the police<lb/>man says he saw me one day come down into the passage, but it is an error of his; it did not take place—I did not give up any other things to the constable; he took them without my permission—I did not buy those things from Bruneau—some of them I bought from other) people, whose names I shall not tell; it would be no advantage to other people to know—some of them, I believe, I bought of a Frenchman named Foltett, who used to be a workman for me, and therefore I know his name—he used to work for Mr. Laing as well—I believe Bruneau left a card once, about the first or second time he came to me; that would be perhaps a year and a half ago—there was a name and address on it of a company that were export and import merchants—I have looked for that card—as a rule we throw them away, or send them away on packing-boxes; but I searched for this one, as there was a possibility of its being wanted—I have not been able to find it—Bruneau said he travelled for a city-house, and had a commission—he is not one of those Frenchmen who come with a few things—I did not inquire his name, or that of the house, or take any invoice—it is not usual to do so.</p>

I am an engineer, and live at Cambridge-street, Old-Saint Pancras-road—on the night of 15th January, before going to bed, I secured the house in the usual way—I particularly noticed that the parlour-window was closed and fastened with the usual catch—the things in the room were in their usual order—I went to bed at half-past 10, and got up the next morning at a quarter to 6—I found the keys of the workshop removed from their usual place, and the house had been broken open—the parlour-window was wide open and the blind blowing outside—the shutten to that window were not closed the night before; a bar, or some piece of iron, had been pushed between the two meeting bars to push aside the fastening—I missed six silver tea-spoons, nine altogether, a little salt-spoon, a pair of tongs, a barometer, a case of instruments, a black overcoat, and some other things—several things were all ready to take away, but were not taken—I recognise these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as belonging to me—they were safe night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Cross and Gordon, tea merchants, 27, Rood-lane, City—there are several partners—the prisoner entered our service some time in October, 1861, as a commercial traveller—he travelled in the ordinary way, got orders for us, and we sent goods—he bad no fixed salary at that time; we advanced money to him from time to time, to try the trade as it were, to see whether he could make a business—he continued in that way until this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was entered into, on 11th March, 1862—it is signed by him—he was to act strictly as a traveller within the terms of that agreement—we owed him nothing then; the accounts were settled up to that time—the prisoner kept this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); he took it with him on his journey—it was his duty, on the receipt of money, to enter it in this book, and to enter on the other side the money he forwarded to us in London—if he paid any money to us on his return from his journey, he would have to enter it into this book—the agreement speaks of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for salary, and five guineas for travelling expenses—that was almost always sent to him by post-office order if he was in the country, and if he was in London it was remitted to him regularly—that was perfectly distinct from the money he received—he returned from one of his journeys on 23d or 24th January, and handed over to our cashier the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was entered in this book—on 27th January he called at our place of business—I saw him—this book was pro<lb/>duced and made up—463<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the gross amount he had received since the last settlement; it credits 429<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner merely said, as to the balance, that that was all the money he had got—I think there was one week's salary and travelling expenses owing to him at that time; that is entered there—we asked him what he had done with the re<lb/>mainder of the money—he said he had spent about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in horse-hire—we allowed him that, we could not help ourselves—he also said he had spent 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Christmas-boxes, and he said something about having to pay some rent—we said we should want to talk to him before he went on another journey—Mr. Cross spoke to him in my presence, and went through the ledger with him, in order that he might give explanations of the money owing which he had not accounted for—I think he called again on the fol<lb/>lowing</p>

               <p>was—we should have looked at If Mundle's account—if he did not send us the difference, we should presume that when the prisoner went on his next journey he would receive the balance—I am quite sure I did not receive the difference between 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—you must ask the cashier whether the prisoner paid any money about Christmas-time, I don't know—he paid this 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one sum—I can tell that the difference between 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not included in that, because he has not put it on the other side of the book—I knew that Kent was indebted to us 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Tilley 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot tell whether the prisoner sold on the last journey as much as five tons of chicory and coffee; I should think not—he was not to have half the profits of the sales of coffee and chicory unless his earnings were over 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, the date of the agreement—he said he had spent the money in travelling.</p>

I am an upholsterer; I have a shop at Knightsbridge, and live at the Pavilion, Ann's-place—I am landlord of the house, 24, Wheler-street, Spitalfields; I believe it was occupied as a shoemaker's shop—my agent had let it—I saw a quantity of boots and shoes there when I went—I remember going there and getting some boots, I don't know exactly how many, but I should fancy from seven to nine pairs; a girl put them up, and took an account of them—I suppose it was the last witness, but it was a dark night in November, and I could not recognise her again—I took them home—a person afterwards came for some, and took them away in a bag—I believe I sent her down to my private residence—certain boots were sent back—I really can't say whether they were some of those I had taken; I merely sent the woman to my private house—I never saw what she took away, or what were left—she came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she asked me for some money after she returned from the Pavilion; I suppose she had the bag of boots then—she asked me for some money to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she said she</p>

               <p>had no money to pay to go back—I did not notice who drove the cab—my wife had the boots that were kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You often took a good many boots for rent, and so on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have done so of a tenant in Knightsbridge, something like 1, 000 or 1, 200 pairs—I have a very large stock of boots by me now—I had never taken any boots from Wheler-street before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DEAR</hi>. I am the wife of last witness—I remember my husband bringing me some boots—I think it was in October—I selected three pairs from those he brought; one pair for myself, one for a child, and one for a servant; the remainder I put into the bag they came in, and gave them to the woman who fetched them—I afterwards gave a pair of boots to Baldwin; I believe it was one of the pairs that I had selected, but I am not quite certain about that—I don't think I had worn them—I had a summons once or twice before I attended before the Magistrate—I was in the country.</p>

Q.</hi> You say you are not certain it was one of those pairs that you gave to Baldwin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not be positive, because I put them with other boots—I had four or five pain in use, and I was not quite posi<lb/>tive about them—I had not four or five pairs in use; they were new boots, they were all together, and I selected these believing them to be those, but I could not be positive; I think they were the boots; the other boots I had were similar leather and elastic sides—I daresay it must have been two months after I took them out of the bag that I gave them to Baldwin.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Sunningdale—the pri<lb/>soner was coachman to my father, Mr. Robert Hitchings—about 16th Feb<lb/>ruary I found him at the police-station—I had instructed the police to arrest him; it was on a charge of taking money—we have sometimes been in the habit of sending him to town to pay bills for us—there was one bill of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for some money due to Messrs. Geoghegan and Doucet—I received a bill from them, which I had reason to believe had been paid through the prisoner—I found amongst my receipted bills a copy of that bill, with a re<lb/>ceipt at the bottom of it; the sum was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it has never been paid—having found that bill I enclosed it in an envelope, and sent it to Messrs. Geoghegan and Doucet—I received this bill from Miss Medley—I never gave any money for the payment of that bill to anybody, because it was paid with some money of my mother's, which was in the possession of Miss Medley—I made a communication to the prisoner about this bill it the station-house—it bad been shown to him—he said that he had paid it—he did not mention the amount—he mentioned the name of the shop—he said my shirtmaker's in Regent-street—he said he knew nothing about the other bills.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living in the house of Mr. Hitch<lb/>ings, of East Dulwich, and was there at the time of this transaction—about the beginning of July last I gave the prisoner this bill and some money—I cannot recollect whether I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or just the amount; if I did he brought me the change back—he was to pay the money at the shop men<lb/>tioned on the bill whenever he went to the west-end of the town—he after<lb/>wards brought me back the bill receipted, as it is now, with a receipt stamp</p>

               <p>on it—he made no observation to me at that time about it, not till after Christmas, when another bill, for which I gave him the money to pay in October, was sent in again to Mr. Hitchings—he then said to me, "I have been going to ask you two or three times, has Mr. Frederick Hitchings had a second bill from this shop in Regent-street?"—I said, "I can't tell, as be lives in the country; he might have had, but I cannot tell you"—he said, "When I went to pay that bill in Regent street, some one came out and re<lb/>ceived the money; I did not get off the box; somebody brought me the bill out receipted, went away, and did not return to the shop"—that conversation had reference to this bill.</p>

I am a solicitor, and have chambers at 10, New Inn, into Strand—I know the defendant very well—I have known him some little time as a solicitor—he has not a certificate; I did not know that, when he came to me, only that he was very poor—in March last he spoke to me about issuing a writ against Pentecost, at the suit of Frewing; and I took out the summons in my own name, changed it to my own name, and brought the action in my own name—the date of the writ is 8th October,—I was to be the attorney to conduct the action; that was agreed upon—we were working together in that and two or three other things—I brought the action and issued the writ in my name, in the Court of Common Pleas—I gave notice of trial in Easter-term, I believe (here is the notice), and then gave a fresh notice of trial these last sittings—I had no money from the plaintiff—I wrote to Frewing, to tell him I must have money to go on with; and he came and told me he had already paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he should not give me any more—that was in January of this year—I did not receive a sixpence from Littlewood in this case—I never had a shilling of his money—I did all the business, he did nothing—Frewing was at my chambers several times—Bevan was not my clerk—I don't know whose clerk he was—I never knew of any letters being written, or any money being obtained—the prisoner's name was written up on paper against my door—I was away ill for some time, and I gave him the key; Mr. King, my clerk, was there—he has been with me thirty-five years—I tore the name down, because they will not let any two persons have chambers and put up two names—the defendant was never a partner of mine.</p>

I paid Mr. Baxter two sovereigns for the animal, and returned the hide")—this is the note I took down to Wisbeach, and showed the defendant (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "January 31st, 1863. Sir, I have sent you two quarters of bee. From T. Howitt, Wisbeach, to J. T. Jefferis, London")—I showed the four quarters of beef, which have been spoken of, to Mr. Davidson, the clerk of the market, also to Mr. Page and Mr. Clements, and to Dr. Letheby, on the same day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Nunn, an iron-bolt plater, residing it 3, Bridge-place, Greenwich—Captain Baker lodges with us—on Tuesday afternoon, 3d February, about a quarter to 4 o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked if Mr. Baker was at home—I said, "He is not"—he said, "Oh! I was to bring him this," referring to this piece of paper, which was folded into a note—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mrs. Nunn, please send me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the crew, by the bearer. W. Baker")—I opened it, read it, and saw it was not in Baker's handwriting—I asked him in—he said, "I will be back in five minutes," and went away—I went in pursuit of him with a man, but saw nothing of him till about a quarter-past 7, when I saw him in Bridge-street, near the Beehive public-house—he crossed the road, and I crossed also after him—my intention was to give him in charge, when he turned round by Lovibond's public-house, struck me in the back, knocked me down, and got away—I was all over mud, and insensible—Mr. Baker sent for me on 4th February, and I saw the prisoner then on the Wood-walk at Dept<lb/>ford—I did not speak to him until I gave him in charge—he was dressed in moleskin trousers, a short monkey-jacket, and a hairy cap when he came to me first—when I afterwards saw him he had a dark cloth cap; but, with that exception, he was dressed the same as before—his features were quite familiar to me—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>—I found that the desk had been forced open, and the cash-box and money taken away—I gave information to the police—two days previous to my receiving the money, I had discharged the prisoner from being my servant—as my servant, he had been in the habit of frequenting my quarters—he was there on the night of the 23d, and saw the money on the table—on 28th January, he was brought to the camp, and said to the major that the money belonged to himself—the major asked him how he came by this money that was found on him, and he said it was the money that he had saved up for three or four months—in consequence of that I looked at the ledger item and found that he could not have received that amount, and that I had not paid him that amount—I was not there when he was searched and the money found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom in a gentleman's family—I have been used to horses for the last seven years or over—on the evening of 15th January, I was with my sister in the Lorimore-road, Walworth, which leads from the Royal-road into the main Walworth-road—I saw a hearse, with a coach attached to it behind, standing at the Canterbury Arms, next to an undertaker's shop in the Royal-road, for about twenty minutes—I then saw it start off at a tremendous pace, I should fancy at the rate of between fifteen and sixteen miles an hour—it came up the Lorimore-road towards the Walworth-road on the right-hand side of the way, the off side; it should have been on the near side—there was a man on the box driving—there were two horses abreast—I could not swear to the man—I heard him whipping the horses <hi rend="italic">most terrific;</hi> he gave, them three or more slashes—they passed a few yards from the kerb where I stood—they were going at fifteen or sixteen miles an hour then—the driver made some hallooing or shouting, to the horses as he went by—he struck the horses three or four times with the whip; I heard them smack very loud—after they passed me they ran into a little cart that was coming out of John-street, in an opposite direction—it was partly in John-street and partly in the Lorimore-road when the pole of the hearse ran into it, just coming out of the turning into the Lorimore-road—the horse's head was turned towards the left—I heard the crash, and ran to the spot—I heard a groan, and somebody called out, "Oh, my leg!"—one of the hearse-horses was lying down, and the horse that was in the cart was lying down also; and I saw a man leaning head foremost out of the cart—I went to him and asked what was the matter—he said he could not move—I daresay there were five or six persons then on the spot—I did not see the driver of the hearse when I first ran up—I saw some one down on the ground by the horse's head; I could not say whether that was the driver—the horses were going fast when I first saw them, but after the lashing they went faster; they were being lashed before they got up to me, and the driver continued to lash them afterwards—I assisted in taking the injured man to St. Thomas Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and physician, of West-square—on Monday night, 26th January, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I was called to 1, St. Alban's-buildings, and found the deceased on a bed dead—I found four or five abrasions on the left side of her throat, but none on the right side—they were such as might be caused by finger-nails—Wallace gave me the description in the prisoner's presence—I observed nothing further at that time to account for death—next morning, Wednesday, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found contusions on the skull, and extravasation of blood on the left side, corresponding with the marks of the fingers—I removed the skull-plate and found an internal ex<lb/>travasation on the surface and on the base of the brain—I did not detect any fracture of the skull, but there was an effusion of the internal structure—I saw a contusion appearing external—both lungs were extremely con<lb/>gested; the heart was not diseased; the liver and kidneys were healthy—I attribute death to effusion of blood on the surface of the brain, causing obstructed respiration, death being accelerated by compression of the throat—blows, or a fall, would account for the appearances I saw on the skull—if effusion on the surface of the brain existed, compression on the throat, from the evidence as described to me, would increase it—the second came was the effusion of blood on the brain and congestion of the lungs—compression of the throat would not account for the congestion of the lungs I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is lividity produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lividity in the face is caused by the arrest of the venous blood, but that is not a constant cause; it depends upon the pressure—the primary cause of death was coma, or the effusion of blood on the brain—the lungs were congested with blood, and did not act in refreshing the blood, and she died from asphyxia; and the reason the lungs did not act was the pressure on the brain, which prevented them from relieving themselves—if there had been no effusion on the brain, there could not very well nave been congestion of the lungs from the stoppage without lividity, not to</p>

               <p>that extreme extent—I cannot say that if there had not been that effusion on the brain, she would have died from the pressure—if incipient or partial coma existed, pressure on the throat would finish it off.</p>

I made a post-mortem examination of deceased, and agree with Dr. Constable's evidence; but, hearing the position of the deceased when she fell, it struck me that there might be a fracture of the spine—I removed the spinal process, and found a clot of blood press<lb/>ing on the spinal cord—it is quite possible that that might be accounted for by her falling under a bed with her head doubled up between her knees—that would cause paralysis almost immediately, but of course not until the clot got to the size I saw it—the effusion would continue to increase for a very short time after death—in hanging, I have occasionally seen very little con<lb/>gestion of the face; it depends upon whether the spinal cord is fractured immediately—in a person suspended for days, congestion would take place of course, but where the pressure is removed the lividity would go off—if there was a compression of the <hi rend="italic">trachea</hi> for half a minute, I should not expect to find much congestion, if any, particularly in this case, because the injuries in the brain were such that this person could not have lived but for a very short time—the immediate cause of death was strangulation—I should not expect to find lividity there, but there was lividity in the marks of the throat—I should not expect to find lividity of the countenance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, living in Lambeth-square—on 19th February, about a quarter-past 2 o'clock, I was knocking at the door of the Starlight public-house, Blackfriars-road, and I felt the prisoner, who came in front of me, give a tug at my watch—I had not seen him before—I halloed out to my friend, "Tom, my watch is gone"—the prisoner ran away and tripped me up, and I fell on my back; another man gave me a shove—my watch was not found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You said you were knocked down in front of the bar? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That was in the early part of the evening; this was after 1 o'clock—my watch was safe at a quarter to 2; I looked when I came out of the public-house—you are the person who took it out of my waistcoat-pocket—several persons were there, a good many of our own workmen; I knew most of those who were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness, and was with him when he was knocking at the door in the Blackfriars-road—I did not notice any other people trying to get in—there were three or four of our friends that had come from the party—I heard my father cry out, and then for the first time I saw the prisoner come out of the crowd, and run off—there was another man standing outside, and I heard one of them say, "Have you got it?" but I do not know which—I ran after the prisoner, down the Blackfriars-road, and gave him into custody.</p>
