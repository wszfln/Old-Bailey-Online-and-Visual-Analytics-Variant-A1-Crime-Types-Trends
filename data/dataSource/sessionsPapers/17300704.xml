             depos'd, That as he was going over Stepney Fields about Three o'Clock in the Morning, he saw the Prisoners carrying Sauce Pans, and perceiving Hawkswell's Pockets bulk out, he suspecting them to have committed some Robbery, therefore ask'd Hawkswell (the old Man) where he had the Goods, and whither he was carrying them? That he reply'd, He was in fear that his Landlord would seize them for Rent, and so he had come from his Lodgings; that he searching his Pockets, found wet Linen, which further confirming his Suspicion, he would not let them go from him, till he came to White-Chapel, and got a Constable, and secur'd them, except one Boy, which ran away; and having got it out of the other Boy, that they had brought the Things from New Gravel-Lane , the Boy pretending, that as they were going to get Bird's Nests, the Prisoner met them, and desired them to carry the Things for him; he went thither, and upon inquiry found the Prosecutors; and in coming over an Hay-Field, found the Boy which had run from him, lying in a Hay-cock, who carried him to the Farthing-Pye-Fields , and shew'd him where they had hid a Porridge Pot in a Ditch.</p>

That on Sunday, the 21st of June, the Prisoner came into her Room, and sate there Reading, that she telling him, it was time to go to Church, that the Bells had rung in, he went, but came back again in less than half an Hour; that she asking him, why he came back so soon? He said, the Prayers were ended, and he was weary of standing; that she not knowing how to get him out of the Room, and wanting to shift herself, was oblig'd to go down into a Neighbour's Room to do it; that while she was out of the Room, the Key of that Drawer in which the Money was, hung with other Keys in the upper Part of the Trunk, the Prisoner sitting by the Trunk reading, that she suspecting nothing, never look'd for her Money till the Wednesday following; that then she being washing, the Prisoner desir'd to have his Linen wash'd, saying, he was to go into the Country; she knew not by what foreboding of Mind, ran up in some surprize to look for her Money, and having taken the Keys out of her Trunk some Days before, and thrown them among some Clothes into a Basket, open'd the Drawer, and found that all her Money was gone; upon which knowing that no Body had been alone in her Room but the Prisoner, she complained before the Prisoner of her Money being lost; and she observing that the Prisoner took little Notice of it, there being no other Person for her to suspect but the Prisoner, she charg'd him with it; but he deny'd it, she got an Officer, and would have him consent to be search'd, but he said he would not be search'd but before higher Powers; whereupon he was carried before the Justice, and being search'd, in his Pocket Book were found twenty Guineas and a half; that before she saw the Money, there were among her Guineas two that she had taken particular Notice of, and if at any time she took out Money, she always took Care to look over them, and lay them by, resolving not to part with them while she had any other left; that they both of them had a Pig (as she call'd it, i. e. an Elephant) under the Head, one of them was a very fair new Guinea, and the other an old one, that had been a little defac'd or worn; that upon looking over the Money, there were two such Guineas there, which she swore positively to be two of those she had lost; and the same she swore in Court, they being produc'd and shewn to her.</p>
