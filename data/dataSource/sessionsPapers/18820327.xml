I am manager to Alexandre Lefevre, furniture dealer, of 331, Old Street—on 18th February Kriens called and asked for a catalogue—he produced this card of the Plate Glass Bevelling and Grinding Works, Clerkenwell, and said that he was one of the company, that they frequently got orders for furniture among their customers, and he wanted to see if we would put him on the best footing, the wholesale</p>

I first saw Bailey at Clerkenwell County Court—Kriens was the only person I saw in these transactions—I believed him to be a partner—he presented a card; that did not give me the idea that he was a traveller—I heard Bailey say at the County Court that he had given him a commission to go and get orders—I did not know that he had been employed by Mr. Pocock for twelve months to do mechanical work—I know it now; Mr. Pocock has said so—our place is about a mile from Mr. Pocock's—I did not go there and make inquiries; they received the first lot of goods, and I thought that was sufficient—the other two lots went to addresses that Kriens gave, in the name of Kriens, but I did not know that he was Kriens till we applied for the money about the beginning of July—I sent my clerk; I did not go myself—I had had no previous transactions with Kriens; if he introduced a customer I knew nothing about it—a gentleman named Lamb purchased some goods, and paid for them—I did not arrange to allow Kriens a percentage upon business he introduced—I did not say before the Magistrate that he introduced a gentleman, and that I allowed him 20 per cent.; I said I was not certain—I allowed him very near 20 per cent.; that was from the retail, not the wholesale—he got orders from me for the company; I gave him orders to the amount of about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he still representing that he was one of company—I got the goods—Mr. Garford told me that a sum of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was offered in payment, which was due to Kriens for commission, and an offer to pay the rest, but we could not accede to it, because we had sent the goods—after that we commenced an action in the High Court against the company for this money—we applied to sign judgment under Order 14—affidavits in answer were filed, and the case was remitted to the Clerkenwell County Court for trial; the action was tried there, and there was a verdict for the defendant—after that we commenced this prosecution—Mr. Sims was our counsel in the action.</p>

W. Kriens, Fairlawn Villa, Lower Merton"—I did not know that his name was Kreins till I went to the company's place—I sent the invoice to the company—on 1st April I sent by post an account of the goods, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—towards the end of April Kriens called again, and said that their cus-tomer was removing to a larger house and would require more furniture, and he then ordered furniture amounting to 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was sent to Thornton Heath, and the invoice was posted to the company—about the end of June we sent in a quarterly account to the company of 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on Saturday, 7th May, a man brought this letter—he simply delivered it, and we gave him an answer—the goods had then been sent off about nine days—on 11th July I called at the office of the company—I saw Bailey—I said I had called for the account of Alexander Lefevre and Co.—he said he wanted to see me, because the account had nothing to do with the company—I said "If this account has nothing to do with you why have you kept our invoices? why have you not returned them to us?"—he replied that we should have to go to Kriens for our money—I asked who Kriens was—he said "He is the man that you delivered the goods to"—up to that time I had not known that the man who had called on us was Kriens—I then told Bailey how he had presented the card, and said that he was one of the company, and how he had ordered the goods—he said "If he has ordered the goods like that he has got them by fraud; there is no company here; Mr. Pocock is the principal, and there is no one else in the firm"—he said he had employed Kriens to go out on commission, and there was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to him, would I accept that—I refused, it not being the full amount of the account—he said he knew that Kriens was going to get some furniture, but he did not suppose he would get so much—I said "If the goods had nothing to do with you why accept the brackets?"—he said" Oh, those were for me"—I saw the three invoices of February, March, and April, all pinned together—he took them from his desk and showed them to me, and said" The other two invoices Kriens has"—I was present at the hearing of the case at the County Court—this copy memorandum was then shown to Bailey while he was in the box, and he acknowledged that he had written the original—he said the stamp in the corner was put on by him.</p>

I know Blenkarn as Bower—my place of business is 83, Upper Thames Street—I live at Staines—the prisoner's offices at 8, Union Court are three quarters of a mile from mine—I had transactions with him in 1881 to the amount of 1 059<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., generally in paper and twine—I first knew him about the middle of 1880—I know the buildings described on the order form, 8, Union Court, Old Broad Street—the entrance would be about 80, Bishopsgate Street—that is no doubt given to indicate the locality; it is near the Four Swans—I introduced him to the Capital and Counties Bank—I had an account there—he said he found it inconvenient to make remittances to the country—tho amount of his dealings with me in the four months previous to his bankruptcy was about 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was buying goods from om Mr. Burt, and Mr. Martin</p>

               <p>—I remember buying paper marked S and H, which I should conclude was Spalding and Hodge—it was not my business to inquire whose paper it was—it was lying at Farringdon Street Station—I paid by cheque—I lent him money occasionally—I had goods as against these advances, in one case especially—I transferred a portion of the goods which I had at Farringdon Street to him back again—from what I have heard this morning a greater portion of them went to Guppy's—that left him in my debt something like 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I re transferred it, not having money in exchange—Bowers had the delivery order—I took it over at 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I had an invoice—I have not got it, and perhaps you don't want to know the reason—it is with my solicitor, in connection with other paper that has been seized—I had some twine of him invoiced at 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not like taking it—he pressed me—mine is a general job business, if I see anything worth my while I buy—the twine was at the dock, and was burnt in a fire—the order was not lodged, therefore they were not covered by my authority—my having millboards to make up for those that had been burnt had nothing to do with the affair—I gave the order to Bowers some time before the affair; Martin was a long time making them; they came on in due course—Martin's millboards were transferred to me on landing—I had given the prisoner an order for them three, four, or five months before I received them; he gave me a letter saying that he had millboards in the City; he had samples, and here is the letter of July—Martin's first communication was about June—the order to Martin is 17th June—I did not ask the prisoner to get me the millboards in the first instance—I have no entry from which I can speak to the order—I keep books; I have not them here—I should not preserve the envelope—here is an account for 59 dozen of twine at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 50 dozen at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know nothing of twine makers except one at Birmingham—that twine was in pursuance of an order endorsed over to me—there is one more transaction for 70 dozen of twine on 18th October at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen—the prisoner owed me money—I had the twine against that money, and I gave some money as well, cash and a cheque—on 2nd November some millboards were transferred to me—that was a portion of a 5 ton order which I had originally given—on 15th September he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods on credit—I remember his bringing the last lot of goods to the wharf—he told me then he had been adjudicated a bankrupt—I said if that were the case I could not have anything to do with him—I cannot fix the date of that with certainty, but it would be after 7th November, and previous to 15th or about 15th December—I did not consider it safe to take the goods—I called at his office three times a week; I saw the office fittings; I cannot tell if they were worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more—Mr. Switch was there—there was a table and a chair—the place was pretty well furnished as an office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—I was present when the deposition of the deceased was taken by Mr. Bushby, the Magistrate, in the presence of the prisoners—I saw the Magistrate sign it, and I witnessed it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I know the prisoners. On Saturday fortnight it was very foggy, and I was at home lying on my bed between 6 and 7 o'clock, and words passed between my wife and the female prisoner, her sister, who had a kettle in her hand. I tried to get the kettle away. Gray, who lives with her, was there. My wife went downstairs, and I got off the bed to try to get the kettle from her, and she tried to throw the boiling water over me, and there was a struggle; and in it I felt a blow on my leg, and I dropped all at once, and lost all power. My leg was broken, in in two places, and I was brought here by five policemen. The male prisoner had a stick in his hand; not the one he has now, it was a mahogany one, like what they push balls about with. I do not remember them saying anything to me all that time; he did not say anything.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Streeting.</hi> It was a little after 3 when you came in my room, not half past 12. We were not drinking all that time and singing. My wife and you did not go out three times, and Gray did not go out for drink. I did not sing "Sweet William of the Ferry" because you liked to hear me sing it. I did not get any of the drink. The table did not fall on me, and we did not get cut with the glasses. I had a share of one lot of drink they brought in, not more. I did not lie down through the drink. Gray did not take my hands from your throat. You smashed a large basin in my face, and cut my nose. I am speaking the truth, so help my God. <hi rend="italic">By the Magistrate.</hi> There was not a struggle, and the table did not fall on me. I only remember having drink twice. <hi rend="italic">By Gray.</hi> I had not so much drink taken. I had to He down on my bed, and could not go out to get Catherine her living when she asked me. I did not hurt my leg when I was being taken to the policestation by three policemen. I did not tell you the policemen said I was the toughest old man they ever had. It was not in that district at all.") On Monday, 6th February, I saw the deceased immediately after</p>

               <p>his admission—he had a very severe fracture of the upper end of the leg below the kneejoint; it was both compound and comminuted; the bone was broken into four fragments—there was also a cut in the wrist, and he had a black eye—he died on 4th March—I attended him through out the whole time—it must have been a very severe blow, even by a heavy stick, to have occasioned such a fracture—there was a small punctured wound just over the seat of the fracture, about two inches from the joint—it was no doubt caused at the same time as the fracture—it was done by a violent blow, and no doubt by the same instrument that caused the fracture—any metal at the end of a stick might have caused it—the blow must have been given in front—I made a postmortem examination, and examined the whole body from the brain downwards—there was nothing else the matter but the injury to the leg—I saw no injuries about the body—I stripped him—the fracture was put in splints immediately on his admission—he gradually got weaker and weaker, suppuration took place, and he finally sank from exhaustion from the effects of the fracture—he never rallied—he received careful attention up to the time of his death—I did all I could for him—a stick was shown to me like this (<hi rend="italic">produced by the prisoner</hi>)—it is very light.</p>

I was on duty in Northey Street on the night of 6th March, a little before 10 o'clock, with Sergeant Kerning, I was called to 3, Thomas's Cottages, and saw the deceased on the floor, supported by Lynch—he was unconscious; his body was burnt in several places about the chest and arms, his fingers, and his hair, and the flesh was peeling of; he was also bleeding from a cut on the side of his head—I said to Maunday," How did it happen?"—he said, "I don't know; I was going out for a pint of beer for my supper, and when I got outside the door I saw a light at the window; I then opened the door, and saw the old man all alight"—I then said to Mrs. Ashby," Do you know how it was done,?"—she said, "How should I know how it was none when I was in bed at the time? I heard him having some words about Maunday coming through our room when I was in bed; I then heard a noise, and when I came out of my room I saw my husband all alight; that is all I know about it"—I assisted in taking the prisoners to the station, and then went back and searched the room—it was in great disorder; knives, forks, and spoons were thrown about the floor; there was also a wooden pail fresh broken, and a quantity of paraffin oil about the floor—I found the bottom part of this lamp on the table, the metal part and a portion of the chimney on the floor, and the burner and part of the reservoir in the fireplace on the hob, with some of the deceased man's shirt partly burnt.</p>

I did it myself. I had been looking for work all day. A lamp was on the table when I came home. I went to take the lamp off the table; it went all over me.

I am manager to Herring and Co., wholesale druggists, of Aldersgate Street—on 5th January, about 5.30, I was in the chemical room, and saw some liquid running from the floor of the bottle room above—I ascertained that it was perfume, went up with White, and saw the errand boy Waterman in the bottle room—I then sent a man down to tap the floor where the perfume was dripping through the ceiling, and hearing the sound I cleared away some large stone bottles and</p>

               <p>found concealed behind them four 1lb. bottles and four 1/2lb. bottles of perfume and one of oil of peppermint—I had a conversation with Waterman the same evening, and next morning I made a communication to Mr. Herring—those nine bottles had been taken out of the essential oil room, the door of which is kept locked and the key hung on a peg near my desk—it is the duty of any person who goes there to come to me for the key—I am under the impression that I had given the key to Waterman that afternoon—he had duties there.</p>

I was in the defendant's employ for a few months in 1871—I remember his going to Switzerland towards the end of December—while he was away four long boxes of watches came—Mr. Boulter paid the carriage and I unpacked them, but did not open them—I have not the slightest doubt that they contained watches, and put them into the safe where I had often put watches—I swore in my affidavit "I placed the contents, which were watches, in the safe on the said premises," but I did not open the, boxes—another box came afterwards from Switzerland addressed to "Mr. Schott—I did not unpack it, but put it bodily into the safe—the four boxes were cleared away before I saw Mr. Schott—he came for them one morning before I got there, and I saw him afterwards and he told me he had taken them away, and that he was going to Liverpool, where he had a customer, but should be back on Saturday—that same evening he placed in the safe a large roll of banknotes, among which I noticed some for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never came back, and I never heard from him—he took the key of the safe with him—I have seen Newman perhaps a dozen times at 9, Spencer Street, in October and November, buying watched—he came there about the time I was there, but I never saw him after Mr. Schott went away on 1st December—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of Schott's books—I am a watchmaker, and had nothing to do with the bookkeeping—this name of Newman in the index looks like Schott's writing; I believe it is, but I cannot swear to it—it is not mine—I went with the solicitor's clerk to Schott's lodging, and the landlord gave him some papers, and a book which I did not identify—I cannot say whether I told him that they were Schott's books—I always saw the books in the safe, but I never opened them—I have told you all through that these are the books—this memorandumbook is mine; I put down everything in it, and I see here that Mr. Newmann called on Thursday, 24th November.</p>

               <p>Newman—he told me that he did shipping business—he was in the habit of going to Switzerland to buy watches and was away frequently—I knew when watches came from Switzerland by the Custom House marks outside the boxes—Schott was sometimes in the habit of shaving—he told me that he had a banking account in Switzerland—the goods Mr. Boulter paid carriage for were from Switzerland.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 61, York Street, Westminster, and sweep a crossing at Duchess Street, at the corner of Portland Place—on 27th February last, about 3 o'clock in the day, I saw three young men standing there—Knee and Moore are two of them—I don't recognise either of the others—one of them took the lady round the waist, turned her round, and threw her down, and as soon as he had done so ran offhe might have taken her purse, because she was carrying it in her hand—the lady had passed me before I saw the young men—two or three shillings and some coppers dropped, and the other two young men stooped to pick them up, and then made off also—all three went up Duchess Street towards Portland Street—the one that took the purse ran, and I believe the others did till they got round the corner—I saw nothing more of them till the policeman came, and I was taken to the station and asked to pick out the young men, and I picked out the two—I dare say there were six or seven young men at the station—the one that knocked the lady down had a dark straight coat on that came to about his knees—when I saw him at the station he was in his shirtsleeves.</p>

I am a cab driver of Freeling Street, Caledonian Road—on 27th February I was in Duke Street with my cab on the stand, opposite the Devonshire publichouse—Duchess Street joins Duke Street and Portland Street—I was standing talking to a man named Thorn between 2.30 and 3 o'clock, when my attention was called by Thorn to three young men passing up Duke Street towards Duchess Street—I saw them turn round Duchess Street to the left towards Portland Place—Knee was one of them—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw the same three return running—I cannot swear to the others—I am almost positive they were the same I had seen before—Knee had a dark coat on—I can't say exactly what sort of coat; I should think it was a medium length—on 7th March I was taken to the policestation, and I picked out Knee from eight others.</p>

I am a publican at 12, Station Street—on Tuesday evening, 21st February, about 10 o'clock, I was walking along High Street, Stratford, and as I came near the prisoner's shop I received some information from a lad—I saw a crowd there—I and a friend pushed open the side door, and out came a volume of thick smoke and flame—I tried to make an entrance—I saw in the farther corner of the room a</p>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of the West Ham Fire Brigade, and live at 8, West Ham Lane, Stratford—on the night of 21st February I was called to this fire at 304, High Street—I got there at 10.6—I found the side door open—I saw the place where the fire had been in the cupboard; it had been extinguished—the house was full of smoke—I went upstairs and opened the windows to let the smoke out—I had to crawl on my hands and knees on the first floor, and as I did so I found a sheet of writing paper sticking up in the floor—smoke was coming through the floor just inside the door of the back room first floor, one of the bedrooms—finding one of the boards loose I took it up, and underneath found a small fire; a quantity of paper had been burnt—none of the boarding was burnt—the board was down in its place and was covered over with the oilcloth which ran along the stairs and up the passage—the board ran from the bathroom across the landing to another room on the right hand side—the piece of paper that was sticking up was in the bathroom, away from the oilcloth—I took that sheet of paper out—the police took the rest of the paper—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then went downstairs and examined—I found a fire in the shop on the right hand side as I entered from the side door (<hi rend="italic">referring to a plan</hi>)—there was a quantity of rubbish there, straw, refuse, waste paper, and a pair of old boots, they would not burn very quickly—it looked like the sweepings of the shop—that fire was burning about 18 feet from the counter; it had damaged part of the flooring—I tried to get in farther, but the smoke was so dense it took us half an hour to do so—I then found another fire on the top of the counter and under the counter in the shop window on the right as you enter from the street—that fire was composed of waste paper, clothing, trousers, and coats hanging up on the rails in the shop window; it had burnt a hole through the counter—the four fires were quite separate and distinct—after the smoke had cleared away I saw that the partition under the coal cellar was burnt; I should think about three or four feet of the partition was burnt away—I saw the prisoner on the premises before we got the whole of the fires out—I asked him if the shop was connected with the private house—he said "Yes," and he showed me the way into the shop; he opened the door and I went into the shop and discovered the fires—I asked him afterwards if he could account for the fires—he said no he could not, it was all safe when he locked the place up and went out at 9.25—I estimated the damage at between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw what furniture and stock the house contained—I am not a valuer, but I should think the outside value of the whole was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is a rough estimate; I mean everything in the place.</p>

Stratford, accompanied by Sergeant Lennox—after the fire I went over the house with Mr. Smith—I afterwards made this plan of the premises; it is correct—I found traces of a fire in the coal cupboard; that had been extinguished before I arrived—a portion of the partition separating it from the kitchen had been burnt away about 3 feet by 1 foot in depth, near the flooring—it was made of match lining—there were traces of another fire on the right as you enter the shop from the parlour—that had been extinguished—it was in the vicinity of an unused fireplace—I saw a quantity of burnt material; I could hardly tell what it was, I should think paper and all kinds of rubbish—a chalk back, covered with papiermache, one of the dummies, was broken and had been burnt; it was all charred and blackened—two of the boards had been torn up in order to extinguish the fire; this was behind the counter—near the entrance there was another counter, and on the top of that there was a pile of woollen goods near the window; that had been burnt; the counter was burnt through from the top, and the pile of goods had been burnt through from the bottom—it had been extinguished, but was smouldering—that pile of goods was about a foot and a half high; it extended nearly the whole width of the counter—those three fires were actually distinct—I then went upstairs to the firstfloor, and in the back room there were traces of a fourth fire underneath a plank which ran athwart the top of the landing—I lifted it up and found traces of fire underneath; there were burnt embers of paper, and on the night of the fire I saw burnt paper taken out—they were mostly mourning letters, I should think a dozen or more—some were between the joists under the flooring, which was not loose—the prisoner was sitting in the kitchen—after I had made my examination I told him that we found fires in various parts of the house, and it seemed to me to be a serious matter, and I said, "If you like to accompany me I will show you"—he went willingly with me over the house, and I pointed out the various fires—I asked if he could account, for them—he said no, he could not—I asked who lived in the house besides him—he said his two daughters and himself—I asked where his daughters were—he said, "At a friend's house close by"—I asked who shut the shop up—he said his boy, but he was the last to leave—I asked him respecting his insurance—he said he was insured for</p>

Yours obediently, A. C. Williams.") That is the prisoner's writing—on the morning of 15th November I went to 27, Phillip Road—I noticed the word "Bank" on the fanlight," The British Equitable Deposit Bank" on the door-post, and round the corner, before you got inside, "Bank" again, on the lintel of the door—as soon as I got inside there was a lot of writing in different sized letters, then on the door "General Office" and "Bank" again—that is where I applied first—I was told to wait—in about 20 minutes I was asked to go upstairs and see Mr. Williams—there was "Bank" on his door, and the figure "4"—I went in there and saw Mr. Williams—he shook hands with me, showed me a chair, read my testimonials, and said" They are very satisfactory indeed"—I asked him to write to Major Stuart Nicholson—he said that was not necessary, but I still asked him to do so and he said he would—we talked the things over, and he said" That is the way I do my work and carry on my business; I keep valuable papers locked up, and at times I have things of great value"—he pointed to the boxes; one on each side of the fire-place—he said "You will find plenty to do," and that I should have to keep the place clean and take charge of it—I told him my wife would help me—I said I could not give any decided answer before I had seen her about it, and he said" Certainly not"—I asked if I could see the rooms—he said "Certainly"—there were three rooms at the top of the house—he did not show me the kitchen that day—he showed me the back bedroom, and said "It is a very nice room," and then I saw the front off room—he said" This is a small off room; I will have it done up; I have only had a boy, and you will have the boy with you"—it was arranged that my wife and I should come on the 17th—on that occasion the premises were in the same condition, with the word "Bank, "&amp;c., on them—the agreement was then handed to me, and he explained the period I was to serve, which had not been filled in—I signed" George Fuller," and he signed under it "A.

               <p>if you will come upstairs we will settle the matter, as very likely I shal be very busy later on"—I went upstairs, and paid him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes—he took the agreement out of the pigeon hole, and wrote the receipt which is on it—I saw him sign "A.

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Cavendish Retreat, Wandsworth Road—I am out of employment—previous to 28th September I saw an advertisement in a newspaper that a situation was vacant for a young man to look after offices—I wrote to three or four alphabetical letters, 5, St. Bride Street—I received a post-card, and on 28th September this letter, in consequence of which I called and saw Mr. Williams—he said "I am carrying on a large business as the British Equitable Deposit Bank; I have a branch at Lewisham and at Ludgate Circus; what security are you able to place down, as it is a great place of trust? Sometimes I shall be away, and you will have the entire charge of the premises"—I asked him how much he wanted; he said "The man whose situation you are taking placed down 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I offered to put down 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that would do—he handed me this agreement—I paid the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and signed it—he signed after me—then he signed the receipt below—that was on 28th September—I noticed "Bank" over the door of No. 4 room and Over the fanlight of the front door and on the second door, with the words "British Equitable Deposit Bank"—another door leads into the chemist's shop—one was a swing door—I did not have to pass through the shop—" British Equitable Deposit Bank" was on the wall—I went up to see Mr. Williams—I was to receive 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and to be provided with a ready-furnished room at the house 27, Philip Road—I went to occupy it on 10th October—I had received this letter of 2nd October. (<hi rend="italic">Postponing the witness coming till the</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">th.</hi>) I afterwards received this letter from him. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing post-office order for</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for week's salary and extra for residence.</hi>) I never had the rooms, so I had the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead—I continued my work there from 10th October till 19th November—I had to keep the place clean and take out circulars, letters, and so forth—I went there about 8.30 a. m. and stayed there sometimes till 9.30 p. m., and sometimes I got away at 6—I was not left in entire charge—I received my wages regularly—I lived, and still live, in the Wandsworth Road—he knew my address—on 19th November I saw Fuller in the passage—after he arrived Williams came out of the back part of the premises to me and said "Boor, you can get away; you have no occasion to Btop any longer to-night; I am going home to tea; if you will come out along with me I will pay you your salary"—I went out with him, and went round the corner towards his home—he said he had been obliged to enter into different arrangements and to take a fresh partner into the business, and "I think by handing you back your 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. your engagement will be at an end; on the other hand I undertook to give you a month's notice, therefore I shall pay you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next four weeks; at the expiration of that time you can receive your 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. security; any</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating: "</hi> I shall send you your salary on Monday without fail.

(<hi rend="italic">A large pane of glass was here produced, with "British Equitable Financial Association, &amp;c.," on it.</hi>) I am not certain if that is the window—there was writing on some of the windows—I can read a little.

(<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 22,10, '81, <hi rend="italic">stating that he could not obtain the situation for the witness on the security offered.</hi>) It is Williams's writing—I wrote this letter of 27th October, 1881.
