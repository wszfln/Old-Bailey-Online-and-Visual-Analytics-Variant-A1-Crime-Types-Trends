               <p>November, just before 12 o'clock, I was with Stewart on duty in Bucking<lb/>ham Palace Road, outside the Grosvenor Hotel—I saw the prosecutor the worse for drink, leaning against the wall of the hotel—the prisoner and another man accosted him, and asked him to buy a box of matches—the prosecutor put his hand in his vest-pocket and took out some money and gave the prisoner something for the box, I could not gay what it was, and took the box—the prisoner caught hold of the prosecutor's arm, and said "You are the worse for drink; I will see you home"—the prosecutor said "No, you won't"—the prisoner said "I know you, and I will see you home"—the prosecutor then shook the prisoner off his arm and crossed over to Lower Belgrave Street; the prisoner followed him; the other man went away—the prisoner followed the prosecutor' to Ebury Street; Stewart and I crossed on the other side of the road, and concealed ourselves in a dark doorway—the prisoner and prosecutor had not been there above five minutes when I saw the prosecutor fall on his back, and the prisoner fall on the top of him—the prosecutor immediately called out "Police!"—we imme<lb/>diately ran across the road, and saw the prisoner just getting up from the prosecutor; his right-hand was clenched—I seized it just as he was about to put it into his right-hand pocket—I forced it open—it contained a penny—the prosecutor's right-hand waistcoat pocket was turned inside out—he charged the prisoner with stealing a half-crown—the prisoner said "Are you sure it is not a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece"—he said "No; I am sure it is a half-crown"—I took the prisoner to the station, searched him, and found a half-crown and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze in his right-hand trousers pocket—I also found on him a discharge from the 55th Regiment of foot—he was sober—the prosecutor complained of pains in his back—another constable got up to the spot just as we were crossing the road, he was close at hand—he had not been there when I first saw and followed the two men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sutherland House, the Bank, Highgate—my husband is at present in Canada—on Friday afternoon, 23rd November, about 6 o'clock, my attention was called to a smell of fire, in consequence of which I went to a bedroom on the first floor; on opening the door the smoke was so heavy that I could not enter; I could see no fire—I shut the door, I looked in a second time, but could see no flame—my sister called for the police, who came immediately; the fire engine came in twenty minutes or half an hour—before they came an attempt was made to put out the fire by myself and a passer-by—after the fire brigade had put it out I went into the room—the furniture was all burnt, so as to be completely useless—the fire had originated at the back of the bedstead, which was burnt, and the flooring was charred and burnt and the carpet was burnt completely through—the prisoner had been living with me from 27th July; one other servant lived in the house, and I had a charwoman also in the house—the prisoner had the sole charge of the paraffin oil for the lamps—I bought four of them at her instigation—she said she had been accustomed to them all her life—I said I was afraid of it, as it burnt down every house it went into, but in the end the cheapness of it overcame me, and I let her have it, as I had turned off the gas.</p>

I had a candle carrying, and I knelt down and put the bath</p>

I live at Compton Place, and am a labourer—on 3rd November I was standing in the court where I live, outside the public-house—Quinlan took me into the Lord John Russell and gave me some beer between 3 and 4 o'clock—Doughty went in with us, and McCann, Walsh, and Golding were there—when Quinlan went in he went on to the right-hand side of the bar, where Walsh, Golding, and McCann stood, and asked them if they had anything to drink—he picked up the pot and drank, and passed it round—I stood against the door with Doughty—afterwards he asked for a pot of four-half and some whisky; he paid for that and passed it round—I went to the rear—when I came back they were beginning to quarrel and fighting—I saw the deceased fall against the partition—I went between them, picked up the deceased, and helped to bring him out—outside Quinlan wanted to fight McCann—I took him away and told him he had better go away, or he might get locked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale stationer at 17, Bread Street Hill, trading as Adams and Rees—I have two partners—we have been in the habit of warehousing goods at New Commercial Wharf, Hamborough Wharf, and other places—these straw boards and wood-pulp boards were stored away in those places—William Prenter was our clerk and stock<lb/>keeper—I think he has been there four or five years—some of my papers are marked "A. R.," and some have no mark except the size and weight—the mark "A. R." is known to everybody in the trade—when goods had to be brought from either of the wharves William Prenter made out an order, which had to be signed by the firm—Curtis, the carman, then got away the goods, and brought them to 17, Bread Street Hill or one of our other factories—the order would be left at the wharf—it is there sent for the goods—Curtis was paid once a week—he brought the particulars of what he had done on a large invoice—these wharf orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), A B C D, are in William Prenter's writing, and the signatures are genuine signatures of the firm, E and F are forgeries—they are William Prenter's writing—I last saw him on 3rd August, when he went to Belfast for us on business—we have had two letters from him since, but I cannot tell where he is now—about a fortnight or three weeks after he went to Belfast Mr. Adams found out about this order—the order marked A is addressed to the superintendent of Hamborough Wharf—it is a request to deliver to Curtis 120 bundles of straw-coloured boards, weighing 4 tons—this "No sale or transfer" means that the goods go direct to the customer, they do not come to our warehouse—that does not appear on the order—it is dated 5th April, and endorsed by Boswell, and this is a similar order for 4 tons, dated 27th April, and endorsed by Soar to deliver to Curtis's van at Hamborough Wharf—that was also endorsed</p>

R." on the straw-boards—he did not show them to us, he declined, and said we must go to his solicitor—I didn't tell the prisoner that if he told me all about it he would hear no more of the matter—I said we were anxious to get the receiver, and if we had got his brother, and his evi<lb/>dence was necessary to convict the receiver, we would do the best we could for him—it is for Mr. Wontner to call the receiver as a witness against the prisoner—the prisoner told me that the name of Brenton was used at his brother's suggestion—I said before the Magistrate he did say so—he told me he had sold the boards for his brother, his brother told him they were on account of Royal—his brother, being in our employ<lb/>ment, selling the boards would be guilty of a breach of duty if he sold them to any one in antagonism with us—the prisoner told me that the printed heading was done at 18, Heygate Street, which enabled us to make inquiries there—I knew that he was employed at Marcus Ward's—I think I must have known that two years ago—I have heard his brother William speak of his having a brother there—I think I was there two hours on this Saturday asking him questions, but not so many ques<lb/>tions as Mr. Ward—I had instructed Mr. Ward the night before, and I had a long conversation with him before Hector was called in; he was afterwards sent out, I suggested fresh things, and he was called in again and examined—I think Mr. Ward asked him to go with me to my solicitor to see what was to be done in the matter—I didn't tell him he would be given in custody—we left together, and took him there to do what he thought advisable—I didn't ten him he was to go to my solicitor to give information, or why he was to go—I think Mr. Ward asked him whether he had any objection to go—I didn't tell him that the detective was waiting outside—he had joined us when we went out, and walked with us—I didn't introduce him or say who he was—we went in an omnibus to Mr. Wontner's; he was not in his office, and we all three went and had some refreshments, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and the detective—we had a friendly meal together, which I paid for—I think he knew who the detective was—we were 20 minutes or half an hour over our meal—we did not talk, we were perfectly silent during the dinner—after that we all three went to Mr. Wontner's, and found him there—I went in and asked Mr. Wontner what was to be done, and he called the detective in and told him to take the prisoner in custody—it was Mr. St. John Wontner—when I gave the prisoner a friendly meal I didn't know whether we were going to make him a witness or a prisoner; it had been put into Mr. Wontner's hands two or three days before—it was not at Mr. Wontner's suggestion that I went to Marcus Ward's, that was my notion—I did not communicate with the detective till I had been to my office and seen my partner—I think Mr. Ward asked the prisoner if he had any record of the transaction, and he at once produced the book—towards the end of our conversation I noticed a second entry of the 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think I mentioned that entry before the Magistrate—I will not swear it—I beg pardon, it is very probable that I gave that informa<lb/>tion to Mr. Wontner, and he took it down—Hector told me he had to meet his brother in the City in the middle of the day—I received instruc<lb/>tions from him to offer things for sale—he said that in doing this for his</p>

               <p>brother he did not think he was doing anything wrong, he thought he was doing it for Royal, who had a bill of sale—I asked him if he knew Royal personally—he said "No"—he said "My brother said that if I went to the customers he would be known"—that was as to Isaacs—I can't say if he said so about Bishop; probably his observation applied to both cases—if he said so his brother would probably get into trouble with us and get dismissed—I told him if his evidence could be used against him and the receivers, we should be disposed to let him off—I think that was in Mr. Ward's presence—Mr. McCulloch said in my presence "We can give you no definite promise"—all that was done there was in my presence and by my sanction.</p>

I am principal of the firm of Alfred John Isaacs and Son—I had all these transactions with the prisoner for the purchase of these straw boards, and these are his nine receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—March 16, 1882, is the first; that has a MS. heading—I do not remember the conversa<lb/>tion—the price would be arranged when the samples were shown; they were shown for that purpose the same day, or the day before—they were delivered before payment—when he came for the money he made out the invoice or brought it—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all cheques which I gave him in the name of Henry Brenton—he has signed the receipts "Henry Brenton"—he described himself as a paper and straw board agent—I made inquiries through the Trade Protection Society—I did not notice that the receipts are signed "<hi rend="italic">per</hi> Henry Brenton, Junior"—he did not tell me he was acting for another person or that he had a father—the price was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton—I cannot tell whether any of the parcels had A.R. on them, because they were delivered at my warehouse, and I never saw the bulk—the cheques came back from the bankers endorsed "Henry Brenton"—I think I said "Have not you any printed invoices?"—he said "I have only just gone into business; I am having some printed"—every purchase was by sample—I saw him twice for every transaction—when the goods were delivered he came for the money—this one is on a printed heading—the usual discount was 5 per cent.—he said that he was selling because some<lb/>body wanted the money; the difference in price and what I paid him was very small—this is the receipt of April 6 for two tons of straw boards at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two tons at 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with 5 per cent. off—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was allowed, because I think the weight was short—this is the cheque given in respect of that; you will see nine invoices and nine cheques—the next is 30th April, six tons at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton, 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less 5 per cent., 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and on May 1, here is the cheque for the payment—the next is 19th June, two tons at 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 12 bundles, &amp;c, and 60 bundles at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those are thin boards—the receipt is</p>

               <p>given on the 20th, and the cheque for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. corresponds—the next is July 3, three and a half tons thin boards, 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and on 6th July the pay<lb/>ment is 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 1st August, here are three tons at 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and an allowance it made—on August 2 a payment was made by cheque, which came back through the bank—on 22nd August, here are "five tons at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by cash on account 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he might have brought the invoice after the goods were delivered and asked for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the next is August 30, five tons, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not pay for that then; I suppose he did not call for the money—I did not know anything about his brother, I only knew the prisoner—some of the goods are here—we have, I think, two or three tons of them left, as when Mr. Rees called with detective I instructed my people not to use the boards—those are all the transactions I have had with him—I passed the inquiry through Stubbs's office in the name of Brenton, and did not know the name was anything else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a perfect stranger when he came in March—we deal very largely in this kind of thing—I paid a fair market price, not a full price—I do not take them in myself—tie goods were delivered before he had the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—my petty cash-book is not here; I will send for it—I know which boards these were by the size and weight—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was a fair cash price, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not—it is an imported article—you could buy these from an importer for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to sell again—it is quite possible that I beat him down in the price; he may have asked 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton more, not 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold them for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and no doubt I have some<lb/>thing in my books to show that—no doubt I had those goods in my posses sion when the prosecutor called on me—I did not refuse to show them to him—I am sure he never asked me to show them and I refused; he asked me for the invoices, and I took my file down—I don't believe the question was put to me whether I would show the goods—I think the only <hi rend="italic">wood</hi> boards I received were those of August 3—this word "wood" is in the same writing—I cannot swear whether it is different ink; it may be lighter than the other; it is decidedly not written by anybody in my office—I neither went or sent to Heygate Street—I represent that all these things were done in the ordinary way of business, and he just acted towards me as an agent of another person would, otherwise I would have had nothing to do with him; if I had not satisfied myself of his respectability I should not have bought of him—I really cannot tell you what price they would get; we give 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them in quantities—I should think about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the market price—I bought at 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I consider I saved about 15 per cent.—I was subpoenaed before the Magistrate, but not called, and I had a subpoena to come here—I do not know Mr. Bishop—this 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. means 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—it is 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a ton—those are thinner; they are two-ounce boards, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton.</p>

With regard to the summons for assault, it was the affair of a moment, and the next day they were good friends again; and with reference to Mrs. Calver being his lodger, after the man had been in possession, the bill of sale was reassigned, and he became the landlord and she his lodger. When her character was attacked at the police-court he had defended it, and he argued that nobody was injured except the lady, who had withdrawn the charge against him.</hi>

On 15th November I was in Fetter Lane with Sergeant Conquest—I saw Hartley enter and leave Mrs. Man<lb/>ners's shop, 106, Fetter Lane—I followed him into Greystoke Court, about 20 yards from the shop—he was followed and joined by Allen; they were talking together, and walked very rapidly as far as Cursitor Street—I there took hold of Hartley, and Conquest took hold of Allen—I told Hartley that I was a police officer, and I should take him in custody for being concerned with Fred Pulley, now under remand for obtaining money by fraud and conspiracy—he said "Very well," in a very low tone—he scarcely uttered a word the whole way to the station—I took him to Scotland Yard, searched him, and found on him a penny, and a newspaper that he had previously purchased at 106, Fetter Lane—they were both charged at the police-court—I don't think they made any answer—they refused their address—I saw Pulley in custody at Upper Street Station about 12 o'clock the same morning.</p>

I did not see Hartley leave you, but he entered the shop—you went quietly with me to Scotland Yard—when we got to Upper Street Station you asked to see the warrant—Pulley was arrested on the same warrant on the 3rd—this was on the 15th—the name of Arnold was on the warrant, not your name—I knew you under</p>

On the 15th of November I was with Dowdell; I saw Hartley go into Mrs. Manners's shop, and when he left I followed him—Allen was waiting a few yards off—I followed them to Cursitor Street—I there took hold of Allen—I told him I was a police-officer, and he would be charged with others in fraudulently obtaining money—he said "All right; have you a warrant?"—I said "Yes, there is a warrant, and it will be read to you later on"—I asked his name and address—he said "We will give our name and address when we see the warrant"—the warrant was afterwards read over to them; they made no answer whatever to the charge—Allen then gave his address as William Allen, 2, Providence Place, Upper Street, Islington—I searched him—I found no money on him; there was a pocket-book containing two duplicates and two racing cards.</p>

I live at New Cross—I am one of the sub-editors of the Central News—I was examined at the Mansion House and bound over to appear here on my recognisance, and was here to be called—while I was on duty on the morning of 22nd October I opened the skeleton telegram marked C. (<hi rend="italic">Referring to a Special Cabinet Meeting</hi>.)—there are twelve words on that subject—I dealt with them and sent out the flimsies I see here. (<hi rend="italic">An expanded telegraphic report containing a list of the Dominion Cabinet and details not in the skeleton form</hi>.)—that was my production—I went off duty about 9 or 10—no other telegram had come in in the mean-while—I had telegraphed to our correspondent to send more particulars—they had not arrived when I went off duty—I have never stated that I had no other particulars; before I wrote what you have read to me I had a great many particulars—I do not mean that I have got an answer too my telegram—I had a great deal of other telegraphic information between the arrival of the first telegram and the time I wrote this—Mr. Moore, the chief editor, came on duty next to me about 4 o'clock—he writes out telegrams—I was on duty when the telegram came from Woolwich; I was not in the office when this article was written: "A terrible explosion occurred at the rocket factory," &amp;c.—I do not remember writing a word about the Woolwich explosion—the Central News do not supply anybody with "supposed tele<lb/>graphic information—the <hi rend="italic">Echo</hi> is a subscriber; we supply them some<lb/>times—I cannot tell you who supplied them, or who sent out the flimsies about the Woolwich explosion—Mr. Jennings and two lady sub-editors also expand telegrams; they also write out telegrams—now I see this report of the Woolwich explosion on a flimsy I can say I did not write it; I know nothing of it—there is nothing on the flimsies to identify the person responsible for it, only the knowledge of hand-writing—these are Central News flimsies—I cannot tell you whose writing they are in—the word "telegraph" is not there, but it was tele<lb/>graphed—this report (<hi rend="italic">of the Woolwich explosion</hi>) came from the Central News Office to the best of my knowledge, as it is written on the Central News paper, but where it came from I cannot tell.</p>

                  </hi>. In October last I was a sub-editor in the service of the Central News—I edited the telegram from Montreal of 22nd October, "Plot explode Circassian, Ramouski thwarted, Lansdowne's movements circuitous, Halifax dynamiters sent trial"—that telegram and the previous one referred to make 28 words—I have not counted the words of our expansion to see if they make 710 words—I had nothing to do with sending out telegrams of the Woolwich explosion—the Madagascar telegram in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> was a Central News telegram, but I know nothing of it—I have no doubt the telegram of the earthquake in Asia Minor was a Central News telegram, as it is so quoted, but I had nothing to do with it—we are quite used to contradictions from Reuter—if they happen to be behindhand with a piece of news they invariably contradict—I took no steps at the time the Madagascar telegram was contradicted, but the matter has since been fully confirmed, and amongst, others by the despatch of Lord Dufferin to the Lord Mayor of London appealing for assistance for the sufferers—I had other information, namely that to be found in the files of the London daily papers—I am not aware of any written information in our office of the existence of the dynamite school in New York—the information that the desperadoes were to row out in an ordinary boat is contained in the words of the second skeleton telegram, as they could not reach the Circassian without rowing out or swimming—with regard to the words "Machines would be concealod</p>

               <p>in the boat," they would naturally be carried in the boat—the information that machines were hidden in Quebec was conveyed to me in the course of very wide reading of both American and Canadian newspapers for weeks previously, from which I was aware there was considerable activity amongst the Irish party in the Dominion—the information as to the way in which the miscreants were to effect their escape during the panic and confusion, was a reasonable deduction from the actual skeleton telegram—the railway journey and the blowing up of bridges was founded upon the plot mentioned in the first skeleton telegram, in the dynamite plot, and that Lansdowne's movements were circuitous, also from numerous threats against Lord Lansdowne, and amongst other things the blowing up of railway bridges was mentioned—news of plots in Canada reached us in fragmentary forms as they leaked out, and therefore I concluded they would come to the ear of the police in a fragmentary way too—the whole was a reasonable conclusion from the actual words of the telegram—as to the words "I am reliably informed," of course I assumed that our correspondent was reliably informed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Previous to my engagement by the Central News I had been employed by Reuter—my work there was a reversal of my present work—I had to contract into a few words, telegrams to send abroad, and condense long telegrams into short ones—the same system is adopted at Reuter's as at the Central News as far as my knowledge went—as long as it is honestly performed it is not possible to carry on the business without adopting that system—I had to act at Reuter's for Australia, India, Egypt, and other places—I have been in the telegraphic profession about ten years—where the charges are high the condensing and expanding system is used, as every possible economy has to be made and the fewest possible number of words sent, and what is sent should be sent in such a form as to afford points for the receiver to catch hold of for the purpose of filling up or editing, it on receipt; but in the United Kingdom, or France, or a nearer country, where the charges are not so high, a great deal more liberty" is allowed and many more words are used to express the same meaning—the receiver is not told anything he ought to be previously aware of—that is the principle adopted in condensing and expanding telegrams—that principle was followed in the services I conducted—when the Central News has been first with informa<lb/>tion, contradiction by Reuter has frequently appeared which has been afterwards withdrawn when they had the honesty to do so, or subsequent events have confirmed our original news—the dynamite plot was subse<lb/>quently confirmed by the American and Canadian papers—no error has been pointed out to me with regard to it—our telegram as to Madagascar was found to be literally accurate—the Central News have frequently been in advance of the Government in information, the Government is always slow in divulging anything they know—I was not cross-examined about the Madagascar affair at the Mansion House—it was not mentioned there—the telegram in French now produced says there were more than a thousand victims by the earthquake—it turned out to be the fact that there were a thousand killed and more than 20,000 victims—before and after Reuter's telegram, the Central News, the <hi rend="italic">Standard, Daily News</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> were receiving telegrams from day to day giving details of the earthquake—a special correspondent went from Constantinople to the scene of the disaster, and telegraphed hundreds of words direct to us—it is a fact that a dynamite</p>

               <p>school exists in New York and that a man advertises to give a course of lessons on infernal machines, dynamite and others—an exhibition has been held in New York on the method of sinking vessels by dynamite—nothing appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> from us but what was literally accurate according to the information in the telegrams and already in our office and reasonable deductions from it—it is not true that I have ever concocted false news, or to my knowledge published false or misleading information, or that I have been a party in any way to pretending to receive news which I have not received.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in Router's offices since 1874, four years in South America and five at the head office—the telegrams are generally in foreign languages and in code—"skeleton" conveys to my mind no meaning whatever, and I never heard that expression before this trial—I never saw a telegram expanded in this way before; I call it development—I can only explain the system at our office—we receive telegrams in plain language and also in code—we receive them in plain language from foreign newspapers where the price is low, from places like Zanzibar we receive them not in a skeleton form, but a code is a message composed of frame words and cypher words—the tariff is as high from Zanzibar as from Melbourne there is no difference between a plain message and a message in code—when we receive a telegram in code we may alter its form, but we do not add to it except prepositions and conjunctions which may be required—we do not add nets to it, but it has happened in Melbourne or Australia through excess of zeal that editors have added facts which have not appeared, but directly we found that we reprobated the practice and ordered them to discontinue it—that occurred in Australia but certainly not in the head office; it is practically not the case at Reuter's.</p>

I live at Gordon House, Isle<lb/>worth—in November, 1882, I was staying in Grosvenor Place, and in consequence of a message I went into the hall and saw the prisoner, who gave her name, Ada Lempriere—she said that I should not recollect her under that name, but she reminded me of Lady Daly, and said that she was a Miss Gordon, a niece of Lady Daly and the daughter of the late Colonel Gordon (Lady Daly was the wife of Sir Dominick Daly, Governor of South Australia), and that she had married a man named Lempriere, a clerk in Sir Dominick's office—I believed her, and asked her into a room—she said that she had four children, two girls and two boys, that the eldest was employed and absent in Melbourne, and the two girls were left in charge of her cousins, daughters or daughters-in-law of the late Sir Dominick Daly, and she had come to England to place the boy at school or in some institution—believing her statement I gave her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she told me she had lost some of her effects coming from Egypt, and asked me if she had a claim against the Government—I gave her a letter to Mrs. Gladstone, and one to Colonel Colville, Comptroller of the House<lb/>hold of the Duke of Edinburgh, and this memorandum. (<hi rend="italic">Dated November, 1882, giving particulars of her history, and stating that her husband was killed by Arabs in crossing the square of Alexandria</hi>.)

I am in partnership with Mr. Barker as solicitors, 5, Bell Yard, Doctors' Commons—the defendant applied to me in February for a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for six months—he first deposited his lease, and a mortgage was afterwards executed—the period of his loan expired on 27th August, and I issued this writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to recover the amount—this is an office copy of the judgment—on the same day or the day after, I put an execution in at 16, Southwick Street, and was met by a bill of sale—the Sheriff subsequently interpleaded—the defendant called on me several times, and on 10th October my partner entered into a certain agreement with him, but I was not present—I saw him on several occasions—he said the furniture was all there—he was trying to get us to buy it, subject to the bill of sale—a summons was afterwards issued for his attendance before a Master, and I attended the examination—I don't know the date—the defendant was sworn by the Hon. E. Romilly, and I examined him—the Master took down his statement—this is it—I asked him what had become of the furniture; he said it had been moved,</p>

               <p>some vans came in the morning, and took it away, they came from a Miss Gunner—I said "What did you do? did you protest against it being removed?" he said "No, I put on my hat and coat and went to the City"—I said "Did you help to move any of the furniture?" he said "No"—I said "Do you know where it is?" he said "No"—I said "Do you know to whom the vans belonged which moved it?"—he said "No," but at the end of the examination I asked him again, and he said he believed the vans belonged to Mr. Shepherd, of Carnaby Street—the examination lasted an hour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate girl, living at 15, Boston Place, Dorset Square—on Saturday night, the 13th October, Arthur Ash and Alfred Wise were locked up for assaulting and robbing me, and on the following Monday, the 15th, I appeared at Marylebone Police-court and gave evidence against them—they were remanded to Monday, the 22nd, and on Sunday, the 21st, I went into the Green Man in the Edg<lb/>ware Road about 10.30—I there saw Shea, he asked me if I was going to the Marylebone Police-court next morning; I said "Yes"—he said "You don't want to go against them"—I said I was going and he said</p>

               <p>"You had better take some money and not go against them"—15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was mentioned—McSheen was there, he said in Shea's presence "You had better not go against them, you won't be safe to go along the road if you do"—I made no answer—I told Shea that a gentleman named Turner had called to see me and had offered me money not to go against them—Shea said Wise's father would not give a halfpenny towards it—he said "You had better meet me to-morrow morning at the Pump public-house in Paul Street," and he would give me the money—I and Crosbie, a young woman, and Mrs. Nelson, went to the Pump public-house—about a quarter of an hour after we got there Shea came in and five minutes after that Wise came in—we had nothing to drink—Shea told us to go round to the Carpenters' Arms—he was there when we went in—Shea, Wise, Ellen Crosbie, Mrs. Nelson, and I, went there—Shea gave me a drink and told us to go to the coffee-shop and have some breakfast—after breakfast, which I think Shea paid for, I said to Shea, "I am going to the Court"—he said "You had better not go, you had better have another drink and go round to the Portman's Aims"—Wise heard that—when we got inside the Portman's Arms he said he had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to give me—we were all there—I said I should not take it, I should not take less than 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I was going to the Court—he said he would go and get another 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not give me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left us four in the public-house and went away—I said to Wise that I thought it was very funny that Shea should give me the money—I wondered why Wise's brother did not give it to me—he said it did not make much difference—I, Ellen Crosbie, and Mrs. Nelson went out before Shea came back, and we went down the Edgware Road towards the Court—after we had gone a little way another man came up and said something to me and I went with him into the Olive Branch—Wise came in, I said I was going towards the Court, he said "You had better not go, you had better wait till Shea comes back with the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I, Mrs. Nelson, and Mrs. Crosbie then left the public-house, and I and Mrs. Crosbie, leaving Mrs. Nelson at the corner of Stratford Street, went into the waiting room of the Edgware Road station—that was on the way to the Court—we were in the waiting-room about seven or eight minutes—when we came out we met Mrs. Nelson and Shea—Shea offered me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he said he could not get the other 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and "You had better take this and not go"—he told me to go and have another drink at the Rose and Crown—I, Mrs. Crosbie, Mrs. Nelson, Shea, and Wise were there, and there I took the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Shea said he had just seen Wise's father at the Court—we remained in the public-house some time, and after about an hour Wise left, saying he was going to the Court to see if his brother got off—I, the two women, and Shea, left the Rose and Crown about half-past 3 and went to the Olive Branch—I ought to have been at the police-court at 11 in the morning—Shea said his brother did not get off, and that he hadn't done any good by giving the money to me—I did not appear at the police-court on that Monday—on the following Monday, the 29th, the police came to me, and in consequence I went up on the following Monday, and Ash and Wise were then committed for trial—I told my story to the Magistrate and a summons was issued against the prisoners for this offence.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The cross-examination of the witness on the trial of Ash and Wise was here read by the shorthand writer.</hi>) I gave evidence against them here, they were acquitted—whilst they were under remand I said some others were interfering with me, not the prisoners—I went with Theobald and Mrs. Nelson and Mrs. Crosbie to the Treasury—Theobald took me into a public-house after we had been to the Treasury and treated us to drink—Buck treated me first, before they were committed for trial—I don't recollect if Theobald said on the last occasion here that he had treated us afterwards—I heard Mrs. Nelson say she was treated after<lb/>wards—I don't recollect hearing her say at the police-court that Theobald had treated us to drink before we went in—I was not in the police-court on the last occasion—I did not hear her say "I wish to make an alteration in my statement, I wish to correct my evidence given on the last occasion"—the case of Wise and Shea was adjourned for a fortnight, during which Ash and Wise were tried here, and Theobald gave evidence—I heard him say he had not treated the women more than once, and that was after they had given their evidence at the Treasury—after he had said that here, this case came on at the Mary<lb/>lebone Police-court—I do not know if Mrs. Nelson then got into the box and said she wished to make an alteration in her evidence—Wise and Ash called witnesses to character on the last occasion—I heard something stated about my taking them down there for an immoral purpose and cheating them out of their money, and that there was no foundation for a charge of robbery, and I think the Jury were asked not to believe me—on the Sunday night, in the Green Man, Shea asked me if I was going to the Marylebone Police-court or going to-morrow morning—I said at the police-court I could not remember if he used the words "to the Court"—he first said he would give me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and if they got off he would give me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I positively swear 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the first sum mentioned—the coffee-shop was opposite the Baldwin Arms—I have never been there before—I don't know that anybody from there is here to prove we went there—when we had had breakfast Shea offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had offered me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. first in the Green Man—although I took the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the Rose and Crown I have given true evidence against the prisoners—Mrs. Nelson and Ellen Crosbie, besides Wise, Shea, and myself, were present when the 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was parted with—no one else was there—I swear Peter Shelley was not there—I saw him on the Sunday night—he had some coffee with me—I did not say in his presence "I want to get some money out of these if I can, because I have got their brother in custody"—I have known Shelley about three months—I have not spoken to him since this case has been on—I used to meet and drink with him occasionally up to that time—I had no quarrel with him—I did not in Shelley's presence go over and ask Shea and Wise for money—they did not say "You will get no money out of us, however often you ask"—Shelley came to my room next morning—Ellen Crosbie sleeps in the room with me—I had not a man in bed with me—there was a man in bed, I believe</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at Maritime Chambers, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and am managing owner of the steamship Denia, sailing under the British flag—the prisoner entered my service in 1882, and from that time he had command of the Denia—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the charter-party, dated 18th June, 1883, between J. Hermer and myself, the passage being from Libau to London, ship to be ready on 20th July to carry oats and other grain in bulk—he left Newcastle for Libau in the beginning of July—it was his duty to sign bills of lading—he carried a copy of the charter-party—when he was at Libau I received from him a draft for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Zimmerman and Co., on 23rd July, 1883, on demand to order of R.H. McBride, value received—I cannot read the acceptance—there was no letter in the envelope, but the direction was in the prisoner's writing—I subsequently received this letter.

I said "You are"—he said "There is no fear"—he was intoxicated—I ordered the helmsman to port, the effect of which was that the ship kept out to sea—the captain went to the chart-room again, and at 10.10 we rounded the Skaw light; that is a fixed light on the land, and there is a lightship two miles out from the lighthouse—at 12.10 the engineer reported to me that the shaft had broken—I told the captain, who said "Let her go to hell"—a steamer was passing, and I threw up a rocket—the Danish captain of the steamer Nordcap came under the stern, and I asked him how much he would tow us for; the captain replied 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner said he might go to hell—the prisoner went to the chart-room, and I asked him whether he would allow me to make an agreement with the Danish captain; he said no, he was quite fit to do it himself—he went aft, and some arrangement was made—he afterwards told me to open the hatches and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> the b—cargo overboard—I said "The ship is 10 or 12 miles from land;" he said "Never mind, do it, I am working for your interests"—I have been at sea 17 years—the ship was not in danger at the time, and there was no necessity for throwing the cargo overboard—she was towed to Gothenburg, and in order to get the shaft repaired we discharged some of the cargo into two lighters lying alongside, but it was carefully tallied and replaced in the vessel as it left, and it was sealed down—Captain Cooper came from Lloyd's before the shaft was finished, and in conse<lb/>quence of what had transpired some samples of the cargo were taken ashore at Gottenburg—we were there 25 days—I came with the ship to the Millwall Docks—after the ship arrived 42 quarters of linseed were taken by the consignees from the fore hatch, and they refused to take any more—while unloading, the prisoner, who had been ashore, asked me how we were getting on; I said "Very badly, as they have stopped taking cargo"—he asked the reason; I said "Because it is a swindle from beginning to end"—I had the bills of lading in my pocket, and he had signed them all "clean," and had antedated some of them—he said he was bound to sign the bills of lading "clean" by a clause in the charter-party; I said "I do not think so"—he took me down in the cabin and read the clause to me, and said "Let them go to hell, they</p>

               <p>high tides—I remember the captain taking out some packages to Carl E. Bernard, I believe his name is—he is a stevedore at Libau—I saw him with the captain; he is a friend of his, and he discharged the cargo—what I believe to be Hermer's is a large, fine warehouse, and there are clerks and a substantial-looking business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I am not on the watch I am sometimes about the ship—there are rocks and sands near the Skaw, and where there are rocks and sands it is more dangerous to life than simple sand—there was no reason whatever, in my opinion, for ordering the helmsman to alter the course—we were steering straight towards the lightship—I did not say the prisoner was sober; I said as far as I know; he spoke sober; I said so because I tried to hide his fault—as to the hour when the course was altered it is guesswork, but the lights were, lit—it was after I came to London that I heard about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being deposited with Mr. McBride—I did not know it when I said I had no suspicion of the master running the vessel on shore—I begun to suspect something then.</p>

I joined the Denia as chief engineer, and went on a voyage to Stockholm and then to Libau—I saw the cargo put on board; it was not linseed, it was dirt and seed mixed—on 28th July, when we were nearing the Skaw light, I went on deck, and the ship's head was pointing towards the land—I could see that by the light—I did not hear the mate say anything to the man at the helm, but the ship's course was altered after that to her right course—the shaft broke the same night, and I reported it to the mate and the captain—I told the captain the ship was disabled; he said "Oh, let it go to hell!"—in my opinion he was intoxicated—a Danish steamer came up and an officer came on board, and the captain said to him "Go to hell out of that"—on the same night, after we broke down and before we were in tow, the mate told me that the captain wanted him to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> the cargo overboard—when the captain left the ship in London he wished me good-bye and said "This is a bad job"—I said "This is a swindle"—he either said "They can't hang us" or "It is no hanging matter"—he once told me that he could get a cargo at any time from Hermer's people, and that he had had a present of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Hermer, but not Hermer of Libau—I think it was the father of one of the Hermers.</p>

November last I was en<lb/>gaged by Mr. Beck on the ship Melanope—she was discharging among other things a cargo of linseed in the Victoria Docks—the barge Bertha, of which the prisoner was the master, was alongside—I only knew him on this occasion—Mr. Gibson begin the tallying—after he had taken in a certain quantity he gave me instructions and showed me his tally book—I copied from it the quantity he had tallied in; it was 33, which now appears in my book—when I began to tally I stationed myself in the barge; the prisoner was there, and his mate helping him—they took a tally of their own, and chalked it up on a board—at closing time, 4 o'clock, the tally was 250—the whole of them, except 16, were in the fore part of the barge—about noon the prisoner said to me "Your <hi rend="italic">boss</hi> is not about, if you will give me six bags I will give you half-a-sovereign; you may as well have that for stopping out in the cold"—I shook my head—he said "You need not be frightened, as I have 10 bags from the ship G.H. Waller, and 12 from another ship; no one will know any<lb/>thing about it; leave it to me"—I said nothing to that then—about ten minutes or a, quarter to four I had thought the matter over, and I asked him if he meant it—he said he did—I then said "lam rather short of coin, you had better let me have a shilling"—he went down into the cabin and handed me up half-a-crown—I immediately proceeded to Mr. Beck's house; I saw him soon afterwards, and made a communication to him, and I received instructions from him for the next day—I made this entry in this book the same day—at 9 o'clock next morning I was on borad the Bertha, she was still alongside the ship taking in linseed—the prisoner and his mate were on board—after my back had been turned for a minute or two I saw that three bags had been inserted in what was called the Burton tier—I tallied them after I saw them there—I had not tallied them before—I made a note in my book—I later on there was another bag in another tier, in one of the wings as it is called—I made a mark in my book as to that one—there were 76 in another tier, of which I made a note in my book at the time—all the bags come down a shoot—I saw Mr. Beck in the afternoon, and made a communication to him, and produced my tally book, and he went to the police—I said to the prisoner that day "How about the balance? you have got five bags, and I shall probably not be here on Monday"—he said "I will give it you when we have finished the Graft."</p>

               <p>a locked cupboard in a front room 27 bottles and two jars, all containing liquids of some kind—I poured out some from one of the jars, and Mr. Catten tasted it—on Friday, 30th, I went with Mr. Starkey, of the Customs House, and made a further examination, and brought away some nutmeg and peppercorns—we found no more spirits, but some papers and Customs House books, which Mr. Starkey said were Govern<lb/>ment property and he should seize it—some of the bottles were full, some half, and some three-quarters—some were marked "Prepared specially for Her Majesty's Stationery Office," and one contained gum and one glycerine I believe—there was nothing on the spirit bottles; they are all here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I don't know if these are the sort of bottles used at the office, or if they are sampling bottles.</p>

On Saturday, 24th November, I was with Harvey near Hayes Wharf about 4 o'clock, and saw the prisoner leave the end of Hayes Lane carrying a paper parcel which contained oranges—Harvey was following—I noticed the prisoner's right coat pocket rather bulky—I followed him up Duke Street, High Street, Borough, to the top of Blackman Street, opposite the police-station, about three-quarters of a mile I should think—I was in plain clothes—that would be on his way home—I stopped him, and said "You have something heavy there in your pocket, mister; what</p>

               <p>is it?"—I had had him pointed out—he looked rather surprised—I said "I am a police-officer"—he said "Well, I cannot show you here"—I said "Then step inside the police-station"—he did so—I said "Now what is it?"—then he took from his pocket this round bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) marked "H. M. C."—I said "Where did you get it from?"—he said "From my place, Hayes Wharf; it is my per<lb/>quisite"—I said "I don't think you have any right with it; have you anything more about you?"—he said "No"—I searched him, and in each of his trousers pockets I found another bottle—these are the two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I found; they contained brandy—as soon as I had found them in his trousers pockets he said "I didn't say I hadn't any more; I said I had only spirits"—I said "Well, how do you account for them?"—he said "Well, it is the trick of the trade, if you ask me"—I charged him with unlawful possession—he said nothing further—he gave an address, 80, Trafalgar Street, Walworth—I did not go there; Harvey went—the bottles were handed over to a gentleman from the Customs for examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This one had a partly torn label on; the other things have been put on—the bottles were marked in the glass "H M C"—I could not say if bottles so marked are broken up when empty—other servants might have been coming out at the time; I only saw him—I saw him after Harvey—Harvey followed him up Hayes Lane, and pointed him out to me—I did not take a note of the conversation between us then—he was carrying a bag besides the paper parcel; the bag is not here—it was a small string bag, in which he would carry his food—it was given up to his wife—I stopped him outside the police-station—he took the round bottle from his pocket, and then said "It is only a little drop of spirit I took from my place at Hayes Wharf"—I said "Does any one know you have brought this away?"—he said "I don't know they do; they have all left"—then I said "What account are you going to give of it then?" and he said "It is the trick of the trade"—I have been a detective in that neighbourhood going on for three years—I think you would find all these bottles, except the one marked "H M C" and those with gum and glycerine, which are prepared specially for the Govern<lb/>ment offices, sold at a certain class of shops in the neighbourhood—I don't know if the clerks in the Government offices break up the gum bottles when empty; I have never seen such bottles—I don't know if they are probably washed when empty—I know brandy from rum—I have only tried the white-coloured liquid in the gum bottle—I tasted it; it is glycerine, I believe—I have not tried the pure ginger brandy—the officer of Customs examined that.</p>

I am examining officer of Customs, stationed at Hayes Wharf—the prisoner was under me as sample drawer—a very large stock of spirits is in bond at Hayes Wharf, and was on 24th November; I should think over 1,000 casks altogether—the prisoner's duties are when the reguage papers are brought to me I enter them in a book and hand the papers to the prisoner, he makes out a label with the particulars of it, and puts it on a bottle; the spirit is drawn out of the cask in the vault through a valinch by the sample drawer into a bottle, which he puts into my office with the key—in the office it is tested—it remains there until the surveyor is satisfied with it, and then it is returned to the same cask through the bunghole at the wharf—that is the sample</p>

               <p>drawer's duty—he has no right to take away with him the sample or any quantity of it after it has been tested—on 24th November I and the prisoner came out of the office together—I certainly had not given him authority to take any bottles with him, and certainly did not know he was taking any—I know of no perquisites that attach to his office—this bottle marked "H M C" is one of the sampling bottles—the label that remains gives no indication of where it comes from—I have searched the book.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have numbered them 1, 2, and 3—I found three casks of brandy had been reguaged on 24th November—they were about 5 per cent. stronger quality than those in the bottles—on 7th November I nave found by the books a cask of almost similar brandy was reguaged as that contained in bottle No. 1, and on the 14th a cask of brandy similar to No. 3, but I can find no brandy reguaged in nor similar to that in No. 2—of the three bottles found on the prisoner, no brandy corresponding to their contents had been reguaged on that day—I know nothing of the vaults in my official capacity—a specified quantity, about three gills, is to be drawn from the cask for testing—the bottles are constructed to hold about three gills—there should not be and I have not seen any receptacle in the vaults for liquor besides the casks—there is a natural loss from the cask, sometimes more and sometimes lees—some vaults are dry and some wet—the wharfinger would be answerable for an excessive deficiency—we have a scale of allowances—the gauger and examining officer measure the natural loss when the cask goes out—Linnell should find the quantity in a cask and its strength, and make his computa<lb/>tion for duty before it went over to the merchant—it is the duty of the officers to see there is no excessive loss—I have heard casually that there is an arrangement by which some jar or receptacle is kept in the vault, in which some of the liquor is poured, and then when a cask is found to have had too great a natural loss, it is made up out of the jar; but I do not think such a thing occurs.</p>
