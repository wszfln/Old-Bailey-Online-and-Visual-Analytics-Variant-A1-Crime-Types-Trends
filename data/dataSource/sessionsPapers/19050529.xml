J. Cowley, Esq., Ringwood, Ranelagh Gar<lb/>dens, London, S.W.—that was not an address upon the prisoner's rounds—I posted it at the South Western District Post Office about 12.45 that day—that is the post office where the prisoner is employed—I gave instructions as to what was to be done—the packet coming in the ordi<lb/>nary way under the prisoner's observation, should have been thrown out as a mis-sort; it was placed in his delivery—about 5.15 I saw him at the district office and told him 1 had been enquiring into the losses of packets, and I cautioned him—I said, "You had a mis-sort packet on your walk to-day for Ranelagh Gardens; what did you do with it?"—he said, "I remember the packet; I threw it out as a mis-sort"—I said, "Do you mind turning out your pockets?"—he said, "No," and pro<lb/>duced from a pocket a small purse, at the bottom of which was the ring marked by me—I said, "What have you done with the other contents</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290005"/>
               <p>of the packet?"—he said, "I have not seen them. I can account for my possession of the ring; I picked it up on the floor of the office. After I threw the packet out as a mis-sort, I picked the ring up"—the ring could not have come out, even if the packet had been opened, because it would not have come out of the chocolate box—it was a very tightly pressed box.</p>

I am not married. I have been living here about a week with him"—I told her that Taylor had been arrested for being in possession of counterfeit coin, and I had reason to believe that instruments for manufacturing coin would be found in the room, and that a search would be made—she said, "I know nothing about it"—the other officers and myself made a search, and between the mattress and the bed I found these twenty-eight counterfeit florins (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) wrapped in this piece of stocking (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I showed them to Lea and she said, "I knew they were there, but when he went out he told me not to touch anything that was under the bed"—I left, leaving her with the other two officers.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 48, Garvan Road, Fulham, and am a servant—I was engaged to be married to the deceased—on Saturday, April 1st, he called for me at my house between 8.10 and 8.30 p.m.—between 8.30 and 9p.m. I went out with him, and we walked towards the top of Field Road—we stopped at the Queen's Arms, at the corner of Field Road, for fifteen min<lb/>utes and then walked towards Fulham Palace Road, along Greyhound Road—we were walking arm in arm on the right-hand side of the road—I noticed a barrel organ playing, and we stopped and listened to it for about twenty minutes—we then passed on in the same direction past the laundry shops in Greyhound Road—I know the railings on the right hand side of the road opposite the laundry shops—as we came along towards the railings, I saw two men coming in the opposite direction; one of them appeared to be drunk, and was rolling about—the other man was walking with him, but had not got hold of him then—I was walking next the railings—as we met them the drunken man rolled up against deceased, and pushed me into the railings—the deceased said, "Mind where you are going"—the drunken man said, "I will soon show you where I am going," and he got hold of the deceased, and pushed him into the road—he caught hold of him by his shoulders; they were facing each other—the deceased went back two or three steps, and fell on the back of his head in the road—the drunken man fell on top of the deceased, and, while in that position, punched him two or three times in his side—then he got up and kicked him on the head or neck while the deceased was still lying down—the second man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290017"/>
               <p>was standing on the pavement, and after the deceased had been kicked the drunken man walked away, and the other man took hold of him—they went away together towards the Prince of Wales, which was the direction they were going when we met them—only two of the shops were open at this time: a paper shop, and a barber's shop—the drunken man was the prisoner; I had never seen him before—he had on a dark cap, dark tie, turn-down collar, a square-cut dark coat and dark trousers—he had black round his eye, and the eye itself was red and bloodshot—he had heavy boots on—the second man had a bowler hat, an overcoat and light trousers—on April 2nd I saw a number of men at the police station, and picked out the prisoner—after the deceased fell down he did not move—I went to him, but he did not speak, and I sent a boy for assistance—the police came and took him away on an ambulance—he was quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite sure we left the Queen's Arms about 9.15—I saw the time by a clock in a chemist's about three minutes from the Queen's Arms—it was after that that we heard the barrel organ in the Greyhound Road—the men were about fifteen or twenty yards away when I first saw them—I did not take particular notice of them then, only that they were rolling about, and we went in against the railings to get away from them—when the prisoner rolled up against the deceased I do not think he did it on purpose; I think it was the result of the condition he was in—I am quite sure the other man wore a bowler hat, and that his trousers were light—I know now that the prisoner lives in the same road as I do, but as far as I know I had not seen him before—it was rather dark in the road—I was not frightened when the prisoner caught hold of the deceased by the shoulders; I was when he was hitting him—when he was in the road I moved back, and did not go back to the deceased until the men had started to go away again—I saw the man's face who pushed the deceased down, I knew he was the same cut of man as the prisoner, but I could not exactly recognise his features—I did not see the other man face to face—he was facing me, but I did not look at him—after the deceased had been taken away I went to the police station with his mother—his sister also came to the door, but she stopped outside—a boy named Watson was not with us when we were going—before we got to the station I did not hear anybody say, "Jimmy Rice <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that"—we stopped at the station with the deceased until he went to the infirmary—detective Hood first spoke to me about this about 12 o'clock that night; I do not remember who spoke to me first; there were two detectives there—I went with Hood to the prisoner's house—I had been out with Watson before that—Watson said he thought it was Jimmy Rice who had knocked the deceased down—that was the first I heard of Rice—when Hood and I went and knocked at the deceased's door two of his sisters answered it—Hood asked if their brother Jimmy lived there, and they said he was not in—Hood said he was a friend of his come to see him, and that he had been in the Army with him—he did not then say anything about a man having been knocked down—there was no conversation as to how the prisoner was dressed—Hood did not ask the sisters whether their brother wore a bowler hat; I did not hear any<lb/>body ask them that—I was not present when Bedford went; I was talking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290018"/>
               <p>to Hood about fifteen yards away—I did not know that Bedford was going to ask for the prisoner again—I did not knock at the door at all—I called at the house once—I heard the sisters tell Hood that their brother had a black eye—nobody told me that he had a black eye; I saw it for myself—I heard next day that Tomlin, the deceased's brother, had given the prisoner the black eye—when I identified the prisoner there was no other man with a black eye, but I picked him out by his clothes as well—his collar was not clean—I had seen his boots when he picked up his foot to kick the deceased; I was about five yards away then—they were not particularly heavy boots, nor very light—I did not notice any nails in them—the man who knocked the deceased down looked tidy; he did not look clean, but looked as if he was a respectable workman out for a Saturday night—the other man looked like a workman and looked tidy—when they went away I looked after them—there was a woman going along with them with a green coat on and I left them to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I stepped back it was only for about five yards—I saw the woman in a green coat—I have seen her since; her name is Mrs. Dowden—when I went back to the deceased I had seen Mrs. Dowden—I went back to him directly the man left, and directly the other man had got hold of the prisoner—I first noticed the prisoner's face when he was coming towards me; there was a lamp at the corner of the road which shone on his face—it was then that I saw his black eye—I went with the ambulance to the police station; I did not go to the infirmary—I did not give any information to the police that night; I did next morning—about midnight I saw detectives Bedford and Hood at the station—I did not give them any description then; I had not made any statement to them at the time I went to Garvan Road—I had spoken to them—when I got to the police station with the ambulance I think I stayed there about thirty minutes—I remained until I went to 20, Garvan Road, with the officers—I think we got there about midnight—it was next day that I saw the prisoner at the station in the morning amongst a number of other people—I recognised him and pointed him out; I have no doubt at all that he is the man.</p>

               <p>kicked the deceased was dressed in cord trousers, heavy boots, and a, blue serge cap—both the men went round to the Prince of Wales which is near a baker's shop—I waited until the deceased was taken away on an ambulance, and on Sunday I went to the Fulham police station about 3.30 p.m.—I saw a number of men standing there in a row and picked out the prisoner; I noticed he had a black eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was out on an errand for my mother—I was just by Geissler's grocer's shop—I saw the men coming from Crefeld Road—they met the deceased and Kirby almost directly they came to the pavement—I know one of the men had a long coat on and the other one a short coat—the other man had a hard bowler hat—Kirby and the deceased were coming from the Prince of Wales and the two men were coming towards them—I did not see anybody fall on the deceased; he fell in the road by himself—I did not see any blow in his face—I did not see what made the deceased fall into the road—when I got home I told my mother that the deceased had been kicked by the prisoner—somebody in the road had said the prisoner had done it, about fifteen minutes after it had happened—my mother said she knew Jimmy Rice—I did not see the prisoner's face when we were in the road; he was coming behind me, I believe—when the man knocked up against the deceased I walked up to see what was the matter—I must have passed them because they went round Margravine Road—I did not see them come round Margravine Road; somebody in the road told me that they had—nobody told me that the prisoner had a black eye; I did not see that he had a black eye until the Sunday morning—I did not tell my mother what kind of a man it was I had seen do this—she did not tell me it was Jimmy Rice who had done it—I was shown a plan at the station and asked to show where I was standing—I do not know how long before this night it was that I had seen the prisoner—there were a lot of people in the road when it happened, and they came while the struggle was going on—I did not see anybody trying to stop the two men from going away—I went away to see how the deceased was getting on—I did not go to the station with him—I went on my errand—everybody was talking about it; it was then that I heard somebody say it was Jimmy Rice.</p>

               <p>Clifford's and was returning towards the Prince of Wales on the foot-path by the railings, and I saw three men coming down the road—two of them were struggling—I thought they were playing at wrestling—I saw two of them fall on the kerb—they got up and I cannot say which of them threw the deceased into the roadway—I cannot say how he was held—he fell very heavily upon his head and the other man kicked him—I saw the kick—I called out, "You dirty brute, you have kicked the man; hit him while he is up, not while he is down"—the third man who was standing by came to me, and said "Don't say anything, <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>; the other one kicked him first"—I said, "He did not"—the two men walked towards the Prince of Wales—the deceased was still lying on the ground, and, as far as I could see, did not move—I followed the men as they went in the direction of the Prince of Wales—I said I would give them in charge—the men who had kicked the de<lb/>ceased made use of a filthy expression, and said he would kick me too—I continued to follow, and he was going to break away to strike me, but the other one held him tight—he tried twice to break away to strike me—I was alarmed, and thought it wise to go into Geissler's shop, and I left them to go on their way—the last I saw of them was when they were going in the direction of the Prince of Wales—when the deceased was kicked as he lay in the road I heard a woman scream just after the kicking had taken place, but I did not see anybody there whom I could recognise—I had seen Curl, Watson and the prisoner together on Sunday, March 26th, in the Pear Tree—I noticed that the prisoner had a very bad black eye; that is the reason I noticed him—when I saw him in the Pear Tree on April 1st he still had it; it was even blacker—he looked to me as if he had come home from work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 127, Greyhound Road, opposite Crefeld Road—on Saturday, April 1st, about 9.30, I was at the corner of Bayonne Road and Greyhound Road—I saw the deceased, whom I knew before, and a young woman walking along Greyhound Road, and a couple of men coming in the opposite direction—near Geissler's shop I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> one of the men come up to the deceased and push him—he fell in the roadway, and then I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the man go to him and raise his foot three or four times in the action of kicking—it seemed as though the man caught hold of the deceased's two shoulders and pushed him into the road—it was while he was lying in the road that I saw the man's foot <hi rend="italic">go</hi> three or four times—I did not see the deceased move after he fell down—I know now the man who kicked him—I had not seen him before that night—I noticed he had a bloodshot eye with black marks round it—on April 11th I saw a number of men in a row at the station and picked out the prisoner as the man who had kicked the deceased—after the man had done the kicking he and the other man walked towards Geissler's store and towards the Prince of Wales, and disappeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the Police Court and the Coroner's Court—the prisoner had not got a black eye when I picked him put, he had a blood<lb/>shot eye—there was no other man there who had a black eye—it was the prisoner's right eye—there was about a foot between the prisoner and the other man who was nearest me—to see the prisoner's black eye I should have to look through the other man who was standing between us—the nearest lamp was about thirty feet away—the prisoner was dressed in a kind of dark tweed coat and waistcoat of a kind of greenish colour—when the sergeant came to my house I told him he had a light grey suit on by mistake—I did not tell him he had a dark cap on—I first thought of that at the West London Police Court—I saw the policeman come to the deceased—I did not go and say a word to the policeman—when I saw the deceased in the road it did not strike me that he was hurt—I did not hear any crash—I did not go over to the policeman, because I was waiting to see somebody—it did not strike me that something serious had happened—it is not usual for men to be thrown down in the street and be kicked</p>

               <p>and a policeman to go to them—I did not think it was right to go and see if the man was hurt—I did not notice how the other man was dressed; all I know is that he had an overcoat on and a bowler hat—I did not tell the police that, and they did not tell me that he had a bowler hat on—I did not hear the witnesses at the Court say that he had a bowler hat on—nobody ever said to me, "There is Rice and Watson going for Tomlin," but I heard somebody say that to another man; I do not know who the man was—the deceased was then on the ground—I did not tell the policeman that, because I did not want to have anything to do with it—I did not know the prisoner or Watson before—I did not see the man who threw the deceased down fall on top of him—if he had fallen I must have seen it—the two men I saw walking along opposite me were respectably dressed—the clothes the prisoner had on appeared to be working ones—the other man had an overcoat on and a clean collar; he looked clean—the first time I talked about this was eight days afterwards—I had not paid a word to anybody during that time—I was asked to give a statement, and then told Sergeant Bedford that the man was wearing light clothes—the state<lb/>ment was read over to me and Bedford asked me if it was correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I corrected my statement about the light suit at the West London Police Court—I do not know how I came to describe it as a light suit—I did not know the prisoner or Watson before—I had known the deceased for about six years—I also knew Frederick and Frederick Robert Tomlin—I do not know who made the statement as to the pri<lb/>soner and Watson being at Tomlin again—I did not notice a little boy there at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner, and assistant medical superintendent to the Fulham Infirmary—about 10.50 p.m. on April 1st the deceased was brought in in a comatose condition, and blood was issuing from his nostrils—I made a careful examination of him after he had been undressed in the ward—there was no evidence of external</p>

               <p>injury, and he remained in the same condition until he died about 12.50 that morning—on Monday, April 3rd, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found no external signs of injury, but on removing the brain I found an extensive fracture at the base of the skull—that would hardly be con<lb/>sistent with a fall on the back of the head—the fracture extended to the hole in the bottom of the skull through which the spinal cord enters, and it radiated from there—it was consistent with a fall on to the top or side of the head or with a kick by a boot—I cannot say if I should expect to find marks of violence upon the head if the fracture had been caused by a lack from a boot—if it was a sharp pointed tipped boot it might have given the injury; the side of the boot would not have given it—it could have been very severe without leaving any mark—the force must have been violent to cause such an extensive injury—the force could be violent without showing any outward sign, such as a man falling from a height into a bale of wool, or falling on his feet on to a soft mass—if the deceased had been thrown very violently into the roadway, this extensive fracture might have been caused then, and there might have been a mark left—I do not think you could throw anybody into the road with all your might without marking his head—if the deceased wore a cap he might fall with<lb/>out showing any signs.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I have formed the opinion that the injury was due to some violence directed to the top of the skull—a kick at the top of the skull might have done it—I do not think a kick with the aide of a boot would necessarily leave any mark, but I cannot state it as a fact—I have never heard of a man kicking anything with the side of his boot—a sudden jar or jerk would, I think, cause the injury—a sudden jar may have injured the inside of the head, and not the outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Assuming a man of the prisoner's height was kicking a man on the ground on the head, or on the side of the neck, I should expect to find bruises—it would not be possible for a man to lock another on the head without doing so, unless he kicked him with the side of his boot, but I cannot say if the force would be sufficient then to break his skull.</p>

I can prove where I have been since about 7.30 p.m., and I have not been out since. I was with Bill Watson at 49, Chelmsford Street, all that time until now. I thought there was something wrong when I saw you here"—at the station he said, "I went home about 6.45 and gave my sister Ethel my money and left again, and got to Watsons' about 7.30 p.m. As to Tomlin, I thought it was him that set Tomlin on to me, and he gave me a black eye last Saturday week"—at the station Tomlin's name had been mentioned as Tomlin, not Robert Tomlin—I do not know the christian name—later that morning the prisoner said, "I did go out for a pint of beer in a bottle.

                  </hi>. I am wharf clerk to F. Meyer's Sohn, Limited, of 17, Mincing Lane, sugarbrokers—we have been interested in the sale of a commodity called Moloweat, and appointed agents to canvass for orders—among the agents was the prisoner, who was appointed on March 17th, 1904—Moloweat is a mixture of molasses and other things for feeding horses and cattle—the terms were that the prisoner was to be paid 10 per cent, on all orders, subject to the receipt of the amounts of the invoice from his buyers—he was told never to collect money—the first agreement was verbal, but this is the prisoner's letter of March 19th, 1904 (<hi rend="italic">Acknowledging receipt of agreement, and confirming the verbal agreement, and stating that the Moloweat was to be sold at £5 a ton net, and that the commission would be payable to the prisoner on the amounts when received</hi>]—he had no authority to collect moneys—he sent in thirty-eight orders from customers, amounting to £252—I received from Mr. Carter, a customer, £3 3s. 9d., upon which I sent the prisoner 6s. 4d. due to him for commission—altogether I think he has had £3 2s. 6d. on account of his commissions—he wrote asking for money for expenses, and I think he had £1 at that time—I made continuous applications to customers whose names he had sent to me—I got no payment—I commenced an action against Carter in the Mayor's Court—in the course of that action Carter produced a receipt signed by the prisoner for the amount I was suing him for, and I had to pay the costs—I made inquiries and ascertained that a similar sum had been collected from a Mr. Strickland—in consequence my solicitor swore an informa<lb/>tion, and a warrant was granted by the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner</hi>). I was a clerk in the service of Mr. Sidford, an accountant, of 1, New Court, Carey Street—I was employed in keeping the books of Israel &amp; Joel for some time—I had a salary of £2 10s. a week—Jenn kept the Sold Ledger—he was a clerk to Israel &amp; Joel at £2 5s. a week—the debits in the Sold Ledger are written up from the Day Book, and the credits from the Cash Book—I checked the Sold Ledger with another clerk every week—if the debit entries were not there the clerk would make a note which would be handed to Jenn, and the error pointed out to him; that is what I ought to have done—the credits were not called, but posted direct by Jenn from the Cash Book—those were checked by two of Sidford's clerks—in September or October, 1903, Jenn spoke to me—I cannot give you the exact words, but the effect of his proposition was that I should pass certain omissions, and that the customer would pay him half, which he would divide with me—I did not agree to that at first, but afterwards I did—in pursuance of that arrange<lb/>ment I received money from Jenn from time to time—another method of falsification was that I should put entries into the ledger of cheques that never came, representing moneys that had never been paid—I did that, and received money from Jenn for the transaction, amounting to £150 or £160—looking at the account of Marsh in the Sold Ledger I see that under the date of July 9th, 1904, I entered a cheque of £29 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; October 31st, 1904, a cheque for £61 2s., 6d. and empties £7 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; December 3rd, a cheque for £7 3s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; January 20th, 1905, a cheque for £28 1s. 3d., and empties £8 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; July 27th, a cheque for £46 10s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; March 2nd, a cheque for £98 7s. 9d., and empties £19; March 9th, a cheque for £80 2s. 11d. all those entries are in my writing—I had no duty in connection with the entries in that ledger except in Jenn's absence—they are all fictitious entries, I believe; I speak from memory—they are my ticks opposite to them—the ticks should have been those of the accountant's clerk, Kelly—looking at the Day Book for the Russell Street shop, I find the entry of 11 flats of grapes, 153 1/2 lbs. at 10d., £6 9s. 8d., under the date of December 1st, 1903—that is ticked in the ledger—the Day Book was kept by the clerk Gorman—I cannot swear to the tick, but I know whose tick it should be—it is made in green ink in the ordinary way—it was Jenn's duty to pass these entries into the ledger—in the same entry is 33s. for empties, ticked in green ink, and as far as I can see it is the same tick as applied to the immediately preceding entries—looking at the ledger, I find two entries preceding that of the grapes, and two following it in Jenn's writing—they are ticked in the same way as this one—they are 5 bags of Brazil nuts, 5 of almonds, 6 bags of flowers, and 100 flowers, but there is no entry of the grapes where it should be in the middle of those four</p>

               <p>entries—turning to the account of Bonning, under date of April 23rd 1904, I find the entry of a cheque for £62 13s. 6d. in Jenn's writing—the entry of July 16th, 1904, of a cheque for £20 14s. 3d., and empties, £14s., it in my writing—it is not genuine—there ought to have been nothing there—the tick should be that of one of Mr. Sidford's clerks, not mine—the counter<lb/>foil of the Receipt Book shows a receipt from G. Bonner of 13s. 6d.—the name should be Bonning—that entry of £62 13s. 6d. on July 16th is altered from the 13s. 6d.—my entry of December 7th, 1904, of a cheque for £17 5s. 1d., and empties, £2 9s., is fictitious; also that of July 21st, 1906, of a cheque for £29 8s. 4d., and empties, £1 2s.—the entry of July 29th, 1904, is in Jenn's writing—looking to Bonning's ledger account of that date, I find two entries of 10 1/2 bushels of greengages, and 10 1/2 bushels of plums in Jenn's writing—there are two Day Books for one shop, and one for the other—looking at the Day Book for Russell Street, on July 29th I find the entry of 20 half bushels of pears, 20 bags of tomatoes, and 2 flats of cucumbers, ticked as if they were entered in the ledger with the same sort of tick—the ledger was made up every day—the books of the two shops were kept in the same office—they were checked, not necessarily the same day, but as soon as convenient—the books of the Russell Street shop, and of the South Row shop never left the office—Jenn was employed at the South Row office—the Day Books are made up from the sale tickets which are sent from the shops to the office where the books are kept—turning to Newman's account under date January 1st, 1905 find an entry of a cheque for £13 9s. in my writing—that is not ficti<lb/>tious, as well as the entry of the 25th of £23 4s. 4d.—on December 15th, 1903, I find in the ledger, "50 bags of potatoes, empties 25s. price 90s. balance £9 5s.,"and in the Russell Street Day Book, "20 cases of dates at 8s. 9d. balance £5 4s. 2d."—the latter is not entered in the ledger, though it is ticked as if it were—the entry of 50 bags of potatoes in the ledger is in Jenn's writing—the entry in the Day Book is that of a clerk—the 20 cases of dates is in the same writing—on April 12th Mr. Sidford spoke to me about some false entries—I made a statements to him, and pointed out the entries in the books—I told Jenn later on that day what Mr. Sidford had said—Jenn had been called into the office and we were there together—our attention was called to the £62 first—I told Jenn that I thought the best thing he could do was to make a clean breast of it—he said, "No, I do not think so"—on the same day I saw him at a public-house, near the market, later on, about 1.30 or 2 o'clock, in the luncheon interval—I still advised him to come back to the office and own up—he promised he would do so the next day—he did not come back to the office—I was suspended the same day, about 12 o'clock, and returned at 6 in the evening—I saw Mr. Sidford—I was told to stay away for a few days—Jenn called at my house—very little was said—I did not see him again till last Tuesday after the police-sergeant had arrested him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From November, 1903, till April 7th, 1905, there is no entry in Jenn's writing except one of £56 13s. 6d.—it did not strike me that it would look suspicious for the cash entries to appear in my writing in a book kept by him—it does not appear so now—an audit is</p>

               <p>made by Mr. Sidford and his clerks, apart from me—there are a number of genuine entries in my writing in the ledger of money payments—here is <hi rend="italic">one of</hi> £3 14s. and another of £2 0s. 6d. of another customer—my fictitious entries do not extend over two years—the clerk Gorman received some of the Proceeds of' this fraud—we can identify one another's ticks, as different people make their ticks in different ways—there are genuine mistakes in the entries—I had nothing to do with checking payments—I ticked the credits in the ledger—it was not Gorman's duty to call out to Jenn the entries which he had made in the Day Book from the tickets—I made entries from the Day Book into the ledger in a good many instances, covering a considerable period—another clerk named Coleman checked the entries in the ledger—I know the porter, Levy—he carries the goods from the shop to the van of the customer when it is waiting outside—I have not heard of complaints being made of Gorman not entering the goods—Jenn's words to me were not, "I know nothing about it, but I cannot explain the entry of the £62"—that is not the substance of what he said—I do not know of any difficulties with the firm as to Michael Israel keeping the books—I do not know that the books were removed from the office—I do not know that they were moved at the request of Mr. Joel—it is very difficult to keep accounts of large dealings of this kind by different clerks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Reexamined.</hi> My entry of July 9th, 1904, of a cheque for £29 18s. is the earliest of my fictitious entries, to the best of my belief—the stock was checked each week—I passed over the omitted entries when the amounts were called out as if they appeared in the ledger—the fictitious entries were made after the checking, because they would not be re<lb/>ferred back to—the books were balanced, to the best of my knowledge, once a year—a customer was credited with considerable amounts which he never, in fact, paid, and one entry was made to balance another—I have not stated' till to day that Gorman was a party to these frauds, if I may exclude what I have said to my legal adviser—Jenn paid Gor<lb/>man—the money I had was given to me by Jenn, perhaps once a week, or not quite so often—I received about a third, not in a public-house, but in the office—I think I only received gold on two occasions—Gor<lb/>man was only concerned with Marsh's account, so far as I know he knows nothing of the others—some of the money I have received on the way from Marsh's place of business—I went there with Jenn at night time once, and on a second occasion in the afternoon—the first occasion was about Christmas, 1903, and the second occasion early in March of the present year—Jenn went to Marsh's shop And I waited in the Harrow Road—Jenn took a turning out of the Harrow Road—on the first occa<lb/>sion I waited quite half an hour, and on the second occasion a good deal longer—when Jenn came back to me he gave me money—on the first occasion how much I do not remember, but on the second it was £6 or £8—Gorman assisted in the frauds in Marsh's case—he had nothing to do with omissions from the ledger; he simply knew what we were doing, therefore he had to stand in with the money—I did not tell him our pro<lb/>ceedings were limited to Marsh—I did not tell him about Newman, so</p>

I am an accountant practising at 1, New Court, Carey Street—for some time past I have had charge of the accounts of Israel &amp; Joel—they are wholesale fruiterers in the market—the first document is the sale ticket, which is made out at the time of the sale, and is sent into the counting house—from it an entry is made into the Day Book—these tickets are numbered in numerical order and in series—there may be three series at a time—from the Day Book the entries, were posted into the Sold Ledger by Jenn, who was principally the Sold Ledger clerk—there were others—the accounts were sent out weekly on the Saturday by Jenn, made up from the Sold Ledger—they would be paid to the cashier, who was downstairs in the shop—they are supposed to be paid weekly, but sometimes they ran a little longer—the cashier would give a receipt upon a printed form—that was the only form of receipt recognised—those forms have running numbers like the one pro<lb/>duced; then the cashier would enter the payment in a rough Cash Book, and from that they were copied into a Fair Copy Cash Book—that was Jenn's duty—it was also his duty to enter them into the customer's account in the ledger—this is a counterfoil receipt—on Tuesdays I checked the entries—I called out the, debit entries from the Day Book, while Clarabutt looked at the ledger—Clarabutt had nothing to do with the Sold Ledger except in Jenn's absence, and even then it was not necessary—I sent two clerks to check the credits of the customer with the Cash Book—the entries were ticked as they were checked—I see now the ticks of a different person—the entry of July 9th, 1904, in Marsh's account is not ticked by the regular clerk—that is a false entry of £29 18s.—it is in red ink—I have checked the entries of Marsh's credit in a ledger with the entries in the Cash Book of payments made by him, and the counterfoil receipt books in black ink, and in another column the red ink checkings of entries in the Cash Book, amounting to £559 11s. 5d., between July 9th, 1904, and March 9th of this year, in Clarabutt's writing—I find £559 11s. 5d. credited to Marsh, but those entries are fictitious—they have tickets other than those of the entering clerk—I know Clarabutt's ticks—these are his—the items must have been ticked

               <p>after they had been called over—he must have gone back and put them in, otherwise it must have been discovered—supposing the ledger was ticked on July 15th, the entry would be put in before that date—the ledger was not squared off weekly—the entry as to the five bags of Brazil nuts, etc., is omitted from the ledger—from the £559 11s. 5d. there has to be deducted £287 16s. 6d., the amount of falsification—I have prepared a similar exhibit with regard to Bonning's account, as to which I find a false credit amounting to £134 2s. 8d., and the fraudulent omissions to £105 1s. 7d., the total of both being £239 4s. 3d.—in New<lb/>man's account the false credits are £36 6s. 1d., and the improper omis<lb/>sions £106 5s. 10d., making a total of £142 11s. 11d.—I first gave evidence on April 26th, when these three exhibits were put in—at that time no process had been obtained against Marsh, Bonning or Newman, and I did not know what documents they might have in their possession—since their arrest documents have been found in their possession—with regard to Marsh's account I find a bundle of invoices which were found by the police and produced in Court—I have them in my hand—I have examined them with Israel &amp; Joel's ledger—they are in Jenn's writing—it was his duty to make out those bills—in the accounts sent to Marsh there are a large number of omissions of items which appear even in the ledger and which are not included in the bills—I find the items so omitted from the accounts, but included in the ledger, exactly balance the false credits entered in the ledger, so far as they relate to these accounts—I have prepared a statement (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 7), which show those omissions and the corresponding false entries in the ledger to balance them, in red ink—the items in black are in the ledger, but omitted from the accounts—the fictitious entries which balance the omissions are shown in red ink—I knew nothing of the existence of those invoices found by the police at the time I made out this statement, but they exactly agree with the statement I made out—there are a double set of omissions, first the omissions of orders received, and there are other omissions of goods sup<lb/>plied—then entries are balanced by fictitious entries of cash which was never paid—I also find amongst the papers found by the police receipts for genuine payments, and some accounts not receipted—the receipts correspond with the genuine payments according to my exhibit—on the other hand 1 do not find any receipt for the fictitious payments—I have examined Marsh's banking account (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find that it shows payments which I have put in my exhibit as genuine, and no items in respect of payments which are fictitious—the fictitious items are not in Marsh's Pass Book—turning to Bonning's account, some docu<lb/>ments were found by the police in his possession; amongst them were receipts—there were no receipts between January 16th and May 5th, 1904, but I find false entries from April 23rd and July 16th, 1904—an item of £62 settles all the accounts between those two dates—that is a false entry of a payment of £62, which purports to have been made on April 23rd, before some of the goods were supplied—the entry is in Jenn's writing—there is am absence of documents between those two dates—I find among the documents produced genuine payments on June 14th</p>

               <p>and 18th, a false credit of £20 14s. 3d. and £1 4s. and in the documents produced by the police, unreceipted accounts for that sum of £21 18s. 3d.—all the others are receipted after that till I come to a group of false credits—the documents produced by the police exactly corroborate my statement which was made out some weeks before—at Bow Street, when I was being cross-examined by the defendant Newman's [<hi rend="italic">Not yet tried</hi>] advocate some documents were put in, in his defence—on examining them I find there were debts ranging from May, 1698, to Decem<lb/>ber, 1904—bills were produced which range from October, 1899, to Octo<lb/>ber, 1903—Newmans banking account was also produced, in which I found entries of his genuine payments in every case, but the fictitious entries of April 26th are not in the banking account and there are no receipts for them—there are some receipts recording genuine payments—I find the fictitious entries are all in 1905, and that no accounts for 1905 are produced—the bills put in by Newman's counsel stop in Novem<lb/>ber, 1903—the first falsification is on December 15th, as to twenty cases of dates—my attention was first called to this matter on April 12th, 1905, by my clerk Kelly, who was investigating some matter in con<lb/>nection with the accounts, but not connected with this case—I spoke to Jenn first of all about the item of Bonning being altered from 13s. 6d. to £62 13s. 6d.—in the other cases there is an entirely false entry, and this is the only case where the genuine and false entries are mixed—that is dated April 23rd—the entry now reads," Cheque. £62 13s. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the tick is genuine, but it really applies to the 13s. 6d.—Jenn's writing is peculiar—he makes his sixes in a peculiar way—I point out three of them—on April 12th I asked him how he could explain that item of £62 13s. 6d. in the ledger when he had in the Counterfoil Receipt Book 13s. 6d., all in his writing; I said, "How do you explain this?"—he looked at the items and said, "I cannot explain it. There it is; I suppose it is put in to balance"—he kept on repeating, "Oh! I cannot explain it," but he said they were his figures—I did not ask him that; I simply asked for an explanation—he said, "I think they are my figures"—he re<lb/>peated about twenty times, "I cannot explain it. I think they are my figures; there it is"—I then called Clarabutt in, and Jenn and Clara<lb/>butt were together, and I showed Clarabutt one or two of the fictitious items as to Marsh, in Clarabutt's writing, and I said to him, "Where did you get that item from to pass into the ledger?"—he said, "From, the Cash Book"—I gave him the Cash Book and said, "Will you find it for me in the Cash Book?"—he looked for it, but did not find it—he still persisted it was in the Cash Book—Jenn was there all that time—he said nothing—it was about 11 a.m.—that was the last I saw of Jenn—I went to call him that morning, and it was said he had gone out—so far as I know, he did not attend Israel &amp; Joel's office after that date—I was there daily about that time.</p>

               <p>very difficult, but it is not so easy as it seems to imitate another per<lb/>son's tick—I am not an expert in handwriting—I assisted Jenn in audit<lb/>ing the books of Israel &amp; Joel—young Israel once balanced the accounts—I was managing clerk to Israel &amp; Joel's previous accountant whom the firm gave up because they could not agree as to terms—I did not hear of any complaints made by customers about the accounts—the sale ticket never leaves the firm's possession—later in the day it is sent to the office, after the goods have been delivered—the goods could not go out without it—sometimes a portion of the goods are left over—the sale tickets were entered up by Gorman—goods are delivered as arranged at the time of the sale and taken there and then to the carts waiting for them—the firm sell the stuff that is in the shop—if certain goods are omitted which had been ordered they would be entered in blank in the Day Book—I never heard of the case of the goods being bought "To arrive"—the £62 entry is in the undisguised writing of Jenn, but the pen is thick.</p>

I am a clerk in Mr. Sid ford's employment in his business of an accountant—part of my duty was to go weekly to Israel &amp; Joel's office and tick the debits from the Day Book into the ledger with Clarabutt—I took the Day Book, and called out the entries from it—Clarabutt signified that the entries I called out were correct—I did not look at the ledger to see; I assumed that Clarabutt was doing his duty—on every occasion he took the ledger—the practice was for the senior clerk to take the ledger and the junior clerk the Day Book—I did that the whole time Clarabutt was there—when he was away I checked the books with someone else.</p>

               </hi>. I am a clerk and salesman employed by Israel &amp; Joel at Covent Garden market—I know Bonning—I have seen him write on some of these sale tickets—the salesman makes out the sale ticket—the purchaser or his carman signs them when he gets the goods—in nine cases out of ten the greengrocer takes his own goods—Bonning took his goods unless he had a very big load, when he would have them sent home—then a delivery ticket is made out and sent by our carman, who would sign the sale ticket—the carman invariably has a way bill which whoever took delivery would sign—the carman is responsible—when goods are at the railway depot there are weekly credits, and credit notes are sent through.—the salesman makes out a pass or the purchaser cannot get the goods from the railway—that pass is delivered to the railway foreman at the gate—the salesman in the office enters the pass in the Pass Book and hands it to the man to pass him out of the railway station—that document shows what goods the customer is entitled to receive—the pass is made out in the name of the buyer—this pass produced, is written by our foreman at the Midland in the name of Bonning—it was made out when I was absent at lunch—Fryer is the name of the clerk—</p>

            <p>this is a railway pass signed by Bonning (No. 3)—I made it out—I delivered it to Bonning or his carman—we would deliver the goods our<lb/>selves—No 4 pass is also in my writing—we delivered those goods to Bonning or his carman—No. 5 is made out by Fryer, and No. 6 by Mr. Israel, one of the governors—No. 7 is in Fryer's writing—No. 8 sale ticket is signed by Bonning—No. 9 sale ticket I cannot swear to, it is indistinct—No. 10 sale ticket, which is not signed, I think was made out by John Israel—No 12 ticket which is signed with the initials "R. G. B." I cannot swear to—No. 13 ticket, signed "G. Bonning," is not Bonning's writing—I should say it was signed by his carman—I nearly always see the tickets signed—No. 14 is signed by Bonning, not No. 15, which is "Received by Bonning," nor No. 16—Nos. 17 and 18, signed "J. Bonning," by the carman—No. 19 is a railway ticket in John Israel's writing, not signed—No. 20 is signed in a name that looks like Kirby, who is the carman, I presume; also No. 21, signed "G. Bonning"—the carmen nearly always sign their master's name—No. 22 is signed, "J. Kirby," possibly the carman—No. 23 is signed in Bonning's writing—No. 24 is a railway pass made out by me—the goods were delivered to Mr. Bonning or his carman—the carman's identity as representing the buyer lies with the delivery porter—generally the name is on the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 25, Abchurch Lane—on April 5th I received a letter from the prisoner, stating that I was required to draw a deed of partnership—I had no knowledge of the prisoner at that time—the prisoner and Mr. Lester called upon me on April 5th, and I was told by the prisoner that she required me to draw a deed of partnership between herself and Mr. Gordon Lester, she acquiring one third interest in his business, and she was to pay him £750—she informed me that she had not the money at that time, but that she had an interest under the will of her late uncle, William John Barker, and she asked me to search at Somerset House, and, if I was satisfied, to raise her £750 to enable her to acquire this interest—she stated that her father was the life tenant under the will, and the reversion was expectant on his death—I caused a search to be made and I found that there was a will of John Barker, and that his brother Richard Smith Barker was entitled to the life interest with remainder to his children, of which the prisoner was one—I did not make the search personally, but through one of my clerks between</p>

               <p>April 5th and 10th—I prepared a draft deed and the prisoner and Mr. Lester went through it with me—it was sent to Mr. Lester's solicitor for his approval, and subsequently returned to me—the prisoner came to me on April 10th and stated that she required me to advance her £10—I told her that it was a very extraordinary request, as I had very little knowledge of her and had been unable, during the few days I had had the matter in hand, to satisfy myself, because I had not the name of the trustees' solicitor, which she informed me she did not know—she said her father was too ill to be communicated with and added, "You have my affairs in hand, and you know my affairs are all right. I have been unable to work for some weeks and should be indebted to you if you would advance me the sum of £10"—on that I drew this cheque and handed it to her—she had previously handed me a retainer to act for her—on the 15th, although I had been seeing her every day, she coming into my office and telling me she could not obtain the information, she obtained a further £5 from me on the same allegations and story as before—about the 19th or 20th, from information I had received from another solicitor, I communicated with Mr. Freeman, who, I was told, acted for the trustees and ascertained from him that the prisoner had disposed of her reversion under this will some years since, and that she had no interest under the will—this information would not be found at Somerset House—I then applied for a summons, and, as the prisoner did not surrender, a warrant was obtained for her apprehension.—On April 19th I received a letter from the prisoner, asking for a further £10, and a similar letter on the 30th—I did not give her any more money.</p>

I am a solicitor practising at 23, Abingdon Street, Westminster—my firm acted for the trustees under the will of William John Barker, and have been so acting for many years—I sent this document dated February 20th, 1899, to Mr. Woolf, which purports to be an assignment by the prisoner of her interest under the will of William John Barker—on receiving a letter from the prosecutor, I telephoned to him, and he sent round a clerk—I told the clerk that the interest had been sold, and gave him a copy of the notice of assignment reciting these facts, which are true to my knowledge—the prisoner is the person referred to therein—the prisoner knew I was solicitor for the trustees having acted for the assignee in the matter of the assignment—I think there could be no possibility of the prisoner not knowing that this money was assigned.</p>

Stone and McKaig came in together—I knew Stone, but not McKaig—Stone spoke to me about this matter—McKaig was standing in the background—I cannot remember him saying at the time that if there was anything wrong with the cheque he would repay the money—I cashed the cheque on Wednesday and paid it in on Saturday—I saw him between then and that, but I had no idea the cheque was wrong—possibly he came in once or twice before the Saturday—it was not McKaig who said he would pay for the cheque if there was anything wrong.</p>

I admit I wrote them; I must have been a fool to do it. I did not sign the others. What Stone says is correct; he saw me sign one cheque"—Thomas said, "This is what I get for mixing up with your class"—on the next day he stated that McKaig showed him the cheques, and had said he had no banking account, and that Stone gave him (McKaig) the cheques—I saw Brent on April 24th and searched him; he had nothing in his pockets—I asked him to write his name and address in my pocket book—the name corresponds to the signatures—I arrested him—he said, "Mr. West, you have made a great mistake. I do not know anything about it"—on being charged at Vine Street he said, "I admit I wrote the cheque I gave to Martin, and also the one I gave to Gardner. He knew I had no banking account, because I told him so."</p>

I was in Mr. Andrews' house every day. I did not ask Mr. Andrews to keep the cheque back."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspector City).</hi> On May 18th, I received a warrant for the prisoner's arrest—at 5 p.m. the same day I saw her at her residence, and told her what I had come for—she said, "I have been expecting you. I have purposely done this so that my case shall have proper notice. I am being very badly treated; it is impossible to get a certificate unless you bribe the professor"—she was taken to the station and charged—she took with her a quantity of documents, including this copy book (<hi rend="italic">Produced)</hi>, which contains a copy of a letter to the Lord Mayor dated May 6th. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "To the Lord Mayor of London. My Lord,—May I be allowed to bring my case before your Lordship' notice. I have been a student at the Guildhall School of Music more than eight years, all consecutive terms, taking for my studies elocution, solo singing, sight singing, and piano. I have sung in the Guildhall School Opera Chorus twelve months, and three years in the Guildhall School Choir at the Guildhall. For some unknown reason to me at the time Dr. Cummings had me expelled. He knows my mother is a widow, and I was studying that I might earn my living by my studies. Since I was expelled I applied to a professor of the Guildhall to teach me privately. He has refused until Dr. Cummings will say what I was expelled for. I have heard since that Dr. Cummings has said I am an immoral woman. By the sacred Cross of our Saviour I will say I am the same moral and virtuous woman Nature bore me. Therefore I make this appeal to your Lordship, as Chief Magistrate of the City of London, to protect the honour of a woman of the country of which your Lordship has the honour to be Chief Magistrate of, and one of England's women. I can prove, if your Lordship will allow me, that I have been insulted, betrayed; my injured honour cries aloud to your Lordship for protection to help me to hold up the honour of my virtue and my womanhood. I have a letter in my possession from Dr. Cummings written in his own writing, dated January 15th, 1904, where he writes to me, "I shall be happy to see you. Signed, William Cummings.' What has made him change, and why is he not to speak all he has against me in this short time? I have consulted two solicitors upon my case, and they cannot help me, unless I pay £50 down. Will your Lordship make him speak, and prove the immorality he accuses me of? He is a rogue, villain, and a liar. He is a rogue to hold a secret of immorality against an honest woman's honour when he is principal where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290060"/>
               <p>75 per cent are women. A villain to be an accomplice to such a rash, mad act to accuse a virtuous woman, and a liar to tell lies to hide his shame. With all due honour to your Lordship's post, heed my pleadings lest in my hour of distress of mind I may be tempted to take that which is not mine to give—my life. I have sought the advice of many who tell me it is a case that must be fought out, because there is malice, deceit, and treachery. My only hope now is your Lordship's help; make him speak all he knows against me. Awaiting your Lordship's reply, I have the honour to be, Your Lordship's most humble and obedient servant, Melita Macready."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Stevens Walker, of "Wrentham," Church Road, Leyton—it is a detached house standing in a garden—the kitchen is on the ground level towards the back of the house, and at the back and joined on to the house there is an outside lavatory—a few yards from the house there is an outbuilding used for washing; there is a copper in it with a fireplace underneath—there is a side door which leads from the kitchen to the garden—the prisoner entered my service as cook on March 16th—she came to me with a five months' reference—I have a parlour maid named Edith Bray—I did not notice anything about the prisoner's appearance until April 23rd—I had no suspicion that she was pregnant—she continued performing her duties till Easter Day—she was a satisfactory servant—on the morning of Easter Day I went to church at 7 a.m., and returned to breakfast—between breakfast and the time that I went to church again, the prisoner asked me if dinner would be the same time as usual, and I said, "Yes, please"—the usual time was 1.30—I went to church again, leaving in the house Edith</p>

               <p>Bray and the prisoner—my children went to church with me—I got back from church at 12.35—I sat down for a moment or two in the dining room, waiting for my husband—I saw the prisoner go upstairs to her room, but she did not speak to me—my husband returned in a few minutes, and we went out for a walk and returned at 1.10—I went upstairs to take my hat off, and Edith Bray came and spoke to me—I went down to the kitchen and saw the prisoner dishing up the dinner—she looked very pale and Appeared to have bean crying—she said, "If the dinner is not as it should be, will you excuse it?"—I said, "Yes, certainly, what is the matter; are you unwell?" meaning her courses—she had to cook some lamb, spinach and potatoes for dinner; the sweets were prepared the day before—I told the prisoner I would attend to the dinner—she sat down in the kitchen, passed her hand over her face and said, "Oh! dear," as if she felt faint—I and Edith Bray then attended to the dinner and took it into the dining room—in about twenty minutes I went out to the kitchen, and, not seeing the prisoner, I opened the side door, which opens on to the garden, and saw the prisoner coming towards me from the direction of the laundry—her face was very white and I asked her if she felt any better—she said yes, and that her nose had been bleeding—I saw no blood on her face or clothes; she had her usual maid's cap on—I asked her to sit down for a few moments and then go to her room and lie down—she sat down for about three minutes, and I assisted her up to her room and she remained on her bed until the doctor arrived—my husband fetched Dr. Dawson—I showed him up to her room and said to the prisoner, "Clara, the doctor has come to see you"—she was lying on the bed—I went out of the room at the doctor's request—after a little while the doctor called me in and the prisoner asked me to forgive her—I think she said, "Oh! forgive me for bringing all this trouble upon you"—I had not then heard from the doctor what was the matter—I thought it might have been a miscarriage—I remained with her until she was taken to the infirmary—I was shown a pair of scissors at the Police Court; they were not mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner at 4, Grange Park Road. Leyton—about 2.30 on April 23rd I was called to "Wrentham"—I went to the prisoner's bed room on the first floor and saw her lying on the bed with her clothes on—I said, "What is the matter; what is your trouble?"—at first she said, "There is nothing the matter"—I had not seen the body, but I had heard that it had been found—I said to the prisoner, "Oh! come, tell me what is the matter with you?"—she said, "I have had a child and I have killed it"—I said, "Oh! don't say that"—she said, "But I have"—I then examined her with her permission, and found that the end of the cord was visible—it had been cut and tied—I said, "Who cut this cord; who tied it?"—she said, "I did"—I said, "You have had a child before then?"—at first she denied it and then admitted it, and said, "It is with my mother"—she had been delivered within an hour of my seeing her—she asked me if I had seen its body—I said, "No, not yet; I must get you well first. I must see to you first"—referring to her mother she said, "It will kill her if she knows I have had this child"—I do not remember making any actual remark then, but I soothed her all the time, I said "I must get you well, don't worry"—she said, "Oh! don't bother about me; I do not want to get well. I would rather die. It is no good getting me well"—I did not look for anything in the room, the prisoner told me where to find the scissors—I looked for them—they were lying on a cardboard box where she told me they were—they were partly covered by her bodice—they looked as if they had been recently washed, but there were a few spots of blood or them—as soon as I had put her comfortable I went down to see the child's body; that was after having found the scissors—when I found them the prisoner said, "I stuck them into the child's neck"—I then went and examined the lavatory and the child's body—it was the dead body of a male child, still warm—I noticed that the face was covered with blood and that there was blood in the mouth—a portion of the cord was attached to the child—it had been cut, but was not tied, and there had been no apparent haemor<lb/>rhage from it—there was a wound in the child's throat on the left-hand side of the middle line—it could have been caused by the scissors or by a knife—I noticed the child's head—there was no bruising at all, but the bone on the right-hand side was badly broken—in my opinion it was not quite a full-time child, it was practically, and was well developed—I went back to the prisoner's room and stayed with her on and off for five hours—she said she gave birth to a child in the water closet; that it was</p>

               <p>born into the pan; that she had lifted it from the pan, cut the cord and tied it and then stuck the scissors into its neck—she said she had washed up the water closet, wrapped the child in a coarse apron, carried it to the laundry and put it into the copper—after five hours she was removed to the infirmary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think the bone in the head would be very easily fractured—I stayed with the prisoner for five hours, as I was dis<lb/>tinctly afraid of suicidal tendencies, because she threatened to commit suicide—she was in great anguish—her mental distress was very pitiful and painful to see, and she kept repeating, "I do not know how I could have done it, or what made me do it," and she was filled with horror and grief—I think it is quite likely that a woman in this class of life, going about her duties and having this unexpected delivery, might have her mental equilibrium upset and that for a brief period she might not have realised what she was doing—when I examined her she was wearing a woman's ordinary clothes—her mental condition for half an hour after I saw her was extremely pitiful to see—it was then that I thought it prudent to move the scissors and a piece of broken glass, because she had no wish to live and would undoubtedly have used one or the other—for a short time she was demented and quite off her head.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical man, practising at Leytonstone, where I am also police surgeon—on April 23rd I saw these scissors (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) at the police station—they have bloodstains upon them on both blades and on the handle and fork—the same day I went to "Wrentham" and saw the body of the child, which, in my opinion, was fully developed—I examined its neck and found a wound nearly an inch long and three<lb/>quarters of an inch deep, with a jagged end—it had severed the jugular vein and other important blood vessels—the injury would be caused by nipping with the scissors, opening and closing them; stabbing with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290066"/>
               <p>the points apart and then closing them—that was the immediate cause of death—any injury to the jugular vein would cause death very rapidly—it would be a question of minutes—I went into the closet and found marked evidence of blood having spurted from living arteries on to the wall and on to a book which was on the floor—it was all over the walls, quite two feet high—I am sure it was blood which had spurted from a living artery; that is a characteristic condition—there were marks as if an attempt had been made to remove the blood marks by washing and wiping—next day I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the body and found bruises and contusions in front of the head, on the eyebrow and on the right side and back of the head—they could not have been caused at one time—there was an extensive fracture on the right side only—it was a multiple fracture, a piece of bone being completely broken out of the side of the head and was lying loose—there was one slight bruise on the forehead—on the side of the head and back there was no external mark—there were very marked bruises on the tissues—such injuries to the skull and head could not have been caused by a fall in the act of delivery, or all caused at the same time—a child falling from the height at which it would fall in the act of delivery might have caused the bruises, but not the fracture—very considerable force would be required to fracture the skull of even so young a child as this—it must have been done by some purposeful blow with some flat surface; it could not have been done by the child itself or by falling—the injury might have been brought about if the head had been directed against some hard flat substance with an equivalent amount of force—the child had had a separate existence, and I found by applying the usual tests to the lungs, that it had breathed I should say, for an appreciable number of seconds—it had an independent circulation of its own—the pumping action of the blood through the artery would cause the spurting appearance on the wall if the artery was cut.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined).</hi> I received this telegram about 12 a.m.—Ellis is an old friend of mine and he was ill at the time—I left my house about 12.15 p.m., and when I got there I found that no tele<lb/>gram had been sent, and I could not make out where it had come from—I remained with Ellis sometime and got home between 6 and 7 p.m.—when I left home my clothes box was looked up—I had the key with me—when I came back I took my coat off to put it away in the clothes box, and I had the key but I could not turn the lock, and I saw that the lid when I lifted it up was broken open—the cupboard door was partly open, and I went back from the cupboard to the box and looked for the key, and found that it had gone—the safe was locked and the key taken away—I got two small chisels and broke the lock of the safe open, and found it turned all upside down inside—the first thing I found was that £3 in gold was taken and £3 left; and that the two deeds had gone—I also missed a watch from my clothes box—I had not authorised anybody to take them—I was not anxious at that time to raise any money on the deeds; I had no occasion to—next morning I went round to the police station and a detective came home with me—I heard from the lodger that somebody had been to the house while I was out—I went to see the Magistrate with the detective to get a warrant the next day, but we could not get one—I know nothing of the prisoner—I never asked him to sign any promissory note in my name—as far as I know Thompson has not got any other grandfather but me; at any rate, not any one in the name of John Clark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My grandson has not been arrested in connection with this—I do not know where he is—I said to Mrs. Smith, my lodger downstairs, "I have been robbed; my box has been broken into.

               <p>what to do. He promised me £5, but I only received 3s."—he said his employer was a man named Ewington, a certified bailiff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think I saw Ewington before the interview of April 26th, but I will not be sure—I think it was after I saw him in Rom<lb/>ford Road—I saw him before the arrest, immediately after the Easter holidays—Wednesday, April 26th, was the first day on which I saw the prisoner—the prisoner has worked for Ewington occasionally for about two years—it was not on seeing Ewington that I first formed the suspicion that the prisoner had been to London with Thompson—Ewington told me that he had nothing to complain of about the prisoner during the time he had been with him—I have made enquiries about him and find that he has a clean record, with nothing against him, so far as I know—he has been for many years in the merchant service; but I have not seen his discharges—I found that on leaving the merchant service he was em<lb/>ployed by a firm for many years, and left there with a good character—he then went to Ewington—on April 20th the prosecutor did not tell me that he suspected anyone at all—he said nothing about his grandson when he came to the police station—we left the station together, and it was then that he told me that he suspected his grandson—I had to make enquiries to get sufficient evidence before I could apply for a warrant against Thompson—I could not have applied sooner—I did not know, on the prosecutor telling me the story on the morning of April 20th, as much as I do now—he told me about the telegram and showed me the safe and I saw the box had been broken open—he told me where he kept the keys, and that he had heard his grandson had been to his house in his absence—I applied for a warrant the next morning, but on account of the holidays I could not get one till Tuesday morning—I made enquiries at once for Thompson at his residence and other places, but it was late in the afternoon before they were quite complete—I was told that he was seen in Poplar on the Saturday evening, but I could not prove it—he has disappeared—I do not think that he has done so with the conni<lb/>vance of the prosecutor—I am quite sure that on April 26th the prisoner said, "I went to your office with Thompson. I said I was John Clark, and signed the name of John Clark to papers"—in the additional evi<lb/>dence served I stated that the prisoner said, "I went with Thompson to your office and said I was John Clark, Mr. Jack's grandfather, and signed papers. I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> as I was instructed. Thompson told me what to say and do"—I did not make notes at the time, as the conversation lasted some time, but from recollection—I did not give evidence of that at the Police Court, because I considered the case closed then—it is an important admisson of guilt—I did not think it necessary to mention that statement, because the prisoner had never denied his guilt—I was at the Police Court to satisfy the Magistrate that there was a sufficient case upon which to send the prisoner to trial—the Magistrate considered he had sufficient evidence—I began the statement before the Magistrate, "On May 9th, in consequence of information received," because I was starting from the date of arrest—I was cross-examined at the Police Court on the second occasion—Whiteman said he failed to identify the prisoner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290072"/>
               <p>and I saw further evidence was necessary, and it was forthcoming—with reference to the statement made by the prisoner on the wary to the station on May 10th, I put in, "I said I was John Clark, and signed some papers. Thompson told me what to do," because I must have confused that statement with what occurred at the prisoner's house; I cannot say that he did say that—when before the Magistrate the words were fresh in my mind, and I did not incorporate those words in the statement on May 10th—I say that on April 26th Whiteman positively identified the prisoner as the man who had been to his office—I did not arrest him at the time—I knew where I could find him—I had my own reason for taking the course I did—between April 26th and May 9th on one occasion I asked the prisoner to have a drink—I went to his house and found he was out—I followed him to another house, where his brother-in-law lived—I then asked him to wait in a public-house nicknamed "The Gin Palace," and I paid for drinks—I did not say I did not want to do him any harm if he would help to find Thompson, nor that he would be rewarded if he would assist; nothing of the kind—I may have given him my card with my name and Plaistow police station on it—I told him if he should hear of Thompson to inform me—at the station on May 9th he was searched and a pocket book taken from him which I subse<lb/>quently returned—I do not know if it had the piece of paper in it with my name and address on—I never saw it—the book was under look and key—I do not know who took that piece of paper out—I went into the public-house to use the telephone and I told him to wait—I have not found anything to the contrary that until the morning of April 19th the pro<lb/>secutor and the prisoner were absolute strangers.</p>

I live in Russell Road, Leyton, and am a greengrocer—I had a bay mare, and on Friday, April 7th, at 8 p.m. I saw her in my stable—I locked the door from the outside—I missed my mare, a bridle, collar, and traces—I have not seen the bridle again—the collar a man found on the road—I next saw my mare on April 13th, at Eastleigh, in the possession of the police—she was quite altered—she was clipped all over where she was half clipped before—she had her mane pulled, that means thinned, and her tail cut—nobody who did not know much of her would recognised her—I had had her for six months and she had certain marks on her which I recognised—she is worth £30 or £35.</p>

S. Ball"—the consignor's name is Blake, of Kensal Road, and the consignee is Pownes, Eastleigh—in the ordinary course the horse would have left Paddington at 8.35 a.m.—I did not put it into the box myself, but I know it left at 8.35—it would arrive at Eastleigh between 12 and I—the train would arrive at 11.45, but horse boxes may be trans<lb/>ferred</p>

I belong to the Hants Constabulary—about 5 p.m. on Tuesday, April 11th, I was with another constable at Aylesford, in Hamp<lb/>shire, when I stopped the prisoners, who were driving in a gig—I said to them, "You answer the description of two men wanted in London for horse stealing and I shall charge you on suspicion for stealing a horse at Walthamstow; I shall take you to the police station"—Brown replied, "All right, only on suspicion"—Bell made no reply—Aylesford is fifteen miles from Eastleigh.</p>

I said, 'It seems funny, but the cheque is made pay<lb/>able to the same name as yourself. I was in the dining room at the time; he told me to see him later on in the smoking room there. I said, 'To-morrow morning I daresay I can get the cheque cashed for you.' After getting the cheque cashed at Mr. Johnson's, at Deptford, I think it was £3 15s., I gave it to Morgan's friend and he gave me 10s. the next day; he said to me, 'I have another cheque for £7 odd.' He said, 'If you can cash that, you can have a sovereign,' I said, 'I will have nothing at all to do with it.' We had been drinking together and I struck him, and I went away after being told the cheque he had given me before was a worthless one. I forgot to mention that when I was going with him to Johnson's, a man told me to say I had been doing a job for some draper in Lewisham High Road, whose name I forget, and that it was given to me in payment for work done. I do not know the man's name, but he has got a wife, an actress. He told me not to tell Morgan how much we got for the cheque, as he would be satisfied with a few shillings.

                  </hi>. I am chief engineer to the Gas Light and Coke Co. at their Beckton Works—Collins was employed there in the oil gas and tar department, at a weekly wage of 35s.—Lowe and Hoare worked under him and were paid by time, Lowe at the rate of 6d. an hour, and Hoare at 6 3/4 d. an hour—Collins had been in the company's service to my knowledge three years; Lowe under twelve months—I cannot tell you as to Hoare—in that department it was sometimes necessary for the men to work overtime and sometimes on Sundays—for working on Sundays they would get double time allowed, and for overtime on week days it was an hour and a quarter for certain hours and more as it got on towards night time; it varied—in March and April the prisoners were doing day work and overtime if it was required—Collins would not be paid extra for overtime—it was his duty to keep the times of Lowe and Hoare in this book called "Collins' time book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there were only three other men, besides himself and the other two prisoners, whose times he had to keep—for this purpose our week ended at 5 p.m. on Thursday, and anything after that would be overtime—on Fridays I find some of the figures have a little dash under them, which means that the men worked overtime on the Thursday after the book was made up—the wages sheets were made out from Collins' time book, and all the particulars of over-time made by Collins were copied into the wages sheets by a time keeper; then the amount due to each man would be made up by a clerk from the wages sheet—a book was kept for the valve men, whose duty it is to manipulate the valves for supplying the gas to town—one of them would be on duty all the twenty-four hours—the head valvemen were required to keep a book in which they put the times of Lowe and Hoare coming in and going out—otherwise they had nothing to do with those prisoners—they simply had to book them in and out—this is the valve<lb/>men's time book for the period in question (<hi rend="italic">Produced)</hi>, in which the times are booked—assuming both to be accurate, the times in the valvemen's book and Collins' time book must agree—on April 19th my assistant, Mr. Moys, spoke to me, and in consequence of what he said I examined the entries in Collins' time book with the entries in the valvemen's book for the week between April 7th and 14th, for which the prisoners would be paid on Friday, the 14th—I sent for the prisoners and saw them in my office in the presence of Mr. Moys—I said to Collins. "A serious charge has been made against you; that is, that you have booked Lowe and Hoare's time that they have not worked"—he said, "It was dirty money"—that means a special allowance made for dirty work—I said, "There was no dirty work"—had there been any, he would have had to ask for permission to book it—he acknowledged that he had not asked—I then said, "What do you say to these two men being booked in on Sunday sixteen hours when you know they were not at work?"—he said, "I know they were not, and I must suffer for it," or words akin to that—it is as near as I can remember—I asked Lowe and Hoare if they had heard what Collins had said, and said, "Do you agree that you accepted this money, well knowing that you had not worked for it?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290082"/>
               <p>and each of them said, "Yes"—I told them that I must report the matter to the general manager, and I suspended them—they then left—Mr. Moys was the person who would authorise "dirty money" to be paid—on April 20th Hoare came into my office and asked if he might have the money that was due to him, and I told him that it must wait until the end of the investigation—he said, "Can you overlook my share in this offence, as I was drawn into it, and it was only on one occasion?"—he meant by that Sunday, April 9th—I said, "I cannot accept that, because there is another occasion—there are two Sundays where the same thing happened, and it was your duty, if you received more money than you earned, to acquaint me of the matter, and not keep it As you have not done so, I consider you all three to blame, and I can make no distinction between you"—he said he had asked Collins to take the money back, and he promised he would never book any more time that was not due to him, and he said that he had told Collins that they would be sure to be found out owing to the check book that was kept by the valvemen, and that that was why he asked Collins to take it back, but that Collins said he would not—I told him if he wished to make any further appeal he could put it down in black and white and I would send it to the proper quarter, meaning the general manager—the matter was referred to the general manager and it was then out of my hands—on taking Collins time book and the valvemen's book for the week ending March 10th I find under Saturday, March 4th, in Collins' time book, opposite Hoare's name, the figure 2, showing that he was credited with two hours over<lb/>time, and opposite Lowe's name also the figure 2, showing that he was credited also with two hours overtime—on Monday, March 6th, Collins has credited Lowe and Hoare with one hour overtime each—on Wednes<lb/>day, March 8th, he has credited each of them four hours overtime—on Sunday, March 5th, he has credited Lowe with sixteen hours, but there is nothing to Hoare on that day—the total extra hours credited to Hoare during that week are seven, which would be equal to 3s. 11d. extra—Lowe is credited with twenty-three hours extra, equal to 11s. 6d.—in the valvemen's time book neither of them is shown as having worked over<lb/>time that week at all—in Collins' time book for the week ending March 17th, on Friday March 10th, Hoare and Lowe are credited with four hours overtime each—on Sunday, March 11th, they are both credited with two hours—that is all in that week—the extra money paid that week to Hoare would be 3s. 4d., and Lowe 3s.—the valvemen's time book for that week shows no overtime credited to either of them—in Collins' time book for the next week, ending March 24th, Hoare and Lowe are both credited with sixteen hours on Sunday, March 19th, and so far as the valvemen's time book is concerned, there is no entry of them having done any work on that day—that would be 9s. for Hoare and 8s. for Lowe—then there is a week missing—for the week ending April 6th, Hoare is credited on Friday, March 31st, with eight hours, and Lowe with six hours, which would be the overtime carried forward from, the previous Thursday—on April 1st they are both credited with two hours overtime, and on Monday, April 3rd, they ate both, credited with one hour, and the</p>

               <p>same thing again on April 5th—in that week the total extra hours credited to Hoare is twelve, equal to 6s. 9d. extra in wages, and to Lowe ten hours, equal to 5s.—in the valvemen's time book for that week there is no entry of either of them having worked overtime—for the week ending April 14th in Collins' time book they are both credited on Sunday, April 9th, with working sixteen hours, on which occasion they both admitted they had not worked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Collins.</hi> I do not wish to discredit the state<lb/>ment that you were in the company's service some years before I came—Mr. Moys has been in the position of assistant engineer twelve months—Mr. Cossey was the assistant engineer before him—you did not within my recollection, on my saying that there was a serious charge against you, go through your time book, and show that the entries were vouched for by Mr. Cossey—you did try to explain that Mr. Cossey had vouched it, but it was for some prior accounts, not the ones in this charge—Mr. Cossey had left his position some ten months before these entries were made, and had nothing at all to do with the entries in question—you kept the times of a very small gang and they were working at hours when the regular time keepers would not be at the works, and would not be able to book, therefore a book was given to you in which to book their time—you have never pointed out to me or tried to make out that on previous occasions Mr. Cossey has corrected entries, so as to make the men receive more—for some time past the dirty work has been removed from your department altogether, and now there is no dirty work which would come under your supervision—I am not in a position to say whether you would see the valvemen's time book or not; it is not material to the question—it would not be Berry's duty to bring your time book up to me to sanction the overtime; it would go to my assistants—you would have to give your book to Berry to transfer the overtime for wages—he is the timekeeper who makes but the sheets; he is not in a position to allow overtime—I put you on a fixed weekly wage instead of by the hour; that covered the overtime—I did not give instructions with refer<lb/>ence to keeping the times—I showed you the entries and you then vol<lb/>unteered to make a clean breast of it—you did not show me entries that I had not seen before; I did not require you to do so—I had only then found false entries in the weeks ending April 7th and 14th—I cannot tell you under what heading you were paid—the heading would not make any difference as to your wages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Hoare.</hi> Collins was your timekeeper—if Berry wrongly copied the entries in Collins' time book on to the wages sheets, it would lead to the men getting wrong wages—if there were any question with reference to the amount, I should say your duty would be to go to Collins—Berry would not personally check your work; he would not know whether you were there or what you were doing—I know the entries in Collins' time books are his, because they are in his handwriting—he has never handed it over to somebody else, and gone away for a week.</p>

               <p>examined the wages sheets for the last week, and found some discrep<lb/>ancies, which made me go and see Collins—I asked him who booked up Hoare and Lowe, and he replied, "I do"—I went to Hoare and Lowe and said to Hoare, "What wages did you receive last week?" in Collins' and Lowe's hearing—Hoare replied, "I do not know"—I said, "That is ridiculous; you must know. Well, I will tell you, 36s. Can you tell me how it was made up?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You know you did not work any overtime"—he said, "Yes, that is so"—I then left, Collins following me—he said, "You had better give us all the <hi rend="italic">sock"</hi>—I told him that I should have to report the matter to Mr. Iago, and I did so a few minutes afterwards—I saw the prisoners together again and said to Hoare, "Did you tell Collins to book this overtime for you?"—he said, "No"—I put the same question to Lowe, who said, "Yes"—Collins heard what was said, and he seemed annoyed at one saying "Yes" and the other "No;" and he said, "Well, I will make a clean breast of it; we are all in the swim"—the next day, April 20th, after Hoare had seen Mr. Iago, he saw me and said that he would not make any further statement—I know Collins' writing—this is his time book, and is in his writing—I have not the least doubt about that—no overtime would be worked on weekdays or Sundays without my knowledge—on the Sundays between March 3rd and April 19th, when the prisoners were suspended, there was no overtime worked by either Lowe, Hoare, or Collins—I usually go to the works about 10 a.m. on Sundays, and I was there on all those Sundays until about 1 p.m.—the prisoners were not at work on those days, or I should have seen them—if they had desired to work on Sundays, they could not have done so without my permission, and I had no such application from them—there was no necessity for them to work then—between March 3rd and April 19th, as regards weekdays, only on March 23rd to 25th did I give authority to work overtime, which was for unloading an oil ship—Hoare worked overtime on those occa<lb/>sions, but he was paid, and it appears in the valvemen's books—apart from that I did not sanction any other overtime—if a man is put on a job that spoils his clothes, such as emptying tanks, we make him an extra allowance called "dirty money" to cover the expense; we allow for so many hours—I am quite sure that between March 3rd and April 19th no such work was done by the prisoners, nor by anybody in our employ—previous to that there had been some, but it was done in a different de<lb/>partment to the prisoners'—if such work were done the "dirty money" would not have been credited to the prisoners without my knowing it, and my sanction would have to be asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Collins.</hi> I did not know that you booked Hoare and Lowe's times—I did not have to get out the expenses of the oil gas tar department, nor did I enter it up in my sheet—the last time that Mr. Iago gave instructions for oil gas tar to be prepared day and night was about last November and December—I cannot say whether he told Mr. Davies of the tar burning people, that they were working day and night—Mr. Davies is not in our employ, but somebody whom we dealt with—I cannot say whether I told him that Lowe and Hoare were working</p>

               <p>day and night on it—Mr. Iago left it to my discretion when they should work—about Christmas you did say something to me about telling Berry to do all the booking on and off, so that he could make up the times himself; there was a complaint that you were not booking your own time properly—that was after you were put on fixed wages—Mr. Iago gave instructions that the men had to book on in the valve room, and I insisted that that should be done, and then you desired that Berry should do it—I said you must book on in the valve room and you threatened to leave, and I said, "Well, you will have to leave if you do not book on"—this was three months before March—if you wanted any extra money for extra work, you came and asked me for that yourself—when Hoare came to see me there was no object in asking him to make a written statement, so that I could prosecute you and Lowe—Mr. Burroughs was not working with me in charge of the tar during the time in question, and I am sure there was no bad feeling between you, myself and Mr. Burroughs—Lowe and Hoare did work sometimes on a Sunday in September and October—when I was in Mr. Iago's office I did not say that I knew it was a conspiracy between you three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Lowe.</hi> I think it was 24s. a week you were told you were to have when you came on first; I told Collins that, as far as I can remember; that would be 6d. per hour, 4s. a day—I am sure I did not tell you that there would be an extra allowance for "dirty money"; I never used such an expression—I am quite sure you did not do the same work as Hoare—I do not think you were booked on and off when you worked on Sundays in September and October—in those days there was some arrangement between you three by which you neglected to book on at all for about two months, I think, and when my attention was called to it I told you you must book on; that is the time you are re<lb/>ferring to—you would come to work without Collins booking you, and I said it must be done—I cannot say whether Collins held the Collins' time book the whole week—it is the rule that there must always be a valve man in the valve room or one of his assistants all the twenty-four hours—the telegraph and telephone instruments are there, and they are continuously receiving messages—it would be very foolish if a man were to start work without booking on; he would go to the valve room to report himself, so as to get his extra time booked—I never heard any com<lb/>plaint from you or Hoare that they could not find any man to book in.</p>

C." is that there was Sunday overtime—there are twenty-four hours marked on the Sunday before January 8th which would mean twelve hours—they are my signatures—for the next week Hoare came in at 5.45 a.m. on the Saturday and left at 6 a.m. on the Sunday, and the difference of five and a half hours there would be time and a half for work<lb/>ing all that time, and I initialled that to show it was correct—there is twenty-eight hours allowed as overtime—in January there is six hours written in red ink by myself—you generally came to me to know what time to book—I never heard you refuse to put any times in—the entries on April 22nd are in your handwriting—on the Sunday that Hoare was credited twenty-eight hours he had an hour for meal time, with which he is not credited—it is made up as follows: eighteen and three quarters hours was the ordinary overtime and he was allowed time and a half for that, which makes twenty-eight hours—I do not re<lb/>member when you were put on weekly wage—it was done in my time, but I had nothing to do with it at all—I heard a lot of complaints from you about overtime—I do not know whether you lost through being on fixed wages.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Collins, in his defence, said that it was customary to allow the men for more Work than they had done; that when Mr. Cossey was assistant engineer and when Hoare used sometimes to complain of his time he (Collins) would tell him that if Mr. Cossey sanctioned the extra hours and signed it in his book he would do the tame; that Mr. Cossey did sanction such extra hours, part of which would be extra allowance for dirty work; that when Mr. Mays came no instructions were given to him to alter the arrangements; that although Lowe and Hoare had not worked the overtime credited to them, it was only keeping up the old system which Mr. Iago as a new man did not know of; that not a man entered in the valvemen's time book had worked the whole time that was credited to him there; that he had no intention to defraud and had gained nothing by it; that according to the valveman, the valvemen's time book was never examined with his book; that he had been in the company's service for fifteen years and had had no allegation of this kind made against him before.</hi>

I am enjoying myself, and you can do the same, can't you?"—the singing went on for a little while and then the party broke up—the deceased went to the door with the prisoner—they seemed to be on good terms then, and on other occasions when I saw them, between then and the date of the death—I was at my house on April 27th—I saw the prisoner and the deceased standing at their street door about 10.20—I gave her the door key and I said I was going to bed—I left them together there—they seemed on friendly terms—about 11.90 I was <hi rend="italic">waked</hi> up and went to No. 83—I went into the kitchen and saw the deceased, a police<lb/>man, and the prisoner—I said to the deceased, "What is the matter?"—she said, "Alf has out my throat"—I said to the prisoner, "What have you done?"—he said, "I have done it, Mrs. Bridgen. I intended to do her in and myself too"—she was twenty-four years old—the pri<lb/>soner appeared to be in a trembling kind of condition, but not drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the medical superintendent at the Camberwell Infirmary, and a registered medical practitioner—about 12.40 on the early morning of April 28th the deceased was admitted to the infirmary—I saw a wound in her throat which was rather more than half an inch wide, just above the thyroid bone, a little to the left of the middle line—it was bleeding very slightly, but it was evident to me that she had lost blood—she could speak, and made a statement—I gave her the best assistance I could, and for a couple of days she seemed to be going on well and save no anxiety—the wound was quite healed by the third day, April 30th, but on that day I observed signs of inflamma<lb/>tion, and from that time fever developed—she remained seriously ill until May 7th—it was obvious to me that she was suffering from some deep<lb/>seated inflammation of the brain and spinal cord—on the afternoon of May 7th I came to the conclusion that the case was hopeless, and I com<lb/>municated with the police—she died at 9.25 that night—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination within three hours—the cause of death was a wound passing slightly from left to right backwards and downwards through the base of the tongue to the back of the pharynx and esophagus—it opened the membranes in front of the spinal cord—the deep part of the wound was unhealthy—the inflammation had extended over the surface of the brain, resulting in inflammation of the membranes of the brain or meningitis—a comor supervened, during which the girl died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found the deceased was a virgin—there was some chronic kidney disease, which would render the tissues more liable to in<lb/>flammation and cause such a wound as she received to be more likely to take an unfavourable turn.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Probably in ten or fifteen years the kidney disease would have destroyed life—it was chronic, but the wound was the cause of death.</p>

I am the wife of John Grinter, and live at 7, Parker's Row, on the first floor—the prisoner and his wife lived on the ground floor—on Saturday, April 23rd, we went to bed about 10.35 p.m.—we had been in bed a little while when we heard a cry of "Murder," but we did not take any notice of it, as we thought it proceeded from the back—it must have been about 11 p.m.—we went to sleep again—the next thing was the deceased coming and knocking at our door—I asked my husband to get up—he did so, and opened the door, and the deceased rushed in in her nightdress, and her hair was hanging down her back—she said, "Mrs. Grinter, look what my husband has done"—I did not see the prisoner then—the deceased's face was red at the side and inflamed, and there was a stain towards the back of her nightdress—she made a complaint to me—I got up and said I would get her some water to bathe her face with, and when I got to the other room the prisoner came to the door with a basin of water—he said, "Lil, let me bathe your face"—she replied, "I will have nothing to do with you, you beast and murderer"—I bathed her face; she showed me her tongue, which was very much swollen—she had to go downstairs for her clothes, and she asked me to go down with her—I stayed on the stairs for some time—I did not at first care about going into their bedroom—she did not go in; she got someone from the street to go in with her—I believe it was Mrs. Fenton and Mrs. Bennett—they went in with her, and I walked in after—her clothes were brought from the bedroom into the kitchen; there is only a wooden partition between—the deceased dressed in the kitchen; the bedroom door was open while she was dressing—she kept closing it and the prisoner kept asking to have it open, and he kept calling her to come back and not to show him up—she was calling him a murderer and different thing—</p>

               <p>she said, "He is all right when there is anybody about"—he kept saying, "Do not show me up, for the sake of my brother and your children at school"—she said, "You did not think of that before—while she was dressing she said, "It is not the first time he has tried it on; I have had my suspicions for some time"—she said he had tried it before with lead in the bed, and she had slept under the stairs, and no one in the house knew anything of it—I asked her if he was drunk—she said, "Not when he came in"—he did not appear to me to have been drinking—I said to her, "Have not you been living happily?"—she said, "No, we have never been happy, not since we were married"—she finished dressing and I asked her where she was going—she said to her brother's—she left about 12 o'clock—she put a cloth round her mouth as she said it <hi rend="italic">hurted</hi> her—Mrs. Fenton and Mrs. Bennett left the house with her—I never saw her again—on the Monday morning I found this letter in the little place at the bottom of the stairs where we usually put our letters (<hi rend="italic">Read):</hi> "Mr. and Mrs. Grinter,—I must beg of you to forgive me the annoyance I have caused you It was a mad trick to do, and has a serious ending up to now. My wife is in hospital. She forgave me. It will be a turning-point to both our lives for the better, I hope. I have had a lot to put up with, and I daresay she thinks she has had a lot to put up with, but I hope all that is past now. Please don't mention the affair to the neighbours, as it would do me a great deal of harm, and her, £00, as I am determined to make her life as happy as I can. I write this, as I think it is better than intruding, up to your door, and I feel you are entitled to some apology from the annoyance. I shall be greatly obliged if you will try and forget it. Yours respectfully, W. Lucas. If Mr. and Mrs. Lonsdale were disturbed I tender an apology to them. Also please destroy this letter"—Mr. and Mrs. Lonsdale live on the top floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Fenton, of 83, East Lane, Bermondsey—on Saturday, April 22nd, I was in Parker's Row shortly after 11 p.m., when I saw the deceased, who was a stranger to me, in her nightdress at the door of No. 7—Mrs. Bennett was with me—I went over and spoke to the deceased, and in consequence of what she said I went into the house, and into the kitchen—the deceased came in after me, and I asked her where her clothes were—I then went into the bedroom, where the prisoner was in bed—I said to him, "Excuse me, <hi rend="italic">guv'nor</hi>, I want your wife's clothes"—he never said anything; he only looked at me—I looked for the clothes, but at first could not make out where they were, and I asked the deceased—I afterwards found some of them and took them into the kitchen—she put on what I had brought—she kept on saying to the prisoner, "You beast," and he said, "Lil, darling, don't be silly; think of the children"—she said, "It is not the first time he has tried it with lead in the bed"—she said he came home, and she cooked a plaice and they sat down, and he kept asking her to go to bed; that when she was in bed he asked her to have some whisky and she refused—when this conversa<lb/>tion was going on the prisoner was in the bedroom, and the deceased in the kitchen—she kept on pushing the door to, and he kept on opening it—I should think he could hear what she said—the deceased was standing by the table in the centre of the kitchen—she said she went to sleep, that she woke up and found him pouring some stuff down her throat—when she had dressed herself she took a bottle from a cupboard, and poured some whisky into a cup; she put it to her mouth, sipped it and screamed out, "Oh!" as if it hurt her—I said, "Is it poison?"—she did not ask me to taste it—I took it up, tasted it and said, "It is all right"—it was whisky—I went out with her, but when Mrs. Bennett reminded me of my children I left her.</p>

               <p>Fenton in Parker's Row—I noticed a woman standing in her nightdress at the door of No. 7—Mrs. Fenton went in while I waited across the road for about twenty minutes, when I went in—I noticed Mrs. Grinter standing on the staircase—I went to the kitchen door and saw the deceased standing in the kitchen, dressing—she did not speak then, but Mrs. Grinter did—I saw the prisoner in bed, the door being open—he could hear what the deceased and Mrs. Grinter was saying—Mrs. Grinter said to the deceased. "Is he drunk?"—the deceased said, "He is so artful, I don't think so"—she said he came home at 9 o'clock, that she got some plaice for supper, and they sat down together and had supper, that he kept on asking her to go to bed, which at last the did; that before she went to sleep he asked her if she would have a drop of whisky; that she had said she did not want any, and went to sleep, and that she woke up with him pouring something down her throat—during the rest of the time that I was there she kept on calling him, "You beast, you murderer"—he said, "Don't be silly, Lil, darling"—she said he worked from morning till night, and earned good money, and that he stinted her to the last farthing—I noticed that her lips were swollen—Mrs. Fenton and I waited until she was dressed, when we all came out together, and then parted.</p>

I live at 32, Sillwood Street, Rotherhithe, about a mile and a half from Parker's Row—I am a removal contractor, and the deceased was my sister—she was about thirty-five years of age, and had been married to the prisoner about nine years—about 1 a.m. on Sunday, April 23rd, I was disturbed—I went to the window and saw my sister in the street—I let her in—she had a cloth to her mouth—before I let her in she hollaaed up to me, "Come down, Tom, and see what Will has done"—when I let her in I did not see what she was suffering from—my wife attended to her—about 2 p.m. the same day I went to Guy's Hospital, where I found her in bed—I then went to seek the prisoner—I found him about 2.50—I said, "Bill, do you know Lil is in the hospital?"—he said, "Go on, is she?"—I said, "Yes, Lil would like to see you; come with me to the hospital"—he seemed very much surprised and came straight away with me—on the way I said, "Will, how do you account for it?"—he said, "Tom, I asked your sister to have a drop of whisky and she said, I do not want your whisky; give it to your f—mother.

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and clinical assistant at Guy's Hospital—I was in charge there on the early morning of April 23rd when the deceased was brought in—I admitted her at 3.15—she was put to bed—she was suffering from a large excoriated patch on the left cheek—her lips and tongue and the inner side of her mouth and uvula were excoriated and inflamed—on examination of her chest I found no sign of pulmonary disease and no other signs of disease whatever—I examined her for a pulmonary disease because I thought the inhalation of an irritant vapour might have caused bronchitis to appear, and about 10.30 a.m. bronchitis developed—the results which I saw accorded with the statement made by the deceased, and I formed the opinion that the excoriation was produced by the application of ammonia on a cloth to the left side of her face—I do not think that if a bottle had been held</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190505290103"/>
               <p>to her nose for a moment and was then dashed away by her, some of the ammonia falling on her cheek, it would have caused the injuries I saw, because the patch of excoriation was distinctly circumscribed and localized—there were no signs of the fluid having run down the neck from the face—there was no trickling or dropping—the mark covered the left side of the chin and the left cheek, extending up as high as the cheek bone—it was limited by the margin of the lower jaw—there was no distinct line on the side of the mouth—the whole of the lips were excoriated—the mouth and tongue being excoriated would indicate that whatever had caused it had been taken into the throat in the form of liquid or vapour—if vapour had been applied for a sufficient length of time to the uvula and tongue it would nave caused the excoriation—I do not think the time would be sufficient if the bottle was simply held for a moment to the mouth or nose—the conditions I saw are consistent with a cloth steeped with ammonia being placed over the mouth and cheek—I do not think ammonia would leave any excoriation when spilt on the skin if it is at once wiped off—the deceased was taken from my care by Dr. Hertz the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had an opportunity of seeing another case of ammonia burning about a over night later and another in the same week—in one case it was application of ammonia to the face and in the other it was the result of spilling some liniment containing strong ammonia—the burn on the face was caused by the vapour—the sores I saw in the deceased's mouth may have been caused by vapour—if some ammonia had been spilled on the cheek and then a cloth or shirt had been dabbed upon it and allowed to remain there a few seconds, that might have caused the excoriation, and if the cloth or shirt had become soaked I think it world have produced the sores in the mouth through the vapour—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I did not find the lips cut or bruised, or the teeth injured—I saw nothing to indicate that the neck of a bottle had been forced into her mouth beyond the fact of the sores from the vapour or some ammonia being in the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think that if ammonia had been spilt upon her face and then wiped up with a shirt and left on the face it would produce the excoriations I saw, but not if it was wiped away in the ordinary way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and house physician at Guy's Hospital—I saw the deceased about 10.30 a.m. on April 23rd—I examined her and found she was suffering from excoria<lb/>tions on the side of her face and round her mouth; I did not see any on her hands—she was then suffering from incipient symptoms of bronchitis—she got worse—I saw her in the evening when there were signs of early pneumonia in part of the right lung—on the 24th she was considerably worse and the signs of pneumonia had developed further, and it appeared as if the pneumonia was beginning to develop on the left side as well—I considered her condition then to be critical and that she was quite likely</p>

               <p>to die, so I sent for the police, as they had not been informed—a Magistrate attended—I was not attending the deceased when she died—I saw her again in the evening, but I handed the case over to Dr. Ticehurst, as I was doing his work—I saw the excoriations in the interior of the deceased's mouth on the uvula and fauces—the condition was consistent with the application of something steeped with ammonia to her mouth and the inhalation of it—I have heard Dr. Leeming's evidence, which I agree with—I think it would be quite impossible to cause the internal injuries by simply holding a bottle to the deceased's nose or mouth—you would have to hold it there for some time; it is impossible to say for how many seconds, but simply holding the bottle to the nose would not produce the inflammation of the fauces—if she had pushed it away at once it would not have been sufficient to cause the inflammation—it must have been forcibly held—the cause of the pneumonia, in my opinion, was the inhala<lb/>tion of ammonia vapour—pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs, and it can be caused by inhalation of an irritant vapour and, in my opinion, it was so caused in this case—my reason for saying that is because we know that she had ammonia over her face and a few hours later pneumonia came on, and at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination it was shown that it was much more likely to be caused by the fumes, than the ordinary pneumonia people get from cold or anything of that sort—there was a continuous inflammation all the way down the air passages.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is the first case I have seen of pneumonia coming from ammonia vapour—I heard the deceased had been standing at the open door in her nightgown for five or six minutes; that is likely to give cold and may develop into pneumonia—if some ammonia had been spilt on to her face and a cloth or shirt had been dabbed on her face, that would have caused excoriation, but it did not seem to me to be likely, because if it was simply spilt over her face there would be no pool or ammonia, as it were, which could be mopped up in that way—I have never seen ammonia spilt on a person which has been dabbed up in that way—if you held ammonia in your hands in a pool it may cause excoria<lb/>tion—assuming there is ammonia on the back of your hand, and you dabbed it up, I do not think it would cause excoriation, because I do not think the cloth would become soaked; I suppose it is possible, but you would have to be particularly careless in which way you did it and almost try<lb/>ing to produce excoriation—ammonia spilt on some people's faces might produce excoriation, but I cannot believe there would be sufficient ammonia soaked up in a cloth in that way to make it sufficiently moist to pro<lb/>duce fumes which could go into the mouth, but if the cloth was soaked it is possible that the vapour would have caused the sores I saw—exposure may lay the foundation for pneumonia, but I do not think excitement would have anything to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There are cases on record where the inhalation of fumes have developed into pneumonia—assuming ammonia is spilt on the skin, there is no difficulty in wiping it up if you want to; it is done hundreds of times—assuming that there was pneumonia spilt on the deceased's face, I do not think that there was sufficient if it was wiped off with a shirt to apply it to her mouth and cause these injuries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital, and a registered medical practitioner—I saw the deceased for the first time on Tuesday, April 25th, about midday—I considered her to be in a critical condition—her breathing was laboured, shallow and rapid; she died early the following morning—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the description given of the external excoriation is correct—internally I found intense inflammation at the back of the mouth, in the throat, windpipe, small tubes in the lungs, and the lungs themselves—there was what is called a forced membrane at the back of the throat, indicating that there had been great inflammation; it is possible that those conditions were caused by fumes of ammonia—I have heard it suggested that they were caused by wiping ammonia, which had been spilt on the woman's face off with a shirt, and apparently her inhaling the fumes from the cloth that was used, but it would depend on how long was occupied with wiping the ammonia away—the time ordinarily occupied in wiping liquid from the face I do not consider would be sufficient—I agree that the condition might be caused by the application to the face of a cloth steeped in ammonia—the cause of death was pneumonia, which can be caused by inhaling fumes of ammonia.</p>

I am going to take you into custody for attempting to murder your wife"—he said, "You do not say that, sir. I asked her to have a drop of whisky.

I took an ammonia bottle off the mantelpiece and put it under her nose. Some must have spilt on her face. I had no idea that it burnt as it apparently has. When I saw her in the hospital her face appeared burned. It was a very silly action, done in temper; I won't say that I was sober at the time; I had been drinking whisky. I am very very sorry." He pointed to this bottle (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) standing on the mantelshelf and said, "I found this bottle on the bed in the morning, and I washed it out in the wash basin." He also said, "I was taking off my shirt at the time. She screamed out; I put my shirt over her mouth and said, 'Shut up your mouth.' I think that must have made it worse." His left index finger was in a bandage, there were ten scratches on his face with red scabs just forming on them—he said, "She bit my finger and scratched my face."</p>

               <p>had a scalp wound on the left side of his head, just above and two inches behind the ear, about 7 inches long and extending to the bone—there was no injury to the bone—it required two stitches—it was jagged and such as would have been inflicted by some hard substance, such as the head coming against the kerb or a very heavy body—a kick could have done it—in addition, there was a slight bruising of the left eye, and he complained of a pain on the right rib—there was no obvious mark on him, but I found a little bruising subsequently—I ordered him on the sick list—he was evidently a good deal shaken and very exhausted, as if he had generally had a rough time of it—he has been on the sick list since on account of symptoms of shock—he has complained of severe headache—I cannot say definitely as to the ultimate result—he is suffering from shock to the nervous system, and insomnia—there has been a good deal of tenderness over the head, which might suggest injury and which might cause confusion of some sort to the brain—there is no other evidence of development, but one cannot always know—he has been three weeks under my care, and the staff surgeon has advised his being sent to a convalescent home, and that is where we shall have to send him.</p>
