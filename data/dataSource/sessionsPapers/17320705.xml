Then I call'd for a Watchman, who was a long time a coming; and then she told me, if I would go up again and lye with her, she would help me to my Watch; so I agreed to do as she desired me, and sent the Watchman away, in hopes of getting my Watch again, but she would not give it me for all that.

             and Prisoner were drinking together at the Black-Boy in Well-street; but Osborn and Longmore quarrell'd, and so the Prisoner and I left 'em. Afterwards we went down a Yard to the Prosecutor's House, where we took a Pane of Glass out of the Window, and cut the little Deal Bar, and open'd it. The Prisoner went in, and brought out a Looking-Glass and a Riding-Hood. He went in again, and brought out some Towels. Then I went in myself, and got a Box of Linen, and a Pocket which had two Keys in it. It was just Ten a Clock when we had done. When we got into the Street, I open'd the Box, and saw there was Linen in it, which I carried to the Prisoner's Maux's, lodging in Church-Lane, in Rag-Fair. We kept a Shirt a Piece, and gave her two Aprons for herself. She sold some of the Things next Day, in Rag-Fair, and the rest in Chick-Lane, for which she brought us 18 s. but I believe she sunk some of the Cole. I was afterwards taken up for a Street-Robbery with Osborn, Tripland, and Longmore, and sent for Mrs. Coniers, and returned her the Keys.</p>

            . We seiz'd the Prisoner on Tower-Hill, and carried him to an Ale house in Thames-street. At first he said that he was not Country Bob (a Name that he used to go by) but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050005"/> when we told him, we'd carry him to New-Prison, and shew him to Fleming, he own'd the Fact, and said, I know I am a dead Man, but I'll bang that Rogue Fleming if I can for betraying me. If you'll carry me before Justice Philips, I hope he'll admit me for an Evidence. Fleming has not put this Burglary into his Information, and I'll inform against him and others for this, and for stealing a Parcel of Hats on the Thames, and several other Facts. Indeed, I ought to be hanged for a Fool, for coming to Town so soon; for I had run away to Brentford, where I went to sleep under a Brick-kiln, and burnt my Thigh, so that I have been since. I know Fleming can't hurt me for any Thing but this one Fact of breaking the House in New-Gravel-Lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have not a Friend in the World, but if you take away my Life, I shall dye as innocent as any Man living. <rs id="t17320705-6-verdict37" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prisoner lay in a Corner of the same Room that I and my Wife lay in. But there was something placed betwixt the two Beds, to hide one from the other. About 2 in the Morning the Neighbours finding all the Doors open, came in and waked us. Our Goods were lost, and the Prisoner gone; but I fo und him in Clerkenwell Bridewell on the Friday following, and he had on my Hat, Coat, Breeches, Shoes, and Stockings. He confest before Justice Giffard, that he took them all from me.</p>
               <p>Court. How came he to lodge in your Room?</p>
               <p>Dallison. Very odly. About 3 Weeks before, he was lying asleep upon a Bulk in Bloomsbury-market, with his Shirt hanging out of his Breeches. Some Boys pinn'd a Paper to his Shirt, and setting Fire to it, burnt his Back-side, upon which he went to a Constable to have them taken up; and it being said, that my Son was one of them, the Constable told me that I must take Care of him till he was well. Tho' I have since been informed, that he received but little Hurt by what the Boys did to him, and that he had got the chief Damage before, by lying in a Brick-kiln.</p>

Between 11 and 12 at Night he let us in, and directed his Brother Valentine where to find the Things, and then went to Bed again; and Val. went into the Melting-house, and brought out the Patterns, and a Bell-Metal Mortar. We packed 'em up, some in our Pockets, some in our Laps, and some under our Coats, and went to Holbourn, where I left them.

The other brought up a Flask and a Glass; I stay'd 1/4 of an Hour, and then was for going; but Walker said, I should lie with her first. I said, I would not. Then said Bishop, If you won't lie with her. you shall with me; and so she flung her Arms round my Neck, and fell a buffing on me like any thing. Then Nill Walker unbutton'd my Breeches, and took hold of what I had, and held it hard with one Hand. While she pick'd my Pocket with t'other. I cried out, and then she let go her Hold below, and clapt that Hand to my Mouth, and the other Hand she reach'd out to Bishop who presently went away. Then says Nell, what does he make a Noise for, I have got but 2 Pence, and that's for the Maid. I went toward the Door, and presently the Landlady came to me, and swore at me, and bid me go about my Business. There were 2 men going by the Door, who help'd me to a Constable, and we found one of the Prisoners about 2 a Clock o' Sunday Morning, and the other about 3; and on Monday they were carried before the Justice, and then they said they had but 8 Pence from me, but I lost 3 Pounds.</p>

            . This Fellow came by my Door, and forced me in to drink a Dram; he said he had but 14 d. about him, but if I would trust to his Honour, and oblige him, he would call again, and give me half a Crown. I told him, I never did such things upon Trust, for it was my way to deal with none but Gentlemen that could make me a-handsome Present. Then he would have had Bishop to have Pawn'd his Waistcoat ; but she told him it was worth nothing. And as I'm a Christian, we got no more out of him than 2 Groats, tho' he swears he lost 3 l. But he's an Irishman, God bless him; I consider his Country, and know he will swear any thing. I was forc'd to go to the Ale-house to borrow 6 d. to give him, before he would trust me with his Shilling. He told us he liv'd in Play-House-Yard in Drury-Lane.

            . I live with my Mother at the Dutch Ware-house against Durham-Yard in the Strand. Last Friday Night I met Isabella Eaton and the Prisoner, and another Woman in the Strand. We went into the Half-Moon-Tavern, and had 2 Pints of Wine. We staid about half an Hour, and then took Coach, and drove to a Brandy shop (kept by one Soamn ) in Red-Lion-street. I did not go into the Shop, but called for a Quartern of Citron-Water at the Door, for which I paid 1 s. Eaton asked me to lye there, but I refusing, she and I and the Prisoner took the same Coach, and drove to the <placeName id="t17320705-12-crimeloc75">Greyhound-Inn in Drury-Lane</placeName>

I knock'd so a Bottle of Water, the Prisoner brought it up, and said she would come to Bed too, and lye with me all Night. I suspecting she had some Design, got up, and put on my Breeches, took the Money out of my Pocket, and counting it, parted the Gold from the Silver, and put the Gold, which was two Guineas and a half, a Broad-piece and a Moidore, into my Right-side Pocket, and thrust my Handkerchief down upon it. Then I laid down (not in, but) on the Bed, and the Prisoner with her Cloaths on lay by me. I fell asleep, and between 4 and 5 in the Morning I felt her Hand. I catch'd hold of her Hand, and ask'd her what Business she had with it in my Pocket? But she got her Hand away, and told me that it was not there. I did not search her then, for feeling on the out-side of my Pocket, I felt some Money within, so that I thought my Gold was safe; but in a Quarter of an Hour Eaton got up, and they were both going away in a Hurry. This gave me a Suspicion, and so searching my Pocket within-side, I found only 2 Shillings, and 2 Sixpences, instead of my Gold: I tax'd 'em with it, and they both owned they had got my Money (but not how much) and said, they would keep it, except I would give 'em two Guineas of it, and then they would return the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they say how they got it?</p>
               <p>G. A. No. I sent for a Constable. Eaton was very outrageous, and broke the Door to get away before the Constable came, but the Landlord prevented her. We all went to the Constable's House, and there Moll Harvey came and made a Riot, and so Bell Eaton escaped. The Prisoner produced all my Money to the Constable, and said she had it of me, but that I gave it her to lye with her.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050009"/>Prisoner. Had you no more Gold about you, than what you charge me with? G. A. No,</p>
               <p>Sral Gra. I live at the Greyhound-Inn. The Prisoner and Bll Eaton, and this little Gentleman, came in a Coach, and asked for a Bed. Says my Mistress, Don't ye want two Beds ? No, Madam, says the Prisoner, but I hope it will be no Offence to go up, and take Part of a Pint with my Friend, and this Gentleman. The Gentleman pull'd out some Gold and Silver, and paid for his Bed, and a Pint of Wine, and so they all went up together. When that Pint was out, says the Prisoner; We will have my Pint now. And so it was brought up. Says Eaton to the Prisoner, I am sure the Gentleman is more generous than to let you pay for it. So the Gentleman paid. I left 'em, and the Prisoner came down soon after. Madam, says she to my Mistress, can't I drink a Pint of Wine with you? Yes, and welcome, says my Mistress. Then the Prisoner sent a Porter for her Husband (as she call'd him) who came directly. They sat down together in the Kitchen, and call'd for another Pint. By-and-by I heard the Gentleman knocking above Stairs. I ran up and asked him what he knock'd for? He said, for a Bottle of Water. I came down and filled a Bottle, but the Prisoner snatch'd it from me, and carried it up herself, and lock'd the Door. Go up, saysmy Mistress to me, and see why she stays; and tell her that I will never suffer such Doings, as for two Women to lye with one Man, for it is not the Practice of my House. I went up to the Door, and told the Prisoner my Mistress wonder'd she staid so long. Damn ye, says she, I'm a-bed. Says I, Your Husband wants ye. Let him go Home about his Business, says she, for I tell ye, I am a-bed, and won't come. With that the Gentleman open'd the Door, and said,

            , what d'ye want. I told him, my Mistress would not suffer such Things, as two Women to one Man. Then he took some Gold in his Hand, and look'd at it by the Candle, and put it into his Side-pocket; and I went down and told my Mistress, that I thought they design'd to rob him. Says my Mistress, I never was served in this Manner by two Women before. I'll sit up all Night, but I'll see whether or no a Gentleman shall be robb'd in my House. The Prisoner's Husband said nothing to this, but got up and went away. About 5 in the Morning my Master was coming down Stairs, the Prisoner and Eaton had open'd the Chamber-door softly, and were coming out. Hey! says he, here's two Woman a creeping away. The Gentleman hearing this, got from the Bed, and they were forced in again. Eaton made a great Disturbance, and would have got out o' Window, but being prevented, she gave the Gentleman several Slaps o' the Face. He said, Very well, Madam! I shan't strike you. Then she went to break the Lock of the Door with a Candlestick, and at last she split the Door, but they kept her from getting out. The Gentleman said he had been robb'd, and desired a Constable might be sent for, and a Constable came and carried them all three to his own House.</p>

I went thither, the Prosecutor charg'd them with robbing him of 2 Guineas and a half, a Moidore, and a Broad-piece.

They all chose my House, and so I took 'em with me. Eaton offer'd me half a Guinea dry, and half a Guinea to be spent, if I would not carry her before Justice Du Veil ; but when I would not agree to her Terms, she catch'd up a Case-Knife, and offer'd to stick me, but I avoided the Blow; and by-and-by Moll Harvey, with a Mob of I believe an Hundred Pick-pockets,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050010"/> came and made a Riot about my House, and so Eaton escaped.</p>

            . I live in Short's Gardens, About a Week ago the Prisoner came to my House to enquire for a Lodging. I told her I wou'd Lett none under Half a Crown a Week. She said she would call again, and bring her Husband with her, and directed me to enquire her Character at Mr. Soams's, a Brandy-shop in Red-Lion-street. So o' Friday Night one came to know if I would let the Prisoner and her Husband lye at my House. I went down to Soams's, and there was she and this Gentleman. I asked Soams if that Gentleman was her Husband. He said, he did not know that he was. With that I refused to receive 'em, and thereupon the Gentleman pulled some Gold and Silver out of his Pocket, and said to me; Perhaps you are afraid we have got no Money. Whereof the Prisoner says to him, Now, my Dear, if you'll give me enough to fetch my Things out of Pawn, I'll go with you to an Inn. So he gave her some Money, but I don't know how much. I am sure I came here very much against my Desire, but she sent a Paper to me, and threatened to ruin my Husband (who is a Cabinet-maker) if I did not appear for her.</p>

The Horse was taken out of my Field; in 3 Days after, the Prisoner (as I heard) offering to sell the Horse to Mr. Paul of Dartford, was taken up on Suspicion, and committed to Deptsord Bride. II. From thence he sent a Letter to his Father in Ickenham Parish, but there being another Man of the same Name, in the same Parish, the Letter by Mistake came to him, and he acquainted me with the Contents, by which I found out the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paul. A Farrier in Dartford asking me if I would buy a Horse, I went with him to a little Alehouse where I found the Prisoner and the Horse. Says the Prisoner, I value this Horse at 12 Guineas, but as I am going a Journey, I must have some Horse or other, and therefore, if you have any that will serve my Turn I'll rap with you. I shew'd him 2 or 3, and at last he pitch'd upon a little serub Horse. We agreed that he should have this little Horse, and 7 Guineas in exchange for the Horse he had to dispose of. I gave him a Shilling Earnest, and then told him, it was the Custom of our Neighbourhood to require Vouchers, when they bought a Horse of a Stranger. He said, He could bring no Vouchers, because he knew no Body thereabouts. I ask'd him where he liv'd, and how he came by the Horse? He said, He liv'd at Harrow on the Hill, and bought the Horse there; and that he would not now have sold him, but that he was robb'd on Bexley-Heath of 3 Guineas and a half, and had not a Shilling left to bear his Charges. On farther Talk, I found he Shuffled, and was in several Stories; upon which I sent for a Constable. The Prisoner then said, That he knew Mr. Buck in our Neighbourhood, to whom he sold a Horse a Year ago. I remember'd that Mr. Buck about that time, did buy a Horse of a Stranger, who said, He had been robb'd on Bristol-Causeway ; and it afterwards appear'd, that that Horse was stol'n. We carried the Prisoner before the Justice, who having examin'd him, committed him to Deptford-Bridewell.</p>

The Prisoner and I, and Plumridge committed this Robbery: The Prisoner and I din'd at Mr. Winniat's in Fleet-Lane, on Sunday was a Fortnight; we had a Leg of Mutton and Turnips for Dinner, and 3 Bowls of Punch after, in Company with Winniat and his Man, and a Countryman; but Winniat is since absconded. Between 9 and o at Night Plumridge came in, and ask'd us to drink a Dram; we had half a Pint of Caraway, and then went all together to Whitechappel-Fields ; there we overtook the Prosecutor: Plumridge seiz'd him, and cut him across the Throat, and gave him 2 Stabs in the Back with a great Case-knife, which he brought from Winniat's : I did not see him give the Stabs, but he told me afterwards that he did it. Then the Prisoner struck him on the Head with a Broomstick, and the Prosecutor being 10 th to come along, we dragg'd him to a Bankside; Plumridge got upon the Bank to pull him over, but did not; I search'd his Pocket, and took out 19 s. and the Prisoner examin'd farther, and found the Pocket-Piece, 'twas a little bit of Silver like a Sixpence: I took his Hat, and gave him mine.</p>
               <p>Lumm. I know of no Hat that was given me.</p>
               <p>Buck. He was senseless with the Blows and Wounds: This is the Hat, and Plumridge took his Wig to the best of my Remembrance, tho' the Prisoner since told me, that he took it himself. We stript his Coat off, and the Prisoner bid me put it on and wear it, which I did; but first they knock'd him down, and would have murder'd him if I had not begg'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050013"/> his Life. How can ye serve a Man so villainously? says I, sure you will not be such vile Men as to kill him! For God's Sake spare his Life. And so as they were going I listed him up, and bid him run for his Life; upon which Plumridge and the Prisoner turn'd back to kill me, but I made 'em easy. This is the Coat, and here are the 2 Cuts in the Back. Then we came on foot to Newgate-street, and there we took Coach between 12 and 1 in the Morning, and drove to Mr. Pember's, at the Pindar of Wake-field, where we all three went to bed together. Pember married one of my Sisters. Next Day we went to the Two Brewers by the Church in Old Bedlam, where we spent most of the Money, and at Night I and Plumridge went to Cow-Cross, where we pawn'd the Coat for 7 s. and from thence to

I voluntarily surrender'd myself to Justice Rohe the same Week (but I forget the Day) and gave Information against the Prisoner, who was taken immediately; then I went, and 3 Men with me, to see for Plumridge in Old Bedlam, but he was gone before we came; and after that I went by myself to New Prison.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there not a Warrant out against you before you surrender'd? Buck. The Prisoner told me there was a Judge's Warrant against me, but I knew nothing of it; I surrender'd upon no other Account than the Pricks of Conscience. Court. How happened it then that you did not surrender sooner? Buck. I went about it as soon as ever I could get out of the Prisoner's Company without his suspecting me; I left him under Pretence of going to have my Wig powder'd, and I told Mr. Pointing and some other Men of this Robbery, and desired them to go with me to a Justice to surrender myself. Court. How long have you known the Prisoner and Plumridge ? Buck. I have known the Prisoner 5 Weeks, and Plumridge 10 Months; the Prisoner and I became acquainted at Mr. Rhodes's Alehouse in Black-Boy-Alley ; he told me that he was a Poulterer, and he and Plumridge invited me to go out with 'em.</p>

            . I lately kept the B Tree Alehouse at the Pindar of Wakefield, but have since left it. On Monday the 19th of April, about one in the Morning, Buck, and Plumridge, and the Prisoner came in a Coach to my Door, and knock'd me up; I told 'em I had no Fire, nor Candle in the House; they said they were very dry; says I to Buck, You know the way into the Cellar, fetch up some bottle Ale; so he went down, and brought up 3 Bottles. I groped about for a Mug, but not finding it readily, they drank out of the Bottle; then they all 3 went to the Pump to wash themselves; I went up to Bed, and they follow'd me; my Wife was not with me, and so we lay all together, for it was a very large Bed. I got up at 5, and opening the Window-shutter, saw their Cloaths which lay on the Bed, and their Linen were very bloody: Plumridge call'd for some Water, and a Towel, which I fetch'd, and he began to wash one of the Coats, which was more bloody than the rest; says I you'll spoil your Coat, you had better do it with a dry Brush; he desir'd me to help him to one, which I did, and then he began to rub the Blood off his own Coat, for he said the other was Buck's, and when he had done, the Prisoner took the Brush, and clean'd his Coat. Says the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050014"/> to Buck, You can't go to London in that Coat, in such a pickle: No, says he, I'll go in my Waistcoat, and leave the Coat here till dry. I ask'd 'em how they came in that bloody Condition, and how the Coat came to be cut Why, says the Prisoner, I was playing Rogue with a Penknife, and cut it myself last Night, and afterwards we all got drunk, and fell to fighting. They went to London, Buck being in his Waistcoat, and about 9 at Night they return'd, and ask'd for the Coat; I gave it 'em, and went out my self, and left them there, so that I don't know how long they staid. On Tuesday the Prisoner and Buck came to my House again, and ask'd me if I knew that Fellow Plumridge: I told them no, I had never seen him before. Why, said they, he's taken up, and put into the Compter, and we have been fighting with the Watch to rescue him, but we could not manage it; for at last we were glad to get away overselves. Now we are afraid that he should take himself an Evidence, and wish you would go to London, and enquire whether it is so, or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they name any particular Fact, concerning which they were afraid he should turn Evidence?</p>
               <p>Pember. No. I went to London and heard that a Man had been robb'd in Stepney Fields of a Coat, and Hat and Wig, and had been very much abused. This made me suspicious of these three Men; and so that Night I went to look for Buck and the Prisoner at a House in Drury-Lane, which I knew they frequented. They both came in drunk between 12 and 1 in the Morning. They stay'd some Time, and then I went away with them towards my House. When we came into the Fields, they quarrel'd about the Coat that Buck and Plumridge had pawn'd at Cow-Cross ; they swore and curs'd, and called Names; you're as great a Rogne as I, says one, and you have no Heart, says th'other; and at last they drew their Knives, but the Prisoner wrested Buck's Knife out of his Hand, and threw it away; Buck sell into a dry Ditch, and there we left him without a Coat. As the Prisoner and I went home together, he told me. that himself and Buck and Plumridge had robb'd a Man, and stabb'd him in the Back, because he was resolute, and wou'd not agree to their Compliance. When we came to my House, I turned my Wife and another out of Bed, and I and the Prisoner went in. Buck came Home soon after, tho' he would not come to Bed because of the Quarrel, but he sat up with his Sister.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she your Wife?</p>
               <p>Pember. Yes, and a good one too she wou'd be, if she was but hang'd. I got up in the Morning, and Buck then went to Bed. I went to London, and consulted with Mr. Brock, Mr. James and Mr. Pointing, and they spoke to Mr. Taylor about apprehending the Prisoner and Buck. We all came for that Purpose to my House; but my Wife suspecting my Design, had given her Brother and the Prisoner timely Notice, so that they got off. Then I appointed to meet Mr. Taylor and Mr. James in London at 6 that Afternoon, and to go to Sir

I and Pointing waited at several House in the Fields, in hopes of catching Buck and the Prisoner, if they came that Way; but we mist of them, tho' we stay'd till 8 a Clock; and so when we came to London. Mr. Taylor was gone, and Plumridge was discharged. Then we went to Drury lane, to enquire after the other two, and hearing that two Street Robbers had been taken up, and sent to the Round-house; we went thither, but found two other Men there, who had endeavour'd to take the Prisoner and Buck ; but a Mob being rais'd by that Attempt, those 2 were committed for breeding a Riot.</p>

I went that Way again, and happening to see Buck's eldest Sister, who lodg'd in Drury-lane, I dog'd her to the White-Hart in * Baldwin's Gardens in Drury-lane, and there I found the Prisoner drinking; I sat down and talk'd, and play'd at Cards with him. He express'd some uneasiness that Buck stay'd so long; for Buck was gone out under Pretence to get his Wig powder'd. At last the Prisoner got up to go away. But one Mr. How stopp'd him. The Prisoner asked the Reason. Why, says Mr. How, I have got a Writ against you for 9 l. which you owe your Father-in-Law Thorowton Bocklingson for Board. O, says the Prisoner, if that's all, I don't mind that, and so he sat down again, and sung us a Song or two; after which a Coach was call'd, under Pretence of driving him to his Father-in-Law's in Rose-street ; but by the Way we was met by

I went and sat in another Box at first, and took no Notice of them. Buck made an Excuse to go out and get his Wig powder'd, and his Sister said. she was a hungry, and would go out and get a Pigeon Pye, or some such Thing; and so Pember and the Prisoner were left together, and they play'd a Game or 2 at Cards. After which the Prisoner got up and went to the Door, and wondred that Buck stay'd so long; he sat down again, but seem'd very uneasy. and got up a second time; upon which I took hold of him; he appeared much concern'd at it, and asked me what was the Matter? I told him, I had a Warrant against him for 9 l. due to his Father-in-Law for Board. He desired me to stay till Buck came back. I stay'd some Time; for I did not then know where Buck was gone to; but not coming I call'd a Coach, under Pretence of carrying the Prisoner to his Father's, for we were afraid of raising a Mob if it had been known that he was taken for a Street Robber.

               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I own I have been so unfortunate as to drink in Buck's Company, but I was not with him that Night the Robbery was committed. Buck and Pember both are Persons of the vilest Character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones, the City-Marshal. I have frequently found Buck in ill House, such as Debson's in the Old-Bailey, and I have often warn'd him to keep away, if he did not intend to come to the Gallows. Pember's Wife is as bad as can be; she's now in Newgate, and at present Pember himself has no visible Way of Livelihood. Brock and James make it their Business to take Rogues.</p>

We went backwards with her to look out the Wood; he soon began his impudent Tricks, and went to put his Hands under her Coats for all we were there.

               <p>John Cooper. On Whit-Monday, May 29. I dress'd myself and went abroad, and returning between 1 and 2 next Morning to my Lodging at Numb. 11 in Eagle-Court, in the Strand, I knock'd once, but finding no Body answer'd, I went to a Night-Cellar hard by, I call'd for a Pint of Beer, and sitting down on a Bench, the Prisoner came and sat by me; he ask'd me if I did not know Mr. Price, and some other Persons, and so we sell into Discourse; we drank 3 hot Pints together, I paid the Reckoning 9 1/3 d. and went up; I was got about 15 or 20 Yards off when the Prisoner came up to me, said it was a fine Morning, and ask'd me to take a Walk; I agreed, and we went into Chelsea Fields, and turning up to a private Place among some Trees, he clap'd his left Hand to the right Side of my Coat, and trip'd up my Heels, and holding a Knife to me, God damn ye says he, if ye offer to speak or stir I'll kill ye; give me your Ring. I gave it him, and he put it on his own Finger; then he made me pull of my Coat and Waistcoat, and Breeches; I begg'd that he would not kill me, nor leave me naked; No, says he, I'll only change wi'ye; came pull off your Shirt, and put on mine; so he stript, and drest himself in my Cloaths, and I put on his; there was 4 1/2 d. in my Breeches, and I found 3 ha' pence in his. He ask'd me where I liv'd, and I told him. I suppose, says he, you intend to charge me with a Robbery by and by, but if you do, I'll swear you're a Sodomite, and gave me the Cloaths to let you B - r me. While we were dressing, a Man pass'd by at a little Distance, if there had been 2 Men I should have ventur'd to have call'd to them for Help, but as there was but one I was afraid. Then the Prisoner bid me come along, and I follow'd him to Piccadilly, and so to Little Windmill-street, and there I call'd to 2 Men, who took him into an Alehouse; I told them he had robb'd me, and he said that I had given him the Cloaths to let me B - him. The Men said they expected to be paid for their Day's Work, if they lost their Time about my Business; I promis'd them they should be satisfied. When we came to Justice Mercer's, he was not up, so we went to the Coach and Horses by St. Giles's Church, and waited an Hour and an half; while we were there the Prisoner wrote a Letter; to his Mother (as he said) and directed it to Numb. 20. in Colston's-Court in Drury-Lane. We went before the Justice, who ask'd me if I had charg'd a Constable with the Prisoner, I told him no; Go and do it then, says the Justice, and swear to the Things, and I'll commit him. So we went toward Tyburn-Road, into Marybone-Fields, and there the Men let the Prisoner go; What do ye do? says I. Why what would you have us do, said they, he charges you with Sodomy, and says you gave him the Cloaths on that Account. Another Man coming by at the same time, I desir'd his Assistance; but they telling him that I was a Molly, he said I ought to be hang'd, and he'd have nothing to do with me; then the Prisoner began to run, and I after him; but one of the two Men, who expected to be paid for their Day's Work, kick'd up my Heels, and as I was rising, he struck me down again; I was very much hurt, and spit Blood, so that I could not follow them, and so they all got over a Ditch and escaped; I went to my Lodgings in Eagle-Court. They were surprised to see me come home in such a shabby Dress; I told 'em what had happen'd, and describ'd the Man, and said that he sent a Letter to his Mother in Calston's-Court; O, Says one, I know him, his Name is

He told the Justice that I put my Yard into his Hand twice; and says the Justice, You had a long Knife, it seems, why did you not cut it off? I would have done so. The Prisoner said that he was not willing to expose me so much. Here are certain Ladies that belong to Brogdon Poplet, who, I suppose, have abundance to say for the Prisoner.</p>

            , Taylor. On the 29th of May, in the Evening, I was drinking with Mr. Mead at the King's-Arms by Leicester-Fields when the Prosecutor came in, dress'd in a black Coat, a white Waistcoat, and black Breeches; he sat down and drank, and then paid his Reckoning, and went away. Next Morning I saw Mr. Mead again, he said he had met the Prosecutor in a dirty ragged Suit of Cloaths, and a speckled Shirt, and never set his Eyes on a Man so metamorphos'd. But how came he in that Condition? says I, Why it seems he has been robb'd this Morning, says he, by one Gordon, a Leather-breahes Maker. I pared with Mr. Mead as I was going by Turnstile in Holbourn, the Prisoner pull'd me by the Coat, and said, How d'ye do? what don't ye know me? and indeed I hardly did know him in that Dress. What is it you, Mr. Gordon? says I, why I heard you was dead. Dead! says he, who told you so? Why Cooper, says I, he drank with me last Night. Cooper is a great Rouge, says he; What has be done ? says I; He gave me these Cloaths this Morning, says he; And is he a Rouge for that? says I; No, says he, but he pretends to get 'em again by Force. Hark ye, Tom, says I, as you have a Soul to be sov'd, I fancy you'll come to be hang'd; for he has sworn a Robbery against you. Has he really done it? says he; for God's Sake help me to make it up, I'll go and get 3 Guineas of my Uncle in the Temple, and meet you at the Bell and Horse-shoe in Holborn. I told the Prosecutor of this, and he went with me, but we could find no such Sign as the Bell and Horse-shoe.</p>

            . Between 9 and 10 on Tuesday Night I was sent for to the Two Sugar-Loaves in Drury-Lane; the Prosecutor gave me a Warrant against the Prisoner; we went before Justice Newton ; the Justice having heard the Prosecutor's Charge, ask'd the Prisoner what he had to say for himself? Why, says the Prisoner, he laid his privy Rarts in my Hand, and offer'd to B - me. Then says Mr. Newton, You had better take him before Justice Giffard toMorrow, he knows more of the Matter, for I see it is his Warrant. So the Prisoner was sent to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was lock'd out, and went to Mrs. Holder's Night-Cellar; the Prosecutor came and sat by me, and ask'd me to drink, I thought I had seen him before; we fell into Discourse, and had 3 hot Pints of Gin and Ale between us; about 4 in the Morning he ask'd me to take a Walk; we went into Chelsea Fields, and coming among some Trees and Hedges, he kiss'd me, and put his privy Parts into my Hand; I ask'd him what he meant by that, and told him I would expose him; he begg'd me not to do it, and said he would make me amends. I ask'd him what amends? He said he would give me all his Cloaths, if I would accept of them, and so we agreed, and chang'd Cloaths. After this, I ask'd him to go into the White-Horse by Hyde-Park, but he said he would not, for he had Relations there, and did not care to expose himself in that Dress. We went farther, and I would have gone into another House, but he made the same Excuse: Then we came to Little Windmill-street, where we found a Man knocking at an Alehouse Door; we thought to have gone in there, but it being early the People would not get up, and so we went to the White-Hart in Knaves-Acre ; there he charg'd me with a Robbery, and I charg'd him with an Attempt to commit Sodomy. We went before Justice Mercer, who order'd us to get a Constable, and in going along, the Prosecutor raised a Mob, and squall'd as I had been murdering him, so that I was glad to get away. He afterwards met me again as I was talking with my Master in Drury-Lane, and carry'd me to Mr. Paplet's.</p>

The Prosecutor said he desir'd nothing more than to have his Cloaths again; but the Prisoner would not consent, For nothing is srcer than Gift, says he, and I'll see you out. We could not get in at the Two Brewers, and so went to Mr. Shaw's in Knaves-Acre, and not agreeing there, we went to the Coach and Horses by St. Giles's Church ; and there the Prisoner wrote a Letter to his Mother, it was directed to his Father, a Taylor, at Numb. 4. in Colston's-Court, I found the House according to the Direction, and deliver'd the Letter, but his Father was not up, and when I return'd to the Coach and Horses they were all gone.</p>

Her Highness lives with Mr. Tull in Eagle-Court in the Strand, and calls him her Master, because she was Nurse to him and his Wife when they were both in a Salivation; but the Princess is rather Mr. Tull's Friend, than his domestick Servant.

            . I was trying on a Suit of Red Damask at my Mantua-maker's in the Strand, when the Princess Seraphina came up, and told me the Suit look'd mighty pretty. I wish, says he, you would lend 'em me for a Night, to go to Mrs. Green's in Nottingham-Court, by the Seven Dials, for I am to meet some fine Gentlemen there. Why, says I, can't Mrs. Green furnish you? Yes, says he, she lends me a Velvet Scarf and a Gold Watch sometimes. He used to be but meanly dress'd, as to Men's Cloaths, but he came lately to my Mantua-maker's, in a handsome Black Suit, to invite a Gentlewoman to drink Tea with Mrs. Tull. I ask'd him how he came to be so well Rigg'd? And he told me his Mother had lately sold the Reversion of a House; And now, says he, I'll go and take a Walk in the Park, and shew my self. Soon after this, my Maid told me that her Highness was robb'd by a Man in a Sailor's Habit, who had changed Cloaths with him. And so next Morning I sent for him. Lord, Princess! says I, you are vastly alter'd. Ay, Madam, says he, I have been robb'd, but I shall get the Reward for hanging the Rogue. Another Time he comes to me, and says, Lord, Madam, I must ask your Pardon, I was at your Mantua-maker's Yesterday, and dress'd my Head in your Lac'd Pinners, and I would sain have borrow'd them to have gone to the Ridotto at Vauxhall last Night, but I cou'd not persuade her to lend 'em me; but however she sent me your Callimanco Gown and Madam Nuttal's Mob, and one of her Smocks, and so I went thither to pick up some Gentlemen to Dance. And did you make a good Hand of it, Princess? says I. No, Madam, says be, I pick'd up two Men, who had no Money, but however they proved to be my old Acquaintance, and very good Gentlewomen they were, One of them has been transported for counterfeiting Masquerade Tickets; and t'other went to the Masquerade in a Velvet Domine, and pick'd up an old Gentleman, and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173207050022"/> to Bed with him, but as soon as the old Fellow found that he had got a Man by his Side, he cry'd out, Murder.</p>

An impudent Rogue! And yet, Ma'm, I think your Highness had better make it up with him, than expose yourself, for some say it was only an Exchange. Why, sysle, at first I would have made it up, and taken my Cloaths again, but now it's too late, and I must prosecute, for those that were concerned in taking him up, expect their Share in the Reward, and won't let me drop the Prosecution.</p>

What, says I, are ye going to rob me? Rob ye? says she, what signifies such a foolish Thing as this? It well never fetch above the Consequence of a Slling. I found I was in a lewd House, and so I did not offer to take it from her; and then I felt in my Pocket, and found my Money was all gone too, and I had 31 s. 6 d. when I went in.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you had so much? Where did you count it? Ford. I counted it in the Street 2 Hours before, and there was 31 s. 6 d. Court. You say you was drunk, are you sure you dropp'd none of it in the Street? Ford. Yes, I was drunk, that's true; but not so drunk as that comes to neither. Court. Did you go into no Company before you met with the Prisoner? Ford. Yes, I went to drink with 2 Men, upon the Acknowledgment of my coming out of the Country, and then I was more fuddled than before; when we came to pay the Reckoning, I had 33 s. 6d. Court. You said you had but 31 s. 6 d. before you went into the Alehouse. Ford. I said so because I made no Acknowledgement of the Consequence of the 2 s. which I spent afterwards at the Alehouse. Court. And whither did you go next? Ford. I went to another House, and drank the Consequence of 2 or 3 full Pots of Beer, but I spent no Money there, because I was treated. I remember it well enough, for I was sober when I came out of the House. Court. Do you drink yourself sober ? How came you drunk then before you came to the Bandy-house? Ford. Why, I don't know; with talking of one Thing or another, I think: But I was full of Liquor, that I was. Court. When you was so full of Liquor, could you know one Woman from another? Ford. Yes, I acknowledged the Woman next Day. Court. Did you feel her pick your Pocket? Ford. No, I felt nothing about my Pocket, being heavy to Sleep; but when I began to wag my Head, she proceeded to the Feet of the Bed, and having a strong Suspicion that she took my Stock, I charged her with picking my Pocket. Court. You said, you felt her take your Stock. Ford. Yes, she took it by main Force. Court. Then she did not take it privately without your Knowledge, and therefore she cannot be guilty of this Indictment. The Jury <rs id="t17320705-35-verdict170" type="verdictDescription">

On Tuesday the 4th of April last, he went to Bed before me, and as soon as I came to Bed to him, he caught me in his Arms and kiss'd me. I desired him to desist, for I did not like such Behaviour. I turn'd about, and went to sleep, and by-and-by he thrust his Y - d so hard against my Fun - t, that it waked me. I told him I would bear such Usage no longer, his Inclinations were not for my liking, nor never would; and if he made any farther Offers that Way, I would immediately complain, and expose him to the whole House. He swore, if I spoke of it, he would do me a private Mischief. He had made some such Offers before, and talk'd to me in the most vile Way; and therefore I had desired the Chamberlain to let me be removed, but the House was then so full that I could not be chum'd elsewhere. At last I resolved to discover his Behaviour, notwithstanding his threatning to do me a Mischief, and so I sent to ask an Attorney's Advice how I should proceed, and then on the Sunday following I disclosed it.</p>

            . As I was drinking in the Coffee-Room 2 or 3 Months ago, the Prosecutor seem'd uneasy with his Chum, and said, he wanted another. I asked him why? Because, says he, this would have B - d me. I told Sylvester of it. He said, that the other was a lying Rascal, and would have served him so. A Day or two after they both met in the Publick Room, and charged one another, and gave one another the Lye, so that the House had a Suspicion of them both, and the Prosecutor, as well as the other, got the Name of a lying, sodomytical Fellow, and it was thought scandalous to keep Company with either of 'em. <rs id="t17320705-42-verdict194" type="verdictDescription">

The Watchman found the Pocket the same Night as he was going 11 o'Clock, but there was nothing in it as he told me. Court. Could you see their Faces plain enough to know 'em again? Burkett. Yes; there was a Glass-Lamp at the Bagnio, and when I came home to St. Giles's, I described them so exactly that they were taken the next Morning, and I went to see them in St. Giles's Roundhouse about 9, and knew them both as soon as ever I saw them. Court. Where is the Cut in your Arm? Burk. Here it is. Court. It looks more like a slight Scratch with a Pin, than a Cut with a Penknife.</p>
               <p>P. Thomas. I'll prove that we were in a House at the Seven Dials when you say this Robbery was done.</p>

Mr. Burkell call'd me up about 5 last Thursday Morning, and told me that his Wife had been robb'd, and that he had some suspicion of 2 Men, who he believ'd were sauntring about the Seven Dials. We went to a Brandy-shop and took the Prisoners, who he said answer'd his Wife's Description; she came to see them in the Round-house, and as soon as the Governor of the Round-house shew'd them, she said she could swear to P. Thomas, because he turn'd her round, but she could not swear to Baker, because she did not see his Face. The Prisoners brought a Soldier and a Woman to prove that they were in St. Andrew's-street by the Seven Dials, at a Brandy-shop, at the same time the Robbery was said to be committed; and so the Jury <rs id="t17320705-54-verdict235" type="verdictDescription">
