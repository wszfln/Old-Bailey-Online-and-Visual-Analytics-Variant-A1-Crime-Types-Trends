On the afternoon of 28th August, I was on duty in Cheapside—I ovserved a crowd collected near Sir Robert Peel's statue, and went to see what was the matter—I found the prisoner and a carman fighting—the carman was on his back on the ground; the prisoner was standing about three or four yards from him in a fighting attitude—I went up to him and said, "You must go out of this we can have no bother here"—her answered me with a volley of abuse, and asked what the h—I I wanted with him, why not unterfere with the other man—he went to rush past me to the carman; I caught hold of him by the coat and told him he must go away—he said, "I have had twelve months for very nearly killing a policeman; you had better let go your hold"—I then let go of him and tried to persuade him to go away—he said, "You must be a much stronger man than me to keep me away from him"—I then caught hold of him again to hinder him from going—he then knocked my hat off with his hand, seized me round the neck with his arm and commenced kick<lb/>ing me about the legs—he kicked me once in the groin—he then put his leg between mine and tried to throw me—he continued to assault me till the arrival of Banham, another constable—he caught hold of him by the arm and persuaded him to come, but he still kept on kicking us both very violently—sometimes he walked and sometimes we had to drag him—when we got to the top of Bread-street he threw himself down in his back on the ground and continued to kick at us very violently—he said if he had a knife he would stick it into us; he would die for a policeman—in Cannon-street he threw himself down on his back again and kicked very violently—we did at last with the assistance of three or four others, succeed in getting</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—about 12 o'clock on 28th of last month, I was in Cheapside with a barrow of greengages—I saw a crowd collected and a young man came and told me my brother was in trouble over the way, fighting with a carman—I ran across the road and saw my brother with the two constables; the carman was standing by; the mob was crying out "Shame! why not take the carman as well? he was the aggressor"—the constable said, "You must come with me"—another constable ran across and said, "Oh, we know him; he has had twelve months before for assaulting one of our fellows"—the prisoner said, "I will go quietly if you will go back and take the carman"—Shead said he would not—the prisoner said, "I will go till you take the carman"—he was bleeding from the nose and mouth, and was crying—the mob was crying out, "Shame"—he used no violence at all while I was there, he only laid down on the ground waiting for the carman to be taken—he said the horse had been devouring his greengages.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William White, a moulder to a brick<lb/>maker—we like at Northalt, near Uxbridge—on Monday afternoon last, about 3 o'clock, I was going with my husband's tea into the brick-field, and met the prisoner going towards my house—I saw him put his hand in the water-spout to see if the key was there—it was not there, and then he tried to force the door open—he could not—he then took up a brick and smashed in the window and frame, and got in—I went up, and saw him coming out at my bed-room-window with a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a shirt, and a handkerchief, belonging to my husband—I told him they did not belong to him, and to put them down—he took up a shovel and swore he would murder me me if I did not let him came out—he knocked me down with the shovel and cut me on my head—I had my baby in my arms at the time and he stunned the child with his fist, and made his way off—when I came to myself, I ran after him as fast as I could, hallooing, "Stop thief!"—some friends caught him, and the things were taken from him.</p>

               <p>my patterns in pawn to charter myself to Derby; what else could I do? I must have stayed there, at a frightful expense in the shape of an hotel bill, instead of which I collected this money, redeemed my samples, paid my bill, and just cleared my way up to London. I went without my dinner and without half my meals to make the money go further; I endeavoured to do all I possibly could but the journey was failure. This money was spen in <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> expenses. Mr. Rolf has sworn tht I have not given credit for Strickland's account, how that is, I know not; I received it and am fully convinced that I paid it to Mr. Rolf. Five years ago I was charged in this Court for the same thing and had a years imprisonment, and it is hardly likely that I should throw away a change again for such a paltry amount; I paid him this money but unfortunately cannot bring witnesses to prove it; I have been negligent and careless: for having had troubles of a domestic nature, I have given way too much to drink, but as to embezzling the amounts, I should as soon think of putting my head in the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the keepers of the Colney-hatch Lunstic<lb/>asylum, and perform duty principally in ward "C"—in March in the present year the deceased, William Swift, was placed under my care in that ward—he was about fifty years of ago I should thing; he might be a little more—he was a large built powerful man, very strong—from that period until Wednesday 9th May, he remainted in the ward under my care—on that evening, in consequence of hearing some noise made by him, I went to the door of the door of the room in which he was and opened it; before I had sufficient time to speak to him, he struck me in the eye and seized me by the necktie—he made use of the words, "I have got you now, you b----"—I found that he was near strangling me; I struck him, and we both fell together—I fell sideways; I could not exactly say how—I knew no more till I was released by Reed—in my struggle with Swift, I did not use any more violence than was absolutely necessary for my own protection—I struck him in the pit of the stomach, just here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the place</hi>); a little to the right as near as I could judge—I saw Swift again that evening, about 8 o'clock, in the same room—he only said, "Good night;" that was all—he did not then make any complaint at all of suffering from any injury—it was my duty on the following morning to unlock the door of the room in which he was—I unlocked it about ten minutes past 6—he showed me a bruise which he had on his stomach—he did not complain of any pain or suffering—the bruise was where I pointed before—he did not at that time appear to me to be under any suffering at all in breathing, or in any other way—he made no complaint at all, only showing me the bruise—it was his habit to sweep that ward—he applied to me about half-past 6 for a broom to sweep the ward down as usual—I thought proper not to give it him—I saw him about the ward that morning, the same as usual; he took his breakfast as usual—he was out in the airing-court as usual; he came in and had his dinner the same as usual—it was 1 o'clock when they sat down—after dinner I went down with him to No. 11 ward, and there I left him—that was by Dr. Tyerman's direction—what had taken place the previous night had been reported in the morning—during the whole of that morning, up to the time of my removal of him to No. 11, he did not exhibit any symptoms at all of distress or suffering, or make any complaint at all.</p>

I am an attendant at the Colney Hatch Asylum, and was so on 9th May last—I recollect being called by one of the patients to the assistance of Gann—I went into the room where Gann and Swift were—I found Gann lying down on the floor and the patient had got him fast by the throat, by the necktie, and had one knee on the floor—I took hold of his hand and said, "Leave go, Swift," and he let go immediately—this was between 6 and 7 o'clock, or it might be a little after 7—before I left the room with Gann I desired Swift to go to bed—he did so in my presence—I said, "Swift, go to bed," and he went to bed directly—he was undressed—he had nothing on but his shirt—he got into bed directly—I saw him after<lb/>wards at 8 o'clock; he was then in bed—he did not get up at all, or make any complaint to me—I did not notice anything peculiar in his breathing—I did not go into his room—I unlocked the door and saw him lying in bed—I spoke to him; I bade him good night—he said, "Good night, old fellow," or something similar to that—I saw him again on the subsequent morning, between 6 and 7 o'clock, sitting in the recess in No. 5.—he was dressed; he had dressed himself—I did not speak to him then—nobody had dressed him that I know of—I never knew any one to dress him—he did not make any complaint to me then—he said to me, as I was walking up the gallery, "Charley, it was a lucky job for him that you came last night; if you had not I should have killed him"—I cannot say whether he appeared to have his breathing affected at that time, or to walk with any difficulty—I did not notice anything—I saw him again that day—I believe he was shifted that day—I saw him after six o'clock that day—I cannot say that he had anything the matter with him at the different time I saw him.</p>

I am one of the head attendants at the Colney Hatch Asylum—I recollect Swift being in the asylum—I saw him on Saturday afternoon, 12th May, between 4 and 5 o'clock, to the best of my remembrance—he was then in the airing court—I observed nothing beyond his usual manner—he came up, as he invariably would, and accosted me in his usual style—he spoke, amongst other things, of having killed 300 Catholics—it was a general delusion of his, and he almost invariably entered on that topic—he was not more than two minutes speaking to me; merely in passing through the court—there was nothing about his walking that I noticed, as if he was in pain—I did not notice when he spoke to me, that there was any affection in his breathing—he did not make any complaint of any kind to me—I had not seen him the day before.</p>

I am a physician and am medical super<lb/>intendent of Grove Hall Lunatic Asylum at Bow—I have had two lunatic patients of the names of Clark and Varney under my care for rather more than a month—they are in attendance to day—Clark is the subject of delusions—in my opinion he is capable of giving a correct narration of matters and facts which occur under his observation, within his sight—he is capable of giving a correct account of matters that took place before his eyes—I consider Varney to be competent to give a correct account of matters that came under his personal observation.</p>

               <p>as he was coming in, and said he had been waiting for him, as he could not keep Swift out of the ward; Mr. Slater immediately said, "We had better have him in at once"—they took Swift into the ward and threw him down, by catching him by the collar and tripping his feet from under him—Vivian did that—he tripped his legs from under him—he fell on his back—they then kicked him, and punched him—and jumped on him with their knees, and stamped with the foot on his chest; here (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—they put him into the padded room after that—they went in—I could then hear the noise of their ill-treatment, and him calling out—it might be about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes that it lasted—I heard him call out "Murder!" once; and he was calling out not to be kicking of him, ill-using him in that way—as I went in from the airing court I saw him in an inclined position—he was in the padded room—I went from the airing court into the ward—I could then see into the padded room—Slater and Vivian were there then—I saw Slater's hand on his head, and he drew up his legs as though to shift his position—Slater just looked round towards the door as if there should be a rush by the patients from the noise that was made; it could have been heard all over the build<lb/>ing—Slater had his hand on Swift's head, and looked round towards the door—Vivian was on his left, standing erect—Swift was lying in his back with his face towards the airing court, and as the patients came in he drew up his legs—the patients came in from the airing court; that was the ward for them to come in; Slater said, "We had better have them in as it will be heard all over the building"—he gave the word immediately for "All in"—I went into a recess and sat down—I did not see anything more—Inever saw Swift again—when he was put into the padded room he was partly undressed—his trousers were down—he took off his stockings, shoes, coat, waiscoat, braces, and handkerchief—I did not see whether he was more undressed than that before Slater and Vivian left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and medical superintendent of the Coloney Hatch Lunatic Asylum—in the early part of May last there was a patient named Swift under my care—he was one of those who are considered dangerous lunatics—I remember his being moved on 10th May, I think, to No. 11 ward—it is a long building, perhaps 150 or 160 feet in length, with a recess in the centre of it towards the west, and a large exercise or airing court, into which one of the doors of the ward opens—during the day the patients would be in different parts of that ward, over the whole of that space.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, in fact, the refractory ward? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; it is one quarter of the establishment which is appropriated for the effectual manage<lb/>ment of very refractory patients—the recess is under cover—it forms part of the ward.</p>

               <p>May—I know I was in that quarter of the establishment once or twice—I do not recollect seeing him at this distance of time—I recollect seeing him on more than one occasion before his death—I did not at that time feel his pulse, not in the interval from the time he had been removed into No.11 ward—I heard of the attack he made upon Gann—on Saturday evening, the 12th Slater came to may residence and gave me information—it would take a minute or two to get to my residence from the asylum—he came between half-past 7 and a quarter to 8—he told me that the patient Swift was very ill, if not already deceased—he led me to suppose that his state of danger was so great, that I might possibly find him dead when I got there—he said that Swift was very ill, having had a fit, I think—I immediately accompanied Slater to the padded room, and found Swift lying upon the mattress, straight out upon his back, with his night-clothing on, dead—there was no contraction of the muscles or anything of that kind, he was quite straight out—I observed on mark of external violence on the right side of the stomach, a large bruise—Slater stated that he had fallen in a fit in the ward—I asked some particulars about the fit, of Slater and Vivian—I asked them on the circumstances of his death, and they told me that he had a fit—I am not quite sure at this time whether there were not two fits described—I think so—I am pretty certain it was first stated that he had a fit from which he partially recovered, and appeared better, and that then he appeared worse and was palced in bed—I am not clear what was said about another fit—I do not distinctly recollect whether it was worse I am sure, and then was palced in bed—it would be my duty to make a report of any matter of that kind-Slater and vivian said it was an epileptic fit—the post mortern examination was made on the following Monday morning in my presence—they told me they left him to attend to the other patients, who were then, I think, at supper—they both agreed as to that—I forget which first stated it—there are so many thousand fits occuring in the course of the year that it would be impossible to fetch a medical man to every individual fit that occurs to an epileptic—there are, perhaps, 30,000 or 40,000 in the course of a year, in one department alone; but if any extraordinery circumstances appear, if the fit does not pass off, and if there is any danger, it is the duty of the attendant to fetch a medical man—during the time Swift had been under my care he had not suffered from epilepsy to my knowledge—I think I have recollection enough of the post-mortem examination the answer you the particulars—a great portion of the arch of the chest was frac<lb/>tured on both sides, across the sternum—there were several ribs on each side broken and the breast-bone was also broken across—the sternum is the centre of the chest, and that was fractured across, about the centre—there were two slight ruptures of the liver—there was an extravasation of blood in the abdomen to the extent of two or three pints, I presume coming from the ruptured liver—there was no appearance of inflammation in the liver—with regard to the chest we found some serous effusion into it which was evidence of a certain amount of excitement in the membrane, the pleura<lb/>that was in the pleural cavity; the cavity at the side of the chest—there was an effusion of serous fluid into the chest which was tinged with blood—there was no symptom of inflammation about the lungs—I should say that the fracture of the arch of the chest down on each side and across was not ac<lb/>compamied</p>

               <p>by displacement of the bone—there was no depression of the bone, no fragments of bone pressing on the lungs; there was no manifest appearance that the bone had at any time penetrated—the nature of the matter that was deposited, of which there was an effusion, was a blood<lb/>tinged fluid; at all events tinged with the colouring particles or colouring matter of the blood—it was reddish, blood-stained—that was in the chest—it was on one side of the chest here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to his own chest</hi>), the cavity which contains the lungs—I could tell you by looking at my notes on which side it was—I made these notes at the moment of the post-mortem examination on the Monday following the death of the patient—I had not then heard of any complaint against the prisoners in reference to this paticular case—I had heard of the attack upon Gann by the patient and nothing more—I had not heard of any alleged attack by these two persons in the most remote degree—these notes were all made at the same time—probably this first memo<lb/>randum might have been made before I went into the autopsy room, but just at the moment, (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>:) "William Swift, aged 54, admitted apparently paralysed, 24th February, 1860—recovered to a great extent and became stout and muscular—epilepsy—evening of May 12th, died between 7 and 8 p.m.—married—a labourer—great violence—lately attempted to throttle master of workhpuse of Aldgate, and also and attendant Gann, at Colney Hatch"—I did not get any of the particulars I have just read from the pri<lb/>soners—now I come to the autopsy<lb/>"Right ribs 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th; left 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th; echymosis of left costal pleura"—that means the external portion of the pleura—"An effusion of three ounces of sanguineous fluid in right pleural cavity; echymosis of right costal pleura; sternum fractured across the centre; lungs cretefied, tubercles of right sper, generally healthy and moderately collapsed"—that refers to the lungs—"Heart not well contracted; right side empty; left side also empty and not well contracted; a layer of blood in the under mudiastinum—abdomen, a large quantity of partly coagulated blood in the abdominal cavity—liver, laceration two inches long, not deep, at the anterior surface of left lobe of the liver; slight superficial laceration on right lobe; mark on the right face and neck and lower part of right ear; bruise and ecchymosis underneath the abdominal integuments at right of umbilico; slight bruise onn right wrist; outer side—brain, before dissection 55 3/4 ounces, after, 54 3/4 "—there is the figure of "I" which implies that there was a loss of one ounce of fluid passed into the liver from old disease of that organ—the heart was wholly un<lb/>touched by any fractured bone—it did not appear to have been touched.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you, previously to coming here to-day, shown these minutes to the attorney for the prosecution or to any one on the part of the prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I read my evidence from these notes before Mr. Henry, the magistrate at Bow-stret—I had the book in my hand at the time—I have not been asked for it; as far as I am aware no one on the part of the prosecution has looked at these minutes at all, nor asked to loook at them—this form of paralysis would affect the patient so as to make him more insensible to pain; I think it always does so to a greater or less extent, paralysing the nerves—the nerves are in a peculiar condition under this form of paralysis; I should explain that it is not the ordinary form of paralysis, but a form almost entirely peculiar to the insane—during the first appearance of these symptoms, it is not necessarily accompanied by any want of physical power in the body, but it is accompanied by a want of regulation of that power; there is a want of regulation of the muscular move<lb/>ment—it undoubtedly makes the person more insensible to pain—at times</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170037"/>
               <p>I think perfectly so—they do not under that state manifest evidence of pain under severe injuries, fractures—I have known cases of patients with that form of insanity endeavouring to go about their ordinary occupation with broken limbs of bones, and also in another form associated with epilepsy, in a way that a sane person could not do—I have known that occur in Colney Hatch Asylum with persons whose ribs I have subsequently discovered to have been broken—I have noticed and reported such cases, and carefully attended to them for the purposes of science; I remember the case of a person there who fractured the left clavicle or collar-bone, and he did not appear to suffer the least pain; he moved his arm almost as freely as before, somewhat to my astonishment—a sane person could not have done that—there is a wide dif<lb/>ference between the two—I remember another patient who, in kicking at the door of the padded room, fractured the left patella or knee-cap; he walked about with a considerable amount of facility a few days afterwards without any apparent pain whatever; that could not have been done by a person perfectly sane and having the usual amount of feeling, not in a state of sobriety, a person intoxicated might possibly do so; the nervous system alters—I remember a patient dying rather suddenly from collapse; at the post-mortem examination I found that several ribs were fractured, they were comparatively recent fractures, I mean wihtin a few days of his death; between the time of the accident and his death I saw that man walking about in his usual way—he made no complaint; on the contrary, on the morning of the day he died he said he was quite well; upon further post-mortem examination extensive fractures of the ribs on both sides were disclosed, and injury to the pleura—nothing whatever was known of it up to the time of his death—the cause of all that, occurred three or four days before—an inquest was held in that case—I have known repeated cases where patients have suffered injuries of this description without any appearance of pain—I have been connected with lunatic asylums for twenty years, as superintendent of the Cornwall Lunatic Asylum and that at Colney Hatch, and during that period I have seen many cases—such cases are con<lb/>stantly occurring under the eyes of most scientific men—Dr. Forbes Winslow is an authority on these matters—the paralysis of which I have been speaking is a form which supervenes upon insanity—I have been in court during the greater part of the day—I have heard the description of the violence said to have been exhibited by the prisoners to the deceased immediately before his death—I do not think it could possibly have taken place without leaving some mark upon the external system, beyond the mere bruise that I discovered—a single blow may cause death without leaving any external mark—I should not expect that a great number of very heavy blows and kicks, such as have been described, could be inflicted without leaving any external mark—the immediate cause of death was h✗morrhage from the liver, producing collapse—if the bones were fractured on the Wednesday without being displaced, a fall on the Saturday, in con<lb/>sequence of a fit, would tend to displace them more than if they had not been previously fractured—the ruptures of the liver were not in the imme<lb/>diate vicinity of the fractures—there were two normal ruptures—I should suppose that the liver would be more likely to be ruptured in consequence of losing the protection of the frame-work—I could trace a connexion between the bruise on the upper part of the abdomen, and the disruption of the liver—there might be a possible associated between the two in this way, that a very heavy blow upon the abdomen might cause rupture of the liver—I believe it possible that the bones may have been broken on the</p>

               <p>Wednesday—if a heavy blow was struck under the breast-bone on the Wednesday, and then a fall immediately took place, that would lead me to consider that the bones might have been broken on the Wednesday—there was nothing in the result of the post-mortem examination to prevent my believing that—the crushing in of the chest might have occurred with greater case after the first fractures, and that might of course lead to rupture of the liver; might facilitate it raterh; it might happed at the same time—the wtness, Clark, has been under my eye during the whole time he has been there—I think he is not a creduble witness—if he came and told me any ordinary matter, I should sift it before I believed it—I have found him con<lb/>stabtly subject to delusions—I cannot say that I remember much of the particular delusion as to being poisoned—in conversation with him I have found him uttering a great number ofdelusions—Varney is also subject to delusions—I should not in any matter of my own, or if I were on a jury, rely upon either of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the senior surgeons of King's Col<lb/>lege Hospital, and am also Professor of Anatomy—I have been so for twenty years or more—I have been in Court during the whole of the evidence, and I have heard the condition described upom the post-mortem examination of the deceased—taking that as the basis of my opinion, I believe the proximate cause of death to have been collapse; fainting, arising either from the loss of blood from the the liver, or the effect that a very severe accident of any kind always had on the nervous system—supposing the injuries described on the chest, the ribs that were broken, and the sternum, to have taken place on the Wednesday, I do not believe that that person could have walked about, eaten, his meals, and appeared to be in good health up to the Saturday; I do not believe it to be possible—I understand that aboput eleven ribs were broken, besides the breast-bone, and that a great part of the chest was injured; that would consequently impede the breathing, therefore there would be a change very obsefvable in the mode of breathin, and dependant upon that would also be a chagne in the pulse—it would probably by hard, provided he had recovered from the immediate effect of the accident, the collapse, which must be presumed if he had lived for a day or two after—the effect on the breath would show itself externally, thus (<hi rend="italic">descrubing it</hi>)—we breathe with regularity, a certain number of times in a minute, with more or less tran<lb/>quillity</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170041"/>
               <p>but there would be a diffuculty in drawing his breath if the walls of the chest, the ribs, were extensively broken, and especially if the breast<lb/>bone were broken; and itr would exhibit itself externally in the way I have described—I should call it a panting, a hard and struggling breathing—it would not prevent his eating his food—the same appearance of breathing would be visible during the time of his eating—that appearance of breath<lb/>ing would be continuous—it is not such an appearance I think as to escape the attention of a medical man—I heard, likewise, of the rupture of the liver, and the extravasation of blood in the abdomen—supposing it to have occurred on the Wednesday I think that quantity could not have been dis<lb/>coverable; the liver may be ruptured to the slight degree I heard without any very manifest symptoms, but if I recollect rightly about two pounds, that is, about two pints, of blood were lost out of the liver—I cannot come to any very distinct conclusion on that point, as to when it was done—those injuries were inflicted, I should think, shortly before the death, perhaps a few hours, certainly, I should say, not more than a few hours—with these par<lb/>ticular injuries a lunatic, or a person in any condition of body, would not be able to alter the state of his breath—the difference between the mode in which a lunatic sustains an accident is this, that a lunatic having broken his collar-bone, or his thigh, or his arm, say his thigh, will do what a sane person will not do, attempt to stand upon it; and if the limb is capable of sustaining him he may do so, or he may make a blow with his broken arm, and he does not manifest any sense of pain, but if his tongue is cut, or his chest is broken in, that is, his sense of talking or breathing, then his lunacy would not help him to carry on the functions of his body any more than in the case of a sane person—the puse would be different if the loss of blood had taken place at once; if it had been gradual loss it might not—it was a very slight wound of the liver, which is an organ that bleeds very profusely when injured—if the loss had been gradual it might not have affected his pulse manifestly, but if it had taken place within the moment, the half hour or so on, it would affect it—supposing injuries of that kind had occurred on the Wednesday and the death on the Saturday, I should undoubtdly have expected to find symptoms of inflammation—that applies both to the injuries of the chest and liver, but more especially to the chest.</p>

               <p>would observe it; any intelligent person would—within a couple of days or so it produces an uncontrollable tendency to cough, the irritation is so great and uncontrollable, even by a person suffering under the form of paralysis which induces the absence of pain—notwithstanding all those con<lb/>ditions, I still think that an ordinary person would obseve the difference; these are involuntary muscles and not paralysed by the kind of palsy so described—supposing the system of the chest to be broken and not displaced, I should say a patient would not feel any difficulty in sitting down or getting up—I do not think a sane person would move about much; how far a lunatic would do so, I cnnot say—I have seen accidents occurring to lunatics brought into hospitals, but have had no further practice amongst lunatics—a person may break two or three ribs or more and be almost un<lb/>conscious of it; it depends upon the rib—I should not like to venture to define very accurately how much of the sternum or how many of the ribs may be broken without the person betraying these symptoms; but the breaking of a breast-bone is a very different thingt from the breaking of a rib—I think that the sternum is searcely ever broken without the ribs being broken; I never saw it—I should not like to say how many ribs might be broken without showing the symptoms; a great point is finding so many ribs broken—I do not know of an instance of the breast-bone being broken without the ribs, except by one shock—assuming the breast-bone or one or two ribs to be broken on the Wednesday, it might happed that from a little extra violence, a fall or anything of that sort, the rest would follow and the other ribs would go; it would be more likely; it would depend upon where the breast-bone was broken—supposing the main bone of the breast to be broken through and one or two ribs to have gone with it, the rest would be more likely to break from want of support—I never saw the breast-bone broken without considerable innury to the ribs; I do not con<lb/>ceive it could be broken alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the evidence of the number of kicks, the stamping, and the blows of the fist, do you think all that could have occurred without leaving any marks at all externally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen such extraordinary injuries without any external sign, that, although I should certainly have expected there would have been marks seen, I would not say that it was impossible, but I should have expected marks on his body—if it was pos<lb/>sible with one blow, every additional blow would render it more impro<lb/>bable—I think the effect of the kicking would be more likely to be seen than the stamping.</p>

                  </hi>. I am vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons and senior surgeon at the London Hospital—I am also surgeon to St. Luke's Hospital for lunatics—I have been connected with that hospital for forty years—in the course of my duties at the London Hospital some 10,000 or 12,000 accidents come under my observation in the course of a year, they do not all come under my observation—I have heard the medical evidence in this case and the description of the post mortem appearances—in my judgment the injuries that I have heard detailed were the proximate cause of death; I include the whole of the injuries collectively—I think it not probable that those injuries were inflicted on the Wednesday, he not suffe<lb/>ring in the interval between the Wednesday and Saturday—I should say they were inflicted at no considerable period before death; I mean a few hours before death, so that there was not a sufficient interval for inflammatory disease to occur—I have heard Mr. Tucker state that be felt the man's pulse at 1 o'clock on the day of his death, and that it was then in a healthy con<lb/>dition—I do not think that is at all consistent with the previous infliction of such injuries as these—the injuries to the sternum and ribs would most undoubtedly cause a perceptible effect upon the respiration—I have heard the evidence of Mr. Partridge, and, in the main, I agree with it—I believe that insane persons can conceal pain or not feel it; but as regards the dis<lb/>turbance of functions, I think they cannot conceal it.</p>

Hoare's—I miss a leaf from my blank cheque-book—the cheque which was produced is the same number and the same appearance—the entire leaf is taken out—I did not join it into the book, because it has been cut or torn afterwards, and would not have fitted—part of the counterfoil was left when it was pro<lb/>duced—on the Saturday morning, at 12 o'clock, the prisoner went out and never came back—I was not in the least aware that she was going to leave—my cheque book was kept sometimes in a drawer, and sometimes in a desk, both of which were locked—the prisoner may have got access to my keys—Crouch left my service on 7th June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, and keep a shop—I reside at 16, New-street, Dorset-square—I think this affair took place on the morning of 23d August last—I had fastened up my shop the night before, it was all quite safe—my attention was called to it in the morning—I saw it safe at 11 o'clock the night before—from a knocking at the door I came down into my shop on the morning of the 23d, some time before 6 o'clock—the door of the shop into the street was open, and also a kind of trap-door through which the shutters are passed—it is a circular window, and at the lower part of the window there are two small doors that take the width of the window; the shutters are kept under there during the day—if a man gets through that he could get into the shop, and then he could open the shop door—the bolt of this trap-door was inside—it had been forced—I bave seen the articles contained in this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my property—the handkerchief is mine that they are wrapped in—this bag is also mine—they are all my property—they were perfectly safe in my shop on the night before this door was broken into.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, of Southampton-row, Holloway-road—On Saturday night, 8th September, the prisoner came in between 10 and 11 o'clock—he was shaved—I attended to him—when he got up he took the paper to read—he was standing near the gas-light and his cap caught fire—a customer told him of it and her said he would punch his head—I told him to go about his business, as I would not have customers insulted—he went out and came in again and insulted me, and said he would punch my head—he knocked me down—I get up again and tried to get him out of the shop—after a scuffle I got him out, and in the scuffle we both went down together—I was underneath, and he took my nose with his teeth and bit a small piece off the end—there was a piece of it fone—I called to my young man, and he came and pulled him off—I got up and he struck me again—I went in my shop, and he ran in the shop and knocked me down again—my nose bled and he ripped my shirt all to pieces.</p>

I live at 4, Matthew-street, Highbury-vale—I was in the prosecutor's shop when this affair took place—it was between half-past 10 and 11 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there; he stood reading the newspaper, with his back to the gas—his cap caught fire, and the gentleman who was being shaved said, "Your cap is too near the gas"—the prisoner put up his hand and his cap was on fire, and he began to call the gentleman every<lb/>thing he could think of—Mr. Hughes said, "I can't allow such language in my shop on Saturday night; you had better go out"—he went out of the shop and came in again and said, "You take it up, Mr. Barber"—Mr. Hughes said, "You had better go out or I shall put you out"—the prisoner said, "I will knock you down"—Mr. Hughes put his hand to his breast and pushed him out of the shop, and they both fought together just outside the door—I cannot tell what transpired outside, but Mr. Hughes came in again and was bleeding profusely from the nose—he said, "He has bitten me in the nose"—I saw it was bleeding profusely—I did not see any more after that, for I left—the door was open—the prisoner did not come in again, bat Mr. Hughes did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post Office—on 15th August, in consequence of information I received, I went to 28, Little Britain—I went there because the prisoner stated he had lately lodged there—he was asked in the office, in my presence, where he lodged, and I heard him say that he had lately lodged at 28, Little Britain—I went into the second floor front-room and found Eliza Vincent—I saw her unlock a box and saw the police constable, Upfold, take from it a letter-carrier's uniform coat; and from the same box in which that coat was, I saw him take this small box—he handed it to me—I opened it and found that it contained the gold geneva watch-case that has been produced—in consequence of what Eliza Vincent said, I took the box and case to the General Post Office in the same state that I found it—I there showed it to the prisoner—I told him where it had been found and that Eliza Vincent had stated to me that he gave it to her about five or six months ago—his reply was, "Yes, it's mine; I gave it to the young woman a long time ago"—he was then asked where he got it—he stated that he had bought it of a Jew in Mr. Reeve's public-house, Pope's-head-alley, Lombard-street, and that he gave 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he was then asked if it was in the same state as it now is, with the spring broken which fastens the inner case to the outer case—he stated yes, and that he bought it with the intention of having some works put into it—he was then asked if any one was present at the time he bought it—he stated that he went into the public-house with another letter-carrier named Fox, to have a glass of ale, but whether Fox had left at the time he made the purchase he could not tell, but he rather thought that he had—the prisoner was a letter-carrier in the office, doing what is called messenger's duty, that is, stamping and collecting letters in the office—he was suspended—on 18th August I went in search of him, and met him in Alderagate-street—I brought him back to the Post Office; he was then told that the gold watch-case had been sent in a letter by the post—he stated that he had bought it of a Jew, as he had pre<lb/>viously stated—I then took him to Mr. Reeve's public-house and he pointed out the barmaid, who, he said, was present when he bought it—her name is Berryman—I spoke to her and afterwards told the prisoner that she knew him by sight from coming to the house, but that she had no recollection of the circumstance; neither had she ever seen a Jew in the house selling gold watch-cases—the prisoner's answer was, "Very likely she did not see me"—pointing to a seat on the right of the bar, he said, "That is where the purchase took place"—he was then taken into custody—the barmaid said that there was a little Jew used to come there hawking about ticketd of watches, and selling gilt pins.</p>

                  </hi>. I am messenger in the service of Messrs. Atkins and Son, of 62, Fleet-street—I live there—about a quarter past 10, on the night of 15th August, I was about to enter the private door in Bouverie-street in order to go home—it was raining, and the female prisoner came and asked me to lend her my umbrella—I refused, and said I wanted it myself—I went to the back of the premises to look at the fastenings of the shutters—she came round there and asked me again for my umbrella—I told her to go away, for I did not want to have anything to say to her—I then put my hand up to the shutters, and she began to fumble me about—I said, "If you don't go away, I shall give you in charge"—my watch was, at that time, loose in my waistcoat pocket, with the chain inside the pocket where she was fumbling—she then went away—I put my hand to my pocket and found my watch was gone—I was going to run after her, when I was collared by a man, perhaps a couple of yards from where I was standing at the shutters, and not more than two or three seconds after the woman had gone off—I put my hand to my pocket instantly—the man said, "You ought to be prosecuted"—I called out "Police," immediately—he said, "You ought to be prosecuted," before I I called "Police"—he did not say why—he ran away directly I called out—he held me about two or three seconds; his holding me impeded me from going after the woman—I did not see her when I got into Bouverie-street—I cannot say whether the man ran or walked away—I saw a policeman standing opposite Bouverie-street, on the other side of Fleet-street—in consequence of what I said to him, he went down Bouverie-street and brought the woman back—he said to me, "Is this the woman?" I said, "Yes, that I will swear;" and that instant, she put the watch into my hand, and said, "Here is your watch, you won't lock me up?" in the presence of the policeman—I locked her up—when I attended the police-court the next day, I saw Alger in the gallery of the Court sitting there as one of the audience—Cole was then in court—I pointed Alger out to the police—I had an opportunity of seeing his features when he collared me, I looked him right in the face—there was no light except the gas-lamp the other side of Bouverie-street—there was sufficient light to enable me to see him—I have not the least doubt that he is the man—the Magistrate asked me to look round and see if I could see the man—I did so, and in about half a minute I pointed him out.</p>

I am a cane maker, residing at Friars Mount, Bethnal Green—On Sunday Morning, 2d September, about 1 o'clock I was at Mr. Craigge's house at Friars Mount—a person named Waring came to the door and asked me to direct some person the way to Whitechapel Church—I went up to the prisoner, who was standing a little way from Mr. Waring's door, and asked him where he wanted to go to—he said "I want to go to Whitechapel Church"—I told him the way to it—he said, "When I get to Whitechapel Church, how far am I off from Whitechapel-street?"—I directed him—then he asked me for Church-street, Bethnal Green—I told him, and with that he turned round and called me a b—liar, and a thing, or something of that sort—he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand and made a blow at me with his fist, and in return, I struck him back—he said he would cut my b—throat, and he put his hand to his right hand pocket—I ran from him directly, into my own passage—he followed me—I did not have time to bolt the door, he forced it open again, and by forcing it open he slipped, and I jumped out into the road—he directly gave me a blow over the left eye; I don't know what with—I hallooed out that I had been stabbed—the blood came from my left eye very bad—Mr. Waring came up, and I asked him to take me to a doctor's—the prisoner did not run far, he only went on to the pavement—Mr. Waring and I went down to Church-street to find a doctor—I was taken to the police-station, and there attended to by a doctor—I afterwards gave the prisoner in custody—whilst I was at the police-station the prisoner turned round and said, "I say, old fellow, if I had been sober I should have blinded you."</p>

               <p>I then crossed over the road to go home—there were two girls opposite—West was with me, and his brother, and another young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, Charles Austin—we met two females—Jane Booty was one of them, the other was another one that was with them—West spoke to Polly—there were only the two girls there then—he said, "How are you, Polly?"—I could not exactly say what answer she made, for I was standing on the kerb, and <hi rend="italic">up</hi> came the foreigner—the woman that he spoke to was not in company with any man at that moment—the foreigner came running up round the corner when she was spoken to—that man is not here; he is gone to sea, I believe—he said to West, "What are you doing with my girl?"—West said, "I don't want your girl, I am doing nothing with her," and that caused the disturbance—then West's brother ran up, and he and the foreigner had a fight—then up ran a lot more; the male prisoner was one amongst them—there was a general fight, four of them and four of us, or it might have been five—while the fight was going on both the female prisoners said, "Use your b—y knives"—they were all together—they did not speak to me; they were speaking to the foreigners, of whom Nicholls was one—Nicholls and West were on the ground then, I saw them fall—at that time I was not engaged in the conflict, I was standing looking on—I saw those two men down and then I heard West say he was stabbed—there was only Nicholls and West together then—I ran up to them to give assistance, and I was stabbed by the man that has gone to sea, Emanuel I think his name is—there was no one near West but Nicholls at the time he called out that he was stabbed—they were on the ground together—there were two gas-lights—I think the public-houses were just closing—there are two gas-lights almost on the spot—I was stabbed on the left side, through the jacket—it was a serious wound—I was in the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hospital—on Sunday, 29th July, West and Shrewsbury were brought there, about half-past 11 o'clock—West was wounded in the chest—it was about an inch long, aud it appeared to penetrate to the sternum, but by passing my finger, it passed obliquely into the muscle, severing the cartilage at the fifth, or sixth rib—that wound was very dangerous indeed to life—I could not ascertain whether the lungs were wouuded, but I have no doubt they were—with caution he is out of danger—I saw only one stab on West—this knife is just the very thing I should think that would inflict such a wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Kirby-street, Snow-fields, and am a night watchman to Henry Grey, a lighterman of Water-lane—on the afternoon of the 23d August, I went to the London Docks, to the Shadwell basin, to look after the lighter Kenmtt—she is the property of Henry Grey—I went on board between twenty minutes and half-past 8; there was nobody on the barge then—it was laden with ten hogsheads of rum—I bad been there about ten minutes when I heard a footstep on the gunwale of the barge, and I asked who was there—the officer replied, "It is me;" that is, Wenman, he is a Custom-house officer—I knew he had gone to take charge of the rum—he went about half-past 3 in the afternoon—Wenman then came down into the cabin and said, "Are you going to stop here?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have a friend on deck; I am going for a few minutes," and went out, of the cabin—he returned in a short time and said, "Are you going to stop all night?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I don't think it is any use me stopping, I think I will go home "—I said, "That you can do as you please about; I am not going to leave charge of the craft"—he said, "My friend does not go away till 10 o'clock," and went out oi the cabin—he had been gone some little time and came back and said, "It is'only now about half-past 9"—he stopped ten minutes or a little more and then said, "I will now bid you good-night"—I saw no more of him till he was in custody on the quay—I had one other lighter to look after, a barge called the <hi rend="italic">Elbe</hi>, laden with flour—I was not always on board the <hi rend="italic">Kennett</hi>—I did not see Brownson till I saw him in custody on the quay—I went an shore to have a look at my other barge—Cooper called me; I went up to him and he asked me what I bad there—I said a barge loaded with sugar, rum, and molasses—the prisoners were both there and could hear that—he asked me if I knew either of them—I said, "Yes, I know Wenman; he has charge of the barge"—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "They have got some rum about them"—I was detained on the quay till the inspector came—I did not take any rum; nobody could come on the barge without Wenman's knowledge—he showed himself about four times—there was nobody on board the barge when I went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Charles Lloyd of 21, Coventry-street, tobacconist—this that I am looking at is in my own writing; made at the time—the prisoner Shine called at my shop, with another person who is not here, and asked to see some of the finest cigars that we had—I took them upstairs and showed them some—the other one said he hoped I would show him something very fine and very choice, for he would be a very large customer—I then showed him some cigars—Shine looked at them and selected three boxes—he gave me his card—it has been destroyed; I can't remember who destroyed it—it was lying about for some time in the shop—I have made search for it; I have not been able to find it—on the card was, "J. Stanley and Co., Commission Agents, 9, Duke-street, Westminster"—Shine told me that if I would send them about 6 o'clock he would be there to receive them and pay for them—I afterwards gave them to Pullen, who did not bring them back—next morning I went at 10 o'clock to 9, Duke-street, Westminster, to receive the money—I knocked at the door, tried the handle, and found it was locked—the place is let out in offices—I knew the place before—I have known the neighbour<lb/>hood some time—I never was in that place before—I knocked at the door on this occasion—Keeling opened it; I had never seen him before—I presented the bill and asked him if Mr. Stanley was there—he told me that he had not arrived—I then told him that that was an untruth, because I had seen him pass from the front office into some room at the back—he said that it was a friend of Mr. Stanley's—I told him that unless he went into the room and fetched him out I should go in myself and see—Keeling then went to the door and Shine came out—it was Shine whom I had seen go into the other room—he gave the name of Stanley—when he came out he made no end of promises—there were so many that I can't remember the whole of them—Keeling and Shine and the person who was with Shine at the shop when they ordered the cigars, and who also came out, all three told me that if I would call in an hour and a half I should have the money—they did not all use exactly the same words—as near as I can remember, it was that if I would go away and call again in an hour's time I should have the money—they each came out, one at a time, and said, "If you call is an hour," and the others said very nearly the same, and afterwards Keeling said, "If you will go away and come in three minutes you shall be paid"—I asked them why they wished me to go away; Shine said because they expected some one to call there to pay some money, and they did not want them to see any one waiting in the passage—I was sitting on one of the chairs in the, passage—Keeling at first asked me to stop there—some one came into the front office, and he asked me to step into the passage—the front office was furnished with about a couple of chairs, a table, and one or two bottles; it did not appear to me to be at all a place of business—I said I could not go away without the goods or the money—Shine said if I would go with him to the City, he would call on his bankers and pay me—that was after they had asked me to go away for five minutes—I went with Shine to the City by the steamboat—none of the others accompanied me—he took me to Thames-street, St. Dunstan's-hill, he did not take me to any banker's—he went into this place in Thames-street, and said he should most likely get the money, and that if he got it he would pay me—I stopped in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170105"/>
               <p>the passages—the place was let out in offices—there was some name up—he was in there about ten or twelve minutes—when he came out he said he had not got the money, and then he told me that if I followed him any farther he would give me in custody—I told him that he could not possibly do that, as he had invited me to go with him—he told me that he had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I would go with him to the Dublin Steam Wharf, Smithfield, I think it was, he had a consignment of goods there, that he would have to pay a small sum of money, and that he would give me the difference; if not he would give me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and call and see my employer, and try to make some arrangement with him—on our way to Tower Hill he showed me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they were sovereigns and some silver—he got into a Hansom cab—I told him I would take that if he would call and see Mr. Lloyd with me—I got into the cab with him—he told the cabman to drive as fast as he could to East Smithfield—we went there, to the Dublin Steam Wharf, and. made some inquiries about goods consigned to him, which they knew nothing at all about—I heard them say so in his presence—I applied for the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately we came out, and he promised that he Would come with me to Mr. Lloyd and pay the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we got into a boat to come back—he promised to come out at one or two piers, and at last he said he could not come, and would not come—I asked him to get out at Blackfriara, and Waterloo, and also Hungerford, being the nearest piers—he said he should not do apy such thing; he should not go; he should go home—he and I got out at Westminster-bridge—he went home and I went with him, to Duke-street again—Keeling came out and told me that unless I went home he should go down to Mr. Lloyd and make some complaint; with that he went in again, came out again, and started off by himself—I stayed there a few minutes after he had left; I knocked at the door and found that it was not answered, and then I went home to Mr. Lloyd's—Keeling came there afterwards—he went into the counting-house; Mr. Lloyd was there—Keeling told him that he was a friend of Mr. Stanley's, and that the debt should be paid in the course of the day—Mr. Lloyd told him that unless it was, he should enter proceedings against him—those were the words as near as I can recollect—this was all on the morning of 26th May—on the night of 30th August I was sent for, and went to Mr. Bartram's, the pawnbroker's—I there saw the prisoners—I did not see the cigars.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Lloyd, tobacconist, of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Coventry-street—on 25th May Mr. Johnson gave me a parcel of cigars to take to 9, Duke-street, Westminster—I took them there and asked for Mr. Stanley—I saw Keeling—I gave him the cigars with the bill, and he said Mr. Stanley had just gone away with his lady in the carriage into the country to a dinner, and that if I did not leave the cigars he would be very much offended, and very likely would not have them at all—I told him, when I gave them to him, that I could not leave them without the money—I was in the office—there was a rail between us, and he put the cigars over the rails to me into my hands at first—I put them under my arm then, and Shine came rushing out from a back room and told me that Mr. Stanley had told him that there were some cigars coming, that it was all right; that he had nothing to do with them; he was superintendent of the police, and that he was to forward them at once, and that if I did not leave them he would be very much offended—as I had them under my arm he took hold of them and gradually took them from me—he took me regularly off my guard; he said two or three other little things that I can't recollect exactly—he over<lb/>came my scruples, and I left them there—I was not in the shop when they were ordered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor—on 1st August, between 9 and 10 o'clock—in consequence of something Gosling said to me I went up to the prisoner—when I reached the front of the shop I went between her and the shop door—Gosling then said, "This woman has some boots about her"—she then made a movement to go out of the door and I stopped her—I said, "What have you got there?" lifting up her shawl, and I took a pair of boots from off her arm—I think lifting the shawl was partly the act of both—I made a movement to do so and she pulled it on one side—I then saw a pair of boots strung across her arm—I took them off her arm and said, "What must I do to you now? I must give you into custody"—she said, "You must forgive me this time, Mr. Carter" or words to that effect—I then took hold of her and led her through the passage way to Mr. Carter—in passing through the doorway that leads to Mr. Carter's department, she pulled on one side from me, and on turning round I saw Gosling pick up a pair of boots—Gosling said to her, "What, another pair?" they were children's boots—she said nothing—we went in to Mr. Carter—he sent for a constable and she was given into custody—the place where the boots were picked up was not the place where the boots were usually kept—they are kept in another room—boots were never scattered about there—it is some distance from the shoe room—I believe she had a basket with her.</p>

I am a waterman, and live at 18, Parson's-hill, Woolwich—I went to bed at 11 o'clock on the night of 24th August last—I sleep in the front parlour—the house stands back some twenty yards from the street, and there is no thoroughfare past that way at all—there are only four houses stand there, and there is a pathway up to those four houses—a person coming up the pathway can touch the window outside—I can't say that that window was fastened when I went to bed that night; it was shut—I took my trousers off, and put them on the sofa by the side of the window—I had in my pocket three sovereigns and a half, and five shillings, or fifteen shillings, I can't say positively which, in a brown leather bag, and two or three halfpence in another pocket—I got up about half-past 6 o'clock next morning—my trousers were in much about the same place as where I had left them—the first thing that attracted my attention, was, I could not find one of my stockings—it was iu the window, with a small portion of it jammed under the sash—I had left it on the bed—the window must have been moved during the night, or else the stocking could not have got there—a person could get into the room by opening the window—I examined the pockets of my trousers—I found nothing there; the bag and money were all gone—I was not disturbed at all in the night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silversmith, and live at 240, Blackfriars-road, in the parish of Christ Church. On Thursday night, 19th August, after going to bed, I was awoke by my shop lad just before 2 o'clock—in consequence of what he told me I went to the place where he and two other boys slept—the house faces the Blackfriars-road—it is on the left hand side going from the bridge, nearly opposite Stamford-street—a stable-yard runs at the back leading to the place where the boys sleep—there are some leads, by jumping upon which you can get into the stable-yard—I went and stood at the corner of the yard until one of the inspectors arrived—it is no thoroughfare—I then went to the gate at the corner of Alfred-place, and there saw the prisoner and another running up Alfred-place towards the Blackfriars-road—they were from five to seven yards from me—I saw the prisoner, and am sure he is the man—when they saw me they ran back again—thinking they could not escape that way I remained where I was till a constable came—we then went and searched and found a ladder, or pair of steps, placed against the wall of the stable, over which they must have got away—we then examined the back premises, and found that a window-frame had been taken out, and a pans of glass was taken out of the frame—a person by getting in at that window could get into the house—I saw the policeman find a jemmy, an auger, and a piece of wood, near the fanlight of the back shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, residing at Camberwell—I have also a shop ou Brixton hill—I was sleeping at that shop on the night of 20th August last—I went to bed about 11 o'clock—before doing so I secured the shop myself—the shutters were all right, and the jewellery in the window all correct—in the course of the night I was awoke by a sudden crash and noise in the shop—it was between ten minutes and a quarter past 1 o'clock—I observed the time by my clock—I got up instantly and went into the shop—I found the crashing was at the window—I could not see anything outside—from the noise and confusion I hardly knew what to do, but I went to the front door, and before I could open it the parties were gone—they had left this small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> behind, stuck in between the bar and the shutters—I found a number of my watches, I think eleven, lying on the pavement, and this brick, or piece of stone, lying in front of the shop—there were no such stones lying about there, it must have been brought for the purpose—the shutter had marks of the crowbar on it—it was not broken, but driven on one side—half the window was broken in, more than sufficient to enable a person's hand to take the watches—it is a plate-glass window—I shouted out "Police!" as loud as I could—in consequence of something I heard an hour or two afterwards I went to a place opposite to the Somers-road; to a place shown me by the witness, Brazier—Halsey, the policeman, was with me—I there found these two gold watches, a silver watch, and a variety of gold chains—they were just within a fencing close by the foot<lb/>path—Halsey was with me when I found them—these other things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found by the policeman—they are my property, and formed part of the stock that was in my window on the night in question—these tickets were shown to me by Brazier—I can swear to them, they came off the watches.</p>

                  </hi>. I am watchman at some water-works on the Brixton-road—I was on duty, on the morning of 21st August, leading up the rise of Brixton-hill, close to the Somers-road—about a quarter to 1 o'clock I heard a rattle spring—I went to see what it was—when I got to the top of the hill I saw Mr. Monks standing outside his door, with his shop window broken, and part of his property lying on the steps; he was picking it up—it was Mr. Monks' rattle that I had heard spring—I went back again to my watch box, and stopped about a quarter of an hour—I then heard footsteps coming down Somers-road, and presently saw two men come down—they were peeping round the corner of the pier, as if looking to see whether anybody was coming—they directly took arm-in-arm and away they shot—I went after them directly—when I had followed them about twenty yards, I saw some<lb/>body coming up the road, who I thought was a policeman, and I stepped out into the road and collared one of the prisoners, and said, "I shall have you two locked up on suspicion of the robbery"—the policeman came up, and I said to him, "Take these two men in charge on suspicion of the robbery"—Felton said, "You are drunk"—I said, "If I am drunk, I shall not lose you," and we took them to the station—I afterwards showed Mr. Monks the place where I first detained them, and then some property was found—nothing had passed along from the time the rattle sprang until I apprehended the prisoners—I found some property myself, and was with Halsey when he found some—it was found at the spot where I first detained the prisoners, on the rise of Brixton-hill, opposite No. 5—I found these</p>

               <p>tickets in the Tulse-hill road, and I was with Mr. Monks when he found these chains and watches—I had not seen the prisoners in the Tulse-hill road, but you can come from the Tulse-hill road down Somers-road into the Brixton-road—you might go from Mr. Monks' house to the place where I saw the prisoners in about three or four minutes, and in four or five minutes-to the place where I apprehended them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>live at Woolwich—I am a miner—about 2 o'elock on the morning of 12th August, I missed my way—I met the prisoner in Rotherhithe-street, he was dressed as a policeman—I told him I was very tired and sleepy and had missed my way, and asked him if I could go and lie down anywhere for an hour or two—he said the likeliest place he knew was in one of the boats against the water-side—he pointed out a boat to me and I went there and went to sleep; the prisoner left me—when I went to sleep I had a watch and chain—the watch was in my fob and the guard round my neck—I awoke about 4 o'clock—I felt for my watch and it was gone—I walked up the street when I came out of the boat—it was five or ten minutes before I missed my watch—I had not seen or spoken to anybody from the time I left the boat till I missed the watch—as soon as I missed it I turned back and met the prisoner; we bade each other good morning, and he asked me how I had slept—I said I had slept very well, but I had lost my watch—he wanted me to go to the police-station with him, but said he could not go till he had done his duty—we walked up the street together and met a dock-watchman—that was about 5 o'clock—we were talking together a little while, and the prisoner said he wanted to go to a place to case himself—he went away about thirty yards to an old building—I followed him—I asked him if there was a water-closet about there—he said, "No; but I could go anywhere there"—he was buttoning his coat at the time—I walked to the corner of the stable and there saw my watch and guard lying on the ground, about three or four yards from where the prisoner was—I picked it up and said to the prisoner, "I have got the watch, I know your number, and I will go and report you now"—he said nothing to that—I went back to the watchman; while I was with him the prisoner came up—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—I said yes; but I could not look over it; I would go and report him—he begged very hard that I would forgive him and at last I said I would—I told him I had been out all night and I felt cold and wanted a cup of coffee—he asked me to go along with him—I went, but I would not stop to have any coffee, and he directed me to a coffee-house—I went there and he came to me with the watchman—the prisoner paid for three cups of coffee, one for me, one for the watchman, and one for himself, and he went and got some money and gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took it—ten days or a fortnight afterwards I saw the prisoner again—I went to the station house and asked for him, and went with him to a public-house and he gave me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had forgiven him two hours before he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
