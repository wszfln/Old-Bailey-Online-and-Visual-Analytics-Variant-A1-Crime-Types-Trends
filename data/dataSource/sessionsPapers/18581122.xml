                  </hi>. I am a jeweller at 119, Oxford-street. On 14th April, the prisoner came to my shop—he said he had been recommended to me to buy a good lever watch, and he understood that I kept at times very good second-hand watches, and he preferred having a second-hand watch—I said I had not one then, but I knew of one that I thought I could obtain for him—he stated that he was Dr. Rees, professor of chemistry at the University, at all the Colleges, pointing in the direction of Gower-street, where the London University is—he did not name any particular College—I asked him if he knew several parties—he said yes; he knew Dr. Bachoffner, and Mr. Pepper, and several others—he said he would call again in a few days, which he did on 20th April—I then told him I was not able to obtain the watch spoken of, but I showed him one of our own make—he agreed to have that, provided that I could guarantee it to perform to time at 110 degrees of heat—I said I could not do that, but I would undertake to make it perform at 96 degrees of heat—he said he must have it to perform at that at least, because it was necessary in his profession to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220006"/>
               <p>lay it before that heat—I then undertook to compensate that same watch at 96 degrees—he called again, I think on 4th May—he then saw the watch and was perfectly satisfied—he came in several times every day till the 6th May—he kept coming in to see if the watch performed correctly with one of Le Roy's, which he pulled out of his pocket, and which he said Mr. Le Roy had entrusted him with, in fact he was not to pay for it until he had quite satisfied himself that it went correctly—I asked if he had a bill of it—he said no, but I could go to Mr. Le Roy, or I could go to Claude Scott's for his reference; that he was in the habit of banking at Claude Scott's—I think he said that in the first instance—he also said so on 6th May and I also offered to go over to Mr. Le Roy's—that was only just across Regent-street—he asked me to value that watch, which I did at thirty-six guineas—the value of mine was twenty-six guineas—the prisoner said if I would allow him to put it in his pocket for a few hours he would see if it went correctly, and if it did, he would give me a cheque for the whole amount of the goods on the following Tuesday—I let him have the watch—I let him have it in consequence of the representations he made, particularly that he had this watch from Mr. Le Roy, and that he banked at Claude Scott's, and also his being professor of chemistry—if he had not represented that he had banked at Claude Scott's, and that he was professor of chemistry of the University, I do not think I should have allowed him to have the watch, but his introducing Mr. Le Roy's watch helped it—I certainly should not have parted with it, if he had not represented that he banked at Claude Scott's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Gibson, a packing-case maker. In October last we lodged on the first floor of Mrs. Fontaine's house. On Wednesday night, 6th October, I went to bed about 12 o'clook—I had heard the prisoner come home at 11 o'clock, and let him in—he went up stairs into his own apartment—he had to pass our room to go there—he was very tipsy—I could hear his footsteps—we were having our supper—I afterwards heard him go down; that was between five and ten minutes after he came in—I could hear him speaking to his wife before he came down; she did not wish him to go out, but he would go—I heard him pass the door, but did not see him—I heard his voice; they were having a few angry words about going out—I know that he went out because I heard the door shut—I heard him come home again at about a quarter to 3 on Thursday morning—I was awake when he opened the street door—he went up stairs but remained only a minute or two, and came down again (my husband was awake)—when the prisoner came down, I heard a noise as if some one was putting their back and forcing the panels out—I heard that repeated three times—I heard the noise after he passed my door in about the time that it would take for him to get to the top of the stairs—I awoke my husband, and he heard it as well—I next heard the prisoner go up-stairs again; I knew his steps because I have heard him come home every morning for two or three months—he only remained up-stairs a minute or two and then came down again, and I heard a noise as though he was wrenching off the padlock—that was in about the time it would take him to get there after passing my door—I then heard him go through into the back part of the premises, and a few minutes after I smelt fire—I then heard him come up-stairs again, and my husband went to him and said, "Cramp, what have you been doing; have you been burning anything down stairs?"—he said, "No, I have no light; I have only just this minute come in"—I said, "You have been in this half-hour, doing something down at the shop—he made no reply, but went to his own apartment—I remained in my room, but my husband went down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, F</hi> 51). The proseeutrix gave me a description of the man that had robbed her, and in consequence of that description, I apprehended Wright about an hour and a half afterwards in Charles-street, Drury-lane—he was in company with Mitchiff—I had seen them in com<lb/>pany together previously about half an hour before the robbery, in the Red Lion and Still public-house, that is about a hundred yards from Endell-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter of 25, Judd-street. On the night of 5th November, I was with a female in a public-house, opposite York-street, Pentonville-hill—the prisoners and another female were there—I left the female I was with to go home, and the prisoners and the other woman followed me—I was sober; I knew what I was doing—I went to the door of a brothel about a quarter of a mile from the public-house—I went into a room and sat down on the edge of the bed—I rose up again to go, and found my watch guard swinging, but felt my watch in my waistcoat pocket; I took it out and put it into my trousers pocket—the swivel was cut—that was not above five minutes after I went in—during the whole of that time all the three women were in the room—I was thrown on the bed by all three of them and found Field's hand in my trousers pocket—I squeezed her hands hard and made her drop the watch into my pocket again—I hallooed "Police" as hard as I could call—I was thrown on the bed again, and Smith and another one caught me by the arms, and the other by the throat, and with one hand over my mouth, and then my watch went—when I was nearly strangled the police came in, and I gave them in charge—one of them left the room before the police came—I have never seen my watch since.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Liverpool—I am a spirit agent and distiller—we receive consignments from large distilling houses in Scotland and Ireland—Oldfield and Co. were our agents. In May last we advertised for some other person to sell amongst houses in town—shortly afterwards we received a letter from Mr. Rikey—this is it—I have acquired a knowledge of his writing since; it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated May 13, 1858, offering his services as agent: stating that he had had considerable experience in the trade, and could give satisfactory reference and security.</hi>) In about four weeks after the receipt of the first letter I saw Rikey at a hotel in Fleet-street—he then told me he had been with Sealey and Mordan in Mark-lane for twelve years, and he was in the habit of meeting the principal wine-merchants on 'Change, and he could do a very large business—I asked him to name some, and he mentioned a great many that I knew by name to be very respectable—I asked what security he could give, and he said a security of a life interest that he and his wife had in some property—he said he had the title deeds with him, and he produced some parchments—on 19th July, I received another letter from him—I think I did not see Rikey again before I sent up any whiskey—it was partly in consequence of the conversation I had with him and the subsequent letter I sent the quarter cask—I received another letter, but it contained so much nonsense that I destroyed it—I afterwards received other letters from him. (<hi rend="italic">A number of letters from Rikey were here put in and read in part:—in one dated July 19th, he stated that the security he had to offer was a reversionary life interest in freehold property, producing 270 l. per annum, but as no money would pass through his hands, he submitted that no security would be necessary. In other letters he referred to Thurgood as a person who had given orders for whiskey, and stated that he was a person of property, and respectability, and to be trusted. He also stated in other letters that he had been introduced to a Mr. Mead, a partner in one of the New York banks, who would buy largely, and whose agents were the Union Bank of London.</hi>)</p>

On 26th October last, I met the prisoner at the bottom of the staircase—I had not seen him the night before—he slept in my house; my husband had let him in, and he paid my husband over night for the room—after he left, I went into the room that he had slept in, on the second floor front, and missed two sheets and a pillow-case, that were safe when I made the bed the night before—I informed my husband at once—he ran after him and brought him back in about five minutes—I am quite sure he is the person that bade me good morning at the bottom of the stairs—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two sheets and the pillow-case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger at 34, New North-street, Finsbury. On the night of 3d November last, about twenty minutes past 12, I was coming down Long-lane in the direction of Barbican—I saw the prisoner Burridge there—we walked together some short distance, about fifty or sixty yards by ourselves—when we had got that distance Daley joined us—we went some short distance up a court—Burridge wanted me to go home with her, which I refused—they continued to talk to me to some extent and while so doing they robbed me of my watch—I felt my watch safe while I was in the court, in my waistcoat pocket—I found it was gone the moment they ran away—I called for the assistance of the police—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch—it was fastened by a chain—it is <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> the ring now.</p>

On the morning of 4th November last, about 1 o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police," and went towards Barbican—I saw the two prisoners running in the direction of Aldersgate-street, and the prosecutor running along the road in a staggering manner—I ran in the same direction, and he pointed out the two females on ahead as having robbed him of his watch—I followed them; and overtook them as they turned into Aldersgate-street—they were running—Daley was a few yards in advance of the other—I followed Burridge; as she turned round Aldersgate-street, she threw her shawl from her shoulders and held it in her left hand, which formed a festoon behind her, and I, treading on it, nearly tripped me up—I eventually took her into custody—I took them both at one time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at High-street, Tunbridge, Kent. I came to town on 9th November—I was just at the end of Cannon-street, near London-bridge, at 12 o'clock that day—I came up Crooked-lane—I was waiting there to get past the crowd—I saw the prisoner some two or three yards below me; and once in particular, when I looked round, he had got his eye upon me—I did not take particular notice of that—after a time there came up a party of people, as though they came by a railway train, and they went by in pairs—just before the first pair reached me, the prisoner forced his way in between them, and round so as to work them round with a few of them behind me, and then his left hand came and took my watch, and he made his way very quietly among the crowd—I suppose I observed him about five minutes before he took my watch—as soon as he had done it, he got about one or two from me—I could not reach him, so I did not halloo, but I went round and caught him by the collar as soon as I could—I kept my eye on him the whole of the time—I said, "You stole my watch"—he said, "You don't mean that, do you?"—I said, "Yes, you villain, you did"—he began to make a whining noise, as if to attract the attention of other parties; and four or five of a similar stamp came and rushed in between us, and broke him from my grasp—however, I still kept my eye on him—he ran away immediately—he ran a few yards down the path, and then dodged under a horse's head, then under the tail-board of a waggon and round and about several other waggons, and I caught him in about the middle of the open space, the other side of King William's statue—I then shouted out "Police" twice, as loud as I could halloo—about a minute or two afterwards, up came a fellow who said, "Let that man go; I will show you who has got your watch"—I said, "Never mind the man that has got the watch; I have got the man that stole it: that will do for me at present, and I shall hold him"—the prisoner passed his hand back into the hand of the one that came up and wished me to release him, and something passed; I cannot say I saw what it was, but as soon as it was passed, he went over in an opposite direction, towards Fenchurch-street—I secured the prisoner and had him out on the path opposite the ham and beef shop there, and the police came and took him in custody—the prisoner was very resolute while I was holding him, trying to get away all he could, and it was with the greatest difficulty I held him—we had a tumble—a witness came up who was in attendance before the Magistrate.</p>

On Saturday night, 23d October, I went to the Britannia public-house to fetch some beer—it is two doors from the corner of King's head-court on Fish-street-hill—it was just before 12 o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner Gardner, Richardson the cabman, and some other persons standing at the bar; (I had seen Gardner before)—they were drinking—I was standing near them, listening to their conversation—I heard Gardner ask Richardson to fight him—Richardson said "No; I have been drinking comfortably the whole evening; I don't wish to fight now"—they came out of the public-house, and I saw Gardner go up the hill—they were then about closing the house—I went in-doors with my beer and came out again—I then saw the policeman come up, and he asked Richardson to take his cab away which stood at the door, which Richardson refused—Gardner then came back again, and the policeman pushed him up in the court wishing him to go; he said, "Go away about your business, I don't wish to have any bother with you," and he pushed him up King's-head-court—Gardner came back again, and the policeman pushed him again, but not to</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 23, Fish-street-hill, nearly opposite the Britannia. On that Saturday night, about 12 o'clock, I was just going in at my door, and I saw Gardner and Richardson fighting—they were abreast of King's-head-court—the policeman came up at the same time—I did not see Payne—when the policeman came up, Richardson said, "Take him off"—the policeman said, "Take who off?"—he turned on his light and he saw Gardner on the top of Richardson—Richardson said to the policeman, "Why don't you punch him?" referring to Gardner—the policeman said, "That is not my business, that is yours"—with that he pulled Gardner up, and they stood there; and the policeman said to Gardner and to Richardson, "My good men, I want you to go away, I don't want this piece of work in the street"—with that Gardner went away, and the policeman persuaded Richardson to take his cab away, which he refused to do. After some few minutes he sent his cab away by a man, and he stood there himself—the policeman persuaded him to go away; he refused, and made use of very bad language—he said to the policeman," Go to b—y; I know as much about my business as you do;" and he said, "If he (meaning Gardner) comes back, I will smash him"—Gardner came back at the very time, and they were going to fight again, and the policeman prevented them—he shoved Gardner into King's-head-court, and Richardson into the road, one with one hand, and the other with the other—he did not make use of any unnecessary violence—Gardner then came back again; Richardson stopped in the middle of the road—the policeman shoved Gardner again into King's-head-court, and told him to go home quietly as he did not want any piece of work at that time of night—Gardner then struck him and knocked his hat off—they fell down—they both got up and struggled together—they both fell several times—there was pulling hair and scuffling, I should say for ten minutes or more—that was in the middle of King's-head-court, one end of which runs into Fish-street-hill, and the other into Pudding-lane—Richardson was there all the time, he did nothing as I know of; he was standing near the entrance of the court towards Fish-street-hill—I did not hear him say anything to persons who wished to come in—I was in the court—the policeman had his staff out—he did not have it at the beginning nor for ten minutes afterwards—he drew it in his own defence at last; he did not take it out till he had been assaulted for some time—I spoke to Richardson; I told him to go away as it was all through him that the row was—he said nothing to me—I had enough to do to take care of myself, or I should have been killed perhaps as well as the policeman—I took Gardner away from the policeman—he had his staff out then, and he was in a confused state, being down so many times—Gardner got out of my hands, and he went back and attacked the policeman again for two or three minutes—I never saw Richardson after that—I saw Payne after the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was over in Pudding-lane—I spoke to him, and he began to abuse me—I told him to go away, he knew nothing about it—he called me a b—y thief and a smuggler—I told him he knew nothing about it—he said he did, but he did not tell me what he knew about it—he was talking about Gardner lying on the steps and being ill-used by the policeman.</p>

On Saturday night, 23d October, I was near Fish-street-hill—I heard a man's voice crying for mercy—I went to the place and saw two men attacking the policeman—they had him on the ground and were punching him, one about his head and the other about his body—they were hitting him with their fists as far as I could see—I said, "D—n it all, give a man fair play; don't use him like that"—I can't say that I can recognise any person who was present that evening.</p>

I am not yet doing duty; I was on duty on Fish-street-hill on Saturday night, 23d October—shortly before 12 o'clock, I was passing the Britannia public-house on the opposite side of the way—I saw Richardson and Gardner fighting—I crossed over quickly, and separated them—Richardson wished me to take Gardner for an assault—I declined to do so as they were both, in fault—he requested me to give him a good thumping—I desired Richardson to go away—he refused to do so, and I took his number—Gardner came up—I pushed him into the court and said, "Go away, my good man, I don't want to have any piece of work with you"—he made reply, "Then I will have at you, you b—r"—he struck me on the head, knocked my hat off, and caught my hair, and we both fell down—we got up; he again attacked me and we fell down again—Payne was with him—Gardner then said, "I will have your b—y life, if I am hanged for it"—after Payne came up, I looked round and saw Mr. Silverton, and knowing him I said, "For God's sake, Silverton, come and help me"—he came into the court and took Payne away from me—while I was on the ground, I was struck by both of them—I might have been kicked but I did not feel the kicks—I did not lose my hold of Gardner—I had left Richardson at the top of the court—I don't know what he was doing—I was about a dozen yards from the top of the court—Mr. Silverton came and took Gardner off me, and at that time Gardner was bleeding—I had not drawn my staff till Mr. Silverton took them both away from me—at that time there might have been twenty persons—I drew my staff out of my pocket as Gardner was coming again—Mr. Silverton endeavoured to prevent him, but he said he would come—I then struck Gardner on the arm and the head—he seized me, and we went down again, and while down I received blows and kicks from various parties—it might have been going on for eight or ten minutes before I drew my staff—when I drew it and used it, I did nothing at all more than was necessary for my own defence—I cautioned him that if he came I would strike him—I was knocked down repeatedly, after I drew my staff—I was up and down repeatedly till we got into Pudding-lane—Mr. Silverton was engaged in pulling them off first one and then the other—when we got into Pudding-lane, my brother officers came up—I pointed out Payne as one—I have no recollection of anything further</p>

This was recommended and signed by the Rev.

                  </hi>. I formerly resided at 5, York-street, Westminster; I have since removed—I was living there with my wife at the time in question—we occupied the second floor front and back—there are four rooms on a floor, and I had a front and a back room—I knew the prisoner—he did not go by any other name than Isaac Harmond in the house, but out of doors I have heard him called by the name of "Bandy"—a woman lived with him as his wife—I always considered her as Mrs. Harmond—they occupied a back room on the same floor as I lived. On the 15th September, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my own room at my work as a tailor—I heard the prisoner come in—I did not see him, but I heard him come up-stairs—as soon as he came up-stairs, I beard him inquire of Mrs. Clark, who lived in the front room adjoining mine, where his wife was—she told him she was out and she would go and look for her—she went out, and returned shortly afterwards and said she could not find her—upon that, the prisoner made use of threatening language towards her—he said, that when she came home he would do for her, and that he would stick a knife in her—he then went out and returned in a few minutes and commenced breaking the crockery in the room, and he said if she had</p>

In September last I lived at 5, York-street, on the first floor front—I was in bed on the night in question—a woman came to my door and knocked—I got up and went out on the stairs—I went into the room of the person who called me, which is a back room, and looked out of the window—and when I came out again on to the stairs, I saw the prisoner coming down the stairs—I asked him where he was going—he told me that his wife had jumped out of the window—I asked him where he was to allow her to do so—he made no answer, but was going down—we were both going down together—we both went to the coach-house gate, and the prisoner pulled the bell twice—I think he rang it—I had not got hold of him—he came down the stairs quite quiet with me—he never offered to go away or to use the least resistance—I said we would go together—that he should wait till I accompanied him—we did both go down together and go to this gate, and he rang the bell—somebody at last opened the gate—we both went in, and found the deceased lying inside—while we were there the policeman came—the prisoner did not seem to offer any assistance to lift up the woman—I did not see who it was lifted her up—some person went to do so, and a party standing by called the prisoner a scoundrel, and said, "Why don't you make any effort to assist the poor woman now?"—upon that, he went across with the intention of assisting her up, but she was then in the other party's arms—I cannot say that the prisoner was the worse for drink; he may have been drinking, but I should have taken him to be sober.</p>

I am a shoemaker—I did live at 5, York-street, Westminster, in the first floor front—I was not at all acquainted with the prisoner or the deceased—on the night this happened, a few minutes after 10, I was undressing, preparing to go to bed, and I heard the prisoner, as I supposed (I had never seen him), and the deceased come in at the lower part of the house—she spoke to Mrs. Seton and said, "We are all drunk to-night"—they passed up-stairs past my room to their own room—I heard their footsteps, but did not see them—after they were in their own room I heard a great scuffling—their room is not directly over my head, but from the adjoining room I could hear them stir the fire occasionally and hear their footsteps for some two or three minutes—I think he had heavy shoes on—after some few minutes, and when I was undressed and going into bed, the noise ceased, and Mrs. Ward, who lives in the adjoining room to me, came up-stairs and went into her room—she had no sooner got into her room than she rushed out again, and came to my door, but it was locked—she did not say anything—she then ran into Mr. Seton's room, and I heard her say, "That fellow has thrown the woman out of window"—I then unlocked my door and ran out, and at that time the prisoner was coming down stairs, and Mr. Seton had got hold of him—he had stopped him, and said "Where are you going?"—the prisoner had a candle in his right hand, and he was without coat, hat, or shoes—Mrs. Ward ran out into the street to give an alarm—I laid hold of him by the left arm, took the candlestick out of his hand, and said, "You villain, what do you mean by throwing the woman out of window?"—he said, "How could I throw her out of the window, when the bed comes across the window?"—I said, "Why did you not prevent her?"—he replied, "Oh, give her a <hi rend="italic">leg up</hi>"—he turned his head on one side and said that in a muttering way—I told Seton to take care of him while I went up-stairs to put on my trousers—the prisoner said, "Old fellow, you need not be afraid, I am not going to run away"—I went into the first floor back room, looked out of the window with the candle, and saw the woman lying in the coach-yard of Mr. Fowler; and I gave an alarm; I called "Murder" three times—the coachman's wife then looked out of window and asked what was the matter—after slipping on my trousers I went down again, they had then got the gate open, and I saw the deceased—I said to the prisoner "This woman has never thrown herself out of window, had she done so she must have gone forwards"—apparently to me she had dropped in a perpendicular position, and her eye had caught the ornament of the lamp which projects about two feet from the wall, and her heel had grazed the abutment wall—her eye was torn up—she lay rather as though she had dropped than if she had made a spring out—the prisoner made no reply to what I said—he asked the</p>

               <p>then perfectly conscious—I saw her on the following day—I think she was completely conscious on the morning after she was brought in, and remained so until a short time before her death—I was present on 18th September, when a constable of the name of Carr was there—she said at that time that she did not expect to get over it; she led me to understand no—I do not remember the exact words she used—from several expressions she used, I understood that she did not expect to recover—I took a note of the words she used, and gave them to Mr. Paynter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the memorandum I made—she had several times before said she expected she would not recover, and she said, "I do not think I shall get over this"—at the time she made the statement, she expressed the same feeling that she should not recover—her mother was present—this was on Saturday, the 18th—Mr. Paynter had been there on the 16th and 17 th—her mother asked her some questions in my presence—I took down in writing what the deceased said iu answer to those questions.</p>

Q.</hi> A person having suffered an injury of that serious nature to the brain and spinal marrow, the intellect would be to a certain extent clouded for the remainder of life, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not make any general statement about that; in her particular case it did not seem to be clouded; if inflammation of the brain follows from the injury, the intellect would be clouded, but here there was no inflammation of the brain or its membranes—she was brought in on the 15th, and died on the 22d—inflammatory action had set up between those times, but not in the brain, or in the membranes of the brain; they were simply congested, that means blood pressing on them; an undue quantity of blood, and an undue quantity of pressure; the brain itself was not congested, only the mem<lb/>branes—there need not necessarily be pressure on the substance of the brain—congestion of the membranes implies that the blood-vessels are unduly gorged with blood; there would be a very slight amount of pressure on the brain—by pressure on the brain, the brain in the performance of its functions would, to a certain extent, be disarranged, or disordered; that was the condition of this woman's brain at the time of her death—it is usual in cases such as that, that the intellect shall be to a certain extent, greater or less, confused and deranged; I do not remember having any conversation with this woman on the day previously to the statement made to her mother; I think only asking her how it came to happen that she was thrown out—I had no long conversation with her—on the first occasion, her mother was sitting by her aide; on the second occasion I was told that the mother was there, and Mr. Paynter had expressed a wish that some<lb/>body should be present whenever anybody came to see her, therefore I went and stayed while she was there—on the second occasion the mother was there, when I went into the ward—I went in very frequently during the previous hour—I do not think that on each occasion the mother was sitting by her side and talking to her—she was frequently with her alone, when I was not present—I attended her up to her death—she was not delirious, till very near the close of her life; that was on the 22d—I was constantly with her night and day—I visited her at intervals during the night—a portion of the time she was in a heavy stupor, both by day and by night, occasionally, when she was left completely alone; that was so throughout—it is scarcely to be called a comatose state, if. was a deep sleep; I do not think it was coma, because she was very easily roused from it.</p>

The deceased was my daughter—her name was Sarah Farrow—she had been married to a person of the name of William Farrow—when I heard of thig affair, I went to the Westminster hospital to see her—I got there on the Saturday, as it happened on the Wednesday—she knew me—she was perfectly sensible when I came there—I remember Mr. Adair the surgeon being there—some questions were put, and her answers were written down by Mr. Adair—I was there every day with her—I saw her on the Sunday, when Mr. Adair was not present—most of her conversation on the Sunday was about her not getting over it—she seemed perfectly sensible and satisfied that she never should recover—I told her to pray to God and do the best she could to prepare herself for the next world—she said she had done it, and she would do it again—on the Sunday, when Mr. Adair was not there, I put some questions to her as to what she had said the day before, when Mr. Adair was not there, to know if she was perfectly sensible, to know what she had said before; and she repeated the same words again repeatedly—she was quite sensible, I believe in everything—I asked her in particular how it happened, in what way, and whether she had been having anything to drink, or whether she was in any way intoxi<lb/>cated; and she said, "No, I had been hard at work all day, and I was taking my work home, and instead of my taking 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the full amount of my money, I only took 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," whether that enraged him or not she said she was not sure, but immediately she was inside the door he closed the door behind her—she begged of him to undo the door, and he refused so to do—he said, "I have got you now, and I will have my revenge if I serve twelve months for it," and he struck her once, if not twice, on the head with a poker; "and immediately," she said, "I jumped on the bed and threw up the window to make an alarm, but he was so quick upon me; whether I did call or not I do not know; I believe I did call, but he was so quick in pushing of me out"—that was all she said—she said a good deal more in the presence of the house-surgeon and the police, and they took it down, but I being so much troubled, I could not bear it in mind so well as what she said privately to me—that was all that she said on that Sunday—I composed her as well as I could—I did not trouble her much about worldly affairs; I saw how she was going and I put other questions to her—I asked her on the Sunday about what she had said to Mr. Adair on the Saturday—I asked her whether she was perfectly sensible, and she said, "It was all quite true mother, what I told him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in New Tothill-street. On Thursday morning, the 15th September, I think, I was taken to the station-house in Rochester-row—I was taken up on suspicion of being a deserter, for enlisting and taking a shilling, a month previous to that—that matter was investigated and I was discharged—the prisoner was at the station-house previous to my going in—I found him there when I went in—he and I were placed in the same cell—when I came into the cell, he asked me what I was there for—I told him I was there on suspicion of enlisting as a soldier on 15th of last month, which was August; and I said that I was there to go before the Magistrate again on that account—I then said, "What are you here for?"—he said, "Ah! mine is much more serious than that"—he said, "I expect mine will turn out a bad job"—I then said, "What might your case be then?"—he said, "Did you not hear of it?"—I said, "No, I did not, for I was locked up last night"—he said, "Did you not hear about the woman being thrown out of window?"—I said, "No," I had not heard anything about it—he then said, "Well, I was out yes<lb/>terday, looking after my living," or "seeking my living. I came home to my tea, and my wife was out and no tea made; I went to look after her, and found her drunk. I remonstrated with her for getting drunk, and not</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your house the London Tea Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I drew up this agreement; it is signed by my brother—I think there was no person present on behalf of the prisoner—it is stated here that he was to have a commission on articles specified in the schedule, but there was no schedule made—he applied to us in distress—I could not get a character, and I thought he had been hardly used by his employer—I made a special provision, to employ him for one month, and then if I thought proper I would give him a commission according to the schedule; but, prior to the expiration of the month, I repeatedly called the foreman into the counting-house and told him to tell Robinson that we should not continue him; and the foreman told him we should not—the prisoner came into the office, and begged very hard to be continued—I told him the amount of the sales he effected was so trifling it was not worth our notice—he pleaded again to be continued, and I said, "If I do it will be with a view of befriending you, but there will be no commission"—I did not pay him the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; it was not in my department—he was not paid the first week, the second, or the third—I told the foreman to pay him the four weeks, and he misunderstood me; he should have paid him the month, and he paid him only one week—since then he has been paid every Saturday night—he was to have paid half the bad debts of the sales effected by him out of the commission, but he had no commission—I am not certain about the date, but it was on a Saturday he was suspended, and on the Tuesday he was given in custody—I did not ask him to go over the books with me—the books were all in our office—the prisoner would have an order book to take out each day; he would call on families and take orders and enter them in his order book, which book he would return at night, and the next morning he would have his way-bill—if he received money he would not enter it in his book, but in the way-bill which he gave in—the way-bills were made out by our junior clerk, my younger brother—these are the way-bills—here is the column in which he entered the money he received—he should enter these sums at the time he receives them, or at some time previous to balancing the way-bill—when he came home he had to account to the cashier—the order-book is the book in which he entered the orders he received—he would leave the order-book at home, and the orders would be entered in the way-bill for the next day—our cashier is never out of the way; if he had been out of the way I should have attended to it—in the event of our both being out of the way the foreman would have taken it—there is no other person who would receive it from the travellers—we have another cashier who receives the accounts in the house—the orders the prisoner got and entered, are from persons whom he introduced to the firm, I should presume entirely so, and that business did not pay—he made not one-fourth part of the average of our carts—he entered into our service in July—on 21st August, he received payment for one week instead of the month—I believe it was prior to that being paid, that I told him there should be no commission—I kept him on after that for his own benefit—I believe the bad debts were not mentioned—the commission was destroyed, and therefore the bad debts would be destroyed—we had a bond which was for his honesty only—our attorney has the bond.</p>

I am an officer—I was on duty on 29th August in Whitechapel, between 7 and 8 in the morning—I observed the prisoner walking down North street with a bay mare—he offered it for sale to some man who refused to buy it—I went and asked him where he came from—he said from St. Luke's—I asked him how he became possessed of that mare—he said he had had it for six years and a half, that it was blind with one eye and broken winded, and he wanted to sell it as it was of no use to him—he afterwards told me that he and another man took the mare from Hackney-marsh, from a field near the church, about half-past 5 o'clock the evening before—and if I went in that direction I should find the owner—I took possession of the mare, and Mr. Tate came and owned it—I went to Hackney station and gave information—the prisoner said, "The other man that was with me when we stole the horse, has just made his escape."</p>

In April last, the prisoner brought me a table, which I purchased of him for 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—what makes it perfect in my memory is that I did not know that Mr. Anidjah dealt in tables, and the prisoner said, 'It has nothing to do with Mr. Anidjah; it is my own pro<lb/>perty"—I therefore paid him at once—he did not give me a receipt—he brought the table in the van which comes every week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Grosvenor, Chater, &amp; Co., paper manufacturers—they have been in the habit of sup<lb/>plying Shaw &amp; Sons, of Fetter-lane, with paper—this book, which has been produced, is composed of machine-made paper—there are two sorts of paper, machine-made and hand-made—I know that in August, 1857, we supplied some paper to Shaw &amp; Sons, of Fetter-lane—I sent it out in our carts—I supplied them from our store—down to a particular period, we supplied hand made paper as well as machine-made paper to Shaw &amp; Sons, but not with their name on the sheet—we supplied them with both sorts of paper down to the present time—in March, 1857, an alteration was made in the kind of paper supplied to them—instead of having the watermark we had made it with before, they altered it and said they wished to have their name and address, "Shaw &amp; Sons, Fetter-lane," put in the watermark of the paper—the paper in this book is machine-made paper—on this paper there is the water-mark, "Shaw &amp; Sons, Fetter-lane."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>within the last five years—it is only by connecting the watermark with the paper that I can identify it—the party that made the dandy roller can, no doubt, identify his own work—the watermark enables me to tell when the paper was made—when the book was first put into my hand, I went by the watermark—there is no date there—I judge by the watermark now, by its having the imprint, Shaw &amp; Sons, Fetter-lane, in the sheet; and it is a machine-made paper, made by Greer &amp; Co., of Ireland; and I know they never made paper with Shaw &amp; Sons in it, before 1857—I cannot speak in any other way, only by the dandy roller—I have not the least doubt that this is Greer's paper—there is no doubt that it is Shaw's mark—that only tells me that, if made at our place, it was made within a certain time, because of the dandy roller; that was not made till 1857—we did not have a watermark of that kind before 1857—whether Greer had or not, I do not know, except by letter—I have not seen Mr. Greer himself—I have seen his agent in London.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You used to supply Shaw &amp; Sons with machine-made paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; made by Greer, and other persons also probably—we supplied them with papers of different makes—then they wanted machine-made paper which should have their name in the watermark—they told us that in 1857—thereupon we gave an order to Greer to supply that paper;—after that we had paper supplied to us of the description with which we supplied Shaw &amp; Sons—for anything I know, Greer might have had a dandy roller ten years before, and supplied Shaw's direct; but they can prove that that was the dandy roller made in 1857.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dandy roller maker and moulder. In the month of February, 1857, we supplied a dandy roller to Messrs.

I was on duty in Princes-street on the morning of 19th September—I heard the disturbance in Paul-street; I went there—I met House—I went with him to the house in Paul-street—when I went in I saw the two prisoners on the landing—House said, "Come down, I want you for an assault upon the sergeant"—the answer was, "You b—r, if you come up here I will split your head open;" one of the two men said that, I cannot say which—House asked them twice to come down—they made the same reply each time—eventually we went up—I saw Farrington with a shovel; Henley had a poker—there was nobody else that I saw on the stairs besides the two prisoners—when House asked them again to come down, they made a strike at us with a poker—that was before we went up—we went up, House first—House got three parts of the way up—I saw the two prisoners strike him over the shoulders—they did not strike him in any other part—I saw House knock Henley down after he had been struck violently by the prisoner—he struck him with his staff—he knocked Henley down; after that I saw the other prisoner come up and strike House on the head with the shovel—when he received the blow he staggered, falling from the effects of the blow—the prisoner was going to strike him again; I pushed forward, and stepped in and received the blow on the shoulder—I can assure you I felt it—House was taken away by another constable; he was bleeding very much indeed—Farrington was taken to the station, and so was Henley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, living at 16, Paul-street, Lisson-grove. On Sunday morning, 19th September last, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was looking out of my front window, and saw four or five of these men standing at the door of 21, Paul-street—presently sergeant Thorne came up and said, "Now, lads, go in"—they said, "We will presently"—I could hear every word—I came down, and went to my own door—he gave Farrington a shove, and shoved him into the passage of 20—Farrington came out—Thorne caught hold of him by the collar, and they both went out on the pavement—the sergeant's hat fell off in the road—a woman came and picked up the hat, and went across the road with it—another policeman came and ran across the road, and got hold of his hat, aud said, "All right, I have got your hat"—Farrington and the others then all went in doors, and shut the door—when they shut the door the sergeant and the other policeman came up and stood at the door with a staff in his hand for four or five minutes, one on each side, and the door was not opened—then both of them walked away out of the street altogether—it was after 1 o'clock, I think, when they came back again with seven or eight of them together—they stood on the opposite side of the way, with their backs to the wall, and had some conversation among themselves; and presently one went up to the public-house door aud pulled the bell, and apparently got no answer, and he stood just for a moment—then he pulled it suddenly—he got no answer—he came up and joined the men again—he said, "That is the door, and I insist upon breaking that door"—that was one of the policemen, I do not know which—he pointed to the door of 21—they got their staves out and walked across the road—they went up to the door and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it light open, and the screws were torn out—I saw it in the morning when I went to help Quinn put it up again—Quinn is the landlord of the house—I saw no more—I did not see what happened in doors until I saw Farrington taken out—they took him out and laid him on his back on the pavement—then they went in again and brought Henley—I did not do anything then—I did not go near them—I thought perhaps I should get in for it if I went near them—they brought out Henley and left him one side of Farrington—some one of the policemen said, "We had better have the stretcher and carry him along;" and one said, "No, take the Irish b—and drag him along;" and they dragged him along—his legs kept dragging along—they laid Henley by the side of Farrington, and carried him along as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Paul-street, Lisson-grove. On Sunday morning, 19th September, I was there—I was passing through out of the yard with a light in my hand, and it was knocked out of my hand by the police, who were rushing past and going up the stairs—they were coming from out of the street and going up the stairs to the first floor back—they were going through the passage from the front door—I did not hear anything take place before this at the front door—when the police were making a noise at the door I was in bed, but I got up as I was coming to see what was the matter—the candle was knocked out of my hand—I live in a cottage at the back of the yard—I went into my own place again and got a light—when I came back again they were dragging Farrington down the stairs—when they got him to the bottom of the stairs, the policeman beat him across the legs with his staff, and I said, "Good God, don't commit murder"—only one policeman beat him—they dragged him out into the street, and when I returned to see who the young man was, I did not know him being in such a state of blood—he was quite a stranger, I said—they turned his head up, and I said,"Oh good God, I don't know the young man at all"—when I returned, they were dragging John Henley down the stairs—there were four policemen doing that—he had his arms up—they took him out of the bouse and took him away—I did not follow them—I went up-stairs and the policeman came up afterwards and took the fire irons away—they took the poker from the back room, but it was perfectly straight then—I could not swear which policeman it was; I do not know his number; I was too much frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased Robert Bridge Langham. He was a stableman—we occupied two rooms over the stable in Davies'-mews—the prisoner was coachman in the service of Mr. Wilson—my husband and the prisoner had their carriages in the same coach-house—my room commands a view of that coach-house—it is not directly opposite, but I could see it plainly. On 19th October, my husband came up-stairs to change his boots, and put on his wooden boots—he wears wooden boots when he washes the carriage—when he went down, the prisoner was there, washing Mr. Wilson's carriage—I heard a conversation between my husband and the prisoner—my husband said he did not wish to have any masters work there—he said he did not go to his master when he had an accident, and the next time he would not settle it so—my husband walked away from him to the coach-house—he went into the coach-house—the prisoner said, "That is your game, is it?" and under the wheel of a carriage there was a setter—the prisoner went to the setter—he unfastened the chain and took the pin out—he took out the lever and went into the coach-house, following my husband—he raised the lever with two hands, and struck him a violent blow—my husband reeled out of the coach-house to the back of the carriage—he had his hand to his head, and said, "Oh, dear!"—I saw the blood flowing most profusely—I ran down-stairs, and, as I went, I took off my apron and put it to my husband's head, to try to stanch the blood; but it was impossible to do so—my husband went to Mr. Ritcham, his master, and spoke to him—the prisoner went to his work—I went with my husband to the surgeon—he went to two doctors before he went to Mr. Bloxham—my husband went home with me, and finished his work—he did a little now and a little then—he did his work—that was on Tuesday—on Wednesday, he went to Mr. Bloxham—he was not at home—my husband went to the hospital on Friday—he died on the Monday—I had some con<lb/>versation with the prisoner on the day that he struck my husband—I told him it was a cruel blow—he said, "You did not see <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> hit me"—I said, "No, Mr. Brown, he did not: there was no blow struck when you hit my husband"—he said, "I don't say there was"—I said, "If there had been, it did not justify you in hitting him"—he said, "Yes, it did," and if I did not get out of his way, he would serve me so—"You won't do that," I said, "I have got the medical certificate in my hand which Mr. Bloxham has given me; and I will let Mr. Wilson know what a wretch of a coachman he has got" street police-station—he repeated then that I did Dot see my husband hit him—I said, "No, I did not; and if I had, it did not justify him in taking his life"—he said, "No, I don't say it did; I am very sorry for it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I recollect the deceased coming to me about 11 o'clock—when he entered my surgery, his face was covered with blood, and he had his hand to his head—I placed him in a chair, and proceeded to examine the wound, and dressed it—it was a straight wound, about two inches in length, extending up to the hair and down to the fore<lb/>head—it was partly incised and partly contused—the scalp was not penetrated by the blow, neither was there any depression of the bone—I dressed the wound in the ordinary manner—it was a blow which might have been inflicted with the straight part of this weapon—this was on Tuesday—I saw him again on Thursday—he complained of a little stiffness about the dressings, but they were undisturbed—he seemed slightly feverish, which induced me to ask him if he had been drinking—he said, "Yes"—I directed him to continue taking some medicine which I had prescribed on the first day, and he said, oh he had had enough of that—he went to the hospital on the following morning by my advice—he was in such a state that I thought it necessary—I did not see him after his death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This injury did not extend to the bone, and the scalp was not divided? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he had a smell of beer, and his strangeness of manner induced me to ask if he had been drinking—he said, "No, only half-a-pint"—if he persisted in a course of drinking, it would very much aggravate the wound—any blow on the head is very dangerous if there it intoxication afterwards—I should have called it a severe wound—at that time, with care and sobriety, I did not anticipate any dangerous results.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital—I recollect the deceased being brought there on 22d October—I examined his head, and found a wound on the forehead about two inches in length—I did not examine the scalp for some days—I examined the wound—I took the dressing off, and the bone was exposed—I dressed him and prescribed for him—he died on the following Monday—there was a post<lb/>mortem examination—there was a wound on the forehead; and when the scalp was pulled down there was a fracture of a part of the frontal bone, called the organ of fate; there was matter between the membrane of the brain—in my judgment the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, produced by the injury.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live in Gilbert-street, Grosvenor-square—I am a coachman. On the morning of 19th October I saw the deceased about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock—I did not observe what state he was in—I was not near the coach-house door; I was by the stable, which is at the top of the mews—I saw the prisoner and Langham's master outside the stable-door—I heard the deceased say to the prisoner, "You are a b—y liar"—the prisoner was in the stable, the deceased was outside—I heard Mr. Ritcham say to the prisoner, "Go and get your carriage done, and I will make <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> ay for it"—<hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> was the name the deceased was known by in the neigh<lb/>bourhood—<hi rend="italic"> Bob</hi> said the prisoner was a b—y liar; and he said, "If you say that again I will take your b—y life"—I can't say where the prisoner went, for I went home to breakfast; I did not return till 11 o'clock, and then I heard what had happened. I then saw Langham cleaning a brougham in the coach-house where this had happened—there was a man there washing a gig, whom I knew by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Tucker. I asked Langham what had been up, and he told me he had knocked Brown's head against the wall, and then he struck him with the setter—on Thursday the 23d I went to Dr. Bloxham with him; he went in to Dr. Bloxham, and he came out again, and told me Dr. Bloxham had ordered him to go home and keep himself quiet, or else it was very likely he would have a severe attack of erysipelas, but he would not dress his head that day—I remember he had a black eye—I do not know how long that was before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the brig <hi rend="italic">Thorn</hi>, which was lying in the Thames, off Milwall. On Sunday, 7th November, a little after 12, or on midnight of Saturday, I was walking towards Wapping to my ship, and met a man who offered to show me the way to it—he was a stranger to me—I followed him past the Thames Tunnel, and down a narrow passage—he said, "Come this way"—I saw a gas-lamp at the end of the passage, and, thinking I was not going the right way to the ship, I turned round and saw the prisoners behind me—they struck at me with their fists, and three more came up, laid hold of me by the coat, held me by my neck, and rifled my pockets of my <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi>—I then sang out, "Police! murder!"and they ran away, and in a little time the police came, when I was sitting on a door-step, being exhausted—the prisoners ran in one direction, and the three men in another—the prisoners went up a lane—I missed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, four sove<lb/>reigns, and my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Brewer-street, Woolwich, and am agent to Ben<lb/>jamin Bloomfield Baker, contractor for forage for the troops at Woolwich. On Monday, November 1st, I was at Charlton-wharf, and saw the prisoner in charge of a barge, which had come in on the Saturday—I spoke to him twice during the day—I went to him about 5 o'clock, and asked him if he had got all the oats ashore—he said, "Yes; every sack of it"—there were 450 sacks of oats—there had been a cargo of 800 sacks—we had a bill, saying that there were 800; that was the only way we knew it at that time—I asked the prisoner what he had done with the sweepings—he said that there were not many of them; he had put them in a sack which had burst, to fill it up—I said, "What did you do that for? I was down here this morning, and told you to put all the sweepings in a sack by themselves, that I might see what quantity there were"—I had told him that two or three times over—I then began to walk down the plank; and directly he saw me coming, he drew the ladder up—I told him to bring the ladder back—he did not do so; I repeated it, and he very reluctantly brought it back—I then went down into the barge, and saw a sack of oats—I asked him three times how that came there, and he gave me no answer; at last he muttered out that that was the last sack of the cargo—I told him it was no such thing—I then went on shore, and the man who we had to assist us in unloading, came out of the store-room—I asked him, in the prisoner's hearing, what that sack was in the barge—he said it was a sack of sweepings of the barge, which Forsdick and he had swept up and put in the sack—I said, "Why, how is this? one tells me that he put the sweepings into a sack to fill it up; and the other, that this is the sweepings of the barge; what have you to say to that?"—the prisoner said, "It is one of the cargo; I will go and fetch it up"—I said, "If this is one of the cargo, why did you tell me that you had taken all the sacks ashore, and why did you take the ladder away?"—he made no reply—I said that he should not fetch it up, but he did, and I had it put in the store-house, made a chalk mark on it, and locked it up—I told the prisoner I should give him in charge; that I had suspected it for a long time, and had stopped a man last week with two bushels—he said that he did not know anything about that; he was not going to steal it—I gave him in charge—I compared the oats with the cargo, and they corresponded—they are worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner said that he had brought down 400 quarters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the Woolwich division of Royal Marines. On 23d October last, about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was going home to my barracks, along High-street, Woolwich—I had had a little drop to drink, not much—I could stand and walk—I knew what I was about—I turned down Bell Water Gate-court, near there, to make water—there is an opening at the end of the court where you can go down to the river—you must come back the same way that you go in—when I had got there four men came up behind me—they must have gone into the court after me—I had seen them a short time before at the Coach and Horses, all the four of them—the prisoner is one of them—they asked whether I had got any money on me; and I said, "No, not for you"—upon that the men divided—the prisoner returned to the top of the court with one other—one of the other two then put his arm round my neck, at the back, and tried to throttle me—whilst he was doing that, the other man pulled a knife out—I saw it—he cut my right hand trousers pocket out with it—the pocket contained 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a purse—the other two men who had gone to the top of the court were about twenty yards from me—they could see what was going on—they stood there watching—they appeared to be watching in case a policeman should come—I heard one of them call out, "Take his life, he is only a marine"—I cannot say whose voice that was—I knew the prisoner knocking about Woolwich that week—I knew nothing of the voice that called out—upon that being said I struggled and got away from them—as soon as I got away from them I called out, "Police," and then they ran after me—in the course of the struggle I had succeeded in getting away the pocket which the man cut and took—it was in his hand before I got it back again—I found blood coming down my shirt from the middle of the left breast—it was not near my trousers pocket—there was no wound where the pocket was cut—I had a cloth military jacket on—after they ran after me I went to the police-station—they were all coming after me to catch me again—they tried to catch me, but could not—they did not come all the way to the police-station—when I was at the police-station a few minutes afterwards a policeman brought in the prisoner—when I saw him come</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, and live at 53, Powis-street, Woolwich. On Saturday morning, 23d October, about 1 o'clock, I was passing through Hare-street, in Woolwich—I saw a soldier passing up Hare-street, running as fast as he could—there were three or four persons who appeared to be following him—I cannot say positively—I recollect the prisoner as one of them—he was following last—I went then in the same direction as I was when I saw the soldier, towards High-street—at the time, I took no notice of what I had seen—I walked towards High-street, and two or three minutes afterwards came back and saw the prisoner in the hands of the policeman—I am sure he is one of the men who were running after the prosecutor—the prosecutor was rather tipsy, but he could run very fast; when I saw the prosecutor, the blood was flowing very fast—his coat was open and his breast exposed—it was a light-coloured coat, a sort of white—I could see the blood distinctly flowing down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I live at 35, Francis-street, Woolwich—last Sunday evening I was at the King's Arms, Woolwich, in company with Mr. Taylor—my wife and my brother's son were also with me, and my brother's wife—we took tea there—I drank a glass of grog—at half-past 10 we went to another public-house—I do not know the name of it—I had two glasses of grog there, and then a glass was broken on the table by a woman, and as she had no money to pay for it she said to the interpreter Fisk, "You must pay for it"—I paid for the glass, and left the house about 11 o'clock—when I got into the street, Fisk the interpreter disappeared from me—several persons came round me, and among them Drake and Brown—Brown took me by the throat, jumped at me, and I seized him by the throat—there were several others who attacked me but I could not find them—I received a blow on my head first with a stick, and fell—it was then that Brown jumped at me—it was a marine who struck me—he is not here—while I was lying on the ground they all attacked me—Drake put his hand inside my coat and I lost my pocket-book containing documents and letters from government, certificates from the hospitals of Paris, and other letters and correspondence—the pocket-book was in my inside pocket, which was torn as you now see in the struggle, because I could not defend myself—while I was on the ground the marine was feeling in my pockets, and the others continued giving me blows—I should not know the others if I saw them—I saw all three of the prisoners there—I endeavoured to get away—the marine ran away, and I do not know where he went to—after he came back they all pushed on me, and I said, "I want to go into the house to get some help," and I told Drake that he ought to give me my pocket-book or else I would call a policeman—I said that while the other men were holding me by the collar—I said it in French because I cannot speak English well—it was Evans that held me by the collar, because I wanted to get into a house for help—besides the papers my pocket-book had in it an English 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which I had received in the morning—I have not seen any of my property since—when I paid for the glass in the public-house I took out my pocket-book as I had my money in it, and they saw it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the military train at Woolwich—last Sunday week I was at the Crown Masons' Arms, at Woolwich, at a few minutes past 11 o'clock, in the tap room—some civilians were present—the prose<lb/>cutor came in with his interpreter, who is a soldier, and they had some drink—there were some females in the room at that time, and the interpreter invited one of them to have a glass and he asked me also—the girl that was speaking to him broke a glass, and asked him if he would pay for it—he said he had not money to pay for it—I saw the two civilian prisoners there—the room was not half the size of this Court—everybody could hear what was said—the glass was not paid for at that time—I saw the interpreter speak to the prosecutor, but, previous to that, the prosecutor pulled out his pocket-book to pay for the drink he had had—Evans and Brown were there then, and had the same opportunity of seeing him that I had—I saw the interpreter and the prosecutor leave the house—I went with them, us three, and a young woman—we went to a private house, two doors higher up, a brothel—we went in and remained there five or ten minutes in a back room on the ground floor all together, when Brown came in with his coat partly off—he began to abuse the Frenchman, who laid hold of him, and pushed him into the passage—I took the candle and went into the passage, and then the door of the room was locked behind me—a scuffle commenced between the Frenchman and Brown, and in a short time Evans came in, but I could not see whether he came from the street or from one of the rooms—I saw a marine in the passage—that passage goes to the street, and at the other end the door was closed behind me—I was at the far end of the passage from the street—there is not a room on each side of the passage—there is one front room and a back room—the marine who came in was Drake—the Frenchman was knocked down, I could not see by whom—several were engaged in the struggle whom I could not name; but I saw the three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220113"/>
               <p>prisoners all struggling with him—I cannot say that they were assaulting him—he was on the ground—he got up, put his hand to his breast, and pulled out his pocket-book to see that it was all right, as I understand, and then put the book into his breast, and when he got half way down the passage the men attacked him again—the three prisoners were there all the time—he was knocked down a second time, and when he got up he pointed to his breast and made signs to me that his book was gone—he called out something and pointed to his breast—the three prisoners were then at the end of the passage—I missed the marine for five or ten minutes—Brown and Evans got into the street, and then the Frenchman rushed at Drake, took him by the neck, and said that he was the man that had his pocket-book—he called "Police," and whistled as loud as he could—he let Drake go before the police came up, but did not let him go away—he gave him in charge at some distance from there, nearly opposite the George and Dragon—Drake said that he was willing to be searched, he had not got the pocket-book—I cannot tell by whom the door was locked—the interpreter was locked inside the room—I was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four months—he is a veterinary surgeon—there were from sixteen to twenty people in the public-house—it was very quiet when he came, but there were afterwards some few words about a dog which he had with him—those words did not lead to a quarrel or a fight—he had about two glasses of spirits, and I had one—the women had one or two glasses—it was the woman who was with the interpreter that broke the glass—she did not come in with him—she was in before him—he knew her—she lives at the brothel close by—she is the one who went there with him—I did not see any of the women searched—it was the same woman that was locked into the room with Fisk—she went through the passage into the room—she was in the passage during the time that it took her to walk along it—I was in the passage about twenty mimutes after the struggle commenced—the French<lb/>man was there all that time—I was there more than half-an-hour altogether—there were other women in the house; there was one standing at the front room door, but she did not interfere—the Frenchman was a little angry about the dog from what I could understand, but I do not understand French at all—I cannot say who struck the first blow in the passage or who the Frenchman was knocked down by—I had a light in my hand and was three or four yards from them—I had not my back to them—I swear deliberately that I could not see who struck the first blow—the Frenchman struck with his fists—he did not kick that I saw—he had nothing in his hands that I saw—he did not stand up and let himself be thrashed—I did not help him as regards fighting—I held the candle to see that there was nothing done more than really was done—if I had not held the candle very likely it would have been worse—it was after he had been knocked down that he pulled out his pocket-book—the prisoners were all in the passage then—they all went out in the street in fifteen or twenty minutes after the struggle commenced—it lasted nearly fifteen minutes to the best of my knowledge—the passage is about four feet wide and twenty feet long—there is a front door and two side doors, I think—I have not been into the house before—it was not the woman who broke the glass that came into the passage—she was locked in the room with Fisk—Evans did not run away when the Frenchman called "Police"—he stayed with him until we got nearly opposite the George and Dragon; and when the policeman came up the Frenchman gave Drake into custody, but not Evans.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the <hi rend="italic">R</hi> division of police, and am attached to Woolwich Dockyard—the prisoner was, before 1854, em<lb/>ployed as an armourer in the dockyard—he was an old soldier belonging to the sappers and miners—I believe he had, in 1854, a pension from Chelsea Hospital—we understood him to be a pensioner from the sappers and miners—in 1854 there was a charge of felony against him, for stealing something in the dockyard—I apprehended him on that charge—I did not search the different workmen as they left the dockyard, at that time—I had previously done so, but in this case I called one of the constables to do it, and he searched the prisoner, and did not find anything—he was tried upon a charge of stealing copper from the dockyard—I was a witness in the case—he was tried in this court—he has not been employed in the dockyard since that—he was in prison four months after the conviction—after the expiration of his sentence, I used occasionally to see him in the street—he never passed me without my seeing his lips moving, muttering something, and on one occasion I heard him say "Villain" as he passed me—he made an applica<lb/>tion against me at the police-court, after his conviction—I know he did so on one occasion—on 6th October, I left the dockyard soon after 4 in the afternoon—I went to a Mr. Butler's shop to get some change—while in the shop, I saw the prisoner pass outside—I endeavoured to ascertain whether he had seen me in the shop, but I could not detect that he had seen me—I went from that shop to another—when I left the second shop, I was return<lb/>ing to the dockyard, having got what I wanted—that was the next shop but one, I think, to Coleman-street—I was crossing the end of Coleman-street, and I saw him coming down—he was about twenty yards from me, and he hastened his distance and made it about five—I proceeded towards the dockyard, apprehensive of some violence from him, and I kept looking into the shops on my left hand, but my object was to see him, to see that he did not shorten the distance between us—he was about four or five paces from me, till we came to a shop where there was a waggon—I crossed the road, taking the wall of the dockyard, and I then lost sight of him—I thought he went into the Black Eagle—the waggon was between him and me—I then hurried on to the dockyard-gate—just before I got to the gate I heard a footstep; I turned my face and saw the prisoner coming up behind me—he was close to me, when I turned to my left—he had a pistol in his hand, and it touched my nose—I drew about three or four inches back from him, and he fired, and the ball lodged in my cheek—I could hardly see how he was holding the pistol before he fired, but I rather think it was in his left hand, I am not positive—I do not recollect that he said anything before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220117"/>
               <p>he fired—the ball lodged in my cheek—it did not go through my face—I did not fall—I was dropping down, but the thought occurred to me that he would get away—he was running away—I called after him and pursued him—a person came up to my assistance, and secured him—I believe a man named Flint picked up the pistol—I saw him stoop and pick up something; and he said, "Here it is, he has thrown it away"—a surgeon came at once and extracted the ball.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer and machinist, and live in Collingwood-street, Blackfriars-road. Towards the latter end of July, Aime and Boisserolle called at my premises—Aime asked me if I could make a coining press—I told him, "Yes"—he said, "A coining press to coin money"—he shewed me a copper coin, and inquired if I could make a press of sufficient power to make that coin, and the number that the press would make per minute—I told him, with sufficient men, it would make about sixty of those coins per minute; and I showed him the wooden model of that which is used for the Mint, to show him the size of it—I told him the price would be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered me 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "No; I would not take that"—there was no agreement made at that time—they offered me then 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 175<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills—I said if the bills were good, and upon good per<lb/>sons in the City, I would take them—it was Aime who spoke to me—the copper coin they showed me was about the size of a penny piece—it was similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they went away, and I made some inquiries—in about two days, Aime and Boisserolle called at my house again, and I stated to them at once that I had considered the matter, and I should not take any bills whatever—Boisserolle was very indignant—he marched about the place, and said he would have nothing to do with me; but when he was going down the stairs, he said, "Well, never mind; bring your agreement over to-morrow morning to 8, Chapel-place"—I agreed to draw up an agree<lb/>ments, and when they had left, I prepared this agreement—my daughter wrote it—I took it to 8, Chapel-place—I should imagine that was about 30th July—I then saw both the prisoners and Boisserolle—that was the first time I had seen Reverdy—I produced the agreement, and Boisserolle signed it in the presence of the others—Boisserolle did not speak English—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was brought to me in Collingwood-street, the same afternoon, by Aime—he paid me the money, and took a receipt—he called again in a few days, to see how I got on—during the whole six or seven weeks that I was at work at the press, he called to see how I was going on—he called by himself—he once had a man with him who was a stranger; that was all—soon after taking the order for the press, he said he should want a great quantity of dies—I prepared the blocks—I only do the smith's work, and then they go to the engraver—I made sixteen altogether—Aime told me to give them to the die sinker—I gave three or four to Thomas, and the rest to Oester Zetzer—Aime desired me to give them to Thomas—Oester Zetzer brought back the dies with the representation of John the Baptist, and Thomas brought back the coining dies—after I had these dies back I saw Aime several times—he called on me, and I spoke to him—on one occasion I asked him if that was not the Turkish Sultan's signature that was on one of those engraved by Thomas—he said it was not, and he produced some gold coins to show the difference between that on the die and the gold coins that he had—I had not finished the press by 10th September, but I fixed it temporarily up in my place, with a view to show that my work was right before it went away—I told Aime why I had done it, and I told him I should want some pieces of copper to try it; I wanted him to get some</p>

               <p>made—he said he could not do that, but he brought some copper, and I made a pair of catting-out tools—he sent me two pieces of copper from Messrs. Pecke, of Soho—it was very good copper, apparently; such copper as would make coins; I should say so by the look of it—I wanted to try the thickness of the copper, to see if my work was adjusted right—I did not try the machine at all; we had not got it finished—I afterwards com<lb/>municated with the Turkish Ambassador—I gave the dies I received from Thomas and from Oester Zetzer to the officer.</p>

Mr. Otto Thomas,—Having heard of you by my friend Smith, I beg you to call on me to-morrow evening at half-past 7 o'clock, if possible.")—I, in consequence, went, and saw the prisoner Aime—he said he was recommended to me, and had to give me an order—he showed me some patterns of coins; some like this yermelik, and these piastres, and these small coins, paras—he showed me several of each—he showed me other coins, the same pattern, but different kinds—he asked me about the price of doing them—I did not believe it was money—I asked him if it was money—he said, "Yes, it is money; they require new dies for them"—I asked him what they wanted new ones for, and what was done with the others—he said they were broken up, and they required new ones—I took the patterns with me home, and he gave me the coins, about four or five pieces—I agreed to make them at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pair—I took the five pieces home—I did not sink any dies for them in March; I sunk the dies in July—I saw Aime at the end of June or the beginning of July; I met him in Holborn, at the George and Blue Boar, and he introduced me to Boisserolle as the agent for the Turkish government, to give orders in London—I gave them my direction, 89, Stamford-street, and Aime and Boisserolle called on me and looked at several patterns—they said there were one hundred dies to order, and they would give me the whole order—the first dies were 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a pair, if I had the whole hundred I said I would do them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they gave me three patterns, the patterns of the coins here produced—I had given back the coins that were given me in March—these are the coins that Aime and Boisserolle gave me—I was ordered to prepare dies from those patterns—they said when I received the dies from Mr. Davis I was to begin—I received the dies from Mr. Davis, about twelve dies—I engraved six pair, which was twelve dies—I returned four of them to Mr. Davis; these are them—they are the obverse and reverse sides of a piastre—I afterwards prepared two pair of dies from each of the other two coins—I gave those eight and the coins which I had received to Whicher, the officer, about the middle of October—while I was engraving those dies, Aime and Boisserolle called on me—they saw the first dies, those which I gave to Mr. Davis, but they were not finished when they saw them—I saw the elder prisoner, Reverdy, in the beginning of July at 8, Chapel-place, Cavendish-square; there were Reverdy, Aime, and Boisserolle—I had not then begun to work on these dies—I never did execute the other dies—I never saw Reverdy about these dies.</p>

Vivians at Birmingham, and an order was given to me for Messrs. Vivians, for fifteen tons of copper—it was to be delivered in Liverpool to the care of H. Reverdy, the elder prisoner—Aime spoke English, Reverdy spoke very little English, Boisserolle did not speak English at all—Aime said Boisserolle was to pay for the copper, but how it was to be paid was to be settled with Mr. Smith—I saw Boisserolle give some money to Reverdy—I should think as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were five tons of this copper delivered at Liverpool to the order of Mr. Reverdy—Aime said he thonght he should go to Egypt—I asked him what he wanted this quantity of copper for, and his reply was to make belts for the Turkish Army.</p>

On 27th July I received a message and went and saw the prisoner Aime—he took me to a house in Chapel-place; I there saw Boisserolle and Reverdy—Boisserolle spoke in French; he said they wanted medals—he showed me the coins here produced—when I saw them I said they were Turkish coins—he said it was no use to inquire what they were—he asked me if I could do it—I told him yes; and I gave him the price, but I said I had better take time to consider, and I was to give him an answer in a day or two—I met Aime on the next Monday morning, and he asked me if I could make the medals—I said yes, I would make them—he then said he did not want me to do it; he had given them to Thomas to make—he then asked me if I would make him a sketch of a medal, representing our Saviour being baptized by St. John in the river Jordan—I said I would—on 8th August, I saw Boisserolle and Aime—I received a note to go and take the sketch, but it was too large, and he gave me this coin as a size—this is a piastre—this die represents my sketch—these are the two dies of the intended medal.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Price's-terrace, King Edward-street, Westminster-road. My family live in the next house, No. 2. About 6 o'clock on Sunday, 14th November, I went from No. 1 to No. 2, and while I was there I thought I heard a slight rumbling noise at No. 1. I returned to No. 1 at about 7 o'clock—a private door from the back garden leads into it—I went in by that door—I found that the back-door leading into the garden had been forcibly opened; the latch was destroyed—I ascended the kitchen stairs and heard a noise like the drawing of some boxes, or something of that kind, from under the bed—I went into the back-parlour and found the cheffonier doors wide open, the easy chair disturbed, a large cupboard opened, and all my papers disturbed and strewed about—a silver-edged piece of plate was removed from the sideboard where it had been standing, to another place—I still heard the noise upstairs—I went out to get assistance—I returned without any, and went on to the landing of No. 1—the noise upstairs still continued, and I called out, "You had better come down, I know you are there"—after trying to open the landing window, a man came down stairs; it was the prisoner Regan—he came down the landing by the street-door, where I was—he threw something at me, and tried to get away—I returned the compliment with a stick that I had—I had a lantern with me—I saw him most distinctly, and swear posi<lb/>tively to him—I only saw one person come down—I found that the front door was broken; the back door, and all the windows were open—the front door has a Bramah lock—the locks of both the front and back doors were forcibly brokep open by a crowbar. I missed a waistcoat, a cigar case, a scarf, and some spoons—I have since seen some of them—they would cost me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to replace—I am perfectly sure that the doors were all fast when I was in the house before.</p>

From information I received I went to Price's-terraoe—I there saw a man come out of No. 1—it was the prisoner Attwood—I am sure he is the man—he came from the front door and called out "There he goes, there he goes!"—he ran away, and I went after him calling "Stop thief!" as loud as I could halloo—a hackney carriage attendant came up and stopped him—I did not lose sight of him until he was stopped—I suppose I was 10 or 12 yards from him when he was stopped—I kept him in view the whole time—I said, "I take you on suspicion of coming out of 1, Price's-terrace—he said, "Oh!"—that was all he said—he was so out of breath that I do not think he could say anything else—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a knife, a tobacco-stopper, and four lucifers. The inspector asked him whether there was any border on the scarf—he said, "No"—there appeared to have been a border on the scarf, or something, that had been cut off—I afterwards went to the house, 1, Price's-terrace. A crowbar was produced by <hi rend="italic">L</hi> 170—I did not see it found—I compared that crowbar with some marks on the back and front doors of No. 1, and they corresponded—I think the entrance had been made by the back door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 244). I was on duty on Sunday. 21st November, at Spread Eagle-court, Rotherhithe, about a quarter past 11—I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the court and went to stop it—there was a mob of about fifty persons—I dispersed them as well as I could at first—I went away a short time and then they commenced again, and I went back—I apprehended one person that was the principal cause of the <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—the mob being so strong, he was rescued from me by the others—during the time he was being rescued, Berry said, "We have got the old b—down here now, and we will pay him," and with that, Mahony picked up a large piece of brick and threw it at me, and hit me on the nose and made me quite insensible at the time—Mahony left the court for a short time—he returned home again—I afterwards saw him go into his house—I got further assistance from the station—I went to the house and tapped at the door—I could get no admittance that way—I took hold of the top of the shutters which were very slackly fastened, forced them, and went into the house—I went up stairs and found him in bed with two small children with his boots and trousers on—I told him I wanted him for assaulting me, and I took him—he said nothing—I went down to the surgeon after that, and had my nose dressed—when I returned to the station, Berry was brought there by another witness—he was in the mob the whole of the time—he tried to rescue Mahony on the road to the station—I told him I should charge him for attempting to rescue Mahony—he said that he never attempted to do such a thing—he tried to pull Mahony away on the road to the station—Boyle struck me two or three times in my face with her fist, white I had got Mahony in custody.</p>

               <p>there—the prisoner said in my presence that she was pregnant—the doctor said, in the prisoner presence, that she was to be kept perfectly quiet—I remained with her on the Monday night—on the following day she was de<lb/>livered of a dead child in my presence—Mr. Masters delivered her, Mr. Stokoe's partner—Mr. Stokoe was not at home—he came in directly after the delivery—the delivery was somewhere about 1 o'clock—the prisoner was in the house at the time—I continued in attendance on the deceased until she died—on the Tuesday the prisoner went out about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—in the evening Miss Booker called in to see how the deceased was, and she begged her to stay, and she did, and remained that night—the deceased was very ill indeed that night—the prisoner returned about 1 o'clock at night—I was sitting up—Miss Booker and I were both up in the bed-room—when he returned he came into the bed-room—he asked the deceased how she was—she said she was better—he did not say anything else particular then—he appeared very comfortable and quiet; he pulled off his coat and hat, and sat down and had some gin-and-water—I believe he had two glasses—he smoked a cigar with it—he sat up until 4 o'clock—he was quiet all that time, and in conversation—at 4 o'clock he flew in a violent passion—I do not know for what cause—there was a cat in the room at this time, and the noise that he made caused the cat to leave the room and go down stairs—he got up from his chair—he was knocking and stamping about, and hallooing—when the cat left the room he ordered Eliza Little to get out of bed, calling her d—d wretch, saying that she had done something to the cat—he called her many other names, such as a villain and a hound—he then threatened that if she did not get out of bed and go and look for the cat he would murder her—he was then at the foot of the bed—he told her that if she did not get out of bed and go and look for the cat he would kill her—he had a stick in his hand at that time, which I took from him—it was a walking stick—when he ordered her out of bed, she said she would not go—he told her that he would make her—she then, through his violent threats, got out of bed—she put on two petticoats—when she was out of bed in the room he threatened her; he said he would kill her—that was before she put the petticoats on, and after he said that he would murder her—he said that without saying any thing else, at least we were so intimidated and frightened we hardly knew what he did say—I reasoned with him, and begged and entreated of him to be quiet and not to touch her—I tried all I could to keep him quiet—after she was out of bed and had put on her petticoats; he drove her down stairs to look for the cat—he drove her with his violent threats—I believe that he pushed her in the first instance—I was trying all I could to keep him back, I saw him lift his hand to push her—it is only a four-roomed house—this was the front bed-room on the first floor—Eliza Little went down stairs—the prisoner followed her—I went down stairs also—she got to the street-door and tried to get out—she screamed "Murder" in the passage down stairs—I did not see him do anything to her in the passage, no further than driving her through the passage—I do not think he touched her at all—he ordered her through the passage into the kitchen to look for this said cat, because he said she had done something with the cat, and she had not been out of her bed—she went into the kitchen—that is on the same floor as the passage—the prisoner followed her there—taking up a pair of tongs from the back parlour fireplace, he threatened to strike her with them and kill her—he called her a d—d wretch, a villain, a hound, and a dog—when he took up the tongs he said</p>

               <p>to be quiet, nothing of the kind—it was about 4 o'clock when he made the noise and frightened the cat out of the room—he did not miss the cat before that—it was the noise that he made that frightened it out—the cat was sitting by the side of the fire-place, on a chair—it did not go out of the room till he commenced making the noise, but as soon as he commenced making the noise—as soon as he missed the cat he complained of it—I looked for it; he did not—I looked for it of my own accord bcause I wanted to quiet him—he did not assist in the search—he did not take the stick in his hand and poke about the room, searching for the cat—he did not, before he made use of the language I have alluded to, complain over and over again about the cat being missing—it is not the fact that he left the room first, and that Mrs. Turner got out of bed and followed him while he was raving about the cat—she did not follow him—she was the first that went down the stairs—he ordered her to get out of bed—he was on one side of the bed as she got out of the other—he positively ordered her to get out of bed—she said, "Don't take on so about the cat, it is somewhere about the house, you need not be afraid of that"—he still went on raving about it—he drove her down the stairs—I mean to adhere to that—he did not take her by the shoulder and push her down—he did not put his hand upon her at all—she went to the front door and tried to get out, and then she screamed "Murder," very loud—the neighbours in the next house heard it—she was then in the passage—she did not open the door because she was in such an exhausted state—I swear that she screamed out "Murder" over and over again—I cannot say how many times—I stated so before the coroner—I do not know that I have stated it to any one except at the inquest—I do not think I have stated it to any one who is here—I believe I stated before the coroner, that he said that if she did not die that day he would kill her dead—I have not named it to any one before to-day, it is not a pleasant thing to name—I told it to the coroner—what I stated was taken down in writing and read over to me, and I signed it—it was read over to me in order that I might see there was no error in it, and I took care that there was no error in it—I mean to pledge my oath that I gave that evidence before the coroner, and heard it read over to me—I stayed with the deceased until she died—after that morning the prisoner continued his attention and kindness to her as before—that conduct was not resumed until the middle of the Wednesday—from that time until her death he was kind and attentive, as kind as man could be to woman who was suffering.</p>

On Monday, 8th November, I was sent for to 20, Attwell-road, to see Eliza Little—I do not know who fetched me—I found her in bed—the prisoner was in the room—he told me that she was ill, and I examined her; I found that she was very ill—she was suffering from peritonitis (inflammation of the covering of the bowel)—she had a cough—I was told that she was pregnant—I think it was the prisoner that told me so, but I am not certain—at that time she was seriously ill, and in danger—this was a little after 7 on the Monday evening—I prescribed for her, and told the prisoner that she was seriously ill, and that it was necessary to keep her very quiet—I cannot recollect what he said to that—I went next day a little after 1 o'clock; she had then just been confined by my partner—I saw the foetus—I should suppose it was a five months' child—the prisoner was not present then—I saw Mrs. Horsley, and gave directions—she was still very ill—I saw her again in the evening about 9 o'clock—she was still very ill—I don't think I saw the prisoner there—next day I saw her again about 11 o'clock; I found her worse—the prisoner was not in the room then, but as I was leaving the house, I heard a scream from the deceased's bed-room—Mrs. Horsley came down to me in the passage, and requested me to go up—I did so, and then found the prisoner in the room—he was in a passion, and was upbraiding the deceased with regard to to her conduct—I stopped him, and said I had nothing to do with that, that</p>

               <p>it was not a proper time for him to make any remarks to her; that she was dangerously ill, that she was under my care, and I oould not allow it—his violence coutinued, and he said he would not be bullied in his own house, and threatened to knock me down—I told him his conduct was such, that a policeman ought to interfere; I did not consider he was in a fit state to remain with her—I said I should speak to a policeman, and left the house—I called again the same evening, the deceased was still very ill—I continued to attend her until she died, on the Saturday morning—I understand that she died about half-an-hour after I left the house on Saturday—my partner afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination in my presence: the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi>, which is the covering of the bowel, was in a state of inflammation—there was a false membrane covering that peritoneal covering of the bowel, and <hi rend="italic">pus</hi>, or matter, in the cavity of the abdomen, the consequence of inflam<lb/>mation—the chest, lungs and heart were healthy—in my judgment, the cause of death was inflammation of the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that she was labouring under this inflammation on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the same disease continued—compelling her to get up on Wednesday, about 4 o'clock, and going down-stairs into the passage and kitchen without shoes or stockings, then putting on a pair of boots, and returning to bed in five or six minutes, must tend to aggravate the disease—it would so aggravate it as to make it operate fatally more quickly than it otherwise would have done—it was a dangerous disease—I cannot say that it would tend to make a disease fatal, where it would not otherwise have been fatal; but if it was a fatal disease, it would make it fatal more quickly—one womb was not inflamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you say that the getting up, under the circum<lb/>stances that have been detailed, might have aggravated the disease, or do you say positively that it did so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would aggravate the disease; she was worse the next morning and the presumption was that it did so—she was very bad when I saw her on the Monday, and also on the Tuesday—the disease was going on; it was progressing to its climax without any arrest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the state in which you saw her on the Wednesday after this alleged going down-stairs might have existed if she had not got out of bed at all during the night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think that the getting out of bed increased it—if I had not heard anything about her getting out of bed, I should not have been surprised at the state in which I found her on the Wednesday—I was not told by Mrs. Horsley about her getting out of bed—I was not made aware of it until after the death—I attended her from day to day, twice a day—I found her worse on the Wednesday—I anticipated that—some inflammatory diseases are more rapid and some less; I presumed that her state on the Wednesday was consistent with the progress of the disease, although she had not got out of bed at all—she was worse than I expected to find her, from the state in which I left her on the previous night—I considered her in danger from the first—she died from inflammation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing it to be true that she was forced, during the Tuesday night, to go down-stairs in the cold in the manner described, would that in your judgment, have been sufficient to produce the additional state of illness in which you found her on the Wednesday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is probable—I do not think that a person in her state could not have done so without aggravating the disease, by driving the blood from the external surface on to the diseased surface, and producing congestion—that would tend</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185811220144"/>
               <p>to aggravate the inflammation—the moving her in such a state would also tend to aggravate the inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that there was, and he should leave it to them in this way: that if they were of opinion that such coercion was exercised as amounted to an assault, and that her death was hastened by the consequences of the exposure to cold which she was compelled to undergo, it would amount to culpable homicide.</hi>
