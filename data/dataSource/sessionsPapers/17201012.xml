             deposed, that he came with his Wife from Rotherhith (where they Live) into the City, and parted with her at the Still-Yard; that she was going to Mr. Bladen's in Hatton Garden to receive some Money, but that he did not know Mr. Bladen himself, he being a Mariner and not acquainted with his Wife's Dealings.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart confirmed what Mrs. Cole had before deposed, as to the Moidores and her coming to him, and his going with her and the Waterman (Roberts) to Mr. Murrel's, and what past there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Murrel deposed, that he knew Roberts, and that he came with Mrs. Cole and Mr. Hart to his House to enquire for a Thief taker, confirmed what Mrs. Cole swore before relating to what pass'd in his House, and farther deposed, that when Mrs. Cole came from the Prisoner's House with his Wife, and had seen them, and declared that she was positive they were the same Persons who invited her into the Boat to them, that he then said there was no Occasion for a Thief-Taker, he would be Thief-Taker himself; for he would send for them to his House, whither he was sure they would come, and then have a Constable and secure them; he also gave a bad Character of Mr. Tompion and his House.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Murrel confirmed Roberts, Hart, and Mrs. Cole's coming to her House, and the Prosecutor's telling her Story as before, and that when she heard her Description of the Persons, she (this Evidence) said it might be the Prisoner's for she (Ann Tompion) was reputed to be the most ingenious Pick-Pocket in London. That she went to the Prisoner's House under pretence of Borrowing a Sword for her Husband; that they were not then at Home; but she went in and up Stairs, where she found one Woman washing of Clothes, another washing her Feet. That sometime after she went again with Mrs. Cole (to whom she had lent her Riding-Hood) and found them both at Home; that she told Mr. Tompion her Husband desired him to lend him a Sword, and that he would let it be a good one, to which he readily consented, and brought her one with a Silver Hilt, saying there's a Sword will see the Devil out. That when Mrs. Tompion saw Mrs. Cole (though conceal'd as much as could be in her Riding-Hood) she ask'd who she was; to which this Evidence reply'd, a Friend of hers she met on Ludgate-Hill, whereupon Mrs. Tompion turn'd away her Face, that she then had on a Suit of Callicoe, but when she was taken she had a Gown of her Husbands on. That when they came out Mrs Cole declared that she was sure they were the same Persons who were in the Boat with her.</p>
