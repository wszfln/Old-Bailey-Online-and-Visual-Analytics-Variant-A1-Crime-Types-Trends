On Sunday evening, the 9th of January, I went to see an acquaintance not far from the prosecutor's, in the same court where he lives; I think they call it Hoxton-square; I went there to buy a candle, and gave the prosecutor half-a-crown to change, and he refused it, and said it was a French one; and I took it out of his hand, and said, if it was, there was a fleur de lis upon it; I looked at it, and said, it is not a French half-crown, for it is a King William and Queen Mary; and he scrupled it then; and I shewed it to his wife; and then he gave me the change; I said then I should know the half-crown among a hundred; to the best of my knowledge, when I took such particular notice, I thought it had a kind of flaw in the silver.</p>
               <p>Was it smooth on each side? - Remarkably smooth on the plain side, where the heads were not; my husband gave it to me on the Sunday morning; I did not take any notice of it till Mr. Ree refused it: (looks at it): to the best of my knowledge I think this is the half-crown; it is hard to swear; but I could almost take upon me to swear it.</p>

I said I had change for half a guinea; says they, have you any half crowns? I said, yes; one: a man in the watch-house said, I believe this is my half crown; says I, swear to it if you think proper; I said, I had a small quantity of silver besides; I was locked up in a cage in this watch-house; I was there three quarters of an hour; then this Armstrong came and said, I believe I know you, says he; says I, I am just come from sea; I have not been in London: I took part of my money out of my pocket, and he took part, and the prosecutor was there, and Armstrong said, now tell me what you have lost? says he, to the best of my opinion I think three or four shillings-worth of halfpence; have not you lost nothing else? says Armstrong; yes, says he, half a crown: he went home to see; and Armstrong said, cannot you swear to this piece of a halfpenny? I said, says I, Mr. Armstrong, I took you to be a gentleman; I see plainly now what you are; you belong to the justice; you want to swear my life away: the next morning I was taken before the justice; he asked me what I had to say? I told him that was not a place for justice; says Harper, who was there, you villain, do you know what you are saying? says he, you villain, I will knock you down; says I, it is no service to say any thing at all. I have not a friend in the world; I have not been at home for six years; my chief witness when I got change at this publick house, he was a rider, a traveller; I sent a letter to this place, and they said, it was unknown when he would be at home; I subpoened him. When the man gave me the half crown, he said, this is a very pretty half crown, it will serve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160007"/>some of your girls; they like such half crowns.</p>

I was in the Strand this night, and received information of a robbery by six men, between eight and nine; that the man was watering the horses, and was robbed by six men; then I enquired where the coachman was; they told me he was gone home, and that the man was the prisoner; I enquired his character, and where he lived; I went to his house, in Orange-court, Drury-lane, not a quarter of a mile off; I could go there and back in five minutes; I knocked at the door; the prisoner came out; I asked him if his name was not Evans or Jones? he appeared to be drunk; I said I had a parcel to go into the country, but you are not able to take care of it; he still persisted he was not the man; but I rushed into the back room, on the ground floor, and perceived these things laying on the floor; he shammed drunk, and knocked me down; we got a light, and we secured him; then I searched all parts of the house; and some of the things I found between the bed and the sacking; some in a little bit of an old box, distributed about; he said it was his house; I have all the things here.</p>

               <p>Another coach came in on the stand;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160013"/>and he called me to get some water: and Fry was looking into the boot; he said he lost a box; I said I knew nothing of it; being the usual hour to go home, I went up Drury-lane; I saw two men very much in a flurry, one with a bundle under his arm, and some loose things; I went to him, and said, where did you get those things? one of them knocked me down, and I called stop thief! they heaved down the things, and went away; I took them home, intending to come down to the stand to make an enquiry; in a minute these people came down and took me.</p>

               <p>Was not the person you saw at the magistrate's, an utter stranger to you before you saw him in the Park? - I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>I am in the wine and brandy trade, in Bishopsgate-street. I was in the passage leading to the Court-yard, last Thursday evening, near half past four; and just before the Duke of Gloucester came to his carriage, I felt a violent motion in the passage; I thought the motion was a made one, and suspected pick-pockets; and immediately the prosecutor bawled out, and gave me to understand he was robbed; and I collared the prisoner; and then he looked on the ground for some of his property; and the prisoner made a struggle to get away from the brother, and fell against me; and some of the money, gold and silver, fell on my foot; I saw both gold and silver, but could not say the quantity; it appeared to me to fall from the prisoner; but I cannot say positively, for I did not see it fall from his hand; the prisoner was close to me; I stood near to him; he was telling the person who had hold of him, that it was not him; he came right against me; and I imagine it was the shock he received by that fall, threw the money out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Was there any person so near as the prisoner? - None; but there was another person that seemed to be interested in the affair, with him; which I suppose by his being so anxious to get up to him; he seemed as if he would rescue him; he pushed with his elbows, and got through a great many people, and got quite up to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I take it for granted, upon the outcry, that many persons pressed to see who was the offender? - Many persons could not press.</p>
               <p>How big is the passage? - I think I have had the pleasure of seeing you in the Palace-yard.</p>
               <p>I fancy you are mistaken; I am more acquainted with the geography of courts of justice, than with palaces. This person did not attempt any thing like a rescue? - No, he did not; the money fell before.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the jury. The situation I am in, and the troubles of a distressed mind, has rendered me incapable of addressing you in the manner I could wish; but, gentlemen of the jury, you think it a duty incumbent in me to state to you the reason of my being at the place where this unfortunate affair happened. Gentlemen of the jury, on the 10th day of February, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I had a note to go to Brentford, with an order for three hats; I took the note to the White Horse Cellar, in Piccadilly, and gave it to one of the men that drive the Brentford stage, to be taken to Mr. West, hatter, of Brentford; in my return back to my own house I stopped a few minutes to see the Duke of Gloucester get into his carriage: gentlemen of the jury, the prosecutor come down the passage with several people following him, and pushed himself in order among the people, to see who it was that was getting in the carriage. Gentlemen of the jury, I observed a man that I thought was rather too intruding, and pressed much upon the gentlemen, which I took particular notice. The gentleman had not been there above two or three minutes before he cried out, in broken English, my guineas! my guineas! and took hold of me as I stood by him. Gentlemen of the jury, I told him it was not me; but it was that man in the brown coat, and requested that they would lay hold of him; but the gentleman not understanding English, did not know what I said: gentlemen of the jury, I still cried out, lay hold of him, and rushed myself as forward as I could, in order to secure him; when he found that, he dropped the money from his hand, which caused a great consternation amongst the people, for many was down to pick up the money, which gave him an opportunity to make his escape. Gentlemen of the jury, I told him I would give him every satisfaction that he would require. I was asked what money I had in my pockets by the people present; I told them I had five guineas and a half in gold, and a quarter dollar in silver, in my fob pocket, underneath my watch; my watch chain was hanging out at the same time. Gentlemen of the jury, I was taken to Bow-street, and was asked there what money I had about me; I told them the same as I said before, which they found to be right. Gentlemen of the jury, I have a wife much opressed with grief and trouble at this unfortunate affair: I have a son at the age of sixteen, which I have put apprentice to a respectable gentleman in the city of London: it is for their sakes, gentlemen of the jury, that I plead to you for justice. Gentlemen, my circumstances in business has rendered me capable of living happy and comfortable, therefore I could not think of committing an act of this kind, when I was not in distress. Gentlemen of the jury, I am now at the age of forty-seven years, and from my earliest days down to this unhappy time, that my character was never brought into question before; gentlemen of the jury, I have a few friends that will appear to my character; they will tell you that I have transacted business for them with honour, punctuality, and honesty. Gentlemen, before this unfortunate affair happened I was going into business with a gentleman in the country, whose business I have carried on in town for some years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called fifteen witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>

My mother said to me, go and see if your shovel is done: at the end of St. James's-street, I saw two young men with this coat; and they asked me if I wanted to buy a coat? I told them yes: that my mother had been speaking to me, if I saw a tidy coat, she would buy it for me; they asked me six shillings: I told them to come with me to my mother: I took the coat under my arm, and went to see whether my shovel was done: they went along with me, and stood at the door: I went in to know if my shovel was done, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160018"/>patrole followed me in: he asked what I had? I told him a coat; and as soon as those men saw I was taken hold of, they ran away, and they took me into custody.</p>

            . On Monday, the 31st of January, between seven and eight in the evening, I was on duty in Hyde Park; I saw three men pass at a distance towards Grosvenor-gate, a very small distance from Lord Harrowby's; the hindmost man appeared to have something on his head; I immediately went after them, and stopped the last man, which is Rees, and sent Cridland, the other patrole, to go after the other two; the man I stopped, had his coat buttoned, and a smock frock over it; he had this lead under his coat: Brothick, another of the patrole, was with me, and took this piece which was on his head; Cridland brought back the other two men, and I secured all three; the third man was discharged, no lead being found on him; I went with Mr. Banner the plumber, the day after, to Lord Harrowby's; and we fitted the lead together with Mr. Serjeant; we found it exact; it was not half a quarter of what was wanted; I found a knife on Goodman.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber. On the 1st of February, I was seat for to replace some lead that had been stolen from the flat in Lord Harrowby's kitchen; I found five sheets had been cut, part of which was taken away; and I understood some lead was at Bow-street; and I ordered that the lead on the flat might not be removed till I had been in Bow-street; I went there, and was shewn some lead; and Mr. Shallard and me took the lead; in a coach to Lord Harrowby's, and opened it on the flat in four separate pieces, which matched; three of them to the lead that was cut, and one of them to the knot in the board, by a mark of turpentine; as the lead lay there, matched to the others with a knife, I cut off these two pieces with a knife which was found in Goodman's pocket, the shape and strength of which was very convenient for the purpose; I have not the least doubt but that lead was cut from this flat: I suppose, at least, twelve hundred pounds weight was taken away; this is a gross hundred and eighteen pounds, which is one hundred and thirty pounds weight; there is an open railing into the park, through which the lead might be handed.</p>

               <p>I had been at Kensington with a letter; I was coming back; and close by Lord Bathurst's house, I saw these three pieces of lead lay; one was tied up in a handkerchief; I picked that up, and opened the handkerchief, and saw it was lead; and I took the other piece and put under my arm, to find the owner; and just by the bason in Hyde Park, Goodman passed me, and bid me good night; and another young man passed me afterwards, and bid me good night; in two hundred yards I saw Sir Sampson's officers stand by the bason; and that gentleman, Shallard, immediately asked me what I had there? I said it was lead; he asked me who the other two men were? I told him I did not know; I told him there was another piece behind; and I asked him to go the bason again, on the night this was missing; I was about thirty yards off.</p>

Miss Burney, a lady who has the honour of attending her Majesty, has apartments at the Queen's house: the prisoner had been formerly in her service; he knew the apartments and the property, and how to gain access; but I believe, at the time when the present felony was committed, he was not in her service; the felony was certainly committed on the 25th of January last. Gentlemen, some time in February following, a Mr. Heather, to whom the public have been in very many instances extremely indebted, as a pawnbroker, was applied to by the prisoner, who pulled from his pocket several pieces of silver; Mr. Heather immediately suspected him; he searched him; and in his pocket he found other pieces; he gave immediate notice to Sir

Macmanus said it was impossible for him to say; probably he might be hanged; but told him the best thing he could do, was to tell all he knew; in consequence of that he then made the discovery, which I humbly conceive would have been better for him to have made to day; that he was walking in St. James's Park; he saw this property; he was in extreme distress, and was tempted to go into those apartments to take this property; I shall therefore call to you the maid of Miss Burney, who discovered the nossels of the candlesticks being taken away; the consequence of the discovery made to Mr. Macmanus; he likewise told him the place where he resided; he immediately went to his apartments; and there some other property was found, bearing the royal arms of England. You, gentlemen, will hear the evidence, and then there can be no doubt in your minds of his guilt.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I saw him at the office; I heard him tell Sir Sampson that he found those first pieces of silver, rolled up in a paper, in Tavistock-street; Sir Sampson asked him several questions, and desired me to go oyer with him into the back parlour at the Brown Bear; and I talked to him a great while; and he still continued in the story that he told Sir Sampson; then I said I must go to St. James's; and he said, whatever gaol I go to, you will come and see me; I shall want to speak to you; then he desired me to put out the keeper of Bridewell's servant, who was in the room, which I did, and he went out; then he told me it was the Queen's plate; that is, the pieces that he before said he he had found; he asked me, what do you think they will do to me? I said, why what is found upon you will very likely cast you for death; and denying the rest will do you no good; it will only make you more roguish; then I told him to say no more; and Sir Sampson sent for him, and asked what he had to say? and he turned round to me, and said I was to speak to Sir Sampson; and up in a garret, No. 27, Denmark-street, in a room of Mrs. Coltaines's, who used to wash for him; I found her lodging there; I went up stairs, to the top of the stairs; and I found a trunk there which I took to Bow-street; and the prisoner gave me the key; the prisoner had before that told me he had a trunk in that room, in the garret; I recollect now, Morant gave him the key, and he gave it to me.</p>

               <p>Morant. I took his keys from him, amongst which was this key.</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I found these in the trunk.</p>
               <p>(One silver nossel, a pair of silver snuffers, and stand, produced.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Goter. I believe these are things I left in the room.</p>
               <p>- WILLIAMS sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the silver scullery; I deliver out the plate to the several apartments. Miss Burney had a long while in her care, four candlesticks, a pair of snuffers and stand; these are the same I delivered to her: (looks at the three pieces of plate which Mr. Heather shewed him, and the little piece that Mr. Heather found in his pocket): that has no mark; but the royal arms are on the other; and the royal arms are also on one of the pieces taken by Morant; there are part of the arms on the nossel; they are the property of his Majesty.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Heather. Have you weighed the silver? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the value of it? - It is worth four pounds two shillings, at five shillings per ounce.</p>

               <p>As I had pleaded what I have done to Sir Sampson, when I delivered myself over to Sir Sampson and to Mr. Macmanus, I hoped he would have begged the favour of the Jury, if I was to have been tried, to have mercy on me, a poor unfortunate foreigner! necessity has drove me to it; when I went out in the morning, I had not a farthing in money; I had not a thought to go there; but this lady has been the cause of my coming down so low in this country: I came home with a gentleman, a Captain Brown; I lived with him six years; I was persuaded to go into Miss Burney's service; when I came there, I was quite innocent in a case like that; I was not there a fortnight, before I found some enemy against me; I was not there above three months; it brought an illness upon me which put me quite in confusion; I have wrote several letters to Miss Burney, that if she will say as she should say, that I am not quite right in my head at times, from illness and distress; but all I beg now, is for God's sake, if the Jury will be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160022"/>so kind to shew mercy to me, a poor unfortunate creature! and I promise to go as soon as I can get a little money among my countrymen here; I wish to go home to my native country, and never to return to England any more; I could have brought several respectable gentlemen in the city, who know me, to my character, but I had not money to send for them.</p>
               <p>Court to Macmanus. Did you go to the trunk the same day, where he told you it was? - Immediately.</p>
               <p>Was it in the office that the prisoner gave you the key? - Yes.</p>

On the 10th of February, about eleven, the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to look at some shawls; I stood a little distance from her; the porter reached them out; I came up just as he had reached them out; she asked the price of three or four different patterns of shawls; she asked me to cut her half a one; I told her we never did cut any; she then asked for a quarter of a yard of brown Holland, that lay on the other side of the shop; I turned round to come to the other counter, to shew her the brown Holland; as I turned round, she was crossing; about the middle of the shop I perceived something dropping from under her cloak; I could not tell what it was; I suspected she had stolen some shawls; I desired another person to shew her the brown Holland; and I went and examined the shawls I had shewn her; I missed some;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160023"/>I cannot say how many; I told Mr. Cooper I suspected her; she had bought a quarter of a yard of brown Holland, and was going out; I laid hold of her by the arm, and desired her to walk with me into the other shop; I told her she had got some shawls; and upon taking her cloak aside, there were three shawls; I gave them to Mr. Cooper, and he gave them to the constable.</p>
               <p>Where was the porter? - He might be standing behind a minute or so; but I think if he had been behind when she crossed the shop, he would have seen her take them.</p>
               <p>It is probable he might? - Yes, certainly he might.</p>
               <p>(The shawls produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - They cost near thirty shillings.</p>

When they brought up the prisoners I examined them; and Whitaker said, he gave three shillings for the two; Audrey said, he gave three shillings for his one; afterwards he said, they were taken in Silver-street: I believe the patrols made him promises: when he came into the watch-house again, he said he waited against the post, by the Bird Cage, the corner of Silver-street; and after that he said there was a woman with them; then he said, some of them were sold in Rotten-row: we found the handkerchiefs at the daughters of Mrs. Rogers; she delivered them up without any search at all; these are them; here are eight all in one piece.</p>

               <p>Any body trying to come in would of course have pushed you? - Then of course I should have looked.</p>
               <p>That is not the way to answer? - I felt no push.</p>
               <p>Was not Mackenzie at the time you felt the push coming in? - I felt some sort of tickling at the bottom of my belly.</p>
               <p>Would not his trying to come into court have given you that same sort of sensation? - No; it would not: my arm was up: the waistband of my breeches was extended: Mackenzie was on my side; I was nearest to the hall: nobody could come behind me and the curtain all before me: my back was out of the door: I stood fronting the door.</p>
               <p>With the curtain in your left hand, and he came to your right hand? - I cannot answer you any other, was I to stand here eight and forty hours.</p>
               <p>You are not new to this court; you have attended here very often: give me a plain answer; first of all, was his hand under your pocket? was it as my hand is now? - I caught his arm close to my side; his left hand next to my side.</p>
               <p>Was the hand under your waistcoat? - Yes; it was; the hand was not clear off my hip bone.</p>
               <p>Mackenzie made no answer about having your watch, as Gilberthorpe did? - He did not. I will not swear from whom the seals fell; but if I was inclined to swear, I should swear that they came from Gilberthorpe, because he kept fumbling: Mackenzie had only one hand at liberty; if he had any thing he could not have got rid of it only with one hand: I heard the seals fall.</p>
               <p>How long have you had that string? - About five months; I cannot see that it was cut at all.</p>
               <p>Jury. Could not you find that it was cut? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. At the time you say this ribbon was cut you say that the seals dropped off; there must have been knots to tie the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no part of the ribbon that can shew us by the sight of it, whether they fell from wear, or whether they fell from cutting? - No; there is not. I saw no piece of ribbon upon the ground: they did cut both ribbons: I told Lord Kenyon I did not see the piece of ribbon: I saw no ribbon with the seals: I am sure it was cut double, because I carried the watch, and held it up in the court; it was cut strait off; even; both parts alike.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say, that there was this remarkable difference in the answers of the two persons; when you charged Mackenzie he said, I have not your watch; when you charged Gilberthorpe he said, Sir, I have not your watch, you have your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160028"/>watch: did he assign any reason to you, or say how he came under your legs? - No, Sir; he said, let me go; I am a very good lad; I am son to an apothecary in Shoe-lane.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of February, the day mentioned in the indictment, I was in the Court of King's Bench, just within the court; there was a considerable scuffle; a noise without the curtain; which I suppose continued two or three minutes; I went out of the court and saw Mr. Thornton, the prosecutor, very much agitated; I said, what is the occasion of this noise? Mr. Thornton said, I have been robbed, and that the two people that were near him, who were the prisoners, were the people that had taken his watch; I particularly observed the string of his watch hanging out of his pocket; and I particularly observed that the string appeared to have been cut, and that there was no knot, and that I am positive of: he immediately took his hand out of his waistcoat pocket, and said, God bless me! here is my seals, my watch is safe; to the best of my recollection; I will not be positive: he hardly knew what he did: I think, to the best of my recollection, I saw him stooping when I came out of the court, but I will not be positive; and when he said, I had been robbed! I have lost my watch, I observed the string of his watch hanging out of his pocket; and I am perfectly satisfied there was no knot to it: I said, secure the people, and bring them into court; and they were taken into court immediately after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At the time you saw him, you say, you think he was so confused he did not know what he was about? - He did not.</p>

               <p>I am tipstaff to Lord Kenyon. I searched Gilberthorpe by the desire of the court; I found a large clasp knife upon him: I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Nothing was found on Mackenzie? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find this knife open or shut in his pocket? - Shut.</p>

               <p>That knife opens with two blades, one of which seems to open with great difficulty, and the other is so blunt it is a doubt whether it would cut a ribbon, or any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thornton. A man with a silver-laced hat said, there are your seals. There were five or six persons; a great many offered me assistance.</p>
               <p>Who said, there are the seals? - A person a yard from me.</p>
               <p>Was that the servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why, I thought there had been nobody with Mr. Martyr? - No more there was at first. At the moment the seals dropped, they heard them, and said, Sir, there is your seals; it was a stout man, in a silver-laced hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mackenzie. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Mackenzie called three witnesses to his character.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of February, about eleven in the morning, I was at that end of the town; I had heard the water had overflowed Westminster Hall, and that the lawyers were obliged to be taken out in boats; my father and me went: he had some business that way: I found it was no such thing, but it had been so; but they were emptying it out from Westminster Hall: the people said, it would be so again at four, when the tide came up: my father told me not to stop: I was going to return, and coming through the Hall there were some people pulling the green curtain back; I went to listen too; I asked Mr. Thornton what it was? he said, it was a trial about some dollars; he did not listen to me after; he was listening to the trial: I was trying to push the curtain, to get my head in as well as Mr. Thornton, to see; and he turned round, and laid hold of me, and said, I had taken his watch from him; and then he laid hold of this young man; says<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160029"/>he, you have got my watch? I said, no; he said, you have my seals, and they were on the floor, and he picked them up; I was searched, and stopped, and sent to Newgate; we went to the publick house, where we had something to eat; I gave the gentleman the knife; presently came in Mr. Thornton and a lawyer; he said, he had done what he had; he said, he should be very glad if he could have my boots pulled off, for there might be some other property in the boots; but the constable said, there was no room convenient; and they were pulled off there, and nothing was found in them.</p>
               <p>Court to Thornton. Did you hear any conversation between the two prisoners while you was at the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Did Gilberthorpe say any thing to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the seals nearer to the prisoner than to you? - We all stood of a row: the men were near me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Gilberthorpe called one witness to his character.</p>

            , grocer and tea-dealer, opposite the White Horse, Piccadilly. This affair happened on Sunday, the 2d of January; I was going home from St. John-street, Clerkenwell, between the hours of two and three, to the best of my knowledge, in the afternoon; and going up Holborn, I went to enquire for a countryman, in <placeName id="t17910216-24-crimeloc149">Cross-lane, near St. Giles's</placeName>

I told her Mr. Jones; she said she knew where Mr. Jones lived; I understood before I went, that he had left the public house, and lived somewhere in the lane; the old woman asked me to walk in, and I did, into a house in the court; and she asked me to sit down, which I did; and she went out of the house immediately, and left me there; the prisoner and another woman were in the room when I came in; and they asked me if I would give them some gin; this was after the old woman went out; I told them I had no money to give them for gin; I did not like gin; they pressed very hard upon me for some gin, and said if I could not drink gin, they could; then I denied giving them money for gin, and had six-pence and some halfpence in my waistcoat pocket; my hand was in my waistcoat pocket all the time; I pulled out the money, and held it in my hand; and one woman took the halfpence and ran out; and

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at No. 45, Cross-lane, Holborn; I keep a cook's shop and green-grocer's. The transactions in the court I cannot be accountable for; I believe, a quarter past two, of a Sunday, the 2d of January, I heard a great noise in Cross-lane; I opened my shop door, and I saw the prosecutor appear in a frantic mad manner in the street; he said he had lost his watch; he came up to my door, and told me; I said I am sorry for it; how did you lose it? he said he was enquiring for a man of the name of Jones, who kept a public house in the lane, of some people that stood at the end of Star-court; and he said, while he was asking this question, a woman asked him for something to drink, and he gave her a six-pence; he did not say he was in any house whatever, but that he was held by two men, while his watch was picked out of his pocket, by a person whom he did not know; them are the words he said; I refer to the prosecutor; I am master of arms to a man of war; and I have a family; he desired me to assist him, as he said I looked like an honest man; and I left him to take care of the door of the place that the woman went into (it is facing the court) while I went up to Justice Walker's; that was the house where he told me the woman had gone into; he said he had lost his watch, and would give any thing to recover it; he did not say the woman; he said the person; he did not know who it was; I went to Justice Walker's for a runner, and there was none there at the time; I met a man with a lame arm, and desired him to come with me; this man came into my house and had a pot of beer; I believe the runner stood at the door to take care nobody went out; the prosecutor could not give any particular charge of any person; he was so much in liquor, he could not find his way out of the house; there was only part of a pot of beer in my house; he had hold of my hand; he said, you are my friend, and if I could recover my watch, I would give you a guinea; and he said he would call in the evening, and go to Little Wild-street, to another runner; there are three doors to the house, two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160035"/>street doors, and one that goes in a partition between the house where Jones lived and my house; I took him by the hand and shewed him the way out; he said he would call again, and he hoped I would go with him to see for the runner, he said he could not stop, he would go home to his master and acquaint him with his troubles; he came about half past three again alone to go with me to the runner; I was not out of my house, when he came back he was so much in liquor, that I was obliged to help him to Treadway's, and there he gave such a lame account, and said he was among a number of girls, and Treadway and another refused to undertake it, because he said somebody took his watch, but he would not tell who, and at some space of time afterwards the prosecutor had the woman taken up; I had no more acquaintance with this woman, any more than the child unborn; she came into my house at times when I was out, for meat and things; I have seen her as a customer, and never knew any thing dishonest of her.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. You have heard what this witness has sworn: first what do you say as to your sobriety, after you have heard his evidence, was you sober? - My Lord, I was as sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>And do you persist in it that you had not drank any liquor that day? - My Lord, I never touched any liquor, from the time I got up in the morning till the affair happened, but milk and tea to my breakfast.</p>
               <p>Did you drink any thing in his house? - Nothing but a share of a pot of beer, that was all the liquor I had that day, besides one pennyworth, and he wanted me to join for more with him, when we went to the runners.</p>
               <p>Then you had a pot of beer when you returned with the runners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you never in his shop? - No, I never was in his house till I came back from the runners; but I saw him before, and he went with me; there was a constable came before, which was fetched by this man, I told my case to him before we went for the runner.</p>

               <p>Sullivan. My Lord, the constable came, but he said he could not take any charge, because the prosecutor said he could not tell who took his watch, only he wished to have both the houses searched.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This man has been after me now in the hall, and has offered me two guineas and a half not to speak the truth, and the truth I will speak.</p>
               <p>Sullivan. No such thing.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. What offer has that man man made to you? - Says he, Williams do not sell the woman's blood, be favourable to her, do not be blood-thirsty, do not be hard on the poor girl, and we will make your loss good for your watch; one woman will be half a guinea, and her poor mother will be something; she will do what she can to make it up two guineas and a half; he said he would be answerable I should have the money; and then he wanted me to go into a public-house to have a drop of beer, and said my trial would not come on for some time.</p>
               <p>Where was this, now? - Just outside the door.</p>
               <p>When? - To-day; and one of the gentlemen at the door, who had got a staff in his hand, he told me not have any thing to say to him, for he was pumping me, and trying what he could get out of me; I told him I had nothing at all to say to him, and went away, and walked by myself in the furthest passage door from him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell that man, Sullivan the cook, that you was held by two men while the watch was picked out of your pocket? - No, please you my Lord.</p>
               <p>What account did you give Sullivan of what had passed? - I told him there were two men came out of the house, and held me till she got away from me.</p>
               <p>That is the account you have now given? - Yes.</p>
               <p>About what o'clock was this conversation to-day? - It might be half past eleven, near twelve, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see Sullivan? - In Cross-lane.</p>
               <p>Was he at his own door? - He came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160036"/>me when I was in the lane, with a pair of trowsers on.</p>
               <p>Had you called at his house before he came to you? - No, I had not, he came up to me, and asked me how the thing was, and I told him, and he said he was my friend, I was so badly used he could not stand it any longer, and he went for a constable.</p>
               <p>What did the constable do when he came? - Nothing at all, only came to the door, and sent the people from the door; he had no warrant.</p>
               <p>What house was it you searched when you returned with the runner? - The dwelling house, where the prisoner robbed me of my watch.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether Sullivan was present at that search? - I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>At what time was it you went into Sullivan's house? - After I had been with the runners.</p>
               <p>After you had searched the other house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it true, that you was then so drunk, that you could not find your way out of his house? - My Lord, what I told you before, I was sober, and I would not tell any lie.</p>
               <p>Did you make any mistake in coming out? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>When you went up for the runner, was you able to go, or did he support you? - No further than he was his twopence to my three halfpence; I was able enough to go to any part.</p>
               <p>Was you at Treadway's? - I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Was you twice that afternoon at Sullivan's house; was you there twice or only once? - Only once, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you ever go home to your master, and inform him of this, before you went to the runner? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Sullivan so? - No, my Lord, I did not, I never told my master till the prisoner was taken; I was afraid I should be turned out of bread, and lose my place; I have been nine years with my master, and I lived at Mr. Dring's the grocer, at the Bars, and I did not like to tell him of this.</p>
               <p>But why; you had not done any thing wrong; did you make Sullivan any offer to get your watch? - I said I would rather give a guinea than lose my watch, or let my master know that I had lost it.</p>
               <p>How came it you could not find your way out of his house? - There were so many turnings, and I never was there before.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Sullivan you did not know the person that took it? - No, I never told him any such thing, nor any body else; I told the runner, and described her, and they said she was very well known at their office; (Carotty Sall) I knew her directly.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make any offer to any body that he calls his brother's boy to attend? - The boy asked me when he came to the Justice's door to give him something.</p>
               <p>Was the boy before the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What boy do you speak of? - This man's brother's; the Justice asked the boy to look at the prisoner, and see if he knew her; and the boy says yes, Sir; the Justice said, what do you know of her? and the boy said, she lives in Star-court, just where I live; I never made the boy an offer of any money at all, his brother here made him go with me, or else he would not; says he, I hope you will give me something, Sir; my boy, says I, I will give you nothing, says I; the boy belonging to the publick-house was the same boy; Sullivan's brother keeps the publick-house, and this is his brother's boy.</p>

               <p>Did you say that one woman would be half a guinea, and that her poor mother would do what she could? - I will explain that point my Lord; I made mention to you, that it was not to the purpose he described, there is one Butcher, a principal evidence, that said this man told him, if he could procure him two guineas, he would not appear at his trial.</p>
               <p>Did you make this offer to him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not say that a woman would be half a guinea? - I never expressed such a word to him.</p>
               <p>Nothing like it? - No, I did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Did you say that you would be answerable for any money to be given on that occasion? - No, my Lord, I did not, it is no concern of mine.</p>
               <p>Did you want him to go into the publick-house to have a pot of beer? - No, there was a constable that wanted him to go into a publick-house, and told him that his trial would not come on soon.</p>
               <p>Court to Williams. Was it the constable or that man that wanted you to go into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160039"/>public-house? - Please you I tell you the truth; this man, God Almighty forgive him; I take it he would say any thing, God Almighty forgive him.</p>
               <p>But you never did ask him to go into the publick-house? - My Lord, I solemnly declare before God and the world, I never expressed such a word as that; there was a constable, a hair-dresser of Marybone parish, who was here on a trial, and he it was that asked him to drink, and told him so.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you recollect his name? - I do not; he is a hair-dresser, and wore a drab great coat, I knew him before, he attends at Justice Read's in Poland-street, he is a runner belonging to that office; I cannot tell you whether he is a runner or a constable.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have had an accident with your eye, I perceive? - The night after I came from the sessions, two young fellows came behind me, and said, that is she that is against Smallwood; and they knocked me down on one side and on the other.</p>

               <p>You have lived on very good terms with her? - Yes, at times</p>

               <p>How long before? - It may be nine months ago.</p>
               <p>Were not there some other words between you? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never said you would do her the first opportunity, or something like that? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Not to Smallwood have you not said so? - Never in my life: I have heard her say to him, she would do him, but I never did say so in my life.</p>
               <p>Every body in the neighbourhood understood them to be man and wife? - Yes, they did, at that time.</p>
               <p>At the time this affair happened, did they live together then? - No, Sir; they had parted man and wifeship before that.</p>
               <p>How long after that did you say any thing of it? - Never till I went to the watch-house-keeper, and stopped the watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say any thing to any body about this but to the watch-house-keeper? - I was not sure he had the watch, till I heard him come home, and say he had left the watch there.</p>

               <p>Did he ever say any thing to you about the watch? - I made him no promise; I do not remember that he said any thing at any time about the watch.</p>

               <p>I am sister to the prosecutor. On the 19th of January, I came to the door with a bunch of greens, about eleven o'clock. The prisoner was on the step of the door, coming out; and I made room for him to pass; I came in, and my brother came out of the cellar, and said, how came the glass open? I said I did not know; I told him; I went after him; I knew the colour of his coat; I overtook him, and collared him; I told him he had stole some scissars; he delivered them to me directly; he gave me no rough usage; he said he was sorry for what he had done; I told him I did not want to hurt him, if I had my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived with Lord Monson's family, and they are out of town; I have nobody here.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether they were in the tap room when you went down stairs? - No; but they were in that room afterwards; and they were in the house afterwards.</p>

               <p>I am a lamp-lighter. I was in this public-house; and these two prisoners were in at the same time, and had been an hour or two before: when the alarm was given about this money, the prisoners were gone for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I took notice of their both going towards the bar; I thought he wanted to pay his reckoning: before that he wanted to quarrel with me, upon an old grudge; I believe we had been out together and had a pint of beer, and I would pay for it, and I thought he took a huff at it. When Mrs. Beckman found the till gone she came into the tap room, and said, her till was gone, and asked if any one had played tricks with it, as she had lost her till, and all that was in it together: in about five or ten minutes the prisoners came in with some sausages for their supper; immediately the landlady charged them on suspicion: on searching them at the watch-house we found the keys. The constable charged me to assist him.</p>

               <p>Had you frequent opportunities of observing him during the short week he lived with you, so as to know him again? - Every day he came into my own apartment; I have no doubt of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was there any key belonging to your house, that you know of, that would open that door in which the black man lodged? - Not to my knowledge; I did not know before my son told me that there was any key in the house; the prisoner said she was a <rs id="t17910216-36-deflabel226" type="occupation">lady's maid</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. She said if I would give her a guinea, she would not prosecute me? - Never, upon my oath.</p>

At the time I was taken they were offered some money not to touch me till I was flogged, so the Duke of York gave them some money that I might be punished first, and then they were to take me; I was first punished, and then turned over to them; they got five guineas as far as I understand, for not taking me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Beth, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160053"/>send your master on this errand? - No, he went.</p>
               <p>Did you desire your master to make any demand of these people for money, not to prosecute them? - No, Sir, not to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Did you agree to sell the boy a coat? - Yes, not that coat, the coat is at home.</p>
               <p>When the boy went up stairs, was it dark do you think? - Two boys lodged in the same room with me, two under-waiters, he was one at the time.</p>
               <p>Is there not a bed and table in that room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know there were other clothes laying there; were not all the clothes laying together on the table? - I know nothing of their clothes.</p>
               <p>Might not the boy take these clothes for his own? - I cannot say whether he took them in the dark or light.</p>
               <p>Did not you know that the boy's clothes were in that room? - Undoubtedly what clothes he had.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Finchman? - I believe I do.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner's father? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to take any money in order to discharge the boy? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Was there no dispute between you when he went away? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you threaten to turn the boy away? - I told him several days before, that if he was not more careful not to make mistakes, we must turn him away.</p>
               <p>Do you suppose he took away your clothes intentionally? - I believe it.</p>
               <p>Court. After this boy was turned away and paid his wages, how soon did you miss the things? - He went away without notice to any one in the house, on Friday the 28th of January, in the evening; I missed my things on the Sunday; I saw him on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Did you call on the father after you missed the boy? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did the father take you to the pawnbroker's where they were? - Yes, he did, straight to the pawnbroker, which I do not think had a good appearance.</p>
               <p>There was no offer made by the father to you of any sum of money? - No; the father said if I would take two shillings a week, he would pay it, if I would not prosecute him; I would not make him any kind of promise.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known the prisoner from an infant, I was present at a conversation with the prosecutor Mr. Fox.</p>
               <p>What passed between you? - The first time I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Fox, there was the father, me, and Mr. Welchman in the public-house; he said he would be cast for death; I said I hoped not, so I hoped he would be favourable in the indictment; he said if any of us would lay down six pounds, he would take care not to go to that length, but he would favour us; that was our conversation on that day: on Sunday morning I went over to Mr. Spencer's house, where Mr. Fox lived, and was talking to Mr. Fox about it, and Mr. Fox recommended me to speak to them to lay down the money, that he might not prosecute him, that was the meaning of it; I understood from Mr. Fox that Mr. Spencer was to receive the money, and he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160054"/>be answerable he should not hurt him; these were the very words; on the Monday morning following I saw Mr. Fox over at the Ship again, with the father and Mr. Welchman; Mr. Fox said, if we would lay down any sum, (he would not stipulate any sum) and give our joint notes for the remainder, he would not hurt the lad; the lad was in prison then, and before the first conversation; I have known the father eighteen years, and the child ever since, when he was apprentice to a taylor; I shall have no objection to take him now, if he is acquitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Beth. Did not you hear Mr. Fox say the boy would be hanged? - I heard him say if the boy was hanged, the money should be returned; but he said he would give his own note in writing that the boy should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Fox. You have sworn in direct and plain terms; it was put to you, whether the father made to you an offer of any terms, and whether you accepted any terms? is what this man has sworn, true or false; he has sworn, that you, in express terms said, if any body laid down six guineas, you would favour him; is that true? - I made no agreement with him myself.</p>
               <p>Is it or is it not true, in plain terms, what this man has said; he has sworn that you said, if any body would lay down six guineas, you would save him, and he should not be hurt; is all this true, or is it false; you denied every thing like it before? - Yes, what I said was concerning my master.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you and the father respecting favour, and whether the father offered you six pounds, or whether you would accept it? - He was to make up the loss of my clothes which were sold in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>Was there ever any conversation about the prosecuting of this boy between you, and the father? - I told the father if I could only have my property, that I would not lay the indictment so as to hurt him, I would put it under forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Was that all that passed? - That was all, and that he would make up my loss, provided I would put the indictment under forty shillings, and the things that were sold out and out, was the money that he said he would pay me, that I shold be no loser.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell me befoore (you swore it in plain terms,) that there was no offer made by the father; was there any offer not to prosecute? - No, not to prosecute, it never was mentioned, only to recover my loss back: the things that were sold, that are not to be found; the father said if I would not lay the indictment so as to hurt him, meaning to hang him, he would get friends to make up the remainder of my property; I told him I could make no kind of promise.</p>
               <p>I want to know again, whether what this man has sworn, is or is not true; he has sworn that you said, that if any body laid down six pounds, you would not hurt him; is that true or false? - That is false, it must be; I made no kind of agreement, nor mentioned none; I said that my loss was ten pounds, and that I thought the things that were in pawn were not worth more than four pounds; I did not mention any sum, my master mentioned the six pounds; I promised the father to put the indictment under forty shillings, that was all, and the father never came to bring the money, therefore I did it voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Court to Finchman. Was this promise, that if any body would lay down six pounds, he would favour him, or was any thing mentioned as to forty shillings; - No, Sir, nothing about forty shillings; he said he would not take his life; nothing was mentioned about forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you understand that he would favour his life, or not prosecute him at all? - I understood by his saying, he would not hurt him.</p>

               <p>What passed between you and him in the presence of Mr. Welchman and Mr. Finchman? - I heard a great rumour all over the parish, that he would insist on having the boy's life; I did not understand the nature of the law, and being a poor man, I got them to speak to him; we sent for Fox to the ship; he told us then absolutely, says he, Mr. Massey, it does not signify your begging the boy's life, for I must hang him; her sixteenth child was then at the breast: when he saw her in tears, and me the same, he said, if you will give me six pounds, I will save the boy's life, and if he is hanged, I will return the money to you; this I can go to death upon before God and the world.</p>
               <p>Had you any meeting lately, where he insisted on the money? - He agreed with us the same time, to meet that night at six in the evening, on Friday evening was a week; he said he could not come till Sunday; he did not come: Mr. Finchman went to him then on the Sunday evening: I met Fox on the Sunday morning; he told us then, if we would lay down any of the money, he would save the boy's life; I told him I was a poor man, I could not lay down any money; he said if Finchman and Welchman would lay down any money, he would do his pleasure, and nothing should be amiss: he did not mention the boy's life then; but he should not be hurt; leave it to him, and he would take care of all; I am sure he said he should not be hurt; I understood by what he said, that he would insist on having his life, and he should get a Tyburn ticket; he made use of the expression that he should not be hurt: that was on Tuesday morning: I do not remember he mentioned his life on Tuesday, but several times on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Fox call on you, to let you know that the boy had left his service? - Yes, he did call on me first, and said that the boy had been gone away for an hour: Fox came to me; the first word he said, he never saw me before, says he, are you Mr. Massey? I said yes; says he, I am informed your son is gone away, and taken some of my things; he said he had left his own things, and he missed some of his own things; says I, I hope he has not taken them; he asked me then, if I would be agreeable to take them out of pawn; I told him I would go with him to all the pawnbrokers, and search if they were in pawn, and do any thing else to get them; I went with him to several pawnbrokers, and described the boy, and he was with me personally, and we found all the things.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What business had you to come up to me at the Lock-up-room; you spoke to me seriously at first; afterwards you began in a storming manner, and said that you would prosecute me, and that you might swear to me at the Justice's? - I swore to him at the Justice's.</p>

               <p>Court. After he had left you, did you go back to the compting-house to see what was missing? - I was instantaneously upon him; there was only that one paper of halfpence there, besides some loose ones, so that he could not take any more; when I saw him, he was at the desk, and the door of the desk was open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How long was you out of the compting-house before you returned into it again, at the time you say you catched my hand? - About one minute.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; on the morning of the 16th of January, I was at the corner of Berwick-court, Nassau-street, a great way from Norman-street, between two and three that morning, I saw the prisoners pass by, one (Howard) having a piece of meat under his right arm.</p>
               <p>Were they both together? - They were both together, and came in company together down the street; I stopt in the middle of the street, and put my stick before them, and asked them what they had got there; they said nothing but a piece of meat; with that I passed, and let them pass; with that another man (Lovett) followed them up to where they lodged, and sent up for me to bring a light; in consequence of which we entered the premises, and found all the property in the premises; we found two legs of mutton, and a spare rib of pork, and part of a chine; they told me that they bought it at Islington; of a man that had a cart. Lovett asked him why they bought so much; they said that when people have a little money to lay out, people have a right to lay it out to the best advantage; when going along, they said they found it on a dunghill near Hanover-square.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the other man, at the time you passed him, had any thing on him or no? - I cannot positively swear, Lovet can tell more than me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the two men? - I am, I knew them before.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether one or both had bundles? - I cannot positively swear to Isaacs, because my principal object was to Howard; I am positively sure that Howard had one.</p>
               <p>How soon was it afterwards you went to the lodgings? - In a very few minutes; I dare say the lodgings was not above fifty yards to where I stopped them: it is Howard's lodgings; whether the other lodged there, I cannot tell.</p>

The cart went with them from my house, No. 7, St. George's-row, Bayswater, close to the Chapel, through Oxford Turnpike; I sent one of my people, Mr.

            , with the cart, and consigned the large trunk and the imperial to Mess. Collins and Clerson, by Exeter Change, to ship for Rotterdam.</p>
               <p>Did all the three boxes contain prints? - Not all, the greatest trunk contained the greatest part; the whole, which is mentioned in the indictment, I lost with the great trunk, except a few prints in the imperial, with two large coloured prints in stretching frames; there is not a single article mentioned in the indictment, but what was in the trunk that was missed; namely, thirteen hundred prints more or less; there were seventy-one or seventy-three dozen and an half fan mounts engraven, many of which were printed in colours, packed up in either two or threee portfolios, which were in the trunk; fifty-nine original drawings, of Dutch and Flemish masters, also in a portfolio.</p>
               <p>Of what colour were the portfolios? - They were of blue marble colour, except one or two of a white ground colour, with dark and red spots? there were five portfolios in the trunk in all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You say that on this day all the prints mentioned in the indictment were put into the great trunk; do you mean to say that you yourself put them in? - I was there and assisted.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that all those prints were put into the great trunk? - I do.</p>
               <p>What did you mean by saying, except a few? - There were two or three articles in small black frames with convex glasses, that I took out, and put into my travelling trunk, to present them, with the prints of the Orange family, to the Prince of Orange.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You said just now, that these things were put into the trunk; do you mean to say that you speak this by a written document, or by recollection? - I speak of it by the remarks then made.</p>
               <p>Then I understand you have not a clear memory of the transaction itself, but by referring to your remarks? - They were too numerous for me to keep in my memory.</p>
               <p>Where is Mr. Morant, who assisted you in putting them in? - He was in court with me, and withdrew with the other witnesses.</p>
               <p>You know nothing further then of the transaction yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you form these catalogues of the articles at the time they were put into the trunk? - They were done on separate papers, and I have copies of them here.</p>
               <p>Did you copy them yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Then that is no evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Poggi says this, that first of all he put these articles down on separate papers, and afterwards had them copied together: Now I would ask this question, whether this catalogue of the whole was put together at the same time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160060"/>Mr. Schoen. The first paper is the real evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Poggi, were these separate pieces reduced to one catalogue the same day? - No, they were not; we had not the time.</p>
               <p>Are those papers in existence? - There may be some lost; I believe I have many in my pocket, together with the original bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Who made them? - Some were made by me, some by Morant; but Morant copied them all.</p>
               <p>FREDERIC MORANT sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was you in Mr. Poggi's house and service on the 8th of October last? - I was.</p>
               <p>In what way was you assisting him in his service? - In retouching his prints.</p>
               <p>Was you employed by him on the 8th of October, in packing up for Mr. Poggi, to prepare for his journey? - I was for three days before; I wrote the greatest part of his investment.</p>
               <p>How many trunks were put into the cart? - Two trunks and an imperial.</p>
               <p>Where were they to be conveyed to? - To Mess. Clerson and Collins in the Strand; there was one large trunk which contained prints and drawings, I assisted in packing them up.</p>
               <p>Besides drawings and prints, was there any thing else? - I fancy not; they were packed up some in rolls, some in portfolios, and some loose, at the bottom of the trunk; I do not recollect there was any thing else.</p>
               <p>Have you seen the articles in the indictment? - Yes, I am certain all these things were in that large trunk; I went with the cart strait down Oxford-street; the trunks were secured by a cord; I left the cart for about two minutes or more, the corner of <placeName id="t17910216-40-crimeloc252">Newman-street, Oxford-road</placeName>

               <p>Court. You said nothing about fans? - There were fans put up in separate dozens.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Mr. Morant. You are certain all the articles in this indictment were put into this trunk; I should like to know from what your certainty arises? - On account of making catalogues of the several things I put into the trunks.</p>
               <p>Then you speak from the catalogues, and not from positive memory? - Yes, from positive memory also.</p>
               <p>It appears to me very extraordinary that you should have a better memory than Mr. Poggi himself? - I am very fond of looking at prints, and therefore I looked at the best part I put in, and so I can speak to a certainty, without referring to the catalogue.</p>
               <p>How was this trunk placed in the cart? - The last in the tail of the cart.</p>
               <p>With the rope round it? - The rope was not round it, but it went from one end of the cart to the other.</p>
               <p>In a way that it might be rubbed? - I fancy not.</p>
               <p>Court. The rope was placed across the three trunks? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you assist to put it across? - I did not, but I saw it done.</p>
               <p>How high was this trunk when it stood in the cart? - It was a very high one.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by very high? - It was a large big trunk; it might be about a yard high.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did I hear you correctly, when I heard you say the rope was cut; did it appear at the time to be cut? - I looked at the cord particularly, and found it was cut with a sharp instrument.</p>

             with me, I passed Hayman with a trunk on his head, and spoke to him, a little this side of the Talbot Inn, and followed him along the Strand; and when he came opposite Catherine-street in the Strand, he went up till we came opposite to Tavistock-street, and turned in with the box on his head; going along, about the middle, I asked him what he had got in the trunk; he went on, and I went on with him, when he threw down the trunk, and refused to go any further; this was about half way down Tavistock-street, about one hundred and fifty yards from Maiden-lane, but the direct road to it; I took him into custody, and my partner secured the trunk; that trunk and its contents are here; I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Was there any direction on the trunk? - There was, but I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether Hopkins's house was searched after this fact? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hopkins? - I know him now, but not before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. My worthy friend has asked you, but for what purpose I cannot say, whether Tavistock-street is not the direct road to Maiden-lane; and we all very well know that it is the road to Covent-Garden, to Chandos-street, to Westminster, and to fifty other places, as well as to Maiden-lane? - It is to be sure.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patroles belonging to Bow-street; on the 6th of November last, I followed a man of the name of Hayman, with a trunk, a quarter before eight in the evening; we got near to the Talbot Inn, Steward and I were together, when we met a man of the name of Hayman, whom we followed to Catherine-street, and from thence to Tavistock-street, in the middle of which he threw down the trunk, and I secured the trunk, and Steward laid hold of him; we asked him to take up the trunk, and he refused, and we took him into custody; I took the box and man to Bow-street, but it was shut.</p>
               <p>Had the box any mark on it? - There was a direction on it, but I did not perceive what it was.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - At the bottom of the trunk, there was a card or paper, but I did not see it all.</p>
               <p>You did not know Hopkins, or where he lived, before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you attend the search at his house? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you say that you should know the box when you saw it again? - I did, Morant had the care of it, till it went to the office in the morning.</p>
               <p>When was it delivered to Morant? - It was delivered to Morant that night, I believe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You had the care of the box, Steward had the care of the man, and you say that you believe the box was delivered to Morant, but you are not certain? - To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>But you are not sure of that fact; where did you deliver it to him? - Two or three of us had the care of it.</p>
               <p>Where did you leave it? - I left it at the box at the

               <p>How was it secured at your house; was it opened? - No.</p>
               <p>When was it opened? - The next day, or the day after.</p>
               <p>Was it opened before it came before the magistrate? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Was there any key produced with it? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Was it unlocked by the magistrate, or broke open? - The lock was picked.</p>
               <p>What part of your house did you put it in? - I put it in my bed-room, and I have had it there ever since, and I produce it now.</p>
               <p>That box that you produce now, is it the same box that was delivered to you when the men brought in Hayman? - It is, it was delivered to me by Croker, Steward, and Lewis.</p>
               <p>Where was it you first saw Lewis and Steward? - At Bow-street.</p>
               <p>What part? - I do not know, whether it was at the office, or at the Brown Bear, we were all together, backward and forward; it was delivered to me there, and I carried it home.</p>
               <p>On account of this trunk being produced, a search warrant was granted? - No, but a search was made, and I attended.</p>
               <p>(The box produced.)</p>
               <p>To Lewis and Steward. Is that the box you took from Hayman? - It is.</p>
               <p>To Morant. And you have had it in your custody ever since? - I have.</p>
               <p>You say a search was made the next morning; do you know Hopkins's house, was it in Maiden-lane? - It was.</p>
               <p>What number? - I forget, it is the corner of a court.</p>
               <p>Did you know his house at the time the search was made? - I knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Had you known that to be his house before? - I heard say so, but I never was at his house before.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to know from the prisoner himself, at any time, whether it was his house or not? - I did not; I did not know till I went to it.</p>
               <p>How did you know, when you went to it, it was his house? - Because there were two servants that answered, and in consequence of an inquiry I went to that house as Hopkins's house.</p>
               <p>What part did you search? - I searched it from top to bottom; I took a man whom I found in the house, and who gave me an answer, up stairs with me.</p>
               <p>Was he the man that opened the door to you at your knocking? - He was, and two women besides; the man said one of them was his wife, but only the man went up; in the dining-room, up one pair of stairs, we found some pictures in frames, some coloured, some not; they are here: some were hanging up above stairs, some below; there were two or three officers of Bow-street with me; there were Croker, and Lavender, the clerk at Bow-street; I turned the carpet up, and saw a small paper parcel, which had four drawings in it, Croker took it up; this was in the one pair front-room, which I call the dining-room.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160063"/>Was this in the presence of the man whom you took to be Hopkins's servant? - It was; these prints were under the carpet on the floor.</p>
               <p>Was the carpet fastened to the ground, or loose? - It was loose.</p>
               <p>What led you to take up the carpet? - I saw a good many things about in the gambling way.</p>
               <p>Have you got these prints here? - Croker has got them ready to be produced.</p>
               <p>There were a man in the house, and two women? - There were two men and two women.</p>
               <p>These pictures and frames were hanging up in the dining-room? - Some of them were, and some in the back-parlour, and some in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Do you know who occupies that dining-room? - I understood by the people in the house that it was Hopkins's.</p>
               <p>And as to these cuttings, what were they of? - The cuttings of prints or long strips of paper, which laid like waste paper.</p>
               <p>Where were they? - They were below, some in a drawer, and some out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You knew before this, that Hopkins lived in Maiden-lane? - Yes, but I never was at his house before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Lewis. Look at that trunk; is that the trunk you took from Hayman? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Lewis. This was pretty late at night? - It was.</p>
               <p>It was dark? - It was.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of the trunk than in carrying it to the place where you took the prisoner Hayman, till you left it on the table at the Brown Bear; now having seen it at that time, and it being a dark night, can you take upon yourself to say that that is the very same trunk? - I do, I took particular notice of it that night.</p>
               <p>It seems to me to be a trunk not very easily identified; however, you are certain, although you only saw it the time you took the prisoner Hayman, till you left it on the table at the Brown Bear; what else did you find? - Afterwards we found the cuttings of long prints in framing them, and some frames; we brought the cuttings away that time, but not the frames, till the next day.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you find them? - We found them in the shop below, which had the appearance of a shop made like a lottery-office; they were in a drawer behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else? - We only made our observations on some gilt frames, and some straining frames, and some canvas; and the next day we fetched them away; the straining frames were below, and the gilt frames in the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. This is as long ago as the 6th of November, that this trunk was brought to you; the robbery, we have heard, was committed on the 8th of October, and the 6th of November this trunk was brought: now do you know which of the three brought it in? - They were all together when I received it.</p>
               <p>If I understood you right, Croker, Steward, and Lewis, came in together, and Croker had the custody of the trunk? - I cannot pretend to say that; they were all together, that is all I can say, and they came all together to Bow-street, with Hayman and the trunk.</p>
               <p>Now you first saw the trunk, you told us at the office; was that the first place you first saw the trunk? - I do not know where I saw it first; I might get it in the street for what I know, but I know I got it of them.</p>
               <p>Now Maiden-lane, to a house there, is the place where you went; you say you did not know it was Hopkins's house? - I did not till I went to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Steward. Is that the trunk you took from Hayman? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen to Steward. How do you know it? - I know it positively, because I put a mark on it on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>At what time? - It might be nigh about half past eight.</p>
               <p>In what situation; where was it? - It was then at the Brown Bear, Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You did not carry the trunk to the Brown Bear? - No.</p>
               <p>Lewis did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time afterwards was it you made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160064"/>this mark; how long after? - It might be three quarters of an hour, that is, including the time that we stopped Hayman.</p>
               <p>Was it after Morant had it that you made the mark? - No, before.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol belonging to Sir Sampson Wright; I saw this trunk at the Brown Bear, Bow-street, on the 6th of November, one of the men informed me that they had stopped a suspicious person, and desired me to attend at the Brown Bear.</p>
               <p>Did you see Lewis and Steward in possession of that trunk? - I did.</p>
               <p>Hayman, the man, was then in custody? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you go to search Hopkins's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>When? - On Sunday, the next day.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the next day after that trunk was brought in? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you know that that was Hopkins's house, or what house was it? - No. 27, Maiden-lane.</p>
               <p>Whose house was it? - I understood by the servants, it was the house of Mr. Hopkins.</p>
               <p>Whose house did you go to enquire for? - Mr. Hopkins's; I believe Mr. Morant knew it.</p>
               <p>Who went with you? - Mr. Morant and another.</p>
               <p>Who was the other? - Mr. Lavender, the clerk of the office.</p>
               <p>Did you search the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you found? - Here are some prints that have been in Mr. Morant's custody, and I marked them; some of them in gilt frames; and four drawings, which I picked up from under the carpet; and in the shop we found some cuttings, some laying on a counter, and some laying in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Is that Mr. Poggi's trunk? - I do not know whose trunk it is.</p>
               <p>The room in which these drawings were found, was the dining-room up one pair of stairs, they were hanging against the wall not concealed at all? - No, not at all, only finding those things under the carpet.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they hung up in the room as furniture might be, or as for sale? - They were hung up in form, and not as for sale, here and there indifferently.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Hopkins? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he lived in October? - On the 28th of October he came and took a lodging of me.</p>
               <p>Did he take the lodging in person, or any body for him? - He came himself and a gentleman with him.</p>
               <p>Who was that person that came with him? - He called himself Mr. Hutchings.</p>
               <p>When they came to take the lodging, did you know the person's name that took it? - No; it was not told me.</p>
               <p>What account did he give of himself? - He told me that he was a gentleman just come from sea, and that he wanted this apartment for five or six weeks, or it might be five or six months.</p>
               <p>Did he during this time ever communicate his name to you? - Never.</p>
               <p>You let him the lodging? - I did.</p>
               <p>How long was he at your house? - One week, from the 28th of October to the 4th of November.</p>
               <p>What did he bring with him? - He brought four trunks with him</p>
               <p>Did you see him at any time after the 4th of November? - On the 6th I saw him.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time see any of the contents of those trunks? - No, nothing that was contained in those trunks: I had a chest which he borrowed to put in five or six large portfolio's, which he called the Atlas books. In a week after he came and took away three trunks, which he put inside a coach, and as there was no room, he desired to leave behind the small trunk and the Atlas books: he took away the key of the chest and of the room where the trunk was.</p>
               <p>Was the chest empty? - The chest was empty when I let him the rooms: I gave him the key: there were some portfolios, five or six of them: one of them was opened, and I saw something printed; I do not know what; they were what are commonly called pictures: Mr. Hopkins took them away, to the best of my remembrance, between six and seven o'clock at night; it was dark: at the same time a little trunk was removed, which I cannot say I know, but I should know a card that was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160066"/>bottom of it: this is like the trunk, but there is no card on it.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the name on the card? - Yes; a Mr. or Mrs. Shenton.</p>
               <p>Croker. This is the card Morant took from the trunk.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Perrins looks at it.)</p>
               <p>I believe this is the card: it is Mrs. Shenton: a porter took it away: I should not know him: nobody came but him and Mr. Hopkins: my husband knew the porter again: they both set off from my house between six and seven; that was as near the time as I can recollect: the other property was gone the 4th. The prisoner slept at my lodgings one night. Four men, one of which was Morant, and a Mr. Lavender, and Mr. Croker: I cannot say the name of the fourth man; they visited my house between twelve and one on Sunday: I had not let the rooms to any body after he went on the Saturday night, nor between the 4th and 6th, during which time he had the key.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the day on the 28th of October did he come? - About eleven, to bring his trunks: he took the lodging about ten in the morning: he brought the four trunks in a coach: nobody came with him.</p>

               <p>I am the husband of Mrs. Perrins, at No. 10, William-street, Surry side of Black Friars Bridge. I know the prisoner very well: he took a lodging of me the 28th of October, and staid a week: I was not at home: I did not see the prisoner till the Monday following: I never heard his name, or asked it, or had any conversation with him: he took the chief part of his things the 4th of November, on a Thursday: I saw a trunk or two brought down stairs and carried to the coach, about six or seven in the evening; it was dark: he begged to leave a trunk for one night: there was a chest of mine stood in the room, which he begged to use, and locked up; he fetched away the trunk on Saturday evening, about seven; it was dark; I was at home: a man of the name of Hayman came with the prisoner; they both came in together: Hayman had a lanthorn; Hopkins brought down the trunk, and Hayman carried it away: they went out together: I shut the door: he carried on his shoulder something that appeared to be portfolios, for I saw the edges without the candle: nobody had access to the rooms: he would have locked both rooms, but my wife desired him only to lock the dining room door, where the large chest and the small trunk were: he had the keys of the dining room and chest: on the Saturday night he left the key in the door: Sir Sampson's people came to our house on Sunday the 7th, between one and two: I went in with them; I begged them to search all the house, if they pleased: they asked only for Hopkins's apartment: nothing was found but some shreds of paper under the grace; Mr. Croker found them.</p>
               <p>Morant. They were burnt all to pieces: we brought none of them away.</p>
               <p>Perrins. The prisoner slept there but once to my knowledge: I never saw him go out, only when he removed on the Thursday and Saturday: I believe this is the trunk he left last of all: there was a direction on the bottom when it stood in the passage: it was a Mr. or Mrs. Shenton, and appeared to be on a printed card; (looks at the card) this is the direction: I knew the porter that Hopkins brought; I knew his name at Sir Sampson's: the man I saw at Sir Sampson's was the same man Hopkins brought to take away the trunk.</p>
               <p>(Hayman brought in.)</p>
               <p>Perrins. That is the man, I am very certain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did the trunk stand in the passage? - Mr. Hopkins set it in the passage endways, and by light of the lanthorn I read the direction, for Hopkins held the trunk endways by one hand.</p>

I said, where? he said, to No. 27, Maiden-lane, Covent Garden; it is at No. 10, Williams-street, Black Friars-road: I asked who was to pay me for it? a lady will pay you, says he; I said, who is to deliver it to me? he said, Dan: I went with Mr. Hopkins, or

No. 25, Leman Pond; where are you going with it? says I, No. 27, Maiden-lane; I was very much in liquor; whether it was liquor or not I tumbled down; this is the trunk they took away from me; I told them I was going to carry it to

This is Bacchus and Nymphs, or the Nursing of Bacchus; this is mine; it is not in the same state in which it was lost; it was in a square paper: this plate was brought to me to have my criticism on it, in the state in which it is now, by my engraver, Mr. Pestolini; I know this, because I desired my printer, in my own house, to take off a small number of impressions, in the state in which the plate then was; it is a coloured plate; it never was published; it is an impression from an unfinished plate; none of the impressions have been yet finished, and this impression is not retouched, which is always the case to make it saleable; I packed up eleven of these unfinished, in colours, and fourteen in brown in the large trunk; they were none of them finished or sold: this print is also mine; it has since been cut and put in a frame; the print is called Veillez amans si l'Amour dort: Morant, the young man, had been recommended to me; I gave him four of these to retouch,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160068"/>and I know it by that; it was not accurately retouched; this plate has been in circulation, but none in this state in which it was retouched; I am proprietor of the plate: there were no more of this subject retouched by Morant, but two, one of which is in the trunk, and two are in the trunk retouched by somebody else: this is the Origin of Painting; this has been re-touched several years ago; this is one of the first impression, and I took a particular pleasure in finishing it myself, with intention to make a present to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Look at all the rest that were found in the lodgings, and tell us what you say to them? - I have seen them.</p>
               <p>Are they all such as were in your trunk? - Exactly so; I have looked at every one: these are cuttings of margins of prints; they have been to a press; but I cannot identify them.</p>
               <p>Morant the engraver. I am certain this is of my retouching; this plate was one of those that was put into the great trunk that was lost.</p>
               <p>Mr. Poggi. I have examined all the prints in the box, article by article; they were sealed with my seal at Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>Is there any one print in that small box that was taken from Hayman but what are the same as those that were in the great box which was taken from the cart? - Not a single one.</p>

               <p>Are there many there that have not been in a state of publication? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Are you sure those that are not in a state of publication are yours? and do you believe the others to be your property? - I do affirm it: here are Bacchus and Nymphs in an unfinished state, that never were retouched nor published.</p>

This trunk was not delivered to Hayman by me, and was delivered through the instructions of the man in black; this trunk I acknowledge I did deliver to Hayman, by the order of the man that was in black; I trust that trunk is not considered as my property; the apartments where the things were found, was No. 27, Maiden-lane; the house I acknowledge is mine; but these apartments were let; it is very hard that I should be accountable for other people; I had a difference with my wife; I went and took a lodging in William-street; this man is a debtor to me; he desires me to take this trunk as a security for my money; he comes and settles with me; then he desires me to deliver this trunk to Hayman; this said person in black cohabited with a Miss Roe, who lodged in this said one pair of stairs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was a publican at the time, Mr. Hayman was at my house; I kept the George, at Colebrook, in Bucks; I live now in Middlesex, about a hundred yards from the George; I keep post-chaises. I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the beginning of October his being at your house? - Yes, I do, perfectly well, with Mr. Duck and Mr. Dixon along with him, in company.</p>
               <p>Did you make out this bill? - (A bill of entertainment shewn him.) This is my hand-writing; it was the Thursday morning, the beginning of October; Mr. Dixon came first, on the Windsor coach; I was just going to market; Mr. Dixon came first; then Mr. Duck came in the afternoon; Mr. Dixon and Mr. Duck dined with me and my wife; then Mr. Hopkins came; we got him a beef steak; I am sure Hopkins was at my house on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, till Saturday afternoon, two o'clock; and that he went in the Birmingham coach; he and Mr. Dixon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160069"/>on the outside, with a basket of fish that I had caught; what made me remember the day more particularly when they came down, was, we were going a fishing in the evening between five and six, and Mr. Duck was rather in liquor, and sell into a muddy place, being pushed by Dixon against a cow; and Hopkins was in company with us; and Duck said I shall remember coming down a fishing of a Thursday.</p>
               <p>(Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys.)</p>
               <p>How long have you known Hopkins? - About two or three years, by being on the road, and calling at my house.</p>
               <p>What was his business? - I did not know his business, nor how he lived; but he told me he lived in Maiden-lane; I was once in his house; I cannot recollect when; it was some time ago.</p>
               <p>Are you on a tolerable intimate footing? - No farther than his calling at my house backward and forward, sometimes with Mr. Hart, and sometimes with Mr. Humphreys, and other gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at Bow-street when he was taken up? - I was in London at the time, but was not at Bow-street; I happened to meet Hopkins.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he should want you at Bow-street to give this account of him? - He never told me he should want me at Bow-street to give this account of him.</p>
               <p>When was you in London, and saw him? - The same day; he never asked me to tell this.</p>
               <p>What month was you in London? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Nor what day he was called up at Bow-street? - No; I went to the play, and from thence to Bow-street; after I came from the play, I was with him at the publick-house, and then we were talking about it.</p>
               <p>Then after the examination was over, then it was that you began to recollect this thing? - I recollected it before, for it was in my mind; he did not tell me he was going to Bow street; I heard of it from other people.</p>
               <p>You said you saw him before you went to Bow street? - If I said I saw him before I went to Bow street, I made a mistake; I meant afterwards he did not tell me what he was going to Bow-street for, nor I never asked him.</p>
               <p>Then how came it to be material to talk of the cow on the 8th of October? - That was since he was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you upon what occasion he was summoned to Bow-street? - After he had been to Bow-street, he told me he was summoned there about a trunk.</p>
               <p>He told you he had been there about a trunk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you about the trunk? - Nothing particular, that I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Did he explain to you the nature of the charge upon which he was taken up? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Then how came it to be material to talk about this cow and the drunken man? - Because in case I should be called on in recollection of this man being pushed about.</p>
               <p>He said nothing more than that; that it was about a trunk? - Not to my recollection at present: I was not with him above a quarter of an hour after he came from Bow-street, and I went home.</p>
               <p>Did not this strike you as a strange thing? upon your oath, was not that a strange thing, that he had been at Bow-street on a charge of felony? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath now, did not you know that he had been to Bow-street often? - No, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Then he explained to you nothing more, than that it was about a trunk? - No, Sir, not then.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what had been sworn about the trunk? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you any circumstance of time or place, what had been sworn about the trunk at Bow-street? - Nothing about the trunk, any more than he was taken on suspicion of stealing the trunk; he told me he was taken on suspicion of the trunk, and asked me if I should remember fishing, in case I should be called upon; I did not ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160070"/>him any circumstance of time or place, nor did he say.</p>
               <p>Is it that you recollect now the month and the day of the month, from the bill that you made out? - Yes; I recollect it was the beginning of October, but I cannot recollect the day till I come to look at the bill; it was the 6th or 7th that the bill was made out for Mr. Hopkins's party; I put it in the name of Dixon, because he came first.</p>
               <p>This bill has no name of the month upon it? - It has not.</p>
               <p>Did Hopkins say, you recollect it was in October that I was at your house? - He asked me whether I could recollect what time it was? he never told me any thing about the day of the month, or day, only asked me if I could recollect.</p>
               <p>Where was this house where you had the conversation? - The conversation about the trunk was carried on at a public house in Litchfield-street; I called there for Mr. Dixon, for a whip that he promised to give me; I do not know where Dixon lives; he uses the house in Litchfield-street; I do not know what business he is.</p>
               <p>Do you know who Mr. Duck is? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in company with you when this conversation passed between you and Hopkins? - Mr. Dixon and Duck, and another gentleman that was bail for him, were there.</p>
               <p>When was this conversation held? - the same night he was bailed out.</p>
               <p>What month was it in? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long after they had been at your house? - I cannot say justly.</p>
               <p>Was it one month, two months, or three months? - More, or less, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>This is a disagreeable circumstance, is not it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was called on to recollect what had passed in the beginning of October at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was it after they had been at your house? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long is it from this time? - I cannot tell; I did not put down the day; it may be the latter end of October, or the beginning of November; I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not hold this conversation in December? - I cannot say when.</p>
               <p>Was it December or January? - I am sure it was not in January.</p>
               <p>Was it in November or December? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it early in the month, or late in the month? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was the day he was taken up? - I do not know what day he was taken up; it was the day he was bailed out.</p>
               <p>In what time of the day did you say this conversation was held? - It was a little after ten.</p>
               <p>You had not seen him before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you go to the play-house? - I went directly to Litchfield-street, for the whip he promised me; I thought to find him out; I only went to the entertainment; I staid till it was over; I came to town about eleven or twelve in the morning, and came up on some particular business of my own.</p>
               <p>What was the particular business? - That I am not obliged to tell.</p>
               <p>What was it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. I object to that question as irrelevant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Upon what private business did you come to town? - I have no reason to tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. You must assign some reason for not telling it? - I came on some business to Mr. White's, in White-horse-yard, Windmill-street, at the top of the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>What was your business at Mr. White's? - He was looking out to buy me a second hand post-chaise.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. White on this business? Yes; I employed him some time before to buy the first he could find; I saw him when I rode on my horse in the morning, between eleven and twelve; I went over to the house facing; we had sixpenny worth of brandy and water together.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was ten o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160071"/>when you came to Litchfield-street? - I said it was past ten o'clock when I came out of the play-house; I knew it by that; I returned to Colebrook that night, and was home about one in the morning; I put up my horse and chaise in Windmill-street; it was Mr.

            's.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave your house at Colebrook? - Is that a fair question? because it did not answer my purpose; I transferred my licence to one Rees at Glamorgan; he has it now.</p>
               <p>So the expression of the man that was pushed in the ditch, was more remarkable than your friend being bailed for a felony? - It came to the recollection of my mind.</p>
               <p>When was you applied to to become a witness? - Mr. Hopkins sent me a letter last Thursday or Friday; I was not at home when the letter was brought.</p>
               <p>Do you think him a pleasant man? had you a regard for him? - The man always behaved very well.</p>
               <p>You had a regard for him? - As a customer.</p>
               <p>What were you fishing for? - Roach, dace, and perch, in cast nets.</p>
               <p>A pleasant entertainment in October? - Very pleasant; I am very fond of it.</p>
               <p>You have a horse of the prisoner's now in your possession? - Yes, in my brother-in-law's fields, in Colnbrook; it was left with me the day he came; it has been there ever since, bridle and saddle; his name is Gosling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Have you any doubt that the month in which you made this bill out, was the month of October? - I am sure it was the month of October, by the man being pushed in the ditch.</p>
               <p>As to the day you saw him afterwards, you are sure it is the day he was bailed? - It was on that day; Colnbrook is seventeen miles from Hyde Park Corner.</p>

               <p>I know Mr. Hopkins: I know Miss Roe; I recommended her to lodge with the defendant some time in or about Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Did she lodge there in consequence or your recommendation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she live alone, or did any body live with her? - She lived alone in general; but my opinion of her is, that she was a woman of intrigue; I do not know it.</p>
               <p>How long did she live there? - Five or six weeks; but I cannot be particular to the week; it might be a week before Michaelmas, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did she occupy? - The one pair of stairs floor; an elegant floor; she came to me on the 8th of November, in the morning, pretty early; about nine or ten; she came to my house at Hoxton, and told me she had been a bit of a rake, and wanted me to go with her to her lodging; she had a coach in waiting then; I was going to Westminster; I went with her in the coach, to Maiden-lane, to her lodgings, at this Mr. Hopkins's; I went up stairs with her, and she took some few things away in a trifling box, which were carried to the coach, and there put them in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You then was the person that took upon yourself to recommend this lady, who you believed to be a woman of intrigue, to Mr. Hopkins, as a lodger? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Hopkins? - Some years.</p>
               <p>Of course you expected your recommendation to have weight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did she enter on those lodgings? - Some time on or about Michaelmas; I saw her there a fortnight after that; I once called upon her; I saw her at the lodging, positively, between Michaelmas and October; it was rather before Michaelmas; it was not after Michaelmas, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that it was a few days before Michaelmas? - I believe it was thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not later than Michaelmas? - It really was not, to the best of my memory; I could not pledge my word, but I am pretty sure I am right.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160072"/>How often might you be in the house? - About once.</p>

               <p>When did you call on her? - I cannot say; it was in the interim between Michaelmas and November.</p>

               <p>Was not you rejected? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was you received? - No, I was not received, because we did not justify, nor it was not attempted.</p>
               <p>What cause was that in? - I do not remember; Mr.

             was the attorney for the defendant; but they are things that I am not conversant with.</p>
               <p>Then this is the only instance in which you ever offered yourself as bail, either at Serjeant's-inn-hall, or at Westminster-hall? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - I cannot recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you are not a common bail? - Let me be sworn again; upon my oath, no more than you are; I declare positively I scorn the meaning.</p>
               <p>Have you never offered yourself as bail at Guildhall, before the Lord Mayor, and was rejected? - Rejected! I was opposed; that gentleman well knows the particulars as well as I do; I was opposed by Mr. Garrow; there is the gentleman; and I met him with truth; and facts are stubborn things; and therefore met him fairly at once.</p>
               <p>Now, was you rejected or not? - No, Sir; I do not remember; now I particularly recollect, I was not; I became bail, and was accepted for Mr. Turner; it was for a blow in the street.</p>
               <p>Then this is the only instance in which you ever was bail before my Lord Mayor? - Yes; to the best of my knowledge; I cannot speak positively; the only instance, may be it may; in my life, I might have bailed a friend besides that, and it might have escaped my memory; such a thing as that might be.</p>
               <p>Have not you been bail for a friend before the Lord Mayor in three months last? - Oh! yes; I can swear that.</p>
               <p>Do you swear that? - Yes; that I swear positively: Aye, and I do not suppose I have been at Guildhall within these three months; honest truth, that is in my breast, emboldens me to speak.</p>
               <p>How many times might you have been at Serjeant's Inn Hall last Term? you know where it is? - In Chancery-lane; is it not?</p>
               <p>Do you ask me that question as wishing to know? - I will swear that I am not particular<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160073"/>to the inns; and now, while I speak to you, I recollect it is in Chancery-lane; Sir, I am come with plain facts, to do justice between man and man.</p>
               <p>How often was you there this last term? - Not once; now that is very easily answered.</p>
               <p>Where is Miss Roe? - I do not think she entertains a wish to be here; I entertain a different opinion of her than I did; she has broke off all acquaintance with me since the 8th of November, and has her private reasons for it; I took my leave of her very suddenly; but it seemed to be very agreeable to her; she seemed to wish to be rid of my company; she had a trifling band-box with her.</p>
               <p>Have you never enquired after her since? - No; and I declare on my oath now that I have not an intimacy with Mr. Hopkins.</p>
               <p>When had you first heard Mr. Hopkins was to be tried for this offence? - Some few days; some other man came; not Mr. Hopkins.</p>
               <p>Who applied to you and gave you the subpoena? - I do not know the person; but I believe it was one Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Did you then tell him that Miss Roe had lodged there, and that it would be proper to subpoena her? - No, no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did he explain to you for what purpose you was to be produced as a witness? - No, only to give a true answer to the questions asked me, and that I could not keep off of it on account of the penalty; further than that he asked me if I could give him any intelligence of this Miss Roe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Then all you mean by being bail was for a friend? - Merely so; I am a man of a different description; I detest the idea; except to do it to oblige a friend, or if a man was recommended to me; but to be an hired bail, I detest the idea; upon my oath it is not true.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I believe I may have known Mr. Hopkins ten or a dozen years; I have known him as a publick character; a publick man; a man living in a publick line; a publick-house; as to his character, I never knew any thing wrong of him.</p>
               <p>Has he borne an honest character? - To me; I never knew otherwise; I had never any reason to impeach his character or conduct on any occasion whatever, and I have known him a great many years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Where do you live? - In Whitcomb-street, Leicester-fields; I believe it is near Hedge-lane, it goes into Hedge-lane; I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>What number? - There is no number to the house.</p>
               <p>What is the number of the next door? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - About three weeks.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before? - In Gray's-inn-lane, in Fox-court.</p>
               <p>What number? - I believe it is No. 10.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - About a fortnight, only lodged in the ground-floor.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before that? - In Fulwood's-rents, in a garret; I lived there about a year, with one Lindsey, a hairdresser, No. 10.</p>
               <p>Have you known the prisoner intimately? - Not very intimately, a waiter to a coffee-house.</p>
               <p>You have called upon him once a week? - Once a year Sir; I have no more intimacy with him than I have with you; I have seen him twenty times in different places.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him twenty times in the course of every year that you have known him? - No; very likely I may not have seen him sometimes, above three or four times in a year.</p>
               <p>If any misfortune had happened to your friend, in the course of ten years, I should think you must have known it? - I know nothing about a friend. My Lord, I wish to put an end to this tedious argument and intercourse between this gentleman and me; I know no more of the man than seeing him, dining at a public coffee-house, tavern, and public-house; there was no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160074"/>friendship, no intimacy of any sort or description.</p>
               <p>Is that the kind of man of whom you came on your oath to say that he is a man of a good character? - Pardon me, why because I have known a man ten years, and he in a friendly way calls upon me to give him a character; why should I not, as an honest man, come forward to any man here, and if I did not know so much of him as I did, why should I not come forward to give him a character.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his having been tried in the course of these ten years? - Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not I speak loud enough? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear he was not? - I will not swear about it, but I will swear it was not with my privacy.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that he was upon the ballast lighters? - My Lord, I presume it is derogatory to the business, even suppose I knew that; what is that to giving a man a character? I do not know, upon my oath, of his being confined at all on board the hulks.</p>
               <p>Do you know of his being confined on an accusation of felony within this ten years? - I do not, barring this.</p>
               <p>Who may you be? - Who may I be! I live on what I have, I do not follow any business.</p>
               <p>Did you ever follow any business? - Yes, a silver ivory turner, and tortoise-shell snuffbox maker.</p>
               <p>If any body has said that you kept a gaming-table, they must have told a great story? - What has my keeping a gaming-table to do with it? - I do keep a gaming-table.</p>
               <p>You do; good bye to you? - Do you mean to say, you have done with me.</p>
               <p>Yes? - I do keep a gaming-table, I do not deny it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have known him intimately these last two years, I take it? - I have done business for him as a carpenter, I have been employed for him about three times; his father lived within two years in Maiden-lane, and took in orders as an engraver of seals: I understood from the father that he was an engraver; I cannot say I ever saw any of his work: Hopkins has never told me he was an engraver, otherwise than from his father I never saw him at work, I saw no signs of seals cut, or any article in the engraving trade carried on; I have seen seals in the shop window, along with other hard-ware.</p>
               <p>When did you see seals in the shop window along with other hard-ware? - About six months ago.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath was not it a lottery office at that time? - No, Sir, it was not, I swear that; at that time I took the old front out, and put a new one in.</p>
               <p>You understood he got his living by his business? - I have seen him sell things out of his shop, he appeared to me to be the tenant; I was in the dining parlour once, I saw Mr. Hopkins.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner above two years, he was in the public line of business, I always heard a very respectable character of him, in regard of paying every tradesman that he was connected with.</p>
               <p>Did he bear the character of an honest man? - Yes, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you known him up to this time? - Yes, he kept a house in the court, opposite St. Martin's church; I cannot say how long he acted in the public line, I often used his house, and have transacted some business since, and recommended a friend of mine to Mr. Hopkins in the carving and gilding line, and I fancy the frames are now in court.</p>
               <p>What business is Mr. Hopkins? - I cannot say; he has had frames done for his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160075"/>own use in the course of the last three or four months, the same as them; I mean in the course of the last six or seven weeks, I cannot tell his business, but I always heard by most people, that he was in the tradesman line, that he was a very honest man; I never transacted any business with him.</p>
               <p>Did you know his lodger, Miss Roe, in Maiden-lane? - No, I do not; I have called there, I believe, in his dining-room up one pair of stairs, in the course of this last three or four weeks.</p>
               <p>What family has he? - I do not know, I have been up stairs once or twice in November.</p>
               <p>So far back as October? - Why yes, I do not know but I have.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A carver and gilder. Mr. Hopkins said there was a picture, in particular, that he lost, which I could be on affidavit of.</p>
               <p>Have you seen any pictures in his custody? - Yes, several, which hang up now in his parlour, within the course of the last three weeks. There is a particular picture which I swore to in court, I am very sensible is a common publication.</p>

               <p>I believe these three prints were bought at my shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you to be a very honest man: has that print ever been in publication? - I do not think it has; I never saw it before; that is the Bacchus and Nymphs.</p>
               <p>You are a large dealer in prints; this was found in Hopkins's house framed? - I do not recollect ever seeing the print; and I am sure and certain; never had one in my possession.</p>
               <p>Are you an engraver yourself? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Do you know the difference between a plate that is retouched and a plate that is not retouched? - Most certainly; this of Bacchus and Nymphs, appears to me not to have been retouched.</p>
               <p>Are either of those saleable in a shop? - I should suppose Mr. Poggi would not sell this print, because he is liable to have it copied, not having any publication at the bottom of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that in a saleable state? - Certainly not; it should be finished in the colours before sold; some people might purchase such a thing.</p>
               <p>But would you sell it as a compleat print yourself? - I should not.</p>
               <p>Would you sell it in the common course of business as a finished print? - It is a print that seems to be in a condition for working on with colour.</p>
               <p>Do prints that are in the common course of sale, get into the world so? - It should be retouched for sale.</p>
               <p>Here are two pictures, Hope nursing Love, one is retouched, and the other not retouched; is that which is not retouched in such a state as a man keeping a creditable shop would sell? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Prosecutor. Whether it is not a well known practice in the copper-plate way, to wish to obtain a print for themselves, they will take one if they can? -</p>
               <p>Do you mean a printer or engraver? if I give him leave, if he behaves well, if he is an honest man, I may give it him, or he may obtain it dishonestly, if he has the plate at his own house.</p>
               <p>Court. Those prints that you have spoken of, that were unfinished, were they out of your house or not? - No, they were at my own house; my printer is here, and a very honest lad he is.</p>

They went out together, they looked at the articles together, and each gave their opinion on them. I suspected the money, the silver appeared quite bright, I thought she had something in her pocket to disfigure it.

About three, or five minutes after, I followed the prisoners down Cheapside, and saw them between King-street and Lawrence-lane; they were going towards the Change. In about five minutes after I left my shop, I noticed them, and I thought they noticed me, and I crossed the way, I watched them into Devaynes and Hingeston's, the corner of King-street; immediately as I saw them in the shop, I went home, and desired Pitfield to come with me, and desired him to go and make enquiry what they had purchased; and I saw them come out and cross the way. I missed Pitfield, but I found him afterwards, and desired him to follow them, and I went home. I gave information in Bow-street, they were found in a court in Wych-street, they were at tea, there was nobody else in the room. I saw Jealous put his hand towards Mrs. Field's mouth, and take a shilling, but I cannot say where it was from; their pockets were both emptied; I saw a shilling on the tea-table, but I cannot tell how it came there: Pitfield has the money that I gave him.</p>
               <p>Court. All the money you received from Field? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did any conversation pass between them? - Field asked her for it.</p>
               <p>Sharpe had no concern in the dimity? - No</p>

               <p>The shillings you thought were discoloured in the pocket? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 10th of February I received nine shillings from my master, which he desired me to weigh; I did weigh them, and found them not so heavy as eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you keep them separate? - I put them with two that my master took out of the till, that he suspected he had taken from them. I cannot distinguish which those two were, but the eleven have never been mixed. (Produces them.) Mr. Denning pointed out the two women to me in Cutter-lane, and I followed them down two or three back streets, into Newgate-street,; they were together all the time, they went into the Crown in Newgate-street, I did not see them offer any money there. I traced them from the Crown in Paternoster-Row; I observed Field go into a druggist's in Paternoster-Row; she came out, and they went into White Lion-court, Wych-street, to a private house, I believe it was: after that I came back to my master, and he went to Bow-street: I was in the room when the officers took them, that was about six o'clock; I saw Jealous turn some money out of Mrs. Field's pocket into a hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you weigh the nine shillings together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Denning give you the two shillings at the same time? - No, a few minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>You would not have known them except Mr. Denning had pointed them out? - No.</p>
               <p>There was a great distance of time had elapsed, between the time you were at the Crown and the time you got home? - Yes, an hour, or an hour and a quarter.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>You was in the Excise service in 1788? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was your situation in September, 1788? - At Vineall, within three miles of Battle, in Sussex.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Cain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him on the 24th of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now go coolly, and speak distinctly, and tell my lord and the jury what you saw, and what you did in consequence? - On the 24th of September, in the morning, I saw the prisoner, in company with one Hunt and another, pass through Vineall loaded with tubs; that was about seven; there were three horses that they rode and two others, which made five; seeing them go through I went to Battle, and told Mr. Pudsey; he joined our company, and we went across the country, to the place where we thought they might pass, called Burdwash Weald, a publick-house, the sign of the Wheel; we ran up to the house, and we called for a pot of beer, and Pudsey, I believe, asked the landlord if he saw any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160080"/>smugglers go past? and he said, he had not; and we saw two men standing by the turnpike-house; we had some little suspicion they were of the prisoner's profession.</p>
               <p>Did you in fact see the prisoner and Hunt again? - Yes: we immediately drank our beer, and rode towards Burdwash, to this publick-house, and saw the prisoner, and Hunt, and another sitting on their horses, on the turnpike road, standing still; better than a mile and a half from Burdwash town; on seeing us they immediately rode away towards Burdwash town; and they left the two horses, with the five tubs each, in the road, and let down, or threw down, by some means, four more, from the horses that they rode; Mr. Pudsey and another Hop officer, whose name was John Doody, went from Battle with us; we took possession of those horses they had left; I staid by the horses in the road; Pudsey went after them, and returned in five minutes, with one more horse and one cask; then we took the horses and the cask to a publick-house; there were fifteen casks in the whole, and three horses; we took them to the publick-house, in order to reload them, for better carriage to Battle; while we were there a few minutes the prisoner and Hunt came back on horseback: Hunt swore prodigiously at our taking them away; I cannot say that the prisoner was so violent at that time.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - I believe the prisoner had a whip with a long head, as they call it there, tied to the small end of it; a thong tied to the small end of it like a coach whip; they sat at such a distance I could not hear what they said; I heard him ask Pudsey to give him something to drink; and he told him, if he came back and behaved quietly and civilly, he would; and the came back; and he called for a pot of beer for them, and half a pint of gin; and the prisoner drank, but Hunt refused; the prisoner drank some of the beer and some of the spirits; he behaved very civil indeed at that time; and Hunt said, we should not take them away; the prisoner did not behave so riotous at that time.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the casks? - They were then in a stable, both horses and casks, in order to take them to Battle; then the officer and me went in order to prove the liquor that we had taken; and the prisoner asked the officer leave to let him suck out of one of the casks, which he did; after he had so done the prisoner and Hunt went out, and got upon their horses, and began to be very riotous with large clubs.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any tubs on those horses? - No; they were the horses that they rode on; and they both of them agreed not to suffer us to take the things away; I heard them agree to stand true to each other, and not to suffer us to take the horses out.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they agree out loud, so that you heard them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they say it to you, or to each other loudly? - To each other loudly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long did they continue in this sort of conference with themselves, talking loudly, before they came to this agreement? - Not long; then they both rode up to the door, and swore we should not have the goods, nor take them nor the horses away; but that they would take them themselves: we were then in the stable and Pudsey also; they rode up to the front door of the stable, which was open at the time they came up: they sat and swore I suppose for nearly an hour, and struck several times with their clubs against the door; and then Mr. Pudsey, the officer, produced his pistol, and told them, if they did not desist he must fire: there were a number of people round the stable door: when Pudsey produced the pistol the prisoner at the bar then dared him to fire, and opened his breast; and they both told him, he might fire and be d - nd.</p>
               <p>Court. Whereabouts was Pudsey standing at this time? - Just within the stable door.</p>
               <p>And they were sitting on the outside? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160081"/>Yes; they were sitting on their horses, with their horses heads close to the stable door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did the prisoner at the bar offer any thing to the people that were about? - I heard him offer five guineas to any man that would assist him in rescuing the things; and upon that offer Mr. Pudsey and I concluded it would be best to get some more assistance, for there were a great many people round the door; but I did not see them do any thing, nor hear them say any thing; I went out of the back door of the stable, and went to get another officer, but could find none; I had not been in town a quarter of an hour; but the landlord of Burdwash Weald came with a peace officer, and I went back to Mr. Pudsey again; then Hunt, the other, was shot through the wrist, and they were very quiet.</p>
               <p>Where was Cain when you returned to Pudsey at the stable? - He was sitting before the publick-house door on his horse; they neither of them behaved riotously then.</p>
               <p>You knew Cain by person at this time? - I had often seen him before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. What time in the morning was it that Cain and Hunt returned to the publick-house door after you had received the spirits? - It might be between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Not much later? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it before all the business was over? - I cannot tell exactly; nearly two hours.</p>
               <p>You say they were very quiet, and asked first of all, that you would give them something to drink? - The prisoner was not so bad as the other.</p>
               <p>I am repeating your own words; he asked the officer to give him something to drink? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The other would not take any thing to drink from the officer? - No.</p>
               <p>How much beer had you at the publick-house? - Only one pot of beer and half a pint of gin between us; I drank some of it myself, and several others.</p>
               <p>How he sucked the good creature when he came to the cask you cannot tell, I suppose? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>He did not leave that very easily? - I do not suppose he drank half a quartern; he did not lay at it as long as he pleased.</p>
               <p>Had he it at his own command? - No; he had not; when the officer thought he had enough he told him to leave off.</p>
               <p>However it was not till after he was indulged in his request to drink, that he was disposed to be riotous? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. The people you say were there in large numbers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was in these casks? - I did not drink out of but one; I believe there was some brandy and geneva.</p>
               <p>What was that you drank out of? - I think it was geneva.</p>
               <p>That cask you think was gin? - I think it was; I only tasted one.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know what was in the cask the prisoner tasted? - Why, it was the same cask I drank out of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are not sure of that? - I cannot remember particularly.</p>

               <p>When you first saw the prisoner who was he in company with? - There was one Hunt with the prisoner, and a young lad that I do not know; they had five horses loaded with prohibited goods, and standing a little way from the Weald; and on seeing us going to meet them, they stopped their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160082"/>horses; and on our watching, the prisoner and the man and the boy rode away along the road; and with our pursuing, we came up with two led horses, which I imagine they could not get on; and we left Venus in care of those two, and went in pursuit of the other; the led horses had five tubs each; and we pursued, and came up with another horse with one tub upon it; a young lad jumped off the horse; I saw him jump off; we took the things to Burwash Weald public house; and seeing some tubs thrown off the horses, which we took to the public house, and put the horses and the tubs into the stables.</p>
               <p>When they were there, did you try what the casks contained? - I did tap one cask, and it contained geneva; the whole were tubs of Geneva and brandy.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tap more than one? - The tubs were tasted afterwards, and they were all brandy and geneva; I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Relate what passed when you saw him again? - Him and his accomplice, Hunt, returned back again on horseback, without any goods; they stood a little distance from the house; not far; the horses were in the stable; and I was standing a little from the stable; when I came up, I think I recollect the prisoner asked me for something to drink, or something to that effect; I think I said, if you behave civil, and go about your business, I will; we had a pint of beer, or something of that sort; I cannot say whether he drank or not; he did not drink much; we then went into the stable to take the horses and goods out, and go to Battle with them; then the prisoner said he would have a suck, or give me a suck, or something to that effect; he came in and had a suck, which was very small; the gimblet was very small with which the hole was made; we had got one horse out of the stable; and I stood a little from the public house, and was not apprehensive of any rescue or danger; and the officer, Doody, who is not here, said Pudsey, take care, upon which I turned round, and the prisoner had a large whip in his hand, which had a club more like a walking-stick than a whip; it had the head wrapped round his hand, in order to have a blow, in appearance, at my head; by turning round, I escaped it; they then said we should not go off with the goods; that was the prisoner and Hunt.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner say any thing? - I did.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said we should not go off with them; and his accomplice said, swearing at the prisoner, if he had half the heart he had, they never should have rode away at first; the club appeared to be levelled at me; they appeared desperate.</p>
               <p>Was this the first conversation that passed between the prisoner and Hunt? - They seemed to be displeased at losing them, as all smugglers are.</p>
               <p>Had they any conversation before this time respecting these goods? - I cannot possibly say what conversation they had.</p>
               <p>Before you gave them any thing to drink, had there been any conversation between the prisoner and Hunt about seizing the goods? - I cannot recollect whether there was.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see the prisoner attempt to strike you? - I saw his club levelled; it appeared levelled at me, as if he was going to strike a blow; but he did not strike; the horse with the goods stood before the door; and they seemed to be so desperate; I heard them say to each other; one swore to the other, of standing true to each other; and they shook hands, and swore they would stand true to each other in taking these goods from us.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any of these declarations made by the prisoner? - I heard them both by the prisoner and Hunt; and they shook hands to stand true to each other; then they went into the stables again; Venus went into the stable with us; they rode up both on horseback, the prisoner and the other; and I stood there with one pistol in my hand, desiring them to keep off, but to no effect; they had large clubs which they struck against the top of the door; whether it was meant to me, I cannot say; they did not strike me: there were more people,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160083"/>I believe, before the house; the longer we staid, the more people appeared there; I then shut to the stable door, thinking they would separate and go away; but they kept repeatedly at the door; they would have one grey horse turned out; they insisted on one grey horse being turned out, both the prisoner and his accomplice.</p>
               <p>Was that grey horse one of the horses you had seized? - It was one we had seized, and had had him in the stable; I refused, and told them I would not, nor could not; I begged them to go about their business; they did not go; on shutting the door, we locked the door, and set something against it, it was usual, to keep it fast, when they put in clubs which they had, in order to force it open; their sticks being in the top of the door, trying to open it, I threatened them, and said I did not wish to fire; I was very loth to fire; but I was determined, as I had made the seizure, I would not have it taken from me; the prisoner opened his breast, and bid me fire into his mouth several times; and Hunt opened his mouth, and bid me fire into his mouth several times, which I did not: we pulled their sticks through the door; upon that the prisoner went to a faggot stack, some little distance off, and rapped again with bludgeons, seemingly, larger than the others, and put it at the top of the door, to wrench it open; I then finding myself in a very disagreeable situation, and not willing to use any sort of violence, desired Mr. Venus to go to Burdwash to get more assistance, thinking by that means that they might be dispersed without doing any damage; Mr. Venus went to Burdwash; he went out at the back door of the stable; I sent for a constable, and kept at the door; a person came into the stable, whom I believe to be a smuggler; his name is Skinner; I know him; and when I threatened to fire, as I did repeatedly, he said to me once or twice, do not fire! do not fire! and he said he would go and talk with them; I said to him, you I imagine are a smuggler; you know the consequence of these things; it is a desperate case; you may prevail with them, perhaps; accordingly he went out, came in again, and told me he had talked to them, and to no purpose; some time after, Hunt says there is a back door, and he swore he would be in at that door; I heard them words said; Hunt came round to the other door; I went to the door to meet him, and desired him to keep off, and begged him to keep off; he still persisted to come nearer and nearer, and would not by any persuasion that I could give him, keep off; I told him I was necessitated to fire; the prisoner was at the other door at the time; I kept drawing back and back as he approached forward, till by some means or other; I cannot say voluntarily; it is a thing that I do not like; but by some means my pistol went off; there was one stick, if not more, in at the door at the time; the prisoner was standing at the other door all the time, as I believe; I heard the prisoner, I think, by the voice, say, woe the devil could have thought Pudsey could have fired.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You do not know it was the prisoner? - No, I do not; I then opened the door; the company was before the house; and the prisoner said, if he had a pistol, he would shoot me through the body, or words to that effect; the constable came soon after; I cannot say the words I heard say, any farther than swearing and being very desperate.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing of any money? - I cannot say positively that I did hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Was Doody with you all this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of excise; I know the prisoner, I saw him in a room in the King's Bench, I observed no particular mark on the room; there was Mr. Whitehead, Tucker's wife, and I suppose his two children; the prisoner was not there, I saw two boxes in the room with candles, I opened them, and saw candles in them; there was a dipping mould, and tin kettle, which I suppose the tallow was melted in, was greasy inside; there was some cotton upon two or three rods to hang candles on; I saw the prisoner again, he came to the room after I was there, he wanted to force himself into the room, but was prevented by one of the keepers; there were several people with him; the cotton and things were put into the boxes, and we all took some; Whitehead came first, I had a box of candles, I carried it down to the bottom of the stairs before me in my arms; at the bottom of the stairs I saw Tucker, along with a great many other people, and he took hold of the box, and endeavoured to take it away from me; I had a tussle with him for a few minutes, in hopes some person would come to my assistance; but none coming, Tucker and the other people that were with him, took away the box from me; he first took hold of the box, and then afterwards finding I would not let go the box, he struck me on the side of the head; I was afterwards knocked down, and the candles flew all about the place.</p>
               <p>The blow you received came from Tucker? - Certainly, I was knocked down, and was on the ground two or three minutes, and beat while I was on the ground, but by whom it is impossible for me to say; I had a thick great coat on, which kept the blows off in some measure, but I received the first blow from Tucker; when I got up again Tucker was there; I lost my hat, I picked up my hat, and Tucker was standing in a posture rather of defence, as if he was going to fight, and after I got off, (there was one of the officers advised me to get off as fast as I could) and there was a mob near me, hurraying and huzzaying, and making a great noise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Griffiths if he did not strike me repeatedly before I touched him? - Not to my knowledge, I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I could bring a hundred people, if I had had habeas's, that would have sworn he struck me repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you set down the box during any part of the time, so as you could strike him? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He threw it down.</p>
               <p>Did he strike you before you left your hold of the box? - He did; I am very sure of it; and I had not struck him at that time.</p>

            , stating that he had ready to bring into court the whole of prints and books of the description of which he had been prosecuted, and found guilty of exposing to sale. And at the same time the Attorney General prayed the immediate judgment of the court on the defendant, informing them, that he had, by the desire of a very respectable description of persons in this kingdom, thought fit to bring several offenders before the court of that description; and as to the present defendant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160087"/>he was not an indigent offender, but on the contrary, in a substantial way of business; therefore an excuse of doing a crime of the magnitude this was, did not appear in the least to have any foundation with respect to him; and it must appear as a further aggravation of his offence, that he was a citizen of London, keeping an open shop in the heart of that city; and yet as such thought it no crime to poison the infant younger minds of the whole of that community, and that this was not by the open and bold attack of vice, which might perhaps put persons on their guard, and be resisted; but it was doing this - Inflaming passions in the young and tender mind, to an immoderate extent, when reason is not a match for them - inflaming those passions which the Almighty has planted in the human breast, for wise purposes; because he did not chuse that it should rest on the cold reason of man, whether he should have an everlasting succession of human beings, candidates for everlasting happiness; that was too great an object to be left to us; but was made to arise from stronger motives of our affections and passions. My lord (said he) to poison then the spring of human society, by thus contaminating the fountain, is a crime of so enormous a nature, that hardly any punishment I can call for can be adequate thereto; and to an offender of this sort, I publickly declare, I never will hear of any compromise in my chambers whatever: no atonement, or degree of atonement, shall be offered in my chambers: but as the defendant has made a full surrender of what plates and books of this description were left behind, I therefore, on his behalf, beseech the court, that he may have the full benefit of that surrender: let not that, in pronouncing judgement, be forgotten in his favour. I trust, therefore, that your lordship will instantly, if you shall so think fit, pass that portion of judgment, which, considering the atonement he has made, may be deemed sufficient for the crime of thus exposing to seduction the more younger part of the community.</p>

            , you have been convicted of publishing a very obscene libel, so gross that common decency will not permit me to repeat any article of what must give offence to all who are here; the tendency of such a publication to corrupt the morals of both sexes, is too manifest and too enormous to require any demonstration; if the print, like the one before us, can with impunity be placed into the hands of those, who would either contaminate their own minds, or for the vilest of purposes, corrupt and debauch the minds of others: in vain will parents, who with anxious solicitude watch the education of their children, hope to see their earliest endeavours to have their morals free from corruption, their conduct chaste, and their religion pure: in vain will parents hope to see their more laudable views for these good purposes crowned with success: because this work before us tends not only to inflame the minds of the ignorant and innocent, to their own destruction; but to make the conquest over innocence more compleat, it is endeavoured to be done by weakening the force of religion, in holding up to ridicule the most sacred characters. I cannot but take this opportunity of expressing my sentiments respecting those very distinguished characters, who have thought fit to bring conviction home to persons of your description, that they merit the thanks, not only of this court, but of the community at large; it shall therefore be the business of this court to give them effect; and as example is the primary object of punishment, and that your punishment may deter others from offending in the like manner, for that purpose I feel myself compelled to pass the judgment I am about to pass, taking into consideration that you have attempted to make some small reparation to society for the offence you have committed, by a surrender of all the books and prints which have been found in your possession; these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160088"/>are circumstances that, before a court of justice, ought to have some weight: had you not appeared now so circumstanced, you would have been most indisputably sentenced to the pillory, and then God knows whether, with all the precaution that might have been taken, you might have come away alive: you have taken the most prudent part you could take, and that any man who hath offended the laws of society can take, by making reparation to the utmost of your abilities, in consideration of which your punishment hath been very much reduced, but yet not so much as to take away that impression which it ought to make on your mind, and on the mind of any tradesman who may attempt to do the injury to society that you have attempted, which God forbid any man should do: under these circumstances your sentence is, that you be <rs id="t17910216-44-punish281" type="punishmentDescription">
