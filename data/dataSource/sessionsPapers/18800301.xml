I was called to the Palmerston, and saw Challis in the act of striking Phillips, but I prevented him—Watson was standing by his side—I was in uniform—Watson pushed me away, and said "You are not going to lock him up"—Challis went away, and I went after him and brought him back—he put his hand in his trousers pocket, pulled out three sixpences, and swallowed them—I took him to he station, and found a shillingsworth of bronze coin on him—I was alone, and the other men got away—I received this bad shillings from Lee, and this one from Morgan—they were remanded for a week, and Lee then came up and pointed out Challis as the man who passed the coin—I took Watson on the 10th outside the Court, and told him the charge—he said that he was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Hawkes and Co.; the firm consists of myself, Mr. Wigan, and Mr. Stephens—we have a brewery at Bishop's Stortford—that business came into out possession in 1876—the prisoner was engaged by us permanently about January, 1877 as an accountant at a salary of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he came originally from London, where he was practicing as an accountant, in order to open the books on a new system which we had instituted—one of his principal duties was the checking of the agents' accounts—he was occupied entirely at the brewery at Bishop's Stortford—in June, 1877 we established an agency in London, with offices at St. Pancras Station—up to October last a man named Henry Woollett was out London agent—he entered our service in 1877—he was first mentioned to us by Wall, he went to London to see Woollett and to obtain references from him—he wrote to three people whom Woollett referred to—we had two answers—I have not been able to find the third—they were considered at the time to be satisfactory—we have since made inquiry about them—we have ascertained that one of them was a reference to himself and signed by himself in another name, and the third one, to which I could find no answer, was also written by himself under a different title, and another business—Woollett superintended our London office and the London business—his duties were to solicit orders, obtain customers for the firm, and collect money—we arranged with the bankers at Bishop's Stortford that Barclay and Bevan, the London agents, should receive it, and his duty was to pay it in to Barclay's—it was also his duty to forward to Bishop's Stortford a daily sheet—there were two sheets, one to show the sales, and another called the cash diary to show the moneys received—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a form of the cash diary—these shects would be addressed to the firm, but it was arranged that the letters from the agents should be opened by Wall in the absence of the principals; at the end of each week Woollett sent a weekly advice note, which should set out the moneys paid in during the week to the credit of the firm at Barclay's, and that of course should correspond with the moneys received, as shown by the diary—these forms were supplied to Woollet by us—we had special forms of printed receipts, with counterfoils, in books, numbered consecutively—those receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010009"/>
               <p>books were given out by Wall, and he kept a register of what he gave out, and to whom they were given—it was Wall's duty to see that the counter<lb/>foils tallied with the receipts, as stated in the diaries; there is a column there for that purpose—upon the application for a new receipt book, Wall should have required the used up one to be given back, and should have recorded the issue of the new one—it was his duty at the end of each week to check the daily diary sheets with the weekly advice notes, and also to check the advice notes with the cash book, to see that the money had really been paid in—we balance our accounts on 31st July each year, and it would be Wall's duty, as shortly after as possible, to balance the various books, to extract the balances, and to lay before the partners the statement of the balances from his summary ledger, which contains a short statement of the totals of the monthly balances—that was a locked book, it was kept entirely by Wall, I mean all the writing was his—it was generally in his custody—he had a key, and the partners had a key—he had a room to himself in the brewery opposite the partners' room up stairs, and the book was generally kept there—the agency letters were in foolscap, with the word "agency" printed in the corner—on 22nd October Mr. Wigan showed me a copy which he had made of a letter of Woollett's, addressed to Wall, and marked "Private," but which Mr. Wigan had opened—we do not recognise private letters coming to the brewery, they are supposed to be on business—up to the time I saw that letter I had no reason to suppose that Wall and Woollett were on intimate terms, or had any business transactions between them—shortly after that letter was shown me this paying in slip (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came into my hands—Mr. Wigan showed it to me; it refers to a draft of Mr. Turnham's for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., paid in by Woollett, dated 16th September, 1879—we had lent Mr. Turnham 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on seeing this I turned to the pass book, but could find no trace of that sum—we then called Wall into our room, and the three part<lb/>ners spoke to him—we first asked him when Woollett last paid in any money to our credit—he said he did not know—we asked when did he last advise the payment in of money—he said he did not know—we asked him to fetch his latest advice—he said "I don't know what form of advice you mean"—we then sent for a form of the weekly advice note, and showed him, and he said "Oh, Mr. Woollett has discoutinued using these forms long ago"—we said "How long?"—he said "Several months"—I then showed him the paying in slip—I then knew that it was not in the pass-book—I asked him how long it was since Woollett had paid in any money—he went to look, and said he had not paid in any since the end of July—we then asked what balance was in Woollett's hands at the end of July—he went out of the room to his own room, and came back in a minute and said 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some shillings—he would ascertain that by looking at the summary ledger—I asked why he did not call our attention to the non-payment sooner, and Mr. Stephens said that what he had stated left no doubt on his mind that he had been in collusion with Woollett—Wall very much resented that expression—we did not prolong the interview because Mr. Wigan and I resolved to come to town by the next train to see Woollett—before doing so we looked at the pass book, and found that the last entry with Woollett's name against it was the end of July—Mr. Wigan and I then went to London and saw Woollett at the St. Pancras office—we asked him when to he had last paid in money, and why he had not advised payments in—he said that he had paid in everything up to October, and that he had regularly</p>

               <p>advised moneys on these forms, and he showed us his press letter book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he showed us five press copies in the form of these advice notes, dated subsequent to July, and said that he had sent the originals to the brewery—the five he showed us were 5th, 11th 18th, and 25th August, and 15th September—we said it was so extra<lb/>ordinary that he must accompany us to Barclay's bank to ask them, and he went with me in a cab to Barclay's, where we saw two of the cashiers, and asked them for information of the latest payment in by Woollett—they referred to the books and said that the 25th or 26th July was the last payment, and the account tallied with the last payment that we had found in our pass book with his name against it—Woollett still persisted that he had made other payments—I took him back to the office when Mr. Wigan was, and we suspended him at once, and told him to come the next day to meet us—it was then late in the evening—before leaving we asked him what amount he had not paid in, or not accounted for, and after being pressed a good deal he said he had 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had not accounted for—the amount of the five copy advice notes he showed us was 545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we insisted upon his leaving everything behind him in the office, his keys, a bag that he carried about with him, and everything—we asked him for his own pass book—he had a private banking account at a bank close to the office—he looked for it in a drawer, and said he had not got it—after he had gone out of the office I found it in a waste paper basket at the side of the chair where he had been sitting—he had also shown us two cheques payable to Wall of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, dated 3rd and 16th July, with Wall's endorsement on them, and also a cheque of 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the firm, the last one he paid in in July, which was endorsed in the name of the firm by Wall, which he had no authority to do—those cheques were drawn by Woollett on his own private account at the National Bank, King's Cross—an agent was not allowed to draw on his private account to pay in moneys received from customers—we had occasionally received cheques from him drawn on his account, but they were payments of an exceptional character, not for customers' moneys, those he was ordered to pay in direct to us—we found several loose receipts in his bag, and four or five in the table drawer, and receipt books mutilated, some had whole pages torn out, also some letters from Wall wholly unconnected with business, and some telegrams from Wall to Woollett, also the counterfoil book of the paying in slips of the National Bank—we found from that that large quantities of customers' money had been paid in to his account there; in fact, we found that he had made the payments in to Barclay's general! from his own account instead of the money being paid in direct—two of the telegrams are dated 1st August and 17th October, 1879, referring to interviews not on the business of the firm—we found this letter of 18th August from Wall to Woollett (<hi rend="italic">This referred to some negotiation for the purchase of a brewery by the prisoner; that he had secured</hi> 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and would want from</hi> 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">more, and inquired whether he could depend upon Woollett for some</hi>)—amongst Woollett's papers we found the lease of a brewery at Croydon to Woollett, and an agreement for the purchase of a wine business in Mount Street—we afterwards found cheques which had been given in payment, to the amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that referred to a brewery at Croydon; he had given that for the goodwill and plant to the former proprietor—we also found a number of cards and other things that he had</p>

               <p>had printed for this brewery, with the name of Woollett and Co. as trading there—the brewery to which Wall's letter refers is a different one altogether—Woollett was paid partly by salary and partly by commission; I think it came to about 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the last year—on the morning of 29th October I came up again—I did not see Woollett that day, and I went back to Bishop's Stortford—on the 30th I went to Wall's private room in the brewery, and there found these seven cash advice notes in the secretaire, which he kept locked, they were under a number of other papers—they were the five of which Woollett had shown us press copies—on the one of 15th July I find an addition of some figures amounting to 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. it which is the true balance that was in Woollett's hands on 31st July, 1879—some advice notes were afterwards found by a clerk in the strong room, one of them is the last one on 15th September for 249<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the others were all of antecedent dates—we afterwards examined the summary ledger, which is here; we added up the figures, and found the amount against Woollett to be, not 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as Wall had represented, but 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Woollett had in the meantime sent us a statement of his deficiency, through his solicitor, amounting to about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—upon examining the ledger we found that it was an increased deffciency month by month—Wall had never said a syllable about it—the cheque for 126<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of 30th July was forwarded by Woollett to Wall in an advice note of the 29th—I was at the brewery all day on the 31st, the date on which the cheque was actually paid in to our account, it was market day—if that cheque had been handed to me for endorsement I should probably have asked what it represented, and wished to see the letter in which it was enclosed—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—from 31st July Woollett never accounted for any moneys received from customers—the amount of our deficiencies altogether is over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Woollett was first mentioned to us by Wall—we were desirous of opening a London agency and of meeting with a person who would be likely to carry out that view—I have no recollection of any advertisement—Wall was sent to London to make inquiry about him and he was engaged subject to references—the references were written for by Wall, and answers were received which were thought satisfactory at the time, and he was engaged—he did a very fair amount of business, about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his salary was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and 5 per cent. on custom introduced by him, with certain exceptions—part of Wall's duty was to check the receipts with the counterfoils—Wall kept the receipt books—I believe towards the close of the time Wall gave the books to the cashier—it would be Mortlock, the cashier's duty to compare each entry with the receipt book with regard to the home trade, but not with regard to the agency—it would be Mortlock's duty to post up the cash book from the pass book—the cash book was kept by Mortlock—there is no entry of moneys having been paid in by Woollett after July—as Mortlock is out of Court I may perhaps say he is more honest than clever—he has explained why he did not call our attention to the fact—our accounts are made up for the year on 31st July—our turn over is considerable—it takes a considerable time to find the balances—the accounts were not completed on 28th October, when I had the interview with Wall—the posting in the summary ledger is in pencil, not in ink—there was no reason why it should not have been done, except from his desire to conceal that he was far behind his time in that part of the work—he had been asked fcveral times for these balances—on 28th October I asked him what was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010012"/>
               <p>state of Woollett's account—he went out and returned in two or three minutes, long enough to cast up rows of figures—he is a particularly accurate accountant, and I never knew him make a mistake of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—brewers' accounts are paid in 28 days as a rule—we had no suspicion of Woollett till this discovery—Wall had no testimonials or references when he came into our service—he was known to Mr. Stephens, my partner, when he was in Allsop's brewery; but I have ascertained that he was discharged sum<lb/>marily from a brewery where he was engaged in the interval, Mesas, Sedgwick's at Watford, because there was something wrong in his accounts—I made inquiry at the brewery myself, and that was the answer I obtained' Mr. Stephens of course was quite ignorant of that—the cheque of 31st July was paid in to our credit and duly appears—I last saw Woollett on 30th October—I took out a warrant against him on that day, but nothing was heard of him—we made every inquiry, offered rewards, and had circulars sent all over the kingdom—I don't think anything but the letters and two or three telegrams were found on Woollett's premises showing a connection between him and Wall—one of the letters refers to the purchase of the Brentford Brewery—I do not know Mr. Sedgwick's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Alfred Hutchings, of</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">Baker Street, here deposed to the letter being in Mr. Sedgwick's handwriting, which was dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd January</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and sated that Wall was a thorough accountant and very trustworthy</hi>.) Wall came into our service at the latter part of 1876—I know Woollett's handwriting—these letters from him to Wall are not all marked "Private"—these confirm what I have said, that Wall had interviews with Woollett before he was engaged—I had a guarantee of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Guarantee Society with respect to Woollett—it was on 28th October that I had the conversation with Wall about Turnham's draft for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Wigan made that inquiry—this was received, I suppose, the next day, if it was enclosed in a letter dated 16th September—I believe Wall went away for his holiday on 15th or 16th September—I think he was absent a fortnight—he was absent when that letter arrived containing that paying in slip—in the absence of the partners Mortlock would be allowed to open the letters—I have no recollection of having opened it—a letter was written to Woollett inquiring why the money did not appear, and his answer was that there had been something irregular in Turnham's cheque, and therefore the bankers would not accept it, and he had to wait for a fortnight while Turnham had gone away to Lowestoft before he could get it set right—no doubt the cashier referred to the pass book at Tufnell's, but he did not report it—I can't say that I ever referred to the summary ledger in a systematic way—I have looked at it occasionally, perhaps once in two or three months—I don't think I ever looked at it by myself, it was simply when I have been asking Wall about it—Mr. Stephens used generally to communicate with Wall as to the summary ledger—it must have been apparent to Wall month by month that the credits were largely in excess of the debits—Wall was placed in super<lb/>vision of these agents for the express purpose of a systematic supervision being kept of them, and we considered that anything wrong would be brought to us—the daily'diaries were sent down every day with the amounts received from customers—they are all pasted into a book by the office boy—we had no means of knowing what amounts were received by Woollett except by the aid of the diaries—if Wall had compared the ledgers with the publicans' accounts he would immediately have discovered this—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010013"/>
               <p>woollett came down to Bishop's Stortford from time to time with the pub<lb/>licans' accounts for the purpose of verifying the ledgers with Wall, and Wall ought to have insisted upon seeing the publicans' books with Woollett's receipts in them—with the exception of the two sums of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we know of no money received by Wall from Woollett—Woollett failed to pay in accounts corresponding with the amounts which he admitted he had reeeived—there were additional frauds of Woollett's with which we do not charge Wall having anything to do—the deficiency varied from month to month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Woollett was engaged in May, 1877—the testimonial as to Wall was from Mr. Sedgwick—I believe there was more than one Mr. Sedgwick in the firm—the active partner is now in an asylum—I saw one of the managing clerks—I don't know his name—he told me what I have stated—I have, of course, no means of knowing whether it was true—our clerks had been prohibited more than a year ago from endorsing cheques in the name of the firm—we considered Wall at the head of the office at Bishop Stortford, and we so informed him—he was next to the partners and our right hand man—if our books had been kept in the way I have described it would have been impossible for these deficiencies to have escaped notice—the system is a very detailed and a very complete one, and if properly carried out it would be impossible for any fraud to be committed by any one person—it is only fair to say that we do not state that Wall would have known of the entire amount of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amount of which he should have informed us would have been a little under 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the other was through forgery of Woollett's which he did not know of—Wall did not inform us that either he or Woollett contemplated the purchase of a brewery or a wine business—we had no idea of such a thing—Woollett was a man in trust and authority.</p>

               <p>Woollett had said that the money had been repaid, but Wall said it was still owing, and on that I went into my room and wrote a letter to Wall to tell him on no account was he to part with that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without my sanction—Wall endorsed a cheque on 31st July in the name of the firm—we had never authorised him or any person in our employment to use the name of the firm on the contrary, finding that such a practice had existed with the old firm, we expressly forbade it.</p>

I said "Yes"—he side "We are going to the railway station, will you ride?"—they had a one hone trap, a sort of tradesman's cart—I got in—William sat in front and drove, I sat on the right hand side, George on the left, Lee was behind—William drove towards the Green Lane,' Hornsey, where there is a rail<lb/>way station—when I had been in the trap about five minutes I received violent blows on my mouth and on each side of my nose and on my eye—the first two blows knocked me partly insensible—after that I saw them taking my watch and chain—I could not say which took it—I was wearing it in my waistcoat pocket—I was then sitting in the bottom of the cart—William Stretton chucked me out of the cart in the road in High Street, Hornsey—the other two had then gone—I called out "Murder" and "Police"—some people came to my assistance—I was assisted home—I to my senses—I remember no more till 6 or 9 o'clock—the doctor then attended me—my nose was cut, it is very painful now, and I have suffered great pain in the back of my head—I gave information to the police the erne night—it is about three miles from the Victoria, and three and a half miles from the Three Compasses, where I was thrown out, and not a quarter of a mile from where I live—hearing that the prisoners were in custody I went to the police court at Wood Green on 27th January—I there identi<lb/>fied William and George Streeton from a number of other persons—I did not recognise Lee at first, but afterwards did so—I was sober, I had had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of whisky and afterwards 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth, that is all.</p>

I am now living at the Sailors' Home in Well Street—I was chief mate of the Standard Bearer, a British ship, of Swansea, sailing under the British flag—the prisoner was the master of that vessel—John Maclean was boatswain, William Jones carpenter, and the crew were 13 all told—we sailed from Swansea last March, and went to Monte Video and Buenos Ayres—on 27th July we sailed for Talcahano, in Chili, and arrived there on 1st September—while there we shipped a black man as steward called William Price—three of the crew, Lewis, John, and Greene, were im<lb/>prisoned there for refusing to join the ship, after an inquiry before the Consul—I was examined before the Consul as to the captain's conduct—I made a report—the three men were ordered to join the ship, and were released on 23rd September—while, we were at Talcahano I was in the habit of seeing the captain nearly every day, I frequently saw him drunk there—on 21st October we sailed for England—two or three weeks before Christ<lb/>mas it was my watch from 6 to 8 p.m.—at 8 o'clock the prisoner informed me that he had given me some orders which I had not heard—I am rather deaf, and was particularly so at that time—he also said he had given me two orders the night previous, and that I had not answered him, and he wished to know the reason why I would not answer—instead of directly replying that it was owing to deafness, I asked him if he did not know the reason—he said "No"—I said "What did you pour some oil in my ear the night before last for? why do people roar and shout at me round the deck the last few days, did not you hear that?"—he said that I was too good to answer, that he believed what I was saying was false—he said that he did not go speaking round the deck to other people—I said "Now I suppose we are coming to the two-faced business?"—he answered that he did not particularly single me out as being two—faced—I replied "I am two—faced, shall I give you a sample?"—he laughed and said "Yes"—I said "When the crew were before the Consul at Talcahano I told the Consul that you were a gentleman, and that was an infernal two faced lie n—he asked if I was alluding about his drunkenness, and said "I suppose you will say the same as the rest, that I was always drunk"—I said "I can't say you were always drunk, but that you were many times drunk is perfectly true"—he said he did not care a d—for me, nor the owners, nor the Consul, and he used some foul</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I last saw the captain on the night of the 24th, between 8 o'clock and midnight, on deck—up to that time I noticed nothing at all remarkable in his demeanour—he attended to the work of the ship as usual—after the report of the gun I saw nothing of the steward. William Jones. I am now bring at the Sailors' Home in Well Street—I was carpenter of the. Standard Bearer—about three weeks before this occurrence I heard some words between the mate and the captain—I heard the captain say, "You had best look out for yourself from this time out"—on Christmas morning about half-past 11 I was on the main deck with a passenger—the mate came up with his trousers on his arm and made a state<lb/>ment to me—I saw that his mouth was bleeding—he ran forward-afterwards the mate and the steward went down into the cabin—about three minutes after that I heard the report of a gun—I only heard one report—the mate then came up the companion streaming with blood—the men took him forward—I heard the boatswain call down the skylight and say, "Captain Davis," and the captain said, "Hallo"—he said, "The men have come aft to know if it is safe for them to go on with their duty"—the captain replied, "Safe enough on my part now, I shall not do nothing"—the boatswain said, "Shall I come down and speak with you, sir"—he replied, "Yes, you can come down one at a time"—the boatswain then want down and I followed a little afterwards—the captain sung out, "Who is in the companion there?"—I said, "It is me"—he said, "Is that you, carpenter?"—I said, "Yes, I hope you will not shoot me if I come in there"—he said, "You need not be afraid of that chip, I won't hurt you"—I went into the cabin but could not see the captain—he said, "Here I am up here, chip"—I then looked and saw he was up in the stern ladder against the rudder case, at the back of the cabin—I saw one of his feet was bare, and I saw the gun end on towards me—I said, "What is all this about, sir?"—he said, "God knows, capeuter, I would not hurt no one; but I had a cause for it"—I asked if he knew what he had done—he said, "Yes, perfectly well, and I can stand the law for it"—I asked, "What cause have you for it, sir?"—he said, "I</p>

               <p>was coming out of my room to go to the pantry for a biscuit, and I met the man coming out of his room with a revolver, and I twisted it out of his hand and shot him"—I said, "The mate came on deck and told us you shot him in his sleep"—he said, "No, no,"—I said, "It was a cowardly thing for you to go and shoot the man in his sleep"—he said, "I was bound to do it, carpenter; I could hold it no longer"—I said, "For God's sake give me up that gun and revolver before you do more harm"—he said he would not give them up, they belong to him—I did not see any revolver—I told him to come down from there, what was he doing sticking up there—he then said to me, "You beggar, if I come down you will shove me in irons"—I said, "There is nobody talking about irons; give me up the gun and revolver"—he said, "I will tell you what I will do: I will take them adrift; I will take one half and give you the other half, then they can't do no harm to nobody"—I said, "All right, sir, I will go and fetch some tools to open them—he said, "You don't require no tools; I can open them up here"—I then asked him to open them—he said he would not, they belonged to him—he said, "Look here, I can see people in this cabin now around me"—I told him there was nobody there only me and the boatswain sitting on the settee—he said, "Look here, I tried to get forward to the men, but I was watched; you were in your bunk making signs with the bolt, and Mr. Borland was at the table watching me, and the small boy was a policeman over me"—I said, "All nonsense, there is something on your mind, sir"—he said, "Yes, there is"—he then made a movement with the gun, and I jumped out of the cabin into the steerage—the prisoner said, "You need not be afraid, chip, I am not going to hurt you"—I said, "I don't know so much about that; it looked very much like it then"—one of the men shouted down, "Chip, see if you can see the steward down there, he has not come up"—I looked into the mate's room and saw a spot of blood on the floor as if it had been spat out of the mouth—I went across to the pantry door; it was three parts closed—I called out "Steward" twice—I got no answer, and I opened the door and saw the steward lying in the pantry—I called out, "My God, boys, he has killed the steward"—he was in a sitting position on the floor, with his back up against the bulkhead—I could see that he was dead—a poker lay alongside of him, and two or three loaves of bread—I sang out that the steward was shot, and ran on deck—the captain said, "It is only a yarn, the steward is all right"—I did not notice then where the steward was injured—when I left the cabin the captain was right up on the stern ladder—he was therethe whole time—he appeared to be sober—he remained below—the boatswain came on deck shortly afterwards with some canvas and a tin of linseed meal—later in the day I spoke to the captain again—I asked him to give up his arms, he would not—he said, "Tell the passenger I want to see him"—the passenger came aft after some time—the captain said to him, "Mr. Borland, come down here, I won't keep you a minute"—Mr. Borland said, "l am afraid; give up your arms and I will come down"—he said he would not give them up—he said to me, "I will tell you what I will do; you get the revolver from the mate and take it adrift and I will take mine adrift; I will give you the halves, and you give me half the mate's revolver, then there can be no harm done"—I then went to the boatswain for the mate's revolver—I got it and took it to pieces—I gave the barrel and six balls and the rollerto one of the men, and took it aft and hove it down the skylight to the captain</p>

Mr. Couteau said "Yes, all right, I think there is a light"—I went upstairs—I do not recollect whether the gas was already lighted, but there was a light afterwards—it was nearly 10 o'clock—there was enough gaslight to see by—the prisoner said "You have borrowed some money, and you are paying very large interest for it; I will pay off the loan for you and let you have it at a cheaper rate of interest"—I said "No, I have managed my own affairs so far, and I do not care about that"—the prisoner had previously told me the person's name from whom I had borrowed the money—he said "Well, then, let me lend you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he had said "How much money have you got in the bank?"—I told him—I forget what the amount was; I think it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I do not want the money at present, when I want it I shall be very glad to come to you for it"—he said "You bank at the Union"—I do bank at the Union—he said "That money in the bank will not last you long, you had better have something"—I said "Well, let it be a small sum; I will have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, make it 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "No, I will make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or nothing"—he said "Very good; I will run downstairs and get my cheque-book"—he had already said "I shall not take any interest for this first transaction, but when you come of age you can give me a d—good diamond pin"—he went downstairs, and returned with a cheque-book with a few cheques gone out of it—he then wrote me out this cheque for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Mr. Robertson came to the Westminster Police-court on the 28th January—the prisoner was then in custody on another charge—I placed him with seven others, and the prosecutor identified him—I read the warrant to him and told him what he would be charged with—he made no reply, and was put back in the cells.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The alleged libels were</hi>:—"Jules Riviere condemned between the years 55 and 57 to 10 years <hi rend="italic">travaux forces</hi> for either forgery or fraudulent bank<lb/>ruptcy; he was a fumiste, 18, Place de la Roquette, and cheated his partner. His first wife, a Frenchwoman, they say is still alive; was in England three years ago (his English wife does not know this); he gave 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go away quietly. Is that woman alive now?"—" I forgot to tell you I am off to Brighton to-day. R. knew it, so did (as he hoped) a cunning and underhand trick in giving out circulars last night, which he thought I could know nothing about till Monday. He tells the most unscrupulous lies on the subject. I hope you have arranged for Tuesday at Store Street I am so afraid he dare not face me.—G. W." "What a scoundrel that Riviere is, but I have got all the proofs against him. He will never stay in England afterwards. He has committed bigamy, married this one as a bachelor. All of you must help me with the enemy. I know you will, and am very truly yours, Georgina Weldon."—" Riviere must be done for in time, but it will take heaps of money. Riviere has been con<lb/>demned to 10 years' hard labour, has falsified his marriage certificate, and has committed bigamy."—" I am very hard up now owing to Riviere's swindling, and though I expect, if he does not run away, to get a good sum out of him, besides heavy damages, I have to wait for it."—" I am sorry for Riviere if you are going to testify to your esteem for him. I fear it can be proved not worth much. He has held out bribes to others, perhaps he has done the same to you; but whatever any one may say for him, or whatever esteem his boon companions may hold him in, nothing can take away the fact that he is an escaped felon condemned to 10 years' hard labour; that he has passed himself off as a bachelor in his second marriage certificate, and done other pretty little things which will all come out in time. Here is another letter written by me which you can show to him."</p>

                  </hi> I am the prosecutor in this case, and am a musical director and a publisher of music at 28, Leicester Square—in 1873 I first became acquainted with Mrs. Weldon; she is a lady of musical talent, and sings at concerts, and I first engaged her to sing for me at the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts in 1878, and at Brighton and at the Crystal Palace; we were on very intimate terms; she visited and stayed at my house; I introduced her to my neighbour, Mrs. Brander—Mrs. Weldon sang at my Promenade Concerts last year, and we had a disagreement about the terms of her engagement; we could not come to terms, and ceased to be oft friendly terms for a time—she made a speech at Store Street Music Hall in which she imputed dishonourable acts to me, and we never became friendly again, but we resumed our acquaintance on a business footing—she agreed to apologise to the choir for what she had said about me, and she and her choir sang at my concerts—the arrangement was in writing—in consequence of her conduct I found it necessary to put an end to the engagement, and refused to allow her to sing any more; and in consequence of her coming to the theatre she Was excluded from it, after which the letters were written to Mr. Eberwein, Mrs. Brander, and Mr. Clarke—I for<lb/>merly carried on business in France as a stove-maker with M. Brocard; after I left he made his fortune in it—I was a musical director at the same time—in 1857 I went to Brussels, ant) about a month afterwards declared myself bankrupt in Paris—while at Brussels I gave concerts, and I did so also at Ostend and at Spa—I obtained a passport at Brussels—I did not return to Paris for 10 years, and I heard that I had been <hi rend="italic">condemned par contumacy</hi> for not surrendering to my bankruptcy—I had a list of all my creditors; the amount of their debts Was 85,000 francs—I owed my father-in-law out of that 60,000 francs, and 10,000 francs was due to me on my wife's dowry—I have paid the rest of my creditors since that time who I could find—there is no truth in the statement of the defendant that I robbed my creditors of 93,000 francs—I have never gone by any other name than Riviere—it is not true that I cheated my partner of a shilling—I married my first wife, Marie Caroline Zinck, in 1847, and separated from her in 1856, and up to the present time I have never heard from her or of her—I have inquired of my friends, but could not learn any tidings ahout her; I have never heard of her, and in 1870 I married my present wife; her maiden name was Amy Frances.</p>

               <p>Fisher—Mr. Adam Suede described me in the certificate; he is my brother-in-law, he married another Miss Fisher—I gave no authority to him, or any other person, to describe me as a bachelor—my wife was aware that I had been married before—I never at any time entertained the idea of absconding from England—I remember about a year ago having a conversation in this building with Mrs. Weldon about my bankruptcy in France—I was a pro<lb/>secutor against a man named Laurence Levy in this Court, and met Mrs. Weldon by accident, and I told her that Levy had raked up all my past in Paris, all my misfortunes—she questioned me about it, and said "Can I assist you?"—I said that I had the misfortune to be bankrupt and condemnation followed, and I did not like the position I was in—I think I explained to her that the condemnation was <hi rend="italic">par contumace</hi>—she seemed to sympathise with me, and visited at my house very often afterwards, and sang for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Mr. Longstaff is my solicitor—I possibly told Mrs. Weldon I had got all the documents relating to my bankruptcy and a copy of the sentence—my solicitor has them—I was in London when I was sentenced to ten years travaux force—I never took any steps to appeal against that sentence—I swear that I was not bankrupt as a stove-maker, but I have heard since that by the documents I was so described—I never heard that I was charged with having embezzled money belonging to the firm, and that the result to the creditors would bo very deplorable—I never read that I was charged with being a fraudulent bankrupt—I did not go and get those reports corrected as I was doing very well in this country—it says here that "J. P. R. was, in 1857, while a bankrupt trader, guilty of embezzling part of his assets;" that is correct—I am aware that I was charged with fraudulent bankruptcy, and the sentence was for that offence, and I made no appeal—I told Mrs. Weldon that I had been a bankrupt, but I do not think I said a fraudulent bankrupt—I was <hi rend="italic">greffier de Justice de Paix</hi> before I married Marie Caroline Zinck—that is clerk—I was born on 6th November, 1819, at Aix, and I was first married I believe on 9th March, 1847—my father's name was Prudence Henrie Sulpice Riviere—two years after I was married I pur<lb/>chased the business of my father-in-law, 26, Rue de la Roquette, for 52,000 francs; but before that, he, being very illiterate, sent for me to be his book<lb/>keeper—I was only to pay him an annuity—I never paid him any cash, but I paid him 3,000 francs a year regularly till I left Paris in 1857—I may have been in arrear—I paid him as regularly as I could, but sometimes I was late—I do not remember whether I called my creditors together two years before I was declared bankrupt, but I may have done so, and may have asked for a delay of four years to enable me to pay them—my partner, M. Brocard, and I have had a long lawsuit together, but I cannot say whether I brought an action against him or he against me—he did not charge me with having embezzled partnership goods—he wanted a dissolution of partnership, and for a year we were before arbitrators—I do not remember that I had to make important restitutions to him—I had left Paris before the award—I did not wait for the result—I was the head of the firm, and I collected the money due to me—I don't think it was 12,000 francs—I <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> to Brussels, and never went back to Paris—the money was mine—Brocard is not one of my creditors—I do not owe him anything—he brought all the money in, but I brought the firm, which was worth twice the amount of his money—when I got him to bring in 50,000 francs I was in great difficulties—I had not received a penny from the firm—I went away a year after Brocard</p>

               <p>commenced the suit for dissolution—I had not 2,000 creditors—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the list of them which I received from Paris; there are about 50—I have paid all I could find—I found 21, but many of them were dead—I do not find Strausse among the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I did not pay him—he had a bill of mine before I left Paris—I cannot remember his writing to me in London telling me that he was in great difficulties and asking to be paid, nor did I send him a bill of exchange from London—when he had the bill he was in Paris—the bill was not dishonoured—I never had a bill drawn in London dishonoured—his brother-in-law, Roget, is here, and he can tell you—no, it is Roget's son—I have not paid Strausse-Geraud is dead; I did not pay him before he died, but I sent him something on account, I think it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was poor at the time—the debt was 319 francs, which is 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not paid Kuje, I cannot find him—I paid Musquille—I cannot say whether it was since the action was brought, but I have his receipt here—I wrote a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on the subject—I was at the police-court when there was a disturbance with Mr. Sidney and Mrs. Weldon, who wisely or unwisely conducted her own case—I was not at Bow Street—I have received letters from Michelthwaite and Co., but I have not paid these amounts—I never pay anything compulsory if I can help it, I like to pay willingly—the musicians wanted their weekly salaries, but how could I go into the accounts of 40 musicians at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each?—they played with me their whole life, and there is only a little balance due to them—I did not collect 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left Paris—I think a quarter of that would be nearer—from Paris I went to Brussels, and then to Ostend—I had made the acquaintance of a young lady named Delbart years before I lived with her as man and wife in Green Street, Leicester Square, and she was called Mrs. Riviere—three months after I came to England, as soon as I was able to make a position, she joined me at my request—my wife was still living in Paris—I do not know when she left, but she was not there three years—I think she left soon after me—I left my daughter with her—I commenced making inquiries about my wife in 1862—I did not meet Mrs. Weldon at a person's named Konski when I was there with Miss Delbart—she never went there with me—I went there with the present Mrs. Riviere—I was five years manager to La Fleur and Co., musical instrument makers—I was not a partner—I became the partner of Hawkes about 15 years ago, but my name was not in the firm—I was naturalised in 1864, for which purpose I had two witnesses to my character, one of whom, Mr. Hawkes, knew that I was under sentence of 10 years' imprisonment—I did not give the name of Prudence; I never do—I may have given my age two years wrong, but without any intention—I may have made a mistake in one year—Miss Delbart left me in 1869—I did not remain with her and keep her after my marriage with my present wife—she did not collect my money and run away with it when she found out that I was married, nor did I make a charge against her—I have been out of England many times since that, but never for six months at a time—I was married on 14th April, 1870—Mr. Adam gave the information upon which my certificate was filled up—he did not know who my father was, nor did I tell him—it is all an invention about my father—I signed it, but I never read it—I did not know the meaning of "bachelor" till a year ago, and I did not read these two registers before I signed them—I did not give my father's name Henri Prudence Sulpice Riviere, gentleman—he was a stocking loom</p>

               <p>weaver, but I think he had retired at that time—Mrs. Weldon never said to me that the lady I now call Madame Riviere was not the lady she had previously met under that name—she never asked me by word or by letter whether it was true that I had been married before, nor did I ever write and tell her—I admit writing this postscript in French: "I have been married but once; say once and a half and say no more about it"—that was a joke of mine—Mrs. Weldon makes a lot of jokes in her letters, and so do I—I also wrote in French: "It is not wise to wake the sleeping cat"—the cat was my first marriage with Caroline Zinck—I had not told Mrs. Weldon about her, and I meant that for the "half"—I did tell you that Mrs. Weldon had made no inquiries, that was a joke of hers, nothing else—I should not answer like that seriously. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Waddy read to the witness in French several extracts from his letters to Mrs. Weldon.</hi>) I arranged with her last season to sing on each evening independently of the choir, and it was understood on 25th April that she was to have a benefit—actions are now pending between her and me—I have brought one against her and she has brought one against me—it was part of the agreement that she should provide the ladies' dresses—I had desired her to go to my sister-in-law, Miss Fisher, to get the dresses made—the ladies were to pay for their own dresses—I did not promise to pay for them—I may have promised to advance the money, but I did not do so—Mrs. Weldon had before that assisted me with her choir at the Crystal Palace, but not at Brighton; there was no choir there, but she sang there—she only brought her choir to the Crystal Palace—I paid her for that in 1878—I gave her two cheques of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I wrote to her on 3rd November: "I send you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your little ones; will that be agreeable to you, not for payment, but as a gift?" that is one of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I allude to—the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in the same way—I now allege that it was given her for her services—I never paid her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for her services, why should I pay—she made me pay 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance in the joint names of Mr. Cooper and myself, and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week was to be drawn out by each of us—she spent more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for 200 dresses, that was I think before the agreement was signed—I have never paid a penny on that account, it was part of the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—out of that agreement I paid three weeks—I wrote a letter to Signor Rocca, inside which I put a piece of paper with some more writing on it, which was afterwards brought to me by Signor Rocca's wife, and I tore it before her—I said on that paper that if Signor Rocca would give me a libellous letter which he had shown me the day before from Mrs. Weldon, I would make a present of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mrs. Rocca, and would also give him an engagement as a singer for a couple of weeks in the ensuing season—Mrs. Rocca brought it to me next day—she was uneasy—she said that she would sooner leave London and her husband too than come into this Court—I wrote a letter to Mrs. Weldon's choir com<lb/>plaining of her conduct—I don't remember the date—the expenses for dresses had then been incurred—I saw my solicitors, Messrs. Good and Longstaff, on 22nd or 23rd September, and instructed them to write the letter of 24th September, stating that there was no contract between me and Mrs. Weldon—we could not agree, and I wanted to come to an under<lb/>standing—an agreement was come to on 3rd October—I sent a circular to her choir in my own writing by a man named Barrett, but I cannot say the date—I instructed Mr. Selby, my secretary, to write a letter on 29th October, breaking off the contract between me and Mrs. Weldon; her</p>

               <p>benefit was to have taken place on 5th November—I did not choose the time for breaking it off; I could not help it—she was to have 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payment besides the benefit, and she could have received all the lot, from which she would have to find the dresses—it was 100 dresses not 200; I made a mistake; there were only 100 ladies—as soon as I came to England I was joined by Mdlle. Dellart and began to make inquiries after my daughter; I sent for her—it must now be 21 years since I heard of her—she was not living with her mother then; she was about 10 years old at that time and was in a first-class school in Paris—I was paying for her, but her mother took her out of the school and gave her in charge of a Russian family, who adopted her without my consent—she wrote to me from Russia 21 years ago and told me so—I have inquired for the last 22 years for a certificate of my wife's death—I did not see Roget in 1878; I do not know whether I wrote to him—I did not write to him and say that a question had turned up about my wife, and that I wished to know whether he could ascertain whether she was living or not; I have all his letters here—I did write to him in 1878 to obtain the date of her death and the certificate—I have not heard where she was supposed to have died—I should be very much surprised if she were to walk into Court—I believe she died in 1662, and I have been told at Lyons—I have caused a search to be made there, but could not find that she died there—I have been inquiring for 20 years—I have a letter from her here in which she says "I am going to Lyons; this afternoon I start"—I have not made inquiries myself at Lyons, I have only commissioned people to do it; I was in England—I have been always inquiring from people who were intimately acquainted with her—I never went to France to make inquiries about her—Roget sent every one of my letters back to me; I told him to do so simply because they are the story of my life—I knew the story, but I wanted them for evidence if necessary—I owe Roget some money, and I mean to pay him, but I cannot pay all at once—I did not make inquiries of my father-in-law, M. Zinck—he died 20 years ago I should think; about a year after I came here—I have never heard that he died in the workhouse—he was the man who lowed so much money to—I could not pay him; I was in poverty when he died—I was never told that he died in 1866, and I did not try to find out; I knew I could not pay—I could not pay everybody.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 2, Brooks Cottages, Hendon—I know the prisoner by sight, and by passing the time of day—on 27th January, between 10.30 and 11, I was walking down the Denmark Road and saw the prisoner and the deceased coming round the corner on the kerb—as they came round the woman fell over into the gutter, and the prisoner knelt down on her shoulders with her head between his legs, and he was striking her all up the front part of her as hard as he could, all up the belly—I saw him strike three or four blows—I did not then know that he had a knife in his hand, I saw it after—I then ran up to him and caught hold of him and pulled him off her by his collar—he made a strike at me and said "I will serve you the same, you b—, if you interfere with me"—I then stepped on the kerb away from him, and he stood on his legs and hit the knife right into her ear—several people had come up by then—he pulled her head and shoulders right up off the ground by the knife and shook the head three times to get out the knife—some other men came up—I appealed to them to help me, but they would not—the prisoner continued stabbing her about the head and face—he said "You know I love you, my girl; I don't like to see you in misery, I might as well finish you now," and he put the knife on to her neck to cut her throat—I stepped up a little closer and begged him not to do it, and he did not cut her—he stood back and said to me "You Know me, don't you, mate?"—I said "Yes, I do"—he said "Yes, I know you"—he then said "I prayed to God this should not happen last Sunday night, but it have now, I know I shall not have to live long, shall I? may the Lord have mercy on my poor soul," and he looked round and walked up on to the pavement, and back again into the road—while he was striking her he said it was for going to the Metropolitan Music Hall, dancing at the Metropolitan Music Hall—after he stepped into the road he held up the knife and said "This is the knife the Sisters of Mercy gave to me to do it for you, old girl"—he said "She went to the Metropolitan Music Hall and left my poor children at home starving; they are all lousy; I took them to three different places in Kilburn, and all three of them have been lousy"—he looked round, and then he bolted away, and he ran along Salisbury Road and over the parapet wall of the railway bridge—I followed him; he had the knife in his hand all the while—somebody threw a stone at him and knocked him off the wall—he ran round the railway and right down into Saxby and Palmer's workshop, where all the men were working, and said "Show me the man that took my old</p>

He was not living with his wife at that time—he was in a most miserable condition when I saw him 18 months ago—he was in such a highly excited state that I had the impression that he really was a lunatic, from his violence and his manner generally—I was only with him ft quarter of an hour—it was a casual visit—I gave a certificate that he was irresponsible for his actions—I was unable to form a distinct opinion, therefore I sent him to the infirmary—Mr. Gage was the medical man there.</p>

On Wednesday, 21st January, I went to Broad Street, Reading—about a quarter to 11 a.m. I saw Garrett and another man about 500 or 600 yards from Messrs. Stephens's bank—I watched them—they stood at the comer of Cross Street, which leads from Broad Street, to opposite the railway station—they went hurriedly in the direction of Marketplace—Messrs. Stephens's bank looks on to the Market Place—it is a triangle, you can see two sides of the bank—Garrett stood on one side, the man not in custody on the other, so that they could both see into the bank—they remained about a, minute, when the man not in custody hurriedly left and went back into Broad Street, the way in which they had come—Garrett then went and took his position, which would enable him to look straight into the bank window—that was on the opposite side to the bank—he stood against Messes.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The car was not fuller than it ought to hare been on this night—there was room for several inside—I believe I picked the prisoner up in Whitechapel, but I did not notice him get in; he was not drunk—I imagined he had been drinking—he was wonderfully excited—he was not drunk enough to be looked up for being drunk—I said before the Magistrate that he struggled like a madman—I believe I laid hold of his hands, but he slipped me, and I had to take hold of his arm—there was a struggle for me to hold him—I believe I heard him say he would report me when he was on the foot—board—he said he knew the manager and Mr. Godfrey—I remember his being in the oar again the day before the summons for the perjury was heard—I put somebody out on that day who came into the car with the defendant—he was annoying me in my duty—I cannot recollect whether I said anything to the defendant or not, but I told the passengers who he was—I did not say I intended to give it him—every now and then he would say, "If you have any more than your number in this car I shall call a policeman"—he did call one and delayed me three minutes—I told the passengers he was Mr. Myers, who was summoned and got fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I got fined for assaulting him—Myers said that I had no right to turn the man out, but he would not pay bis lure or give his name and address—on the night of the assault; I did not hear Myers call</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Stratford Green, and am a time—keeper in the employment of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company—on the night of 10th January I was on the car at the last journey from Aldgate to Stratford—when we got near Stepney Green I saw Mr. Myers in the car lighting a cigarette—he lighted a match and threw it alight on the floor—the straw caught slightly alight, and he stamped it out with hit foot—the conductor told him it was against the rules—he said he was going out—the conductor then went on the top—Myers came out on the platform and stood there and commenced smoking—I told him he was not allowed to ride there or to smoke—he said he was going to get off at Stepney Green—as the distance was only a few yards I took no further notice of him until the car stopped at Stepney Green, or just past it; and then, as he did not show any desire to get off, I rang the bell and stopped the car—he then stepped off—I stood on the step with my face towards the driver to tell persons who were hailing the oar that there was no more room, when suddenly some one came behind me and pulled me by the coat and struck me across the head and hat with a cane—I saved myself by holding on to the rail with both hands—the car was in motion—I turned round and saw it was Myers—the conductor came down to my assistance and tried to persuade him to go away—he then turned round and assaulted Dodsworth, who stepped off the car and tried to keep him back for a short distance and he left him standing in the road and ran after the car and got on the platform again—Myers ran after the car alongside and deliberately put his right hand through the end window, smashing the glass and sending the fragments over a lady's shoulder inside—her face was slightly—cut, but in the disturbance her name and address could not be taken—after the window was broken Dodsworth rang the bell and stopped the car, and took his money bag, punch and badge to the driver—Myers followed him—I could see there was a slight disturbance at the fore part of the car, and when Dodsworth came back his lip was cut—I did not see the actual blow struck because I was at the other end of the car—I saw the constables come up—Myers then had hold of Dodsworth by the throat or handkerchief with one hand, and was striking him with his stick with the other—the constables stepped between them, the stick got knocked on the ground, and Dodsworth then gave him in charge for assaulting him and wilfully breaking the window—I picked up the stick and proceeded with the car to Stratford.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Myers seemed excited, as though he had been drinking a little—I said before the Magistrate that he did not seem in his right mind—he threatened to report us after I had complained of his smoking on the platform.

I live at 8, Leterstone, Walham Green—I am the wife of Frederick Adolphus Patten, who is in Persia in the Indian Civil Service—in the middle of September last my husband introduced me to McMurdo in this country, who stayed at our house at Dulwich from Saturday to Monday—my husband left England on 2nd October—McMurdo shortly afterwards called on me at Dulwich and brought me a little dog—he had a friend waiting outside—I said "Why don't you ask your friend in?"—he said that, he was a betting man, and he should not like to intro—me to him, and that he was in a hurry; he was going to a pigeon match—he came again before the 8th December—he had often mentioned that may house was damp—towards the end of November he said "I think the house is very damp; if you wish to sell your glasses I could get a good price for them," that a good many swells came to his office, and he would put some lace curtains over them and show them to anybody who came—he asked me to go and see his office at Aquarium Chambers, 2 and 3, Tothill Street, Westminster—I went there and he introduced me to Barnett as "Mr. Wilmot, my partner"—he said "We do not keep any clerks"—the name up at the chambers was "Herbert and Co., financiers"—McMurdo pointed to the wall and said "Your glasses would look very nice there, I would put lace curtains over them," showing me with his hand how he would raise them up to show the swells who came in—he then sent coat or an older for me for the Aquarium, and asked me if I should like to go; it was about 1 o'clock and he took me over—Wilmot took care of the chambers—I went back to the chambers at 4 o'clock and we had to there, and they saw me to Victoria Station and left me there; they did not wait to see me off—McMurdo wrote to me afterwards—I have burnt the letters—he often wrote to say he would come, but did not—he referred in his letter to my glasses—he came to my house the last Sunday in November and asked me if I had made up my mind to move—he dined there and we talked about various things and about the goods—I had not then made up my mind—the suggestion came entirely from him—he called again on Sunday, 7th December, with Barnett—they were left a long time in the drawing-room and amused themselves with my picture books about an hour; I left them there—I called them when dinner was ready—I told them I had quite made up my mind—McMurdo said Barnett was brought down to arrange about the moving and to look at the valuable things that were to "be packed, and that Mr. Moore was to come down on the Monday to pack them, and I was to dress myself—I said "I do not like this moving"—You are going to give my things</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010077"/>
               <p>McMurdo said "Mrs. Patten, you shall have no trouble whatever you place yourself entirely in our hands, Mr. Barnett will wrap the glasses in wadding and take care of everything; I have known him 12 years, he is one of the best fellows living; he will come at 6 o'clock in the morning if you like"—I agreed to move if they would take care of my things and dispose of the glasses, because I believed McMurdo thoroughly—I had then been after a house at Walham Green, or I was going the next day—that house was let, I was disappointed about it—they went away about 8 o'clock—I received this letter on 9th December: "8th December, 1879. 2 and 3, Aquarium Chambers, Tothill Street. Dear Madam,—Bob is away on urgent business; the van proprietor will be with you at. 11 o'clock, Tuesday. I shall meet him at roar house. I was unable to come, having to keep office. Yours faithfully, S., Wilmot." They had not come on the Monday—at that time I only knew Barnett as Wilmott—on the Tuesday he brought a cart and two men—they commenced packing the clocks and chandeliers and other things in the drawing-room immediately—the looking-glasses were not packed—I went upstairs—I heard Moore call to Barnett, "I wish you would come down, I know I am packing the wrong things"—I said "Oh dear me, you have packed my drawing-room clocks; they are ormolu mounted, I am not going to sell those"—I went down and saw they had packed a lot of those things, and I told them they ought not to have done so—I said "They are not to go to your chambers"—Wilmot said "You had better let them go lor security, I or Moore will bring them down in a cab in a day or two to your house, whenever you wish for them"—Barnett persuaded me and I said "I will sell the dinner and tea service, and coffee service If you will get me a good price"—Wilmot said he would rtake care of them and not dispose of them without my consent and sanction and without consulting me as to the price—I let all my valuables go as "Wilmot proposed—he said "Let all your valuables come to our office, you can have them whenever you like, and I consented to their being taken away—this is a correct list of the things that were taken: "Two large looking glasses, one red and white Bohemian glass wine service, one china dinner service, one china tea and coffee service, two green and white cut bottles, one lamp, two clocks, ormolu mounted; two Dresden figures, stands and shades complete; two blue and gold large vases with shades complete; revolver in case, one silver-plated cornet complete; 16 silver-plated dishes, with silver handles and rims; one velvet pile table-cover, valued at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I think my husband could have sold them for more than 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that paper is signed by me and is dated 9th December—Wilmot wrote it after the things were in the van on my paper—he said "I am going to write on some of your pretty paper"—I said "I do not think it is necessary to write a letter, as you are going to take the things to Mr. McMurdo"—he said it was in case Mr. Patten came home—he gave me a copy; I have lost it—I think that remark referred to another letter I wrote on this occasion at his dictation—he said "I want it and I should like to have it," and then I signed it. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I, Cambridge Villas, Fryan Road, East Dulwich, December 9, 1879. To Messrs. Herbert and Co. I this day send you two looking-glasses, six ornaments, eight plated dishes and covers, one cornet, one table cover, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188003010078"/>
               <p>to Mr. McMurdo, there is no occasion for a letter from me"—I afterwards wrote this letter at Wilmot's dictation: "Dearest Bob,—I have asked your partner to take over all the plate and china and looking-glasses to dispose of them on the best terms he can for me. I send you the three volumes you wished for.—With love, I remain, ever yours affectionately, Susie Patten." The words "except dessert service "are struck out—I did not write those words; that is Witmot's writing—he took that letter away with him, leaving the things in the cart—Wilmot came the next day, the 10th, with Moore and the van to move my things—they cleared the house and took the furnitnre to our new house, 8, Leterstone Road, Walham Green—I went there on Friday, the 12th—the things remained in the van two days—on the Saturday I went. to Aquarium Chambers—I met Barnett on the top of the stairs with a man with a packing case—I said "What are you doing, what is that?"—he said "They are your silver dishes, I am going to show them to an earl"—I had noticed a Hansom cab waiting at the door—I said "You ought to have asked my permission first"—I felt very angry—Barnett said "They will come back again, I shall bring them back soon"—the case was carried down, I did not follow it—I remained talking to the people who keep the chambers, I was so upset—I asked Barnett, "Where is McMurdo? why are you taking my things away?"—he said "His wife is very ill, she is in a fit"—I waited at the chambers from 12 till between 3 and 4 o'clock—Barnett came back, but he did not bring my dishes—I do not know whether it was on that occasion, but he said the things had gone to the Earl of Dudley's gallery, which his father kept, and he had left them there to show the earl—I think he said it was in Bond Street—he said he was going to fetch a Queen's physician to McMurdo's wife, who charged 40 guineas a visit—on Monday, 15th December, I want again to Aquarium Chambers—I afterwards received this letter; "Dec 15, 79. Dear Mrs. Patten,—Your glasses were seen by the best judge in London; he says they are very good but modern; he says we are asking too much, and would not make an offer to<lb/>day, but will do so in the course of a day or two. When he does I will submit his offer to you immediately. Yours in haste, R. A. McMurdo."—I also received this letter on 16th (<hi rend="italic">Stating no offer had been made, and promising to call and consult her when it was, and to write next day</hi>)—I went to Aquarium Chambers once only, early in December—I received this letter, dated 27th December, from McMurdo (<hi rend="italic">Headed Eton and Harrow Club, and stating that he had settled something substantial about the glasses, and would call to<lb/>morrow and would telegraph the time</hi>)—I called at the chambers on the 28th—on the 29th I received this letter from McMurdo (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he could not come to terms about the glasses, and ashing the witness to telegraph if she would include the dinner service</hi>)—when I received that letter I was so angry I went at once to the office—I saw McMurdo after I had waited for him—I said "I know you have only written to put me off, and to keep me from coming to the office; there is something very extraordinary about your keeping writing to me like this"—he was very angry and so was I—he said "So-and-so has not come, it is very strange they have not come about the glasses," and he wrote a letter and sent it off by a man—he did not tell me to whom he wrote it—I thought it was about my glasses—I asked him why Barnett had not brought back my silver dishes and table-cover—he said Barnett had written the necessary letters to get them back, but it would take some time,</p>

               <p>and that they were at the Earl of Dudley's gallery—a man came in called Emmanuel—I went outside and talked with the people who kept the chambers, but I did not go right away—I afterwards looked in at the door and said "Are you engaged?"—he came out and said "What do you want, do you want to speak to me?"—I said "No, I do not want to see you, I want you to bring me back my silver dishes, my table-cover, and my clock, which you said were at the Earl of Dudley's gallery"—he went back into the room without saying anything—I walked backwards and forwards—I went into the room again—McMurdo said Emmanuel had a lot of jewellery about him, and he wished he had shown it to me—I went away—I next received this letter from McMurdo: "2nd Jan., 1880. Dear Mrs. Patten,—Just a line to say no bargain yet; same old yarn you will say, but it is not my fault If I cannot do justice by your glasses I shall wait till I do; in the meantime I can but try. I have, thank goodness, a good business in the office, and shall lend you anything you want pending the sale." I omitted to say I was there on 24th December, when he showed me a gentleman who went out of the room—he said "I have sold your glasses to this gentleman, I could have sold them for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I will try to get 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am holding oat for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and he said "you will get no money till after Christmas, as the gentleman will not alter his banking account"—at that time most of my packing—cases were in the room—he then said "Good-bye, Mrs. Patten, I am going out of town"—I wrote this letter of 5th January at my house, and gave it to Mr. McMurdo—I had written him that day, and he said "I shall put that in the envelope I received from you to<lb/>day, as if it came from you: ""Dear Mr. McMurdo, you are at liberty to use my things till you have arranged your business at Hoare's the bankers, when of course you will return them to me; in the mean time I hope you are negotiating for the sale of my glasses." McMurdo dictated that to me—once when he came to my house he said "I offered your dinner service to a man the other day for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he did not beat me down a penny; until then I did not know how good it was"—this letter of 5th January, 1880, is written by McMurdo (Enclosing a letter from Barnett taking McMurdo to arrange at Hoare's the bankers on Wednesday, and stating that he expected a Mr. Abrams to see him about the glasses, but that he had to go to a funeral)—I wrote this letter: "Dear Mr. Mac—I hope you will not let Sam put his fingers on any moneys realised by the sale of my glasses. If he does not soon produce my clock and dishes I shall go to Mr. Patten's lawyer and take immediate proceedings against him before a week is over his head. I will not endure this suspense much longer. I feel very bad from that horrid stuff I drank last night; the last drop was too much for me. I trust only to you. I hope you will not let the tea service go, etc I trust God my conscience is clear, having done nothing wrong since Fred was away. I do not think 8am should have taken anything from your rooms. I hope he will try to do better and not swear so." That was written I think about the third week in September—I do not know anything about the pencil writing—I never received a letter of which that pencil writing appears to be a copy—I commenced proceedings about 17th or 19th January—I have not received one farthing from either of the prisoners for my goods—I lent McMurdo 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get a will from Somerset House on 1st Or 2nd September when I drew my money, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the latter end of November—I paid Barnett's cab for him once, and afterwards lent him a sovereign—he said</p>

               <p>"I have left my purse at home"—those were loans which they promised fa pay, but never did—I have been shown by Mr. Chapman of Attenborough's a cornet in a case, and a revolver; by Mr. George Milton, Mr. Vaughan'a assistant, a table cover, which I was told was at the Earl of Dudley's Gallery, nine entree dishes, some silver dishes, a clock, some pieces of glass in a broken box, the eight decanters, and eight dish covers I have not seen yet—I was also shown by the assistant to Mr. Smith of 45, King's Road, Chelsea, two candelabra; and two chimney glasses were shown me by Mr. Charles King, assistant to Messrs. Hoare's, of 14, Cranbourae Street—all those articles are mine—I never authorised any one to pawn them or authorised McMurdo to make temporary use of any of them, with the exception of those mentioned in the letters—all he asked me for was the dinner service and the two candelabra that are in Sloane Street—I was not informed of the various pawnings, and McMurdo was very indignant when I said I thought they were raising money on my things—he denied that he had allowed Barnett to do so, and on one occasion he swore it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. I was in ill—health when I lived at Dulwich—I had not the slightest idea of leaving the house till they proposed it—I left it a fortnight or so before the rent became due—I did not leave it for the purpose of avoiding the payment of rent—the prisoners told me to place myself in their hands, and if anybody came for the rent I was to refer him to them—I knew my landlord could seize the furniture for the rent—it was his security—my husband went to Persia in October—I did not create a disturbance at Aquarium Chambers on 8th January—I was very angry—McMurdo wanted me to place my dinner service and Dresden figure! at Hoare's, the bankers—he said he had a writ over his head, and I said I would not let my glasses go—this was on the 5th, and he promised me faithfully they should not go—when I went two days afterwards I found they had gone, and I said "They have robbed me most cruelly and deceived me," and that was all the noise I made—I said that in the evening on the landing at Aquarium Chambers—when the landlord said to me "Everything is gone, your glasses have gone/' I was so astounded I said it was a most cruel swindle—McMurdo wrote me a letter after my visit on the 8th threatening that he would write fully to my husband and explain his position in the matter without reserve, or something like that—I only gave McMurdo authority to sell my property for me subject to my approval, but not to pawn it—I never authorised him to deal with it for his own purposes because he was in a difficulty, except the dinner service and the two Dresden figures, about which he asked my permission on the 6th, while they were already pawned on the 3rd—he always told me he was doing a good business—I did not know anything about a tutor named Hoare—he said he wished to place my property at Hoare's, the bankers, and I gave him permission to place these two articles alone—I wrote this letter on 5th January: "Dear Mr. McMurdo,—You are at liberty to use my things until you get that business finished, when, of course, you will return mine to me. In the meantime, I hope you are negotiating for the sale of my glasses.' McMurdo dictated the whole of that letter—I wrote it unwillingly because he pressed me and said he should have to go to prison or to Paris that night, and I said "I do not like you to leave my things in the hands of Mr. Barnett"—I do not remember whether I said at the police-court that the letter was written at McMurdo's dictation—I have not a good</p>

               <p>went into the room, and said "Mr. Barnett, I will thank you to bring back my silver glasses"—I think I went there about 30 times—he was not always present—they generally came in one close upon the other, about 1 o'clock when I had waited from 10 o'clock—I have heard Barnett play the piano when I was having my tea at the chambers with him and McMurdo—they walked with me to Victoria Station in the daytime—I was never out late at night with McMurdo—I was unwell when Barnett dictated the letter—I did not like the whole transaction—McMurdo said "I burnt your letter, Mrs. Patten; I have thrown your letter in the fire"—Barnett never said "Mrs. Patten, please sign that letter?"—he was never very polite—I thought I was confiding in honourable men, therefore I signed it—he said "I only want it in case Mr. Patten comes home"—the things were already in the van when the letter was written—I doubted Barnett from the time he asked me to sign that letter; I consented to do so, but I was very sorry, and I went to McMurdo—he said "I have thrown your letter in the fire"—I am not in the habit of signing letters without reading them—I had no dealings with Mr. Moore; I never signed the letter authorising him to remove my goods he did not refuse to remove them till I signed an authority—I asked "How many packing-cases have you?" and I made the men go and count them—I let the things go, because I thought I was trusting to honourable men—McMurdo said Barnett had nothing to do with it when I accused him—I knew McMurdo to be in partnership with Barnett as "Herbert and Co.'—I never liked Barnett—I thought he would get McMurdo into trouble—I am sorry I burned my letters, as they would have gone to my credit—in one of these letters I asked Mr. McMurdo to do the right thing—I do not remember anything more of their contents—on one occasion Barnett was upstairs a long time, and I said to McMurdo "What a long time he is"—he said "It is all right"—I said three times "I should like to know what he is doing"—he was up there 20 minutes—I did not look upon him in the light of a professional valuer—he would have mentioned it if he had been one—he did not come there at my suggestion—I am quite sure the letters which I destroyed contained no authority whatever to the prisoner—I am sure I was to be consulted as to the disposal of my goods; I revoked my authority when I went to the chambers and found they had parted with my clock, table-cover, and dishes, and I tried to stop the sale of everything—he was to sell nothing but the glasses—I do not know how it is that this letter is signed in two places—I fancy it was written so faint that I could hardly see the writing—I have pawned my good, but not frequently—I pawned two diamonds rings—I was not afraid of keeping the revolver in my house—I did run away when Mr. Barnett tried it—it was not loaded, but I did not care to be near—I never made McMurdo a present of it, nor of a cornet—I am sure I did not make any present to Barnett—I believed McMurdo when he said that Barnett was working for him in the matter—McMurdo said that Barnett did all the dirty work; he will not be my partner long; 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is due for rent—I let McMurdo have the agreement) and he refused to give it up—I have asked him for it—he did not say he had lost it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bath Road, Chiswick, and am in partnership with Richard Freeman in some building operations—the prisoner was our clerk about six weeks—on 26th January we owed Mr. T. W. Far<lb/>milce, of Rochester Row, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I handed this crossed cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to the prisoner and told him to write a note stating that he enclosed the cheque, and I saw him put the letter with the cheque and seal it in an envelope which he placed in the office, for posting—the office is a temporary building on the estate—it was the prisoner's duty to post the letters—on 2nd December I received the cheque back through our bankers, and we were debited with the amount—this endorsement, "F. W. Farmiloe," is to the best of my belief the prisoner's writing; it corresponds with this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I saw him write—he was supposed to hand me the letters for the firm unopened, whenever I went into the office—I was there on 4th Feb., and saw him there—he handed me this letter of Feb. 3rd on 7th Feb. open—he had no authority to open it—I had asked him half a dozen times if he had posted Mr. Farmiloe's letter, and he said he had, and I asked him several times whether he had received a receipt—he said "No," and I told him to write for one on the 4th—I got this letter from Mr. Farmiloe—I had given no authority to the prisoner for it to be written: "Gentlemen,—A cheque was posted to you on January 24th, Saturday. "We are now making inquiries, and will settle the matter in the course of a few days.—Yours truly, Barnes and Freeman, per R. G." On 4th February I told him to write for a receipt—I was at the office again on Saturday, February 7th, and asked the prisoner if he had received a receipt from Familoe, and he brought me this letter open: "Dear Sir,—In reply to yours, no cheque has yet reached us, and we shall be glad to have same by early post.—T. W. Farmiloe." I have not changed any cheque at Mr. Suter, the grocer's, nor have any of my cheques been sent down there, but I have drawn small cheques, which I believe have been changed there—on 9th February I gave the prisoner in custody—I heard him ask Sergeant Francis to let him look at the endorsement on the cheque—the inspector asked him why—he said "I thought it was written with a quill; a quill is sometimes used in our office"—he told me half a dozen times that that letter had been posted with the cheque.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am the senior partner—Mr. Freeman looks after the practical part—I cannot swear that the endorsement is in the prisoner's writing—I was there every day from 27th January to 7th February—when I was not there the prisoner was not entrusted alone to pay the wages of 90 workmen, Mr. Howard, the foreman, assists in paying on Saturdays—the prisoner was trusted with money to a large extent, sometimes 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—we pay about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—on the 24th, in the afternoon, I told the prisoner I had lost my key of the office, but I found it about a fortnight afterwards—I sometimes posted letters myself if I was going to the station—there were other letters on this day, but I did not post them—I saw them on the desk—I had no letter to post that day with a cheque in it—there was no cheque that day payable to a Mr. George Wright, dated the 24th—I do not recollect Mr. Freeman asking me as to the posting of that; cheque, or my telling him that I had given it to a page boy to post—I had no reason to be angry with the prisoner—he had been employed to check</p>

               <p>the accounts of the firm, and he came to the conclusion that I had had more than I was entitled to; that was a fact, but it was with the consent of my partner—no cheques were ever drawn out without our mutual consent, and they were all payable to order—Mr. Farmiloe's initials are S. "W., and the endorsement looks like F. and W.—I gave the prisoner the cheque at 9.30 or 10 a.m, and business was over by 1 or 1.15—I did not open the letter of 3rd February in the prisoner's presence—I did not instruct him to write this letter—I think I said at the police-court that I had told him to write for a receipt to Farmiloe—I may have said that that was the letter I instructed him to write to Mr. Farmiloe, but that was a mistake on my part—the prisoner only opened invoices which came in halfpenny envelopes—I never bad an open letter handed to ma</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I subsequently found my key in an old pair of trousers at my private house—none of the workmen could get it there—I had no feeling against the prisoner for finding out that I had drawn more than my share—as far as I know I never had a letter handed to me which had previously been opened by the prisoner—Messrs, Farmiloe's envelopes do not bear their stamp outside—this letter was handed to me, but I swear I did not read it—Mr. Suter is not a friend of mine, but I have heard that he has changed our crossed cheques for our workmen—I never saw him till 9th February.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Barnes—I was present on 24th January when a cheque for Mr. Farmiloe was handed to the prisoner—I saw him write a note and place it in an envelope and put it in front of his book on his desk at 1.15 on Saturday—he afterwards asked me for the key of the office—I said, "What do you want it for?"—he said, "I have left my coat in the office"—I said, "I am going that way; I will go with you"—I was then at my residence—when we got 100 yards from the office he said, "You need not go any farther; I can go and get my coat if you will give me the key; you need not go; I don't think I have posted Farmiloe's letter"—I said, "If you have not there will be a tremendous noise about it"—he said nothing—I went as far as the door with him and tamed the key myself, and he entered about 2 yards, and said, "It is all right"—I thought he meant that the letter was there—we went back together part of the way—on the Monday or Tuesday after that I asked him if he bad posted the letter, and he said that he had—on the 30th I asked him again, as we had a letter from Farmiloe's saying that they had not had the cheque, and he said he had posted it—on the 7th Mr. Barnes asked him again if there was any receipt—he said "No"—all letters, except invoices, are opened by Mr. Barnes or myself—the prisoner's instructions were not to open any, and he has never handed me any opened—I did not give him authority to write the letter of the 4th, or any letter whatever excepting for orders—I know Suter, the; grocer; I have changed from 30 to 50 cheques there; I deal there, and my daughter changed them for me—I cannot say whether the prisoner knew that, but he knew that the other workmen changed their crossed cheques there—the endorsement to this cheque is in the prisoner's writing, to the best of my belief; I have seen it on several occasions, and I believe this to be a T—Mr. Barnes has drawn more money than his share by mutual arrangement, and I have not taken offence at it; nothing has been said about it; we are going on in our usual way.</p>

               <p>did not go into the office with him; he fetched his coat and hold it under his arm; he was there two or two and a half minutes—the shed has a window which opens to the yard; there are shutters to it—I was always friendly with the prisoner because I thought he was an honest man—he gave me money twice to take care of for him, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew that my partner had had more than his share, but we did not know how it stood, and Gale was employed in December to put it together—I allowed him to draw what money he wanted, but he was to pay mo 5 per cent. if he did—I questioned Mr. Barnes as to posting a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he told me he gave it to his page—boy to post—that was not a fact, because he did not want any one to know how he was placed—I am not able to read writing, but to the best of my belief this signature is the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The reason he gave for not posting the cheque was that we were short of money and we must keep it back till Monday—that was not true.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, of 17, Tower Hill, in partnership with Mr. Koch—in January, 1879, Ruppert was introduced to us, and we appointed him our traveller—he was to receive 5 per cent, commission, on cheap wines, and 10 per cent, on expensive ones, to be settled weekly—he tot introduced customers for small orders, which were paid for, and subsequently a number of other customers—we supplied them with wine to the amount of about 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entirely upon his orders—he said that he had been 18 years in London, and knew the trade perfectly well, and would introduce good people—he said he was a Belgian, and the father of many children, and though poor he was honest, and he wanted to do the best he could for their support—he introduced a man who I afterwards found to bo Reid, as Smith Brothers, of 39, Wilson Street, Finsbury, and wines were supplied to him under that name—Ruppert said that Smith Brothers were very good people, the old partner hud just died, and that Mr. Smith kept a very good account at the bank, as I could satisfy myself—the first wine I supplied was on 28th March, 1879, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards sent more, which came to 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash for six orders; on 3rd April 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 17th June 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 21st June 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards there was a balance due on the last order, which I received in cash—Ruppert introduced me in May to Miller and Co., 21, Northampton Square, Clerkenwell; he said they were large merchants ex<lb/>porting beer, and showed me a label with "F. Miller and Co." on it—he said that Mr. Miller was a very respectable man, and that he would guarantee the payment for any transactions; I supplied Miller with four parcels of wine amounting to 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and on 31st May I received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by cash for the early order; he gave mo a draft for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. on 2nd July, which became due on 10th August; I renewed it, and it was subsequently dishonoured; I have never been paid anything—I had no idea that Miller had been convicted—Ruppert introduced mo to Taulegne on 19th December, 1878, and said that he was doing a largo trade, buying wine, flour, and corn, and was carrying on business at 26, Lisle Street, Leicester Square—Taulegne ordered goods, and gave me a draft on De Courty; he subsequently took it up by the payment of the money, and I returned him the draft—on 18th February, 1879, Taulegno was supplied with 10 hogsheads of wine, value 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was a cash transaction; Ruppert said that as Taulegne paid me the first account it would undoubtedly turn out a good transaction—he said "I have</p>

               <p>seen Mr. Taulegne in the City; he is ready to give you an order, and he will come to<lb/>morrow to taste the hogsheads in the docks"—he did come with De Courty, who he introduced as "my friend"—I went with them to the British and Foreign Wharf, where they tasted the wine and bargained for it; there was a difference of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per hogshead, and Taulegne said he would let me know next day, and two days afterwards he said that he would take the wine for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash—I made numerous applications for payment, but he never paid me—I brought an action against him, and obtained judgment, but never received anything—I had ascertained that he was trading under the name of Blachere—on 22nd August Ruppert introduced to me an order from J. Lyons, of 56, Trinity Square, Borough, diamond merchant—I supplied 1 him with a small sample case of Margeux—I sent it by my carman, and received on 30th September an order to supply J. Lyons, through Ruppert, with one hogshead of claret for cash—I gave Ruppert the delivery orders on the British and Foreign Steam Wharf and on the Hermitage Bonded Vaults, and received an invoice; the transaction was strictly cash—I told Ruppert not to part with the receipted orders till he got the cash; no wine was delivered on that order, and in August I received this order (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, signed by Ruppert, requesting the witness to stop the delivery of the hogshead, as he had lost his pocket-book, containing the order for it and the invoice.</hi>) That is in Ruppert's writing—I stopped the delivery at the wharf, and on 18th October Ruppert said that Lyons had come from Newmarket Races, and was ready to take the hogshead and pay cash for it—I gave him another delivery order—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and removed the stoppage, and the wine was duly delivered—I afterwards received this post card in Ruppert'a writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, and stated thai Lyons would start for Newmarket again on Monday morning, and would be back on Thursday.</hi>) After that I tried to find Lyons everywhere, but could not; the wine was not taken away, I stopped it—I was afterwards shown the order at the wharf, and the J. Lyons had been altered to L. Lyons. (<hi rend="italic">This was endorsed "Please grant one order in my name, A. Taulegne"</hi>) That is in Taulegne's writing—Ruppert gave me this card: "J. Lyons, dealer in all kinds of jewellery, 56, Trinity Square, Borough"—on 18th February Ruppert brought Humphreys to me and introduced him as the manager of a large concern, "The London and Suburban Coal Supply Association, Bishopsgato"—Humphreys gave me an order that day for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was paid by a cheque on the Birkbeck Bank—he subsequently ordered wine of me to the amount of 98<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., out of which he paid 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never received the balance—on 31st March he gave me an order for 60 cases of claret, amounting to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which he gave me this acceptance at two months—that was not paid; I took it up myself; I have never received any more money on it—Humphreys gave me these cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in December last I found that that wine was pledged with Mr. Brown, of Leicester Square—on 23rd January Ruppert introduced me to Grouer, of 12, Clarence Street, Greenwich, who gave me two orders, one on 23rd January for a case of claret and one on 22nd February for a dozen of champagne at. 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the duty was not paid—I supplied him altogether with wine to the amount of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but have never received the balance, although I have endeavoured to obtain it—on 14th May, 1879, Ruppert introduced me to Michaelis, of 75, Little Britain—he said he was agent for three or four respectable firms in Berlin and Vienna, that his principal busi<lb/>ness</p>

               <p>was for toys, but he bought wine—I received an order from him for wine amounting to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent the goods to him; he paid me 6?., leaving a balance of 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Ruppert also introduced to me an order from a person named Whitehouse, of 65, West India Dock Road, who he said was ft gentleman doing an extensive trade in the docks, shipping goods abroad—I supplied Whitehouse with goods amounting to 172<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19S; I received 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there is a balance of 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due—I received acceptances from him, one of which he met; the others were dishonoured—he told me that his name was Cassabianca, but I only knew him as White-house—I know Whitehouse's writing—Ruppert introduced me to 46 direct customers; 21 of them have paid something, and the others have not paid, and he introduced me to 20 indirect customers, six of whom have not paid—on 6th December, 1879, I went to 6, Lant Street, Borough, in consequence of information—there is a very large warehouse there, with "G. de Courty "on the door—I looked through the window, and saw a lot of my wine—there was nothing on the door about what business was carried on—I was able by looking through the window to make this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the numbers of the cases, on an envelope—I had supplied some of those cases to Michaelis and some to. Montreuil and some to Grouer—I could read my name in full on them—I ascertained that De Courty had another place of business at 8, Union Court, Bishopsgate Street—there was a paper giving that address, in the window—I went there immediately; there was nothing on the door, as he had just moved in, but there was a paper in the window with "G. de Courty "on it—a clerk opened the door—I asked for Mr. de Courty and he came, and said "I know you very well;" after a long conversation I said "You know my traveller, Ruppert"—he said "Yes, I know him a little"—I said "Do you know anything about his dealings?"—he said "No"—I asked him whether he knew Michealis, Grouer, White-house, and in fact all the other swindlers in my vocabulary—he said "I know Whitehouse only"—I asked him particularly about Lyons—he said he did not know him at all—I said "I fear many of my goods have never reached their proper destination, and I have come to ask you to surrender to me two cases of champagne which Whitehouse was going to send to me from your wharf, when he was killed on the bridge "(<hi rend="italic">Whitehouse was killed by an accident.</hi>)—he said that he had no wine to surrender, and if I wanted to press him I might take an action against him—I had been informed before that of Whitehouse's death—he said "I can prove by A plus B that Whitehouse owed me when he died over 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., therefore I have nothing to surrender to you"—he said he was glad I had called because he had a delivery order for six cases of champagne which Ruppert had left with him, and he left 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the delivery order, and he found it was a forgery—there had been an alteration made in my signature, and in the numbers, but he thought my signature was right—when I mentioned Montreuil I said "Certainly there must be something wrong, Ruppert must have deceived you, because I have myself drank one bottle of that champagne at Massey'e, 32, Greek Street, Soho, which was supplied to him by Montreuil"—after that interview I saw Grouer at the Four Swans public-house, which is in the same building as De Courty's office—he was outside the passage—I told him that he had pledged my wine to De Courty—he said "I don't know him at all"—I said "I have seen you go into his place"—he said "It is not true"—on Tuesday, the 6th, I saw what you</p>

               <p>may call the whole family at the Four Swans: Ruppert, Taulegne, New man, Michaelis, Miller, Grouer, Humphreys, Case, Lawrence, Montreuil, and Whitehouse in company together—I obtained a warrant at the Thames Police-court, and subsequently a search warrant, and on 29th and 30th December I went with Inspector Fox to De Courty's premises, in Lant Street, and 154 cases of wine belonging to me were found there, and six eight empty cases, some of which were in a bad condition; 12 of those cases were part of the 40 I had supplied to Michaelis, 18 which I had supplied to Miller, and eight to Montreuil, three to Humphreys, two which Ruppert himself had from me, and 83 of those which I had supplied to Whitehouse—I made this memorandum at the time—I also traced 50 cases which I had supplied to Humphreys to Brown's, the pawnbroker's—I gave Grouer the benefit of the doubt, as it was impossible to read on the cases whether there were 21 or 41 which had been sent to him, the numbers wore all smudged—a bundle of press letters was found at De Courty's, among which I identified some orders which I had received from Whitehouse—Ruppert also introduced me to Winstanley, of 83, Lower Thames Street, and on 20th May I supplied him with a hogshead of wine—Ruppert brought me the order, this is it—I supplied him with goods value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and here is the receipt for them signed by Ruppert—he also introduced me to Tanner, of 16, Woodbridge Street, Clerkenwell, and I supplied him with goods value 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for which I have not been paid—I know Case, one of the repre<lb/>sentatives of Winstanley, Parker, and Co.—I supplied goods to Joseph Brachere, of 11, Florence Road, Finsbury Park, through Ruppert's intro<lb/>duction, to the. amount of 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which I have never been paid—Ihave traced a portion of them to Mceunsh, that is Grouer; they were it Massey's, a wine—merchant—I only knew from Massey who he obtained them from—I know Martelli, a traveller for De Courty; he had wine from me to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he attended on every occasion at the police-court, and since the proceedings I have been paid the money—the goods were supplied on 14th May, 1879—I also supplied wine, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, to Pignol, of Bolsover Street, through Ruppert, and have only been paid 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 10 cases of wine which I delivered to Humphreys were from my stock in the cellar, numbered from 1 to 100, and these were Nos. 1 to 10 of No. 1 brand—this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the carman's receipt for 20 cases of claret supplied to Humphreys, it is signed "J. Humphreys, R. C," that is R, Case—this is an order for a hogshead of wine supplied to Smith Brothers, on 28th March, and this is a receipt for six cases; it is signed "R. Jones, for Smith Brothers"—this is Case's writing—among the papers found at De Courty's were a bundle of cheques and memoranda relating to transactions between Block, Baring, and Block—a charge was brought against me by Block in this very Court, and the verdict was that I left the Court without a stain on my character, and the costs of my defence were ordered to be paid—the Magistrate had dismissed the case, and they preferred an indict<lb/>ment behind my back—that was in 1878.</p>

Early in last year I had charge of a case against George Reid, who carried on business at 39, Wilson Street, Finsbury under the style of "Smith Brothers"—he was charged with defrauding Mr. Fleming, of Liverpool, and other people—I was present at his trial and conviction at this Court—I heard a previous conviction and sentence of five years' penal servitude proved against him—after his con<lb/>viction he sent for me, and I went and saw him in Newgate—I have a warrant at the present time against him for defrauding Mr. de Tracy—among the papers I found on Reid was this contract note of wine supplied to Humphreys by Mr. de Tracy—I also found 68 pawn tickets, several of them in the name of Humphreys—I did not personally know Whitehouse—I knew his case was under consideration in connection with Mr. Fleming's charge, upon which Reid was convicted—Whitehoute died during the progress of the case—on 27th December last I apprehended Miller at 36, Stanmore Street, Caledonian Road—he had two small rooms there, very poorly furnished; there was not the slightest sign of bussiness—I read the warrant to him—he said "I did not conspire with any one; I bought the wine right out from De Tracy, I paid for some"—he was taken to Leman Street Station and charged—I found some papers on him, which I handed to Mr. Wontner—I knew Miller before, carrying on business at 21, Northampton Square, as Miller and Co.—I don't know what business it was—he was given into custody there for felony, but was afterwards discharged—on 28th December I arrested Grouer at 7, Bloomsbury Street; he was occupying the top room front, a bedroom and living room combined—I read the warrant to him—he replied "I paid De Tracy for some of the wine, I owe him but 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him who was Grouer and Co.—he replied "There is no company; I trade as Grouer and Co."—I found some papers there, and a stamp with the name of "Grouer and Co."</p>

               <p>on it—there was no sign of business carried on there—he said nothing about having any other place of business—when I was at the police-court on the 27th Taulegne said to me "I am not one of those sort of men; I only know Ruppert by sight"—I had not said anything to him about any particular sort of men; I had not spoken to him—on 30th December I apprehended Michaelis at 75, Little Britain; there was an office on the second-floor back—I told him I was a police inspector and had a warrant for his apprehension for conspiring with a man named Ruppert and others in custody for defrauding Mr. de Tracy of a large quantity of wine—he replied "I bought some wine from De Tracy; I paid some on account, I will pay for the wine"—he would not come with me; I had not got the warrant, it was at Leman Street Station—I showed him my private and official card, but he would not come; he said he did not know who I was, he kicked at the door, I sent for a City officer, and he came quietly after I got him outside the door—there was no sign of business at this office; it was lighted by a small piece of candle stuck on the end of a desk—I handed to Mr. Wontner what papers were found there.</p>

Humphreys and H. E. Dangerfield—those from 24404 to 24409 are made out in the name of Julius Mœunsh—they refer to six hogs heads of De Tracy and Koch's wine, ex Bitterne, and they are for one hop head each—I have the documents here signed by the defendant's carman, who took away the wine—I have a number signed by William Taylor De County's carman; one receipt for three cases and one for 10, one for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 60, all delivered to De Courty's carman—they would amount to 117 cases—I have a warrant here relating to five cases of brandy in the name of Michaelis, ex Kestrel, dated 15th April, 1879, deliverable to Russell and Co., and endorsed Russell and Co., and Charles Lamb—Michaelis's name does not appear on the warrant.</p>

You first came to my place in October, 1878—you brought me an order from Gray and Co., and I kicked you out of my place—you did not show me a letter that you had from Gray and Co., asking for samples—you gave me an order for 50 cases of champagne, and I was told that Gray had been imprisoned for five years—he was an advertising agent in Leadenhall Street, and advertised to ship boys to sea—I remonstrated with the man for introducing to me a traveller who could bring me such rotten orders—when I saw you again I said you had probably made a mistake, that I thought you were honest you said you were a man of family and would try to bring me good orders and earn an honest penny, and I gave you my card—I afterwards engaged you at the beginning of January—I gave you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a sovereign when you asked me—I never refused to pay you your commission—I afterwards</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I said at the police court that Ruppert first introduced me to good customers—he introduced Taulegne—he was good at first, because he paid me—I paid Ruppert his commission prior to 24th Janu ary, 1879—there might be some owing to him, there was a running account between us—I think I had three transactions altogether with Taulegne, and he paid me for everything except the last—I first thought of bringing a criminal charge against him in November last—that was after I had issued two judgments against him and got no money—I made inquiry—I was not going to bring proceedings against a man named Martelli—we simply wrote to him through our solicitor—it was a small amount, only three guineas—the endorsement on the delivery order of 1st December is Taulegne's writing, not the whole of it, not the word Lyons—I met Taulegne in the street very often, two or three times a week perhaps—Taulegne told me that he had lent Ruppert a sovereign upon a delivery order—I still con tinued to meet Taulegne after Ruppert was taken into custody—I met him twice, I think—Ruppert received his commission on his transactions with Taulegne,</p>

Our wines are principly of a low class the taste of Englishmen being now for low claret—I first thought that Grouer was a private person—they were not trading orders I sent to him at Greenwich—I was paid, I think, with the exception of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he afterwards said he was in business, and I sold him wine to the amount of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was to have three months' credit upon that order—I applied to him for pay—ment every week—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash at the time he gave the order—my partner instructed our solicitor to write to him demanding the money—I cannot say when Grouer was taken into custody, all the warrants were issued on the same day—I have not seen Grouer go to De Courty's place in Lant Street, but 8, Union Court, Bishopsgate—that is the same door as the Four Swans—I have seen him go in and out of that place—it is a large place—there are 60 or 100 offices there—I saw him at the Four Swans, and followed him, and he went into De Courty's—that was on 2nd December—I asked him whether he knew De Courty—he said he did not, he had never Heard the name—I then asked him for my money, and if he would let me have it shortly—he said he would—I know that Mr. Wontner has been through the papers, and says that there is not a single entry in De Courty's books with reference to Grouer—I am certain I saw Grouer open the door of De Courty's office and go in—I have seen him outside the Four Swans five or six times—I began to watch him when I saw that he resisted pay<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>—I saw him with Ruppert and with Taulegne, and I have seen him with Miller near the Four Swans—I have seen him with Humphreys, but I could not say whether he was talking to him; they were walking along they did not seem to speak—I sold some wine to Blachere at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a hogs-head, that was to mix with some stronger wines.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MANN</hi>. Ruppert introduced an order from Michaelis on 14th May, 1879—I did not know that Ruppert was a convict; he told me that Michaelis was agent for some good firms—I wrote to those firms—I have not my press copies of my letters here; one of the firms was Strauss and Co., of Berlin; I wrote to them immediately I got the name, that was in May; I wrote to four firms—I did not get any answer from Strauss—I supplied Michaelis with the champagne and claret, although I, got no answer—I saw a card of Michaelis with 1859 on it—I gave it to Mr. Wontner; perhaps it was 1869—I may not have mentioned at the police-court that I saw Michaelis at the Four Swans; but he was there—I received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Michaelis; I heard in Court that Ruppert had received 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—I charged Ruppert at first with having collected four sums, and I not having paid them to me, but since he has been in custody I have ascertained a great many others—I can produce my letter-book, unless my partner has taken it with him to Bordeaux; he has taken many books for the sake of business—he was three times at the police-court—I was examined nine times; I had the moat implicit confidence in what Ruppert told me—I made no inquiry at Little Britain about Michaelis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Miller</hi>. Your first transaction with me was for six cases of claret, for which you paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a few days afterwards you gave me a bill of exchange for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I renewed it; in the meanwhile you had 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more wine, and gave me a bill for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I came to you to collect it, and thought I recognised you as having known you before—I gave you three months' credit on that bill on the guarantee of Ruppert—when I knew you six years ago I was managing the foreign department of the Bank of Schneider and Co.; when I started in business I had capital to pay every farthing—I went to Arbour Square Police-station last August to charge you with robbing me, but somebody else had already charged you; your wife came to me many times, and asked me not to prosecute you, and said you would pay me—I came to your place on 27th December, and said "I am going to arrest you, but if you will pay me I shall save you this trouble but the detectives were then downstairs, and as soon as I left you they arrested you—I did a large business with a Mr. Danton, about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I know that he pledged a parcel with Mr. Brown; I consider that Brown and Danton have committed an act of conspiracy—I never gave any one authority to pledge wine in my name; I am on very friendly terms with my partner; like a brother—he is in Paris to<lb/>day prosecuting somebody there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Humphreys also cross-examined the witness as to his transactions, which he had already detailed in his examination in chief.</hi>

I saw Case at the Four Swans, several times in December; I was watching there from the office of one of my customers next door to De Courty's—I ascertained Case to be Winstanlev, which I did not know before; I knew him by the name of Case in December; from the 3rd or 6th December to the 15th I saw him at the Four Swans several times, and going into the passage to De Courty—I saw him with Ruppert on 2nd December; the day I went and looked through the window at Lant Street.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POWELL</hi>. I came to this country on 7th October, 1870, after the war—from 1862 up to 1870 I was inspector of the Gresham Insurance Company in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, and different countries, and had 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—during the war my health wag very bad, and I received a commission from the French Government to come here and buy 100,000 rifles; the war lasted longer than I thought, and I stopped in this country up to this time—I was appointed to the Stoke Newington Middle Class School as a professor of mathematics and classics—I first became connected with the wine trade three years ago as a regular wine merchant—in France I had been selling wine for a long time; whilst I was insurance inspector I got many orders from my friends, and used to sell quantities of wine on commission, not as a wine merchant—I am 38 years of age—I began business in May, and Rnppert was introduced to me in October—he introduced some customers to me before I engaged him as my commission agent, about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of business—he was introduced by Mr. Ellis, a customer; I did not ask for any other reference—I first saw De Courty in December, 1878; Taulegne introduced him as "My friend"—Taulegne gave me an order on that occasion—I told him in De Courty's presence that all my transactions were for cash—it was the next day that Taulegne came and gave the order; De Courty was not present then—the next time I saw De Courty was when I went to his office on 2nd December last year; twelve months had then elapsed without my seeing him—I went first to Lant Street—I went down the yard and climbed up the window and looked in, and I saw plainly and distinctly cases which I recognised as mine—I made then and there a memorandum of the numbers and eases—I gave that memorandum to the Magistrate at the Thames Police-court—I nave not seen it since; I made a copy of it—I did not go into the ware-house; I went to the office in Union Court; there was an affiche on the door stating that he had gone to Union Court—the warehouse was looked—I went there with the police on the 28th, and found there the eases I had seen on the 2nd—when I saw De, Courty at Union Court I said I wanted the 25 cases of champagne that "Whitehouse was going to bring me back when he was killed—that was the first thing I said to him—White-house was riding on Waterloo Bridge; the vehicle was overturned and he was killed on the spot—De Courty said he should not surrender it as he had a claim on it as against Whitehouse; he said Whitehouse owed him money—I asked him if he knew Taulegne—he said "No "at first, and afterwards he said "Yes," because he goes by the name of Blachere; that made the difference—it is not the custom in France to raise money on wine warrants—I did not know that it was done here; I, have heard it lately—I never raised money on wine, nor got it done for me—I have found out that my name has been unlawfully used—I first communicated with the police about the middle of November—with the exception of Taulegne I never saw De Courty in company of any of the defendants.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My partner is now prosecuting Danton in France—he if the person who pledged wine with Brown in my name—I don't know how the prisoners have got that information, except through Ruppert; they did not get it from me—the window at De Courty's warehouse is about eight feet from the ground, and the glass was painted—I had to climb up to look in—I will swear that the window was more than three feet from the ground—Block, Baring, and Block were the persons who prosecuted me when I</p>

I am servant to Miss Maria Merryweather of 2, Bruce Terrace, Lordship Lane, Tottenham—on Friday night, January 30th, I went to bed about 10.30—I was the last person up—I fastened the kitchen window with two shutters and an iron bar inside—I came down at 6.30 next morning and found the window wide open—a square of glass had been broken to unfasten it—this piece of iron was broken, and was on the floor—the parlour was in confusion, the cupboard doors open, and the contents turned out—I identify these two silver pencil cases and this stiletto by seeing them in my mistress's workbox, also this bunch of seals, and this agate seal and box.</p>

On 14th February, about 8 p.m., I was on duty in Lordship Lane, Dulwich, and saw the prisoner driving a horse and cart—a man named Adams was in the cart with him—he was driving very rapidly, as if he was drunk, so I followed him to the Cherry Tree, where he was putting a nose bag on the horse—I said, "You are in charge of this horse and cart?"—he said, "No, the other man is; he has gone in to get some beer"—Adams came out, and I said to him in the prisoner's presence, "Are you in charge of this horse and cart?"—he said, "No, this man is," pointing to the prisoner—I said to Jones, "I shall take you in custody for being drunk, as I consider you have charge of the hone and cart as you were driving"—the other man went away, and I took the prisoner and the horse and cart to the station—on the way the prisoner threw away some papers, which a boy picked up and gave to me.</p>

Of course I knew there was nothing at the bank to meet it, my account having closed in 1870"—he then said, "I heard that Inspector Andrews had been inquiring about these cheques, and I gave Collier 51. to go and square Field"—Field was the man who cashed the cheque—he said, "As regards the book, Herbert Pugh has been in my employ as a clerk, his' brother Arthur has constantly visited him, and I believe one or the other stole the cheque-book; cannot I arrange the matter with you to destroy Field's cheque-book? come out and have a glass of wine"—I said, "No; it is just as well that people should not see us together"—I then said, "Shall I take down your statement?"—he said, "I will write ft down if you like," and he wrote down this statement, and said, "You can call me as a witness, and I can say what I have written down."

               <p>January, about 1 p.m., I went with a warrant to 14, Oglander Road, East Dulwich—a female answered the door, and in consequence of what she said I placed Sergeant Moore at the back and another officer in front, and commenced to search the house—the female took me to the back yard, where I found Collier in the closet—I read the warrant to him—he said, "Well, it is very true, Pope owed me some money, and he asked me if I could do a cheque for him; I took the cheque to Mr. Field, and to pay a small bill I got the change—I gave Pope 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money." I produced the cheque, and he said, "That is the one, it is my writing on the back"—he handed me this letter, and asked me to produce it to the Magistrate, as it would be his defence—he said, "I received that—from Pope." (<hi rend="italic">This letter was signed Frederick Pope, dated 7th August 1879, stating that he enclosed the whole amount in Field's matter, although he had only had half of it, as he never went from a promise when once made, and that he hoped to he able to tend more money to<lb/>morrow.</hi>) Collior also said that I should find a number of letters from Field to him, and from him to Pope, in Pope's possession. I found this batch of letters in Pope's desk. (<hi rend="italic">The letters were put in at before.</hi>)</p>

I had this memorandum book in my posses<lb/>sion at the police-court, but I did not use it, because the evidence was fresh in my memory—I made the first part of the entry on the day I took Pope, and the second part when I searched his desk—I was then sent out of the police-court at your request, but after I gave my evidence I kept in Court—I did not stop in the attorneys' seat the whole investigation—Pugh only was first put in the dock—I took out a summons for Pope to come and give evidence, and then arrested him, and he was put in the dock the same day and charged with fraud and conspiracy, and there was an adjournment for a week—I sat by the side of the Attorney for the Treasury, handing him documents—I did not remain there pumping him after the witnesses were ordered out—I assisted him except when I was ordered out—I received the case from Andrews, who has been sent to South America—I do not know that Pope sent for Andrews, but I heard him say that he called on him—Pope never mentioned the name of Williams—he said that the cheque-book had been stolen from his box, but not that he had discharged Herbert Pugh in consequence—he did not particularly request his solicitor to have Andrews there—I have heard that Mr. Crowther was Pope's solicitor, and that Herbert Pugh was in Pope's service some time—there was no committal for forgery, nor do I believe it was applied for—I heard the argument as to a general charge of conspiracy against the four prisoners, and I believe the Magistrate at first refused to do so—I do not know whether they asked him behind your back to be allowed to indict for conspiracy—I heard it, and I understand it has been returned by the Grand Jury—I believe I mentioned in my cross-examinatien that Pope handed me the key of his desk, but not in my evidence in chief—when I went to his desk I found it broken open, and I took the documents—the cheques with "N.S." on fire of them, and "Refer to drawer" on others, were put in to show his pecuniary difficulties, I believe—I understand that four or five of them were dishonoured—a bundle of the dishonoured cheques was not put in to show nefarious trading—I did not cast up the total of the cheques—I don't know that it was 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer and stationer, of 126, Camberwell Road—in August last I received a letter from Gear and Co., of No. 6, Three Crown Square, Borough, for brief and hand—made paper—it was on note paper of this description (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had a printed heading. "Gear and Co., Stock and Share Brokers"—the order was produced at the police-court—I sent the goods by one of my porters, and he brought back a receipt—two or three days after I called at 6, Three Crown Square—as you came up the stairs there was a door right facing you with "Gear and Co." on it, and at the side, close against it, was "Laird and Co., Bills for acceptance to be left in the letter-box"—at that time I did not see anything on the door about a bank—I saw Gear, and said, "I am Mr. Thompson, and I have come for my account"—he said, "My partner is away in the country, when he comes back I will pay you"—he said the order was incomplete, and he wanted some more paper—I said "I know nothing at all about you, will you give me a reference, as our terms are cash?"—he said "No, I can easily get three months' credit if I like"—I then agreed to supply the further goods—he gave the order at the time—he then took me into the adjoining office, and introduced me to the prisoner Laird; he said, "This is Mr. Laird, a friend of mine, he wants some memoranda printed"—Laird wrote out the order for 500 memoranda forms and gave it to me—I produced it at the police-court—Gear also gave me an order for 500 memoranda forms; he said, "Don't make them alike, as we don't wish the public to know we are connected"—they were to be paid for on delivery—I sent the paper and the memoranda forms to both Laird and Gear—I applied for pay<lb/>ment</p>

               <p>several times, but did not get it—I saw Gear once afterwards—he said that his partner was out of town, that he had not got any money, when he came he would give me a cheque—I asked who his partner was—he refused to tell me—I asked where he lived—he said he was not going to tell me, it was no business of mine, or words to that effect—the value of the paper supplied to the two was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe I have seen it all since, at two pawnbroker's, Mr. Ullman's and Mr. Layman's.</p>

Greenfield and Abbot, solicitors, of 37, Queen Victoria Street; we took proceedings on behalf of Mr. Wohlgemuth on this bill and promissory note in the Superior Court of Common Fleas Division; we got a judgment and a Judge's order for the payment of so much a week, but we got no payments whatever; we also took proceedings in the Wandsworth County Court; we went to 24, Hill Street, Knightsbridge, the address of Rose mentioned on the promissory note; it was a very large house in a dilapidated condition, the windows broken and the bell broken; there was nobody occupying it; I knocked and rang and got no answer—I was not able to serve Wymark on the bank bill—I have got an order for substituted service—Wymark did not tell me anything especially about the British and Foreign Commercial Bank—he said generally he was connected with the bank, that he was the principal party, and that he would pay the money on the bank bill—I had not seen Gourlay at that time as to payment—I did not know him until he was pointed out to me by Wymark as the person connected with the bank who would probably pay the bill—he gave me Gourlay's address as Rokeby Road or Street, New Cross; he also gave me the address No. 6, Three Crown Square—after that I saw Laird and Wymark together in Cannon Street—I was talking to Wymark, and Laird came up; he was represented to me as Gourlay, not as Laird—that was the occasion when he said "This is the man who will pay the bill"—Wymark said "This is the clerk to the solicitors who are troubling me for the money"—Laird smiled, and walked across the road to the Cannon Street Station—that was all the satisfaction he got from him.</p>

I am a merchant of 59 Mark Lane—in the middle of last year I was introduced to Wymark by a traveller of mine—I suppose it was for the purpose of doing some business—he gave me an order I believe in May for a ton of glue to be supplied to Lindsay and Co., of 37 Walbrook—he said they were very respectable people and had plenty of money—I made inquiries and declined to supply the goods—one day after that Wymark brought Laird to my office to see some corn flour; Laird wanted a sample which I believe I gave him and told him the terms were cash—he did not say anything to that; he wanted to try the corn flour first—he wanted to sell me some very cheap champagne, which I declined—I did not sell him the corn flour—when Wymark introduced him he gave me his card, "Laird and Co.," somewhere in the Borough.</p>

I want my cash, or some acknowledgment"—he said, "It is no use troubling me. I told you I was staving off bankruptcy. If you trouble me like this you won't get paid at all"—I asked who was in the cab with him; was it his solicitor?—he said, "No, it is my son," and he was going hunting—he was dressed as if he was going shooting—he said, 8 I would let the matter stand over for two or three days he would send me a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not, and I went down to Hounslow again, and forced myself inside the house—I saw him in the library about 7.30 in the morning—he said, "I cannot spare a moment.

It is returned to me. What can I think of that after what I saw in the paper from Blanchard Wontner? I do not want to turn enemy, can you pay me, anyway?"—he said, "If you wish to have your money you must wait"—I said, "How long? This is not business, I am going"—he said, "For God's sake, Boulger, don't go away like that," and he ran out after me and said, "Wait a minute, till I see Mr. Roberts"—I waited down the passage, and he came and said, "Was not that cheque included in the acceptance of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "Do you think I am here to give evidence for you?

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—I have known Hodges three years Messrs. Peto Brothers are under agreement to pay him 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement is dated 7th February, 1878—the time for payment has not yet come, and he cannot enforce payment until certain buildings are erected—it is 6,766<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—'Messrs. Peto erected chambers in Chancery Lane, called Lonadale Chambers, and it is an agreement upon that—from my knowledge of him I am surprised to hear this charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The debt was assigned to me by Hodges on 28th September, 1878, on certain terms—I did not advance money on it—I did not know his circumstances at that time—I did not know that he was borrowing or in a state of impecuniosity—he represented himself as well to do, and I understood he had good property under contract—I had no occasion to inquire into his circumstances—I acted for him in certain matters—I was not aware that he had a traveller named Wymark, or mat he had dealings in needles, boots, or pianos—I understood he was interested in landed estates, buying and selling—he told me that Peto Brothers had agreed to pay him a commission of 7,610<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for introducing to them the proposal for the erection of Lonsdale Chambers, the value of which depended entirely upon tip—result of the measurement of the works when completed, and the payments made to Peto Brothers of the full contract price by the Midland Land Society—I do not know the value of the shares in that society—it is matter of public notoriety that there is such a company—the "matter is in the hands of surveyors—I sued Hodges last June for a bill of costs; I was paid a portion and some remains due—the money was obtained under an execution on the premises in New Bridge Street, in June, 1879, I think—he paid afterwards without proceedings—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lawyer's letter which produced the money.</p>

The Lonsdale Chambers Company entered into an agreement with the Midland Land Corporation to advance money to Peto Brothers at contract price, and the Midland Company are the mortgagees of Lonsdale Chambers—the Midland Laud Company advanced the money to the Lonsdale Chambers Company—it is leasehold from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on a building lease; the Midland Land Corporation finance it; they agreed to find the money and it is paid through the hands of the Lonsdale Chambers Company—they did not want to call up all their capital at once—my bill was paid about May, 1879—Peto's were to be paid, I think, 77,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they have had about 58,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Hodges's brother—he has been engaged in London as a merchant for a considerable time, and I am associated with him—he was bringing out the Bouldnor Pier Company—that is in the Isle of Wight, on the north side—this is the certificate of incorporation (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my brother has advanced 12,0001. or 13,0001 in hard cash upon it—the capital is 58,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares—it was not a success, because we had not the opportunity of carrying it to its end, and the</p>

               <p>money expended by my brother has been a total loss—the cost of printing and plans was very excessive—my brother was the real purchaser of the Basingstoke Canal, and I was the nominal purchaser, in pursuance of which 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid as a deposit, which my brother found, and as the contract for the purchase was not carried out he had to forfeit the deposit—I have not seen these pawn-tickets, but some very impecunious persons watch about the office, much more impecunious than himself, and I am bound to say that I myself have purchased a few of them, and have them at my house, and he told me he had purchased tickets or advanced money on them, I don't know which—he lives at Hounslow, and pays 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—he is married, and has a grown-up family; if you want a sample, there is his eldest son.</p>

Hodges" asking Mr. Davis to sign the articles of association in the Bouldnor Company for 10 sharest and offering to bear him harmless and free from all calls upon them)—you are going upon something which is wiped out and obsolete—I have had some experience in getting up companies—I do not know whether it is usual to get a man to subscribe by offering him shares free of all charge and fully paid up—I never saw Gear till he was in the dock—I knew Wymark 30 years ago travelling for my brother, who gave him an order for some shoes—I do not know that he pawned them, nor do I believe he did; I heard it yesterday for the first time—I do not know which is Grouer, on my oath—you heard a great deal more than was true yesterday—there was no "Co."—Hodges showed me a document with "T.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have defended and brought actions for him—I was solicitor to the company—I do not know Laird or Gourlay, either as a signatory or a director—I attended one meeting of directors—Laird was not one or them—my clerk attended the other meetings—I did not know of the letter being written stating, "In consideration of your signing the Articles of Association for 10 shares we undertake to hold you harmless," etc.—I should not do that, but it is done—I do not think it is dishonest, because there must be seven men to make a company, and more to regulate the company—if seven men take a share each it goes to the public, but it does not take any one in—I should not consider that arrangement an honest transaction if it went to the public, but it was not going to the public—the gentlemen who have done that are not put before the public; they are law clerks, or persons of no position—you would not see them on the books—the list of shareholders is a separate document—I do not think it would influence your mind to find out that they were to be held free—I do net think that is honesty—no shares were ever issued.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an iron dealer at 57, Picton Street, Camber—well—I know the prisoner; he has an iron foundry in the Walworth Road; I had had dealings with his brother Joseph who is dead; he came to me after his brother's death in March last year, looked at a stack of iron, and asked what I wanted a ton for it—I said "Two guineas a ton"—he said "Well, if you like to let me have these goods, I don't want a month's credit like my brother, I have some very heavy orders in, and we can use 20 ton of iron a week, and if you like to sell me these goods there is your money in a fortnight"—I said "You can have the goods for a fortnight's credit"—I sent him the goods by my carman from the beginning of the week—I have invoices here for every load; I cannot read or write; I put</p>

               <p>ray mark—these invoices wore made out by my niece—I left all the writing to her; my carman can neither read or write either—I sent the prisoner the whole stack, close upon 30 tons—I told my carman to take it to Mr. Stone—a fortnight afterwards I went down for my money; I saw the prisoner; I said "Good morning, Mr. Stone"—he said "I am sorry to say I got disappointed, and I shall have to go out and borrow the money to pay the men"—I said "Can't you borrow a few pounds for me at the same time?"—he said "You will be sure to have your money next Saturday"—next week they sent for more goods, and I believe they had three loads—I went there on the following Saturday, and suw Mr. Stone—he said "I don't know what to say to you, Cuttell; I expect a cheque in, and as soon as I get it you shall have your money"—I said "I hope you won't disappoint me"—no cheques came, and I sent my good lady down on the Monday, and day after day—I did not see Stone till after I got this notice of a meeting of creditors (<hi rend="italic">Dated May</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>)—my niece read it to me—I went to the meeting with Mr. King, a lawyer in Walbrook, but I did not stop—he signed the notice, but I cannot read his signature—not getting any money I put it into Messrs. Locksly and Morley's hands, but I changed again, and my present solicitor is Mr. Shepherd, who instituted the criminal proceedings—I send out a weight note by my carman, and he brings it back—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know my own billheads.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot sign my name—the signature to this first invoice is not mine—I do not know who wrote it—my men generally sign my receipts—the firm I dealt with was Stone—I cannot say whether it was Joseph Stone or J. Stone and Son—I do not keep books and cannot keep my accounts in my head—I cannot say whether I dealt with Stone and Son in 1874, 1875, or 1876—I have served them with a lot of goods, but I cannot give the dates—I have not dealt with them for 10 years; I cannot say as to four years, but I have for three years—I know that Joseph Stone. died in January, and 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due from him to me on a bill—that has been paid—10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to me by the men before George Stone came and bought these goods of me; he made the false pretence on 31st March, after which one payment was made of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was part of Mr. Stone's debt—this is the receipt, it is dated 12th April—I sent in my account simply to Mr. Stone—I knew that old Mr. Stone was dead when I was at the police-court, but I cannot say the date when he died—I knew that he was nearly bedridden before he died, and did not come to his office at all, but I saw him there at the time my goods were going in—I cannot say whether I saw him there in November—to the best of my judgment I first knew that he was dead between two and three months before George Stone had this iron of me—I only went for the money; I sent my carman with the orders mostly, and I have gone with him—I generally saw Miss Stone, the niece, when I went there—she used to attend to the books and sign the receipts—the iron went on being delivered for three weeks, and the dates are on the notes—I delivered some and some their carman fetched—I had never sold any iron to George Stone before, he had only acted as a servant I thought before—he had been into my yard before and ordered iron; he always said it was for his brother, but this time he bought it for himself—I could not hear what my wife said at the police-court, she was taken so ill and I am slightly hard of hearing—she was. present when those false pretence? were made, and so was my niece—I have not talked the matter over with my</p>

               <p>wife since; I only told her to speak the truth—I may have forgotten one or two words at the police-court, bat I think I have said almost the same today—when I went with the carman the iron was always unlocked in Mr. Stone's yard and put on the stage—I do not know whether a Mr. Caroline supplied iron to the prisoner at this time, bat he did afterwards, and he told me he got ready money for his goods—Mr. Cross and Mr. Jewell also supplied some—when the iron had been sent in a fortnight, I saw him and his niece—I did not know that the estate was being carried on by trustees, or I would never have let the iron go—I found out that old Mr. Stone had left a son who I knew as a boy about the yard, but I did not know who he was—it is impossible for me to say whether every one of my bills was not sent out to J. Stone; they were supposed to go to George Stone, but my niece sent them out by my authority—I gave bit no special instructions, she reckoned them up—I don't think they were made oat to either J. or G. Stone—I did not instruct Mr. King to write to Stone—I do not know whether he did so—I did not instruct him to act for me—I went to him to see what he thought of it—I was afterwards advised to have nothing to do with him, and went to Lockley and Manser, who wrote to the defendants by my authority—I afterwards changed and went to Mr. Shepherd—I cannot say whether I waited six months before I took criminal proceedings, or till I found that the estate would not pay any dividend—I am ignorant of the affair altogether—I do not know who signed my weight notes—I never asked Miss Stone for more orders, they always came to me, and I sent as much iron as I possibly could for three weeks—iron was sent in after the fortnight's credit had expired.</p>
