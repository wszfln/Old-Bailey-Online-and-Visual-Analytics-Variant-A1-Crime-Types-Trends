I am Inspector of Coin to the Queen's Mint—I have examined one hundred half-crowns and one hundred florins of different dates and moulds; they are all counterfeit—those bearing one date are chiefly from the same mould, and are wrapped in soft paper with a layer between each—they are all finished except the rubbing off the black powder—five half-crowns and four florins found in the bag are good and have been used as pattern pieces for the moulds in which the coins were cast—I have also seen some zinc and sulphuric acid and a cell forming a Bunsen's battery, some moulds, jets, a bath, two sheets of glass on which moulds are made, some silversand and other articles used for coining, also sixty nine good farthings, which have nothing to do with the case as far as I know—all the articles found are what I should expect to be in the possession of persons engaged in the manufacture of coin—the three coins uttered are from the same mould as some of the others.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ryan produced a written defence, stating that he had run away from home, and met Riley, and slept at his house four nights, and used to watch him making money, but had nothing to do with it himself. Giles, in her defence, stated that Turner brought in the bags and asked them to mind them, and afterwards called and took something out, and site knew nothing more till the detectives came. Closier produced a written defence, stating that he met Turner, who said lie felt ill, and went home with him and slept on the floor, and the detectives came in the morning and took them both, and that he had never been in diaries Street before.</hi>

I am the wife of Thomas Moss, labourer; we live at 16 Bernard Road, Tottenham—we used to live at 23 Herbert Road, Tottenham, and the prisoner came there as a lodger in April 1891: she had the first floor front room, for which she paid 2s. 6d. a week—she had a boy Wilfrid eight years old; a girl Grace, six years old; and a little boy Archibald aged about two—the prisoner received money once a month, she said it was £3 a month; I do not know for certain what it was—she occupied her time in looking after her children—she was very kind to them, and they were well looked after and well fed—she gradually got into arrears with her rent—she had borrowed money from me from time to time—on 1st March she paid me 13s. off the borrowed money and 12s. 6d. for rent-after that she owed me seven weeks' rent; it would have been eight weeks on the following Monday—on 9th March we left Herbert Road—on the 6th March I gave her notice which would expire on 13th, because we were leaving the house—she said, Here is a pretty hole you have put me in now, leaving after I have paid you; but I daresay I shall get over that the same as I have not over her things"—on Thursday, 9th, we moved out of the house, leaving it empty, except as to her room—the last time I saw her was early on the morning of the 9th; she was left alone in the house with the</p>

I live at 24, Newton Road—I have known the pri<lb/>soner for some years—she used to live next door to me—I visited her from time to time when she lived with the Mosses—the last time I saw her before this happened was a Saturday, I believe, I do not remember the date; I went to her room—she said she was going to Clapton Pond, and I understood she was going to reside near there—one of the children said they were going there, and the mother laughed; she said her address would be Clapton Pond, I think she meant near it—something was said about her father's house in the country; it was mentioned—she said she was going to her father's house, and the children said they were going to Clapton Pond—I bought of her an old couch, an old chair and a saucepan, a wooden bedstead and pallias—I bought what few things there were in the room, and gave her two shillings or three shillings for them, or something like that; I think it was three shillings—I saw the three children then; I think it was about the middle of the day—I saw her then for the last time before this happened—my children fetched the things away the same evening, I think—she did not say when she was going away; I don't think I asked her; I do not remember.</p>

               <p>the serious accusation she was making against herself, and she replied, "Yes, I have come to tell you I killed the baby by tying a handkerchief round its neck. Will you take care of these other two for me?"—I said, "Where have you been living?" and she said, "At 23, Herbert Road; if you want to get in you must go to Mrs. Moss at 16, Barnard Road; she will give you the key. But there, you need not do that, as I have undone the front parlour window, and you can get in there"—I allowed her to sit down, and sent for Inspector Powell and the divisional surgeon—I went to the house with Powell and entered at the window.</p>

At a quarter to 8 a. m. on 12th March I went to Tottenham Police Station, where I found the prisoner and two children, aged, I was told,' six and eight—she made this state<lb/>ment—I wrote it down and she signed it: "I have killed my baby, I murdered it, I suppose you would call it. I tied a handkerchief round its neck and strangled it. My child would be two years old on 25th of this month. It was a boy. The child is in the top front room. I have burnt all our clothing except what we have on. I did mean that you should find us all, but I had not got courage enough"—she signed that "M. James," and I countersigned it—I went with Hagan to 23, Herbert Road—Hagan got through the window and let me in—the only furnished room in the house was the first floor front room—I there found the dead body of a male child, apparently about two years old, lying on its right side—blood appeared to have been oozing from its mouth and nose—it was quite dead—it had on a frock and a shirt—Dr. Hall arrived about a quarter to nine and ex<lb/>amined the child—I returned to the Police-station and told the prisoner she would be charged with the murder of her child, and she made this further statement, which I took down and she signed: "My two children, Wilfrid, aged 8, and Grace, aged 6, were asleep when I killed the child, and did not know anything about it. I have sold the articles from my house to get something for the children. Last night I sold a kettle, teapot, and bedstead to Mrs. Morby, and bought some fish for the children's supper. Mrs. Morby has been very good to me. After my baby was dead I put him at the foot of the bed, but when the children got up I laid him at the head of the bed, and the children thought he was asleep, but I told them he was dead"—she signed that and I countersigned it—previous to the two statements being made, it was arranged that the two children should be sent to the workhouse, and we were giving them breakfast up<lb/>stairs—when the charge was read to the prisoner she simply said "Yes"—the room in which we found the child's body was in a very poor state; I found only a bedstead and very poor bedding, a child's chair, a tea-tray, a hair brush, a table-knife, a jug, a jampot, both empty, an old black bag, and three pieces of bread, very dry, on the mantelpiece, and socks and boots for the children—no money was found in the room nor on the prisoner.</p>

               <p>payment was made about 1887; I gathered that from evidence given at the Coroner's inquest—I don't know if there were earlier payments—the prisoner said nothing about the payments coming irregularly latterly—on two or three occasions at the Police-court she was crying—I noticed that she seemed to be particularly fond of the children—the only food I found in the room was the three dry pieces of bread—I have been to various addresses where she lodged years ago, and found that she bears an excel<lb/>lent character as being particularly fond of her children, and I was told she was formerly a very industrious woman; but recently, and especially during the last two years, she has been very fond of reading, and has apparently neglected her home—she went out very little and never gave way to drink—I have reason to believe that the last payment to her was made on or about 1st March—I heard she sent for ten shillings on account of the instalment falling due to get some food, and that ten shillings was sent to her by postal order—the children appeared to be very hungry, and I gave them breakfast at the Police-station.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189304100018"/>
               <p>her instructions, in consequence of which she went for a constable—I went through the drawing-room into the hall, and saw the prisoner sitting on a chair—I said, "You here? You will have to go"—she said she should not go—wishing to avoid a scene I opened the door, and walked towards the garden gate—I had not got more than a few paces when I heard a shot—I looked round and saw the prisoner with a pistol—I said "You won't frighten me, coming down here with that; it is not loaded. You would be afraid to do it"—she raised it and said, "I will soon show you whether it is loaded or not"—I ran down the path and another shot was fired almost immediately on my turning; I might have got two or three more paces off—the pistol was levelled at me, I have no doubt—I ran on down the path and round a fir tree—the prisoner was close on me—I turned round immediately and caught hold of her, and then she attempted to hit me with the pistol—I said "If you will not go away quietly I shall have to throw you down"—she struggled and I said, "There is nothing for it, I must throw you down," and I threw her down and held her—she had one hand on my throat—I called on the gardener, who came up and got the pistol away from her and held her—I said, "If you go away quietly you can go, for I don't wish to have a disturbance here"—the gardener let her free, and she lay down under a tree—I waited for the constable—the servant came back and said she was unable to get a constable, and I told her to go again and not to return till she had got one—the prisoner then got up, and went and sat on a different part of the lawn across the path, and while I was waiting for the constable she sprang up and tried to collar me by the throat, using abusive language—as the constable did not come I went for one, telling the gardener to see that she did not go—I went to the Station, and found that a constable was already on his way, and I went back and found him there, and I gave the prisoner in charge—while I and the prisoner lived together, from August, 1891, till July, 1892, I did all I could to make her contented; but she was of a, discontented disposition, nothing I could do pleased her—she was given to drink—she was constantly assaulting me, and for those causes I wanted a separation—on one occasion she threw a lamp at me—she also threw at me the fireirons, and various articles on the mantelpiece, or anything that was handy—some of them struck me—on another occasion she threw at me a tumbler when she returned, as she said, from the theatre—she thought it was her place to go out whenever she chose—she returned at half-past twelve, without giving me any intimation where she was going, and if not intoxicated she was very excited, and after using very abusive language she broke a tumbler on my head, which I had to get dressed at the doctor's—I applied for a separation, and since then I have amended it for a petition for dissolution of marriage.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 75, Southampton Street, Pentonville—on 27th January, about midnight, I was passing the end of Collier Street in Southampton Street, and was suddenly siezed from behind, my arms pinioned, and I received a blow across my head from some instrument, which was only saved by my hat—I was twisted in at some garden gate—the prisoner was in front of me feeling my trousers pockets—I called out "Police!" and one of the men kicked me as hard as he possibly could—the people were just coming out of the public-houses, and the prisoner and the others ran away—there was a lamp directly opposite, and it was a beautiful moonlight night—I saw the prisoner's face—I was about three minutes looking at him—I noticed a scar on the side of his face by his eye; it was on the side the Jury can see—it was not an abrasion, but an old scar—I mentioned it to the police—I saw him a month afterwards at the station among several others; I had no difficulty in identifying him, he was not pointed out to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The blow bent my hat—this is it, it is a high hat—as I faced the gate the men were behind me, and the prisoner before me, leaning with his back against the rails; the light was shining on his face sideways, and there was a light from the public-house, which shone on his back—I don't know whether I mentioned the moonlight before the Magistrate; I said it was a clear night—I did not describe the prisoner's dress, because it was impossible for me to look at it—I mentioned his flushed face and the scar; it was on the left side—I did not describe him as a man with high cheek bones and a scar over his eye; that is a mistake in the deposition.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lamp manufacturer, of 68, West India Road—on 10th November I received this letter, purporting to come from the prisoner, of 10, City Road, Peterborough, asking for quotations for lamps—I sent the quotations, and on 12th November I received this letter, asking for samples—I wrote that a slight mistake had been made in the prices, that instead of 36s. and 40s. they would be 36s. and 48s.—he replied that they would do, arid requested me to send on samples, which I did—on 16th November I had another letter from him, followed by one of the 19th (<hi rend="italic">Ordering two dozen lamps at</hi> 48s. <hi rend="italic">per dozen, well packed, as sample lamp was bent in transit</hi>)—I sent them to him at Peterborough—I then received this letter of 30th November with the same printed heading, asking whether I was supplying him with the stall lamps ordered some time ago—they crossed his letter, and I then wrote for payment—on December 13th the prisoner wrote from Peterborough (<hi rend="italic">Promising payment in a week Signed W. F. Day</hi>.)—I wrote again in about a fortnight, and waited some time—the letter was transferred to Bristol, and after lying at the Bristol Post Office some days it was returned to me, marked, "Not called for"—that raised my suspicions—I neither saw anything of the prisoner, nor got the value of my goods, £5 1s. 6d.—I believed In was carrying on a genuine business as a draper and hosier.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). About 5. 30 on 23rd March I noticed the prisoners in Bunhill Row—Cleasby handed this sack to Wilson—I stopped Wilson—the sack contained these articles—I asked him what was in the bag—he said, "Ties"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—he said, "I found them just as they are, bag and all"—I took them to the Station, and examined the contents of the bag—I told them they would be charged with the unlawful possession of these ties—they were taken to Clerkenwell Police-court and remanded for a week—I applied to the Magistrate to discharge them, and on their being discharged I re-arrested them, and told them they would be charged with having stolen these goods—they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi>. I am salesman at John C. Leefe's, 47, Jewin Street, E. C.—I have seen property similar to this—it would come to the warehouse in ordinary course—access from the street is easy—I cannot say we missed these things, but the last time I saw them was about two o'clock on the 23rd—I next saw them in possession of the police——I identify them as being of the same stock, but we did not miss them.</p>

You will be downstairs in the kitchen, and Dinah will be upstairs in the parlour"—Dinah said, "I knew exactly that he would not live with you a month; I knew very well that I should soon come back to the house"—the prisoner said he did not like me, he could not be apart from Dinah, and he must live with her together—I cried, and said, "It is the third week that we are married together"—he said, "You have got rich relations in your country, you can go back," and he said he could not leave Dinah, he could not be without her—I commenced to cry, and said, "You have ruined me, and taken my money"—I also said, "It is Friday night to-night, and to-morrow night, perhaps, matters might be settled more favourably," and begged him to let Dinah go away for the night, and she went, and the prisoner remained in the house with me, and slept in the same room, but in a separate bed—Dinah did not come next day, but some of the relations came, and the prisoner said that I should leave on the Saturday night, and I should have to rent a room for 3s.—I said, "Where shall I get the 3s. from?"—he said, "You write home and get some money"—it was under the impression that I was to leave altogether on the Saturday that Dinah went away on the Friday night—I went on the Sunday and complained to the police—I slept in William Street on the Saturday night in our own house—the prisoner was in</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Turk's Head, 711, Old Kent Road—on December 10th the prisoner called and asked me if I was insured against burglars—I said, "No"—he said, "I represent the General Accident Insurance Company, and we insure against burglars; Mr. Coveney and Mr. Davis have already insured with me, and sent me on to know whether you would insure"—Mr. Coveney is chairman of the Licensed Victuallers' Asylum, and Mr. Davis is deputy-chairman of the East-end Protection Association—both are well known—the prisoner had a book in his hand; which he showed me, and I agreed to insure with him for £200, for which I paid him £1 5s. 6d. premium—he gave me the receipt, and said I was to receive my policy in about fourteen days—I have never received it—on February 9th I had a burglary at my house, and wrote to the office of the corporation, but received no money—I parted with my money because he mentioned Mr. Coveney and Mr. Davis—I knew they were very respectable and well acquainted with the trade, and would not send anybody to me unless it was <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, and I took his word that they had insured with him, and that he was an agent of the corporation, and that by paying the £1 5s. 6d.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He told me that he had seen Mr. Davis and Mr. Coveney, that they had already insured with him, and that Mr. Coveney asked him to call on me—I made no note of the conversation—I am not aware that my proposal was forwarded for acceptance within five days by the prisoner, and declined and sent back, because it was not properly filled in—he had no proposal form the first time—I noticed on the receipt, "This receipt is issued subject to the risk of acceptance by the directors"—he wrote this on the back in my presence—he called again early in January—after the burglary I called at the London office of the company, and met the prisoner there—I told him I had received a letter from the company—he did not show me this letter—I have never seen it (<hi rend="italic">This requested the prisoner to state how much of</hi> £25 <hi rend="italic">applied to Mr. Casson's proposal</hi>.)—I had a drink with him on that occasion at a publichouse, but he did not show me his agency account, or this receipt for Mr. Lamb's premium, or any document—while we were drinking I told him I intended to go to the company and make them responsible—I did not know then that he was not an agent of the company—he spoke to a clerk and said, "You know I am an agent of the company"—I learned that he was not an agent when I received a letter later on—the burglary was on the 9th—I called at the office on the 14th, and asked if the amount would be paid; they said they had written to Mr. Sydenham about it; Mr. Sydenham was with me, and I went out and had a drink with him, and said I should hold the company liable—before my first visit to the office I had not received any letters from the directors saying that they C</p>

I keep the Duke of Clarence, Alfred Street, Bow—the prisoner was in my bar on the 31st—he asked me if I would insure, and said he knew Mr. Davis and Mr. Coveney, and they had insured with him—I insured for £150, and paid him 19s. 2d. premium—it was the General Accident Insurance Company—I saw "agent" on the receipt, which he wrote at the time—he said I should receive the policy in a fortnight—he came a week afterwards, and said I was to have the policy in another week—I found I was not insured, and called on the company—I received this letter from the prisoner; it is in his writing: "19, Bonner Road, Victoria Park, February 18th.—C. Wheeler, Esq. Sir,—I will call on you in a few days to put matters in order about your burglary insurance—he did not call—I never saw him till I saw him at the Police-court—I know Mr. Davis and Mr. Coveney, and when he said that they Insured with him I believed him—that is what made me insure almost, and I believed he was the agent and acting honestly and <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>, and that is what induced me to part with my money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I understood him to be the representative of the company, and his mentioning those two gentlemen's names made me insure—I do not think I should have insured if he had not, but I cannot say—I did not know that I was not insured until my risk was accepted—I did not see him write "Insurance broker" on the back of the receipt—he said that Mr. Davis and Mr. Coveney had insured, not that he had spoken to them about insuring—I will not say he said, "I am the agent," but I knew him to be the agent by repute—I know Mr. Lamb—if he had mentioned Mr. Lamb's name that would have been an inducement—Mr. Lamb had a job to get his policy.</p>

               <p>agents' acts, but not for the acts of a broker—I gave the prisoner some prospectuses, and said we should be pleased to receive proposals from him, and submit them to the directors for approval—a few days after he brought in four proposals, and policies were issued upon them, and sent to him—no premium was paid—Mr. Fuller had no authority to send off the policies without receiving the premium, and therefore he ceased to be manager on 31st December—I have issued thirteen policies to the prisoner—he has paid the premium on one, that is, Mr. Lamb's—that was paid by a crossed cheque payable to the company—on 3rd January the prisoner called in reference to his being duly appointed as agent—Mr. Mackinnon gave him an application form to fill up, not in my presence—this letter of 13th January is in the handwriting of the manager at Perth (<hi rend="italic">This declined to appoint the prisoner</hi>.)—he called again on the 14th, and said he could not understand the action of the head office in refusing to appoint him as agent—I said if he remitted the premiums he had received to the head office they might reconsider the matter—he said he would do so—this letter of the 14th January to the prisoner is my writing (<hi rend="italic">This requested the prisoner to hand over all prospectusus and papers belonging to the company, including note-books, counterfoils, and cover note-books</hi>.)—a cover book is a book out of which a form is given to the person who pays a premium before the policy is sent to him, in case a fire occurs—the prisoner called again on the 19th—I know Mr. Mackinnon's signature—this letter is written by him, and the enclosure by a clerk at the head office (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th January, requesting a cheque for</hi> £9, <hi rend="italic">the amount of account due, and enclosing a list of the names of persons who had paid him premiums</hi>.)—when he called on the 19th he gave me these prospectuses, and said he had destroyed the receipts and counterfoils—I did not see him again till at the Police-court—if he had been duly appointed agent I should have accepted proposals, although the premium had not been paid, if I considered them satisfactory—Mr. Casson's premium, £1 5s. 6d., has not been paid, nor Mr. Wheeler's, 19s. 2d.—this is a letter to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the company could not accept proposals that were not paid in full, and cautioning him that he might find himself in an unpleasant position</hi>.)—we have not insured Mr. Casson or Mr. Wheeler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I deny that the prisoner was our agent; he was not duly appointed—I cannot say whether we are in the habit of sending letters of this kind to persons who are not agents—I have not known such a case—we should have received an insurance from a broker if the premium had been paid in full—a broker is a man effecting an insurance with an agent—we do not give books to brokers, or send agency accounts to them—the broker acts for the party wishing to insure—these thirteen policies were accepted from the prisoner and registered in due course upon proposal forms supplied by us—we do not supply proposal forms to brokers—we should accept forms filled in, without inquiring of the broker, if they were accompanied by the premium—in some cases we receive proposals unaccompanied by the premium from our agents; in some cases we do not—I know that the prisoner had one receipt book in which he was to sign his name opposite the sum to be insured—I said at the Police-court, "We only give them to agents"—we give a broker a register—Mr. Casson's policy was not accepted in the first instance, because it was not properly filled in; it was received at the head office, and was</p>

               <p>under consideration—the question of the property burglared was on the 10th—some of the proposals sent in prior to the 10th were returned, because they were filled up on forms applicable to private houses—Casson's was not one of those—I did not enclose any proposal forms to the prisoner, but it might have been done in the office—on 14th February the prisoner produced several letters and the agency account, and showed them to Mr. Casson—I do not know whether he produced the letter—Mr. Casson called on me after the burglary, and I told him no insurance had been effected—I do not think the prisoner was present—I remember on one occasion the prisoner giving Mr. Casson some documents—I don't know what they were—I do not remember his saying, "I am an agent, look at these documents"—I said in his presence that he was not an agent—he did not then produce the documents in my presence, and show them to Mr. Casson—they were shown to Mr. Casson just as he was leaving the office—I do not know why he took the documents out—I do not recollect his telling Mr. Casson that he had a monthly account, or Mr. Casson saying that he would hold him responsible—he said he would hold the company responsible.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the City of Canton, Poplar—on February 15th the prisoner came to me and asked me to insure against burglaries—I asked him what company—he said, "The Ocean, Mansion House Buildings; I have several names of publicans who have insured; Mr. Davis and Mr. Coveney, and Mr. Loader"—I knew Mr. Davis and Mr. Coveney, and thought if it was good enough for them it was good enough for me, and I agreed to insure for £200, and paid him £1 9s. 6d. premium—he gave me a receipt, and wrote his name on the back of it, and said that I should have the policy in fourteen days—I have also a jobmaster's business, and he said, "Why not insure it?"—he called three days afterwards, and I said I had not made up my mind—I have never seen my policy—I next saw the prisoner in the public-house on the day he was arrested.</p>

               <p>a good man, is he well up in his work, and is he honest?"—he said, "Yes, he is a thoroughly good man, thoroughly up to his work, and strictly honest; I am very sorry to part with him, but he could not get up in the morning"—I took Crew on that reference—he came in on Thursday evening, 30th June—I keep an account of the takings daily, and I did so the Friday following, and in the evening, when the house was closed, and he was going to bed, we counted the cash—I called him down, and asked him if he was sure he had made no mistake in giving change during the day, as we were busy as usual in all the bars, and our takings were considerably less—he said he was sure he had made no mistake, and all he knew was that he had been hard at work serving all day—he remained till mid-day Monday—on comparing Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, when Crew was in my employ, with the same three days of six preceding weeks, the deficiency was £9—he absconded on Monday—on comparing the six succeeding weeks, the same days, the deficiency was £7 10s.—the takings went up again immediately he left to that extent—the Monday he left he was told to go up to his rest, and my daughter afterwards said he had gone out with his bag—I went out, but could not see anything of him—he had only a few collars and aprons—he did not ask for his money—I watched him on the Monday from a compartment where I had a full view of the bar—I went to Ashley and said, "A pretty beauty of a barman you recommended me; the takings were short every day he was there, and on Monday he absconded"—he said nothing—I said, "Of course you, as a publican, won't think of giving him another reference"—he said "No, he would not"—I said, if anyone should apply, would he send them to me—he said he would.</p>

I am a traveller to Messrs Arthur Nash and Company, metal merchants, of 143, Cannon Street, and early last June Richards called and said he was a builder and zinc worker, of 46, Stalybridge Road, South Tottenham, and wanted some zinc and solder—I asked for references—he gave me a man named Catlin, of Carfax Square, Clapham, to whom I wrote and received this reply (<hi rend="italic">From F. W. Catlin, stating what he had known George Richards six years, and done business with him up to</hi> £50, <hi rend="italic">and always found him just in his payments</hi>.)—I then advised the firm to supply goods to Richards—the first order amounted to £13 0s. 9d., for about a ton of zinc on June 1st, which we delivered on June 4th; and on June 9th some more zinc, amounting to £26 4s. 4d.; and on the 22nd, £17 16s. 6d., and 16s. 3d. for 69 sheets of zinc, a bag of nails, a box of nails, a tin plate, and some solder; and on July 7th, 22 sheets of zinc, some solder, and a 1/2 cwt. of wire nails, value about £18; and on July 19th, zinc and solder, value</p>

               <p>£26 10s. 10d.—the value of the whole was £116 0s. 4d.—the terms were cash in a month—we sent a statement of account at the beginning of the month, but never got paid—I went to 46, Stalybridge Road, a private house—a woman opened the door, and I could not form any opinion of what business was carried on there—when we parted with our goods we believed Richards was a builder and zinc worker—we took proceedings in the High Court and got judgment, but could not distrain because we found there was nothing to levy on—about October 10th he was adjudicated bankrupt—about August or September Lawson came, and said he was a builder, of Kingsland Road, and asked us to supply him with goods—he wanted credit, and we refused to supply him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil merchant, of The Chesnuts, Pinner, and trade as Marsham and Kettle at 194, Kingsland Road, and am land-lord of 228, Kingsland Road, which was to let last October, when Lawson came to me and said he was a builder, and wanted the premises for trade purposes—the rent was fixed at £38 a year—I asked for a reference, and he gave the name of Mr. Harvey, 4, Curzon Street, New North Road—I wrote to that address, enclosing a printed envelope, and received this reply (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Lawson was an honourable man and well connected</hi>.)—upon that I allowed Lawson to take possession of the premises, and he wrote this informal agreement in my presence—he came to my office early in November, and brought this cheque for £3 18s. drawn by A. E. Mann on the London and Provincial Bank, Kingsland Branch, in favour of Richards and endorsed by him—I asked if he knew anything of Mr. Mann—he said "Yes, he is a very wealthy man, living in a splendid mansion in the Green Lanes"—I said I did not care about cashing the cheque; I did not know anything about Mr. Lawson, and he would have to endorse it for me—he said he did not mind that, Mr. Richards owed him £3 5s., and he took the cheque and gave him 10s.—he said that Richards was a plumber, who got it for work done—I agreed to cash it—Lawson endorsed it; I gave him £3 15s., and paid it into my bank, and it came back marked "N. S."—I told Lawson—he said "I cannot understand it; if Mr. Mann does not pay it I will give you the money for it"—I agreed to wait a few days to see if he could get the money—about a month elapsed, during which I saw him two or three times; but he had got clean shaved, and was wearing glasses, and I did not know him, though he was there once or twice when I called—my brother spoke to him and I said, "Is it Lawson's brother?"—he said, "No, that is Lawson himself"—he promised faithfully to come down and make arrangements for paying—he came and brought Richards, and said he was the man who had been working for him; that Richards had got the cheque from Mann, and it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> transaction; and if Mann did not give him the money he would give it out of his own pocket before Christmas—Richards tried to make out that Mann was anything but an honourable man—I said that I should expect payment at Christ<lb/>mas—towards November 25th I received this letter, signed A. E. Mann, 81, Trinity Road, Wood Green. (<hi rend="italic">This stated: "This was got from me by Richards; you must apply to Richards for the money if you have given him money for it</hi>.")—this is not my letter.

S." meant—he said "No," so I explained it, and said I could not reconcile that with the fact of his saying that Mann had plenty of money in the bank—he said that he could not understand it—I produce a blue ink letter and a letter from Mr. Mann—this was in my brother's private office—I was called away once or twice into my own office out of sight—he advised me to wait a day or two and put it into the bank again—I showed him to the door—next day I looked for the blue letter and could not find it, but Detective Murphy showed it to me about a fortnight after Christmas—Lawson told me that Richards gave it to him for work done—I paid the cheque in again and it was returned with "N. S." scratched out and marked "Account closed"—Lawson occupied the premises till his arrest, but did not pay his rent, which was £38 10s—I distrained and found a can filled with water and capsuled over the top as if full of varnish, and fourteen or twenty sacks tied up and filled with dirt; also thirty or forty bricks done up in brown paper with a screw outside—the fixtures, value £2 or £3, were gone, and the coppers pulled down; I have since seen some of them at Mr. Tilley's, next door.</p>

You gave the order for 2,000 tiles in the Boar's Head Public-house—you enumerated a lot of goods you wanted—I booked them down—next day the van went and fetched them away—after you had finished unloading tiles we went to the Britannia Public-house and had a drink—you then gave an order for two dozen sinks, but I did not take or book it—we made an appointment for you to come and look at them, because I had not seen them myself—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an order for tiles: "December 17th. Please deliver to Mr. Tattersall's order 2,000 red tiles as above, and oblige, yours faithfully"—that is on one of our billheads, and is in Mr. Everett's writing—I do not know how that</p>

H. Richards, foreman, 2,000 tiles, for W. Lawson, 228, Kingsland Road, Batey's van"—I kept the order as an acquittance for the goods—I do not know anything about the sinks; I cannot say whether he signed for them—if anyone had driven in and loaded up goods and driven away the railway company's officials would not have interfered, as the company took no responsibility whatever—after goods had been taken out of the company's possession by the Stourbank Company they were put in the yard and they had a man to look after them—this order was brought to me because at that time the Stourbank Company had no man in charge there, but they had taken goods out of our possession and we had no responsibility for them—we allowed them to remain there at their risk—so far as I was concerned anyone could have come and loaded up—there ought to have been a man representing the Stourbank Company there, and he should not have let the goods go without an order—there is a man at the gate to take passes for all goods belonging to the company, but the yard where the tiles and bricks were was at the side, and a man to get there would not pass the gate—I understand the Stourbank Company had a man there, but he was not there</p>

I am an expert in handwriting, of 49, Holborn Viaduct; I have had nine years' experience—I have been shown a number of documents—these documents H and K7 are in Mann's writing, the writer of the other letters—I believe this blue ink document to be Richards' writing, the writer of the documents produced by Mr. Withers and Mr. Benfield—the letters signed Lawson are in Richards' writing, and also the bill sent to Caseborne and Co., and signed "Accepted, W. Lawson," all, I believe, are in Lawson's writing, as is also this reference signed "Harvey"—the endorsement "G. H. Richards" to the cheque for £3 15s. sent to Mr. Kettle is Richards' writing—I make the comparison with the agreement to take No. 228, and I believe it is his undis<lb/>guised writing—I believe the letters to Caseborne were written by Wilson.</p>

He was to employ labourers, purchase materials, and bring accounts to me each week, and upon that I was to certify for the amount, which the Rector would then pay the following week; he was to bring his account receipted. He was paid according to that arrangement week by week. I look at the receipt J. O. 2. I remember his bringing it to me receipted 'J.

I am the wife of Richard Howe, of 34, Gallivain Street, Bermondsey—we let the first floor front room to the prisoner and his wife, and they had been living there about twelve months—they appeared to live on friendly terms; he appeared to be a sober and respectable man—previous to March 20th he had been ill for about thirteen weeks—on that date, Monday, his wife, who had been away from the previous Thursday at her daughter's, came home, and in the evening the prisoner's son and daughter-in-law came—on Tuesday morning, 21st, Mrs. Lawrence came into my room at half-past eight, and I saw that her throat was cut and her face and hands bleeding—she had a razor in her hand—I sent for a policeman.</p>

I am the wife of William Bashan; we have lived for fifteen months at 34, Gallivain Street, in rooms adjoining those occupied by the prisoner and his wife—they have lived together very comfortably as far as I know—I believe the prisoner was a cabman—for some time he has been very ill and out of work—on the Monday night between half-past twelve and one I heard a few words in their room; I could not hear what was said, it appeared to last two or three minutes——then the prisoner came out of his room and called out, "Is anybody here? Is Mrs. Bashan a-bed?" and he tried my door—I did not answer, and I heard him go back to his room and lock his door—I heard nothing more that night—in the morning I saw Mrs. Lawrence—her throat was bleeding—a constable was fetched—the prisoner said to him, "I done it to quiet" or "frighten her?"—I don't know which word it was, but I know it was one of those two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and have been living with him at 34, Gallivain Street—I returned home on the Monday night from my daughter's at Tooting—the prisoner had agreed to my going—I was to go for a week, and the prisoner was to send for me if he was worse—at half-past four on Monday afternoon I got a letter and came home directly—directly I got home about half-past seven we commenced to quarrel; I cannot say what about, but we quarrelled a long time, and then went to bed, and next morning we commenced quarrelling again, and I said I would pack up my things and leave him—I think I had so aggravated him that he did not know what he was doing—I was making the bed when he came behind me and put his hand this side, and I said, "Get on with your nonsense," and I felt something go to my neck; but I am quite sure he did not know what he was doing at the time—I was cut, but it was very slightly done—I noticed that I had been cut with the razor—we were both sober—I went downstairs and made a communica<lb/>tion to Mrs. Howe, and a constable was called, and I charged the prisoner—the doctor saw me at the Station—I feel no effects of it now, it was so slight; if I had known it was so slight I need not have given him in charge—I am very sorry he was given in charge.</p>

For the last twelve months we have lived very happily together—I don't know how this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> commenced—the prisoner has been ill a long time; I have waited on him and done what I could—what made me so cross with him I don't know—he was laid up for fifteen weeks with bronchitis and asthma—we shall have been married twelve years on 26th June—I never had anything like this before—he was a cabman, and worked for Mr. Burgess, of Long Lane, for just on twelve months, I think—before that he was at the Al Biscuit Company, but he could not get on very well, and came back to cabdriving—he had worked two or three times before for Mr. Burgess, not constantly—he bears an excellent character—he always used the razor to shave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner in Holloway Prison—last February I pleaded guilty in this Court to perjury arising out of evidence at the Lambeth Police-court, where the prisoner was charged with bigamy—I was present at Lisburn Cathedral, Ireland, in 1886, when he was married to Fanny Purchase—I was best man—shortly before 14th November last the police came over to Ireland and inquired of me about the prisoner, and I had to come to London to give evidence—I went with Albert Purchase, his wife's brother, to the Police-court—while waiting outside I saw the prisoner—he shook hands and asked me to go to his solicitor, and I went into Mr. Armstrong's office opposite, leaving Albert outside—the prisoner said "For God's sake don't round on me, Mac"—I said "I won't tell a lie; plead guilty"—he then made some suggestion to Mr. Armstrong, and Mr. Armstrong said he would have nothing to do with it—the prisoner came to me and said, "Say the man you saw married was taller and stouter"—I think Mr. Armstrong heard—the prisoner said, "You can't swear to me; it is over six years since you have seen me," and he said I had only seen him three times—he said I was the only witness he had against him—Mr. Armstrong was present all the time, but seemed to be engaged at a desk—I don't know what he was writing—we went to a public-house with Albert Purchase and others, and the prisoner paid for the drink—he said to me in the public-house, if I would say the man I saw married was taller and stouter he would be discharged, and they could not bring the charge against him again—we went into Court, and I was called as a witness—I said the man I saw married was taller and stouter, and that I was not sure that he was the man—Mr. Armstrong, who appeared for the prisoner, cross-examined me, and I said I could not pledge my oath to the wife Fanny either; I might not have known her if I met her, but I knew her in Court—the case was adjourned for a week, and then the prisoner was discharged—he sent me a telegram, "Discharged, with thanks, you, Sarah, and Mrs. Purchase"—after the first hearing we went to a public-house, and stayed with the prisoner that evening—he gave me a message to his sister in Belfast, and a photograph—I was to call on Sarah Wilson, and to tell her, if she came over to London, to say that the man she saw married was taller and stouter than the prisoner, and she could stay at his house the same as I had—she was also at the wedding—I went back</p>

               <p>to Ireland, and the police came to see me again—on the 23rd January I was charged at Lambeth with perjury, and committed for trial—on the way from Ireland I told Sergeant Ward some things in the boat—I was brought up in this Court, and before I pleaded I had a conversation with the prisoner in the cell—he said, "For God's sake don't plead guilty, you will get five years. Armstrong will make it all right, and my counsel will defend you. I am not sentenced yet."</p>

This is a bad job"—McBride replied, "Yes, it is," and the prisoner said, "Come and see my solicitor, Mr. Armstrong"—they went in, and I stayed out-side—when they came out we went to a tavern, where the prisoner stood the drink—he and McBride talked in the corner in a tone I could not hear what they said—we then went into the Police-court, but I did not hear what took place, as I am deaf at times—they shook hands when they met, as if they were very warm friends.</p>

I keep the Coffee House public-house, Duke Street, Richmond—Hester came and asked me if I would oblige him by cashing this money order to save him the trouble of going up into the town; he meant into Richmond—I have known him since 12th December—I said I should have to pass it through my bank—I gave him the money for it the same day; it was early in January, between 2nd and 5th—my wife wrote the name Alcock on the back of the order.</p>

At seven o'clock p. m. on 13th March I saw Hubbard, and said "I shall have to arrest you on suspicion of stealing a money order from the Ryelots, where you were lately in service"—she said "I don't know anything about it"—I took her to the Station, and she was detained—I went to the Ryelots and had a conversa<lb/>tion with Mr. Drost, and came back to the Station—just before nine o'clock I saw Hester in Hill Street—I said "Mr. Hester, I am told you have changed a money order in the Cobwebs some time ago"—the house is known as the Cobwebs, though it is licensed as the Coffee House—I said "There is something wrong about that order"—he said "You don't say so"—I said "There is, and before you make a statement I had better tell you something"—before I spoke again he said, "I got the order from Harriet Hubbard, but I did not know there was anything wrong with it"—I said "You have known her some time, and you know she was discharged from the Ryelots"—he said, "Yes; she follows me about to different public-houses, and I should not have changed the order, if I had known there was anything wrong about it. I admit I changed the order, but I did not know there was anything wrong"—I brought him to the Police-station, and it was decided to charge both prisoners—when placed in the dock side by side and charged, he said, "It seems to me very hard that I should be charged with something I don't know anything about. It is very cruel"—Hubbard made no reply.</p>

I am the wife of James Hart, schoolmaster, of St. Mary's School, Scotch Parade, Athlone—I was present at the Baptist Chapel on 1st April when my sister, Rebecca Walsh, was married to John Edward McLoughlin, the prisoner, by the minister of the chapel, the Rev. Thomas Berry (<hi rend="italic">The certificate was here produced to the witness, but</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEONARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to it</hi>.)—I was the principal bridesmaid, and witnessed the ceremony, which was in the usual form—I have been to a good many other weddings—after the ceremony I saw the parties sign their names in the register; the prisoner signed his name, I am sure—after the marriage they lived together as man and wife—the prisoner went to Ashantee, I think, in 1873, having lived with my sister as man and wife up to that time—I visited them three times—he was away a few months, and came home in 1874—afterwards, when he was in Egypt, I wrote one letter to him—his wife did not go with him, she was an invalid—she is in Court now—I know her writing—these cheques are all endorsed by her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about twenty-three at the time of the marriage—I saw the prisoner going up to the desk with two other gentlemen to sign a book—the minister, Mr. Berry, gave him the book to sign—I don't know if that was the only book he signed—the prisoner separated from my sister in 1873, and came home early in 1874—they did not live apart by mutual consent after that; I used to inquire after him, and she said she heard regularly from him—they lived from 1874 to 1878 in London after he came home from the Ashantee war—I do not know that they were living separately in England by mutual consent.</p>

                  </hi>. I made the acquaintance of the prisoner in Cairo, and on 18th February, 1886, I went through the form of marriage with him at the British Consul's office, Cairo—this is the certificate—at that time he represented himself to be a batchelor; I never thought he was a married man—I saw the description he gave of himself in the register—after the marriage we both signed the book at the Consul's office—he lived with me for two years in Alexandria—in 1888 he went to England, leaving me behind—after about nine months he returned with the troops, and remained for a fortnight, and then went back to England with the same ship, leaving me behind—after about twelve months I came over to</p>

               <p>Aldershot, and lived with the prisoner for a little time—in February, 1891, I took proceedings against him before the Magistrate, the result being that a separation order was made, and an order compelling him to maintain me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it not against your wish that the prisoner is having this charge brought against him?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Unfortunately I don't know what to say—I have entreated, and begged the prosecution—after the separation order I became reconciled to the prisoner, and lived with him again—I always thought I was his wife—as long as I have been in England he has contributed to my support—when I was illtreated by him he said to aggravate me, "I did not marry you, you married me"—when pro<lb/>ceedings were taken against the prisoner to make him pay for my support, he did not say a word about his not being married to me—he has not treated me well since the proceedings at Aldershot—he has supplied me with money lately—I have gone back to live with him within the last few months; my position was so sad—I was all by myself in this country—I thought he was some companion to me—he has treated me kindly as a companion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I complained of his assaulting me at Aldershot, and he was convicted and fined for it, and bound over to keep the peace for six months—I have a child, three and a-half years old, by him—I have no father or mother, no home, no money—during the last twelve months he left me in Egypt he only sent me £10—the Magistrates made an order for 30s. a week for me and the child; I believed then I was his wife—I heard a rumour that he had another wife and children in England, and then I communicated with the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bristol, and am an ac<lb/>countant—I am the prisoner's son—my mother lives at Bristol—the prisoner stopped there for a night three or four years ago—he has been in the habit of writing to my mother and contributing to her support up to last November; since then he has not sent anything—all these cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) appear to be drawn by the prisoner, payable to my mother, and endorsed by her—they extend from 1884 to 27th September, 1886, which is the date of the last—he was in regular correspondence with my mother throughout.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have seen my father write—cheques never came from Egypt several at a time, or in bundles, but always separately; one at a time as far as I remember—from 1885 onwards, I can safely say they never came more than one at a time—they were not antedated, or never more than a month—about 1886 my mother was in very weak health; she had a sort of nervous illness at the end of 1886—she never suffered from heart disease—grave fears were not entertained as to her life either at the end of 1886 or the early part—the prisoner has always contributed to my mother's support and mine—my father and mother were not living apart by mutual consent, he was away on campaign—he was in the Zulu and Boer wars—at the Cape he was gazetted honorary captain on account of his distinguished services—at Dover he lived in barracks, and my mother was then in London—after the Boer war he was not at home for more than six months at the most—during that six months my father and mother did not live apart by mutual consent—they did not live together—when he was in London he was with us.</p>
