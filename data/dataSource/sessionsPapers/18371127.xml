                  </hi>. I live at Broomfield Cottage, Teddington, in Middlesex, and keep poultry in a large building, tiled, secured by bolts, and a lock outside—it joins on to part of a wall, running from my house, and then a hedge surrounds the building and the house—there is a complete fence all round—I locked the building myself about six o'clock on Saturday night, the 11th <hi rend="italic">of</hi> November—I had twenty-one fowls there—I ex<lb/>amined the pig-stye—there was a black pig safe there—about eight o'clock the next morning I found a staple of a large bar, which partly confined the hen-house, taken away, part of the tiles and lathing removed, and a large bell removed from inside the door—it had evidently been broken open—I found the yard strewed over with feathers, and the heads of three fowls lying there, with the skin of the whole neck attached to them—a good deal of blood was sprinkled about the door—I found inside, near the opening of the roof, a striped cap, which I gave to Cook, the officer, with the heads of the fowls—I missed thirteen fowls and a turkey-cock—I examined the pig-stye and found the bolt drawn, and a hurdle on the top of it moved, and missed a black pig, about five stone and a half—I observed, immediately opposite the pig-stye, impressions of feet, very complete, and traced them into an adjoining meadow—I was present when Cook brought a shoe which fitted one foot-mark, particularly as to a large nail in the centre of the shoe—there were evident marks of two persons, one smaller than the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Borough police at Kingston on Thames. I accompanied Mr. Johnstone to his house, and examined the premises—I received from him a woollen striped cap—I made inquiry, and apprehended the prisoners at their lodgings at Hampton Wick, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, on Sunday the 12th—they lodged together—I found Turvey sitting on a chair before the fire, asleep—there was a pot on the fire, with something boiling in it—Shilling<lb/>worth was on the bed in the room above, with all his clothes on except his shirt and shoes—his shirt was being washed—there was a pan in the room—I found a quantity of joints of pork mangled in an unseemly way—there was some black hair on the joints—some of the inner parts were quite warm—it had been pressed into the pan, but not salted—I called Pigrum, another constable in, and took the prisoners into custody—I asked them who the pork belonged to, and Turvey said it belonged to him—I asked how he came by it—he said, "Fair and honest"—I said, "Can you tell me who you bought it of?"—he said, "I growed It"—there was no pig-stye there—two fowls were boiling in the pot on the fire, they appeared to have the heads torn off close to the throat, and the skin torn off the breast—all the feathers and flesh of the neck were off—I observed that the heads were without necks, and the fowls have necks without skins—I found some baskets in the house, and one of them with some fresh blood, scarcely cold, and some fowls' feathers and a bill-hook, which appeared to have been recently used to chop up some meat—I took off Shillingworth's left shoe, and in Mr. Johnston's presence, with a pair of dividers, I tried the distance</p>

               <p>from the top of the heel to the toe, and the mark of the nail in the centre, and have no doubt, from the measure and appearance of the impression, that the shoe had made it—on a table near to where Turvey was I found a sword or sabre—the floor of that room was quite wet, evidently recently washed, and a quantity of black pig's hair was sticking to the floor—before I went up stairs I asked Turvey where Shillingworth was—he said he did not know any thing of him—I found only one cap, and no hat—on examining the parts and putting them together, I consider there is the whole carcase of a pig except the head and feet—I observed some red marks about Shilling worth's browsers, as if he had been wiping his Angers—I considered that to be blood, but he said before the Magistrate it was paint—it was evidently the marks of three fingers.</p>

"—he said, "They were given me by Brinkley"—I said, "You must go back with me to the shop; I left Brinkley there; he has been robbing me, and has given you these nuts to carry away"—he said, "Don't take me back, for God's sake, for the sake of my character"—I took him back, and sent for Brinkley—I said to him, "You have been robbing me, and giving these nuts to this man"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You must go with me before the Lord Mayor, "and he was taken—there are twenty-four cocoa-nuts—I am sure they are mine—I saw them taken out of the house—I had left my wife at home when I went out, and Brinkley sitting in the shop—it was not his business to take care of the shop—I paid him so much a hundred for opening the nuts, and taking the husks off—I left him opening nuts—no one could have taken them without his seeing them—I had left about ten minutes when Shepstone went in—my wife was in the shop then, and when I came back—she is not here—Brinkley was gone when I came back.</p>

I have lost hay from time to time, and on the 23rd of October I sat up to watch—the hay was in a shed in the rick-yard—about half-past two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came into the shed and took a truss of hay—I let him go across the field, about two hundred yards from the shed, and then collared him—he said he hoped I would forgive him, and he would never come again—I took him to his father, who is a labourer, and lives about one hundred and fifty yards from me—I left him there, and went for him next morning, but he was gone—I gave information to the police, and he was apprehended on the 13th of November—I never heard any thing wrong of him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) I was rather intoxicated when I went to the house—I called for some coffee and went to bed—I dropped a sixpence, but did not miss it till I got up stairs, when I searched for it but could not find it, after being in bed about five minutes the alarm was given, and the sixpence I had lost was found in my umbrella—nearly at the same time I went to bed two females went up stairs—all was quiet till half-past six o'clock, when the handkerchief was found under the bed—if I had known it was there I could not have slept, besides there was time to have eaten it if I was guilty—the landlady said at first that the man had a great-coat on in the room, but afterwards said she saw somebody crawling on his hands and knees.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Cambridge-road, in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. The prisoner was formerly my apprentice—I went to bed on the night of the 27th of October, about half-past ten o'clock—my servant Emma Frost secured the house—my wife touched my elbow several times in the night which awoke me—I felt a draught come on my face, and was convinced that my room door was open—she still kept touching my elbow—I looked on one side and saw somebody's face opposite my bed, close to the drawers—he was at one of the drawers—it was not light enough to distinguish his features—I jumped out of bed and seized him by the leg—he got away—I followed him down, and stood in the passage to listen where he was gone to—I did not go into the kitchen—I heard a noise and ran into the garden, where I found the prisoner, and secured him—I sent my son for a constable, who took him in charge—on going up stairs I found one of the drawers in the bed-room open, with a key in it which had been taken from my pocket, which had been at the head of my bed with four others—I missed from my pocket, what silver I had the night before, which was about half a crown—I saw the prisoner searched at the station-house—five keys were found upon him, four of which were mine, and two shillings and a sixpence—I am sure I lost as much as that—I also missed a silver watch, two gold seals, a gold key, and chain from the drawer—they not been found—I had not seen them in the drawer for a fortnight before, not having gone to the drawer—I am certain my room door was shut when have I went to bed—my wife came into the room last, but I am sure the door was shut—it could be opened from without—there is a door at the top of the cellar stairs fastened by a button—a person could come that way to the room, and I found the edge of that door and door-post scratched as if it had been <hi rend="italic">prised</hi> open, and the corner of the button was broken off—that would enable a person to come to the stairs leading to my room—when the policeman knocked at the door, I shook the prisoner, and said, "You villian, who are you?" he answered that he was "<hi rend="italic">Jack"</hi>—I knew his voice—he went by that name when he was apprenticed to me—it was about half-past two o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was about half-past ten, or twenty minutes to eleven o'clock when I entered the house—I went up the cellar-stairs, but the button of the door was not broken off—he could not see my face, it was against the wall—he came into the kitchen where I was, and felt round, and was within four inches of me—when I got into the garden he put me into the hands of my fellow-apprentice. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> My other apprentice came down—my wife brought my trowsers and coat down—the ap<lb/>prentice held him while I put them on, and then I held him again till the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Platt-terrace, Pancras-road, and have lived there nearly three years—the prisoner is a butcher—I dealt with him for nearly two years, and used to deal with him about three years ago—there was some dispute then—he said I owed him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I did not owe it him justly—he claimed the debt, and I denied it in conse<lb/>quence of short weight—on the evening of the 31st of October, about a quarter to seven o'clock, he called at my house—I sent my servant girl down to him—(he was in the habit of coming two or three times, and cau<lb/>sing a confusion at the door, and raising a mob; and when we sent for a policeman he would run away)—I sent the servant girl down, and after<lb/>wards sent Charlotte Calnan down to him—I could hear her voice where I was, and, from what I heard, I went down myself, and saw him—I asked what he wanted—he said he wanted his money, and would not go away till he got it—I told him I did not think I owed him any, and if I did he must summons me—he then called me a d----d cowardly rascal, and, I believe, drew something, which I thought was a knife, but it was a steel—he made a stab at me with it in the left breast—it went through my coat and the lin<lb/>ing against a pocket-book which I had in my pocket, but it did not touch my person—I then pushed him off the threshold of the door, and off the steps, down into the garden, where he made another stab at me with the steel, which entered my eye-brow—I had hold of him at the time—the garden is in front of the house—we scuffled down the garden, and he stabbed me again, and hit me in the temple, which threw me senseless against the paling for a few moments—it entered to the bone—I then managed to wipe the blood out of my eye, when I came to myself—it was flowing down my face and breast—I looked up, and saw his hand raised up, with the steel in it, going to make another stab at me—a gentleman, at the same time, happened to be passing—he leaned over the paling, and caught his hand, with the steel in it—I do not know who the gentle<lb/>man was, he went away—I looked up, and the gentleman had hold of his arm—I had sent Mrs. Calnan for the policeman, who came—the gentle<lb/>man held him till the policeman came and took hold of him, and took the steel out of his hand—he said, "Take him in charge, he has stabbed the man;" and I gave him in charge—he was taken away by the police—I went to the station-house, and gave charge of him—I then went to the</p>

The prosecutor was brought there on the 31st of October, and I examined him—his lower jaw on the left side was broken in two places—the skin was broken internally, not externally—there was not a great deal of blood—one fracture was near the chin, and the other near the ear—that injury could not have been inflicted without considerable violence—I should not think a blow with a fist would cause "such a fracture—such a hammer as this would be likely to produce it—if it had struck the head with the same vio<lb/>lence, it would probably have fractured the skull.</p>

I live at Dagenham, in Essex, and am a farmer On the 23rd of September the prisoner was employed by me as a porter and salesman—Richard Lee was then my servant—he is not so now—the I prisoner used to sell for me till I came to the market—I sent the prisoner that morning 20 1/2 cwt. of potatoes, and after we had done selling, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Bill,"</hi> says I," you had 20 1/2 cwt. this morning"—"No, master," says he, "I only received 14 1/2 cwt. "—I said, "This is strange, when I sent 20 1/2 cwt." the other 6cwt. would weigh about 670lbs.—he did not pay for that—he I accounted for the rest—I went home and spoke to Lee—I gave Lee 20 1/2cwt. I to give him, and he accounted for the rest.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker and jeweller, and live in Broad-street, Ratcliffe. On Friday, the 3rd of November, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was in Schoolhouse-lane—I had fetched a clock from a customer, and had it with me—the prisoner Kain came up to me—I turned round, and saw Nugent with him—they were together—Kain said to me, "Don't you know me?"—I said, "No"—he said, "You must recollect me from what took place last night"—I said, "No, what was it about?"—he said, "You must recollect"—he said that I had indecently used him—he said, "You took hold of my person"—he did not mention what part of his person—I told him he was mistaken, and to go about his business—he said he was not mistaken, I was the man—and he said, "Give me some money, or I will expose you"—Nugent was close to him during this—I walked on—he said that the one who was with him was his witness—Nugent must have heard that—I walked on toward my house, which was about two hundred yards, or more than that—they continued to follow me, but I did not look round—they followed me to the bottom of the lane, and then Kain said, "Come, come, stop"—I stopped, and asked him what he wanted—he said, "You have used me in a s----way" and asked again for money—I told him to come on to my house, and explain—he said, "No—I am as b----<hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> as you"—I walked on till I got to my house—they continued to follow me—I went in doors—I called my wife into the shop—they must have heard me call her—she was close to the shop in the passage—the front door of the shop opens into the street—the prisoners did not go into the shop, they stopped at the door, but I opened the glass door, and told them to come in, and they both came in to the outer door—I then asked them what they wanted with me—Kain said he wanted money—he said, "Give me some money, and we will say nothing about it—if you do not, we will expose you and punish you"—my wife asked them what they wanted the money for—I repeated to her, that they had accused me of an indecent assault, and wanted money for it—I refused to give them any money—they frequently said they would not go away without they had some money—Kain said that Nugent was his witness—he said that loud enough for Nugent to hear—my wife appeared</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183711270080"/>
               <p>to be very much flurried, and said in their hearing, that she wished me to give them money to get rid of them—I refused at first to do so, but seeing her state of mind, and being much agitated myself, I said, "Give them some," and she gave them 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I directed her to do so, in consequence of the threat that had been used—after she gave them the money, she said, had they not better give a receipt, or they would come again, addressing herself to them—Kain said, "Yes, we will give a receipt"—I think my wife gave the money to Nugent, but they both stood close together—I was very much intimidated by the accusation, before I directed her to give them the money—I wrote the receipt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—my wife put a slip of paper into my hand—I said, "What am I to write? "—Kain said, "Clear of all charges"—I asked him his name—he said George Jackson—I then wrote the receipt and gave it to Kain—he handed it to Nugent, who looked at it, and signed it on the left-hand corner—he then returned it to Kain, and said, "Make a mark," and Kain made a mark—I wrote this "George Jackson"—that was the name he gave me—this is the paper—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>) "Nov. 2, 1837, "<hi rend="italic">George Jackson received</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and begs pardon for this unfounded charge. George Jackson, ✗ his mark, and Nugent"</hi>—after this, my wife said, "You will not come again?"—Kain said, "This is clear of all charges "—just at this time my servant, Elizabeth Lowitt, came in—next morning before twelve o'clock, I went to the Thames police-office, and got a warrant—about six o'clock in the evening I had a policeman at my house—I saw the two prisoners at the shop window—I went round directly and opened the door—Kain said, "A'ynt you going to give us something?"—I asked them both to come in, and they did so, after some hesitation—I then closed the door, and Ellis the constable, directly took them into custody—he tied each of their arms together, and Kain said to me, "This is as close as we were under the bridge"—I never had any communication with the prisoners in my life, until they attacked me the day before in the street—I never gave either of them a watch—I have three children, the youngest is six months old to-morrow—I have lived in my present house since 1823, and within a few doors of there since 1818.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was it not because your wife was fluried that you gave them the money, and not from any real fear that a charge would be made against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was from fear in my own mind as well—we were both very much flurried, and I was flurried in the street—I objected to give them money in the first instance, knowing they were trying to rob me—I certainly continued to object for some time, but I was nearly as anxious as. my wife to get rid of them, my flurry was so great—I refused to give it them at first, as I thought they would perhaps go away when they found me obstinate—Kain appeared the principal person—he spoke the whole time—all that I heard Nugent say was, "Make a mark," and he wrote his name first.</p>

In consequence of Mr. Harrison having come and made a complaint at the office, on Satur<lb/>day, the 4th of November, I received a warrant to apprehend the prison<lb/>ers, and went to the prosecutor's house with it, about four o'clock—I remained there till six o'clock, at which time the prisoners came—I asked what they wanted with that gentleman, pointing to Mr. Harrison, who was behind his counter—Kain said, "He knows very well what we want; we have come for some money"—I immediately took them into custody, and fastened them together—on my doing so Kain turned round to Mr. Har<lb/>rison, and said, "This is as close as we were when we were under the bridge"—I conveyed them to the station-house, and on the way there Kain said, "Oh, Harrison is a guilty man, or else what made him give us the money and watch"—I asked Kain how much money—he said, "8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and we have given a receipt for it"—this was said in Nugent's hearing—they were fastened together at the time—I asked Kain how long ago it was since he first saw Mr. Harrison—he said, "About three weeks ago, in the Ben Jonson's Fields"—he said that Mr. Harrison came up to him, and said he wanted * * *—he then said, "I went under the bridge with him"—he did not say when—he said it was three weeks ago when he first saw him—he said he went under the bridge, and there Harrison * * *—I said, "Did Harrison give you any thing?"—he said no, bat Mr. Harrison was going to charge him with a robbery, and he turned round and ran away—he said, "I have never seen him till last Friday, and here is my witness"—I asked Nugent what he saw of the case-he said he followed them over the fields, and saw them go under the arch of the bridge to<lb/>gether * * *—they neither of them said what day or week this was—I did not ask them to fix the day.</p>

Mr. Harrison keeps very good hours—he is a very regular man—I remember his going out to supper on the 24th of October last, to Mr. Ruston's—with that exception, I have not known him out so late as eleven o'clock, for three weeks before this transaction—I can say so for six months, and more than that before—he is a very regular living man, good husband, and a good father—he was very regular in his hours while his wife was lying in, about six months before—I think he left home about eight o'clock the night he went to sup at Mr. Ruston's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general salesman, and keep a shop at No. 49, Hedge-row, Islington. On Tuesday, the 19th of November, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was looking through a hole which I made in my window, which separates my kitchen from the prisoner's parlour—they live next door to me—(the window was painted, and I rubbed a bit off to look through)—I saw a goblet which belonged to me, and which I had missed on the Sunday—the policeman and I then went into the prisoner's house, and there I found numerous articles belonging to me; there were eleven pairs of trowsers, a pair of breeches, eight waistcoats, and a quantity of articles—they are here now—I saw the female prisoner, and told her I understood there was a trap-door communicating from their house to mine, I wished to see it—she asked us to walk up stairs, and showed a place which she said she believed to be the place—the policeman then said he wished to see her boxes and drawers, and in every box and drawer I found something belonging to me—I found a quantity of glass in a glass case of hers—I believe they are man and wife—some of these boxes were locked—I think she took the keys from her pocket—I could not speak positively to that—shortly after the male pri<lb/>soner came in—the policeman made some remark to him, and told him he was in custody, and that it was an unfortunate thing for him—he made no particular answer—the policeman showed him some articles that were found—I went into the yard, and found some baskets, and there was a number of articles in two of them belonging to me—I did not go through the trap-door—it communicates with my house—I can lift up the trap in my kitchen—it communicates from there to their bed-room—I did not know of it before—I have been there about twelve months, and have been losing property all the time.</p>

At half-past six o'clock, on the 6th of November, I was behind my counter, and saw Prince come into the shop, and take this gown off the bar—I went round the counter after her—she walked to the door, and gave it to the other prisoner, who walked on—I accused her of taking the gown off the bar—she said she did no such thing, but she was looking at a pocket handkerchief—I left her with one of our young men, and followed Dempsey, who crossed and went to a shoe-shop—I asked where the gown was—she said she had no gown, and had not seen her friend—I went for a policeman, and while I was gone, the policeman of our beat came, and found the gown where I had seen Dempsey—I did not we Prince give it her, but I saw her turn round and speak to Dempsey, and then, when she turned round, Prince had not got the gown—the gown was found at the shoe-shop where I saw Dempsey go to—no one but Dempsey could have put it there—I did not see Prince pass any thing to Dempsey, because her back was to me—I know no one else took the gown, became no one else was at the door, and I went after her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Clarke, a grocer in High Hol<lb/>born. Between seven and eight o'clock on Monday, the 20th of November, the prisoner came to my master's shop and asked if I could change a £5 note, and he would take a quarter of a pound of green tea—I told him I could, and weighed the tea for him—this is the note—I asked him to sign his name and address, which he did—here is something he has written—I cannot read it—I believe it is George Harris—I saw him write it—it is number 16169.</p>
               <p>(Morris Edward Berkley, clerk to Innes and Pocock, solicitors; Henry Stormont Murray, Esq.; and Charles Collins, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

               <p>applied to me to be taken into my service about that time, under the appearance of very destitute and miserable circumstances—he told me he had been very badly used by his brother, who had deducted his wages, and did not give him what was due to him, and for some months he had not been on speaking terms with his own parents—he had a portion of his apprenticeship to serve, and as I had known his brother I took him into my service as a pressman—he continued with me about six months—almost from the first of his coming to my employ, I began to miss rem<lb/>nants of works and papers—I had never missed any before, and have not since he left me—I have other people in my employ, and could not tell who to suspect—on the 13th or 14th of November, I went to No. 23, Gee-street, the prisoner's lodgings, and found two Nautical Magazines and this other property, which I can identify—here are three Sermons on the New Marriage Act, they appeared as waste paper; and here are differ<lb/>ent bills which he had to post for me, but he had not posted them, he had kept them for purposes of his own—this is waste paper, here is the Narrative of the melancholy Shipwreck of the ship <hi rend="italic">Charles Eaton</hi>—that was found at Islington—I went there because I knew he had a box there—the policeman got the key from his wife—she was present when we went to the house, and gave us the key in his presence—in the box we found the Narrative of the <hi rend="italic">Charles Eaton,</hi> some waste paper, and three cards, show cards or boards—they are mine—I did not exactly miss any of them, but the moment I saw them I knew they were mine—I had never sold them, or given him any authority to have them—I cannot tell how shortly before I saw them in my place, but I am sure they must have been there—these are August and September Magazines, and must have gone since that time.</p>

               <p>might Miss Bruton produced two magazines—I expected the prisoner would be at home—I do not think I staid two minutes with the ladies be-before he came—I had made no arrangement with Miss Bruton and the mother and the wife that Miss Bruton was to say, "By-the-bye, Mr. Goode, I shall return the two books you lent me"—I had nothing to do with it—I did not expect that she would do it—I saw these magazines first on the morning of the 10th of November, I think—I called on the prisoner to inquire whether he had posted a number of bills advertising the "Nautical Magazine" for me—I was shown into the parlour by Miss Bruton, and the first thing that caught my attention, was the "Nautical Magazine" eleven—I made no remark about it—I called in the evening, and had numbers of the "Nautical Magazine" in my hand, and Miss Bruton and the prisoner were there—I had not been there two minutes before Miss Bruton brought up the books—the sight of these books in my hand might put her in mind of it—I believe it was to Mr. Tillinghurst that she said, By-the-bye, here are the two books you were good enough to lend me"—she did say so—I knew Mr. Goode lodged there—I was not in the habit of frequently visiting there—perhaps the whole number of times may have been a dozen, both in the presence or the absence of her husband—I had no idea that Miss Bruton would produce these books—I did not speak to her about it before Mr. Goode—she did not say that she would go and fetch the books that Goode had lent her to read—the prisoner followed her down stairs, and came up again with the books—he had them in his pocket, I believe—I asked him for them, because he followed Miss Bruton down, and because I had seen them in the parlour that morning—I asked what there was of so much importance in these books that I-might not see them—he said, "They are something of my own"—I said he need not try to hide the truth of the matter, I had seen the books down stairs in the morning—he then said that Cross, the warehouseman, gave them to him—I had not been to the prisoner's lodgings in Islington, the morning of the day I got the two magazines—I do not know that his wife ever lived at Isling<lb/>ton—we were never together in any house in Islington—I knew Mr. Parry lived where the prisoner lodged—I was never there but with the policeman—I have seen the wife three or four times since the husband was taken up, at her lodgings—he was taken on Tuesday, and examined on Wednesday, and we wanted some duplicates, and we thought that a young man we wanted might be about Gee-street—I went there with the policeman, and the wife's mother and father were there—I have been with<lb/>out the policeman to visit the mother, and saw the wife at her mother's house, but I never saw her alone—on the first night we went to Worship street, I drank tea with his wife—I went several times—three or four times without a policeman, and drank tea at her mother's house—I remember the prisoner's father and brother coming in and finding me at tea there—I do not remember the woman saying she would keep company with whom she liked—I will not swear it was not said.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183711270110"/>
               <p>and we went down with the policeman on duty, and got then just as the persons were running out in their night-clothes—the fire had no assumed a very serious appearance, and there was an engine directly opposite the house—we both stationed ourselves at the engine, but there was no water to be got—the fire at last burst out, and it being an oil and colour shop, the inflammable materials burst from the window—I saw a soldier go into the prosecutor's house, which was the adjoining house—the doors of the prosecutor's shop were thrown open, and I saw a soldier rush into the house—my brother went from my side, and went in after him—I followed, and there was not two paces between us—no question were asked, on my oath—when they got in, they began pulling down all the property there—he did the best he could to save the property—the first thing he took out was a piece of bacon—I heard him say in the shop, "Are there any lives in danger up stairs?"—I afterwards heard a cry up stairs—I stood up on the counter, and began taking things off, and the policeman and others took the property out, and ran with it to the other side of the street, the flames rendering it necessary to go that way—the policeman said to me, "Keep throwing the property into the hall of the house"—I turned, and saw my brother in custody—I heard him say, "I will give it to the master"—he had the ladle in his right hand—he was right opposite the prosecutor's house—I saw a gentleman in a M'Intosh coat expostulate with the policeman for taking him—he was going to where the rest of the property was placed—I know he was about to go to France—he has been talking of it these two years.</p>

Last October a man very much resembling the pri<lb/>soner gave me a £5 note in the tap-room—I cannot swear to him—he was a tall man, and stout—I gave him change—I gave the note to Ann Codwell, the servant, to take up to her mistress, and she brought me down the change—the person had two sixpennyworths of brandy-and-water, and staid in the house about ten minutes.</p>

My brother's name was Joseph, he went to reside in Carpenter-street, Grosvenor-square, three weeks previous to his death, which was on the 14th of November—I visited him there several times—he was ill before he went there—I found the pri<lb/>soners attending him there—they lived in the same house—one sat up one night and one another—on Friday, the 10th, I called on him, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and found him in a very dangerous state—I advised him to receive the sacrament—he called me to him, and told me to stoop down close to him—he said, there was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had put into a corner, pointing to a trunk in the room, and that was for his funeral and other expenses—he had told me about three days before of his having re<lb/>ceived 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he said I should find it all in his trunk, except 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the female prisoner was present and heard that conversation—on Monday, the 13th, I called again, a little after three o'clock, and found him alone in the room in bed—the clergyman had been with him—he was in a very had, sinking state—the female prisoner came in a little after four o'clock—I had been with him nearly an hour—when the prisoner came in she ap<lb/>peared very much fatigued and out of breath—he had said something to me about providing for my children three times—I called next morn<lb/>ing, and found my brother had been dead about an hour—I found his trunk in the room and the key in it—I opened it, and found a little red book, with two £10 notes—the female prisoner was present, and I showed them to her, and expressed my surprise at finding no more—I did not even find the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said she knew nothing at all about any money, she never knew he ever had any about him—I searched every where, and could find no more—the male prisoner came in shortly after—he trembled very much when he came in—I told him I was surprised I could only find</p>

I am a servant, and live in Market-street, Haymarket On the 13th of November, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, the male prisoner came to me, and said he and his wife had been attend<lb/>ing a person who had been ill for some time, and on that day he was much worse, and from the kindness he had received from him and his wife dur<lb/>ing his illness, he had made over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to each of them, and he would be very much obliged to me if I would come up to his lodging and indorse the notes, as the deceased was too ill to do it, and he could not do it him<lb/>self—I promised to come, and he went away—about an hour after that I went to his lodging, No. 7, Carpenter-street—I went to the kitchen, and saw both the prisoners there—I afterwards went up stairs with them, at their request, and saw a man in bed—I cannot say whether he appeared in a bad state—John Gould placed a chair by a table, some distance from the bed—Mrs. Gould brought some Bank-notes rolled up—John Gould asked me to indorse on the back of one of them, "John Williams, 24, Welbeck-street, Cavendish-square"—I did so, and gave them back to Mr. Gould, and left the room—soon after that I got into a coach with the two prisoners, and ultimately went to the Bank of England—the male prisoner gave me a £100 note and two £50 notes, and at his request I ac<lb/>companied Mrs. Gould into the Bank to get them cashed, leaving him in the coach—I got 200 sovereigns for them, and we all drove back again to the corner of Mount-street—the male prisoner then left me to go to his master's, and I accompanied the wife to Carpenter-street—she had not the key of the door of her room, and she ran to the prisoner's master for it, and the male prisoner came back with it—I counted over the 200 sovereigns to him, and saw him put them into a bag by him—this is the bag, to the best of my belief—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—after coming from the Bank, he told me he had three £10 notes, but he could cash them at any time.</p>

I keep pigeons at the top of my house, fastened in by a trap-door—I fastened that trap-door on the night of the 12th of October, and on the 13th, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I missed ten—I went to Thomas Perks, I bird-fancier in Adam-and-Eve-court, and saw six of them—I traced footsteps along the gutter of the house to No. 5, and there found a bell which had been on the pigeon-house door, and there was some fresh pigeon-dirt on the floor—Gagan lived in that house with his mother and father.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It don't stand to reason that he should leave it in the box and go walking about without it—he has perjured himself, and at the great day of judgment it will be seen—he will find out he has been guilty of perjury as sure as ever a man trod in England—I thought he had a better conscience, but it seems his conscience is asleep—I would have had the landlady here, and his brother officer, that he relieved, if I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stockbridge-terrace, Pimlico, I am not in any business. In the afternoon of the 20th of November I was walking up the passage leading from New-street to St. James's Park—the passage was very much crowded indeed—when I got into New-street I missed my purse and keys—the purse contained two sovereigns and one half-sovereign, four half-crowns, and three shillings—it was a very singular purse—it was folded up—when I got to the top, after I had been dreadfully squeezed by the prisoners, a person came up and said, "Have you been robbed?"—I said "Yes, of my purse and keys; I don't mind my purse, but I don't like to lose my keys"—I saw the policeman had got the prisoners, and took them to Bow-street—I said, "I can tell you what the coins were"—they counted the money, and found it was exactly the case—Watts said, "It is my money, it was taken out of my pocket"—I said I had the same—the money corres<lb/>ponded exactly with what I lost—the gold was gone, but the keys and silver were produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Co vent Garden-market, and live in Horse Ferry-road. On the afternoon of the 20th of November I was with James Jones in St. James's Park—I saw the prosecutor enter the passage which leads to New-street, followed by Watts, Richardson, and Batchelor—Richardson was close to his back, and Watts on the side of him, and Batchelor by the side of Richardson—as they were going up the steps into New-street, I saw Watts drop the three keys, which I now produce, from his left-hand—I picked them up—he was then close by the prosecutor's side—when he lifted up his foot I took up the keys—the prisoners turned—I was behind them, and they pushed me—I secured Watts, and gave him to Jones; then took Batchelor, and gave Richardson to a police man—Batchelor said he had done nothing.</p>

Brothers; and when he came on monday morning, the 13th, I desired him to come again in the afternoon, which he did, and said he had come for the plate again—I told him it was finished—he was disappointed, but I told him he must come the next—he did so—I told him the plate was still unfinished, the workman had not completed it, and I could not give it to him—he was still disap<lb/>pointed—I prevailed on him to come on the Wednesday—that was the 15th—became that day, and I told him it was not finished—he then became very angry; 1 told him I had some difficulty about delivering the plate up, I did not quite like the appearance of the thing—I told him to write in French what he had to say, and he wrote it on this paper—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it, which, being translated, was</hi>—" Give me the plate and the note, and on Monday I will bring you the address of Mr. Walker")—I said I could-not give up the plate without a satisfactory address; and afterwards he wrote, "Give me the note only," and signed his name to it—I still put him off till next day, the 16th, and on his coming then, an officer was there, and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Bacon's employ—I understand the French language perfectly well. I faithfully interpreted to Mr. Bacon the conversation between myself and the prisoner on his coming to the house on the 24th of October—he had called the previous evening, and presented a twenty-dollar note, of the Louisiana Bank, wishing it to be copied per<lb/>fectly, and wished to know the price of copying it, and the time it would take—we told him Mr. Bacon was not in the house, but would be on the following day, and it was agreed he should come and see him—he came the following day, and Mr. Bacon was then at home—Mr. Bacon asked him what right he had to have the note copied—I put the question to him—Mr. Bacon said, "Have you any house in London that you can refer us to, in order that we may know you are authorised to have this imitated? "—he said he had no house; that he was a merchant, who had a quantity of coffee, and other colonial produce; and in the course of his travels he was to have this copied, being himself a Director of the Bank; that he had nothing hut a <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi> order of the Committee of Directors—Mr. Bacon then stated to him, that as he had no house in London to which he could refer us, his errand was very questionable; though he himself might be an honourable man, which he did not doubt, he was going just the way any forger would to have a thing executed—on the previous evening he had said that these</p>

               <p>notes had been made at New York, but in consequence of a quarrel which had occurred with the Bank they had withdrawn the notes from that house, and wished to have them executed somewhere else—I specified that the work was a very peculiar kind, which was seldom done any where but at our house and in America. and that it would take considerable time—he wished to know the expense, and said he had applied to a house, which our house was somewhat connected with, in America—he said he had come from France, and if he could not dispose of his produce advantageously here he should go to Rotterdam, where he could dispose of it—we said he must have some house to do business with—he said that he could not tell us hat house he was going to do business with—he had not yet decided what house to do business with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mathematical instrument-maker, and live in Exmouth-street, Commercial-road. The prisoner Flesch lived opposite to me about five months—I first became acquainted with him about the 20th of September, when he introduced himself to me, by saying that he had lived opposite to me for five months, and stated that he was a general agent for Mr. Brandis, of King-street, Liverpool, and wished to knot if I would like to enter into a small speculation—I understood by his making signs to me, that it was a speculation in telescopes—I let him have three for five or six days—he then returned them, saying that he had letter from Mr. Brandis, saying that he highly approved of them, but was dissatisfied at their not having the maker's name on them, and I got my name engraved—he brought, at the same time, a paper with mathematical and philosophical instruments" written on it, which he said he took out of the dictionary, not knowing the terms, or any thing of the sort—I said 1 had a handled quadrant and microscope—I gave him an invoice of them made out to himself—those are not the goods in the indictment—he called on me again on Tuesday morning, the 3rd of October, and said, that on Monday evening he had been in company with Captain Jackson, at a sort of "free and easy," in Rosemary-lane, who had given him his card, and intro<lb/>duced himself to him, and he thought of doing business with him—that he had invited him to come and take tea with him that afternoon, and wished to know if I would let him have a sextant to show Captain Jackson-he had seen a sextant previously—I hesitated, and he felt hurt at my suspicions—I said I was very sorry, but as I had not received the money for the first goods, and (Thursday had not arrived when he said Mr. Brandi would call on me) I felt rather uncomfortable having let him have 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods, which were the three telescopes, quadrant, and microscope—I told him he might take the quadrant and show as a specimen, but as I sextant was a delicate instrument, I was afraid it might be hurt—he took the quadrant, and said he would return it in two hours, which he did, and then wished to know if I would bring the sextant and quadrant over to his house together, about a quarter to four o'clock, to show Captain Jackson—I went, and all the prisoners were there smoking their pipes and drinking rum-and-water—I placed the articles on the table—they all looked at them, and said they were very fine instruments—Jackson said he did not understand them particularly, but they pretended to bargain about them—Jackson said he liked it very much—Henochoberg said it was a fine instrument—Flesch said, "Well, I must have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this instrument"—Jackson said it was a great deal of money—Flesch left the room, and Jackson said to me, "Is Flesch a fair dealing man?"—I made no answer—he said, "Oh, I know him very well"—Flesch returned, and having some misgiving, I said to Jackson, "What are you? "—he said, "I am on the water, or sea." I do not recollect which-he said Mr. Flesch must come with him to the hotel in Leicester-square, which was a subscription-room, and nobody was allowed to enter but sub-scribers, or those who were introduced, and if I would come with Flesch and dine with him he should be glad to see me, and to bring some of n»v cards with me—I said, if it was agreeable, I would go with Flesch with the instruments—he said if I brought my cards there were a number of</p>

               <p>captains there, and two wanted instruments; that he would introduce me I to them, and could no doubt sell some instruments for me—Jackson said I Flesch was to go with the instruments, to have the opinion of a friend there I about the sextant—I said, if it was agreeable to them, I would go with Flesch—Jackson objected, and said he never allowed a third person present when he was doing business—I said, "Mr. Flesch, perhaps you will step over to my house before you go?"—he said he would—I went out and went to their landlady, and then went home—Flesch came over very much agitated—I said, "Mr. Flesch, I feel very uncomfortable about the instruments"—I had left them at his place—he said, "Why do you feel uncomfortable? "I said, "Because I have had no money yet, and you are a stranger to me"—he said, "Oh, I think Jackson won't go to night, for he has taken a glass too much, and you can go in the morning with me and make an excuse for going again in the afternoon, saying you have forgot your cards"—I afterwards went to my bed-room window, and saw Jackson and Flesch go out—Flesch had the two instruments in his hand—Henochoberg followed after—I directly ran down and followed them to Sidney-street—there was a pawnbroker's at the corner—I lost sight of Jackson and Flesch all in a moment, and sup<lb/>pose Henochoberg went down a street—I went into the pawnbroker's side door, but they were not there—I ran to the top of the Commercial-road, but could see nothing of them—I ran back to the house, and spoke to the landlady—next morning she came to me, and in consequence of what she said I went over to her house, and a friend went round to all the pawn<lb/>broker's with me—we found the quadrant at Fleming's, in Newgate-street, and the sextant has since been found at Mr. Myers's, in London-road—my distinct understanding with Flesch was, that the goods were to be re<lb/>turned that night, or the money—I had not sold either of them—I had made out an invoice of them, for he ran over in a great hurry, and said, "Will you make out an invoice and receipt it, for I am in a great hurry?"—that invoice is here—Flesch put it into his pocket in my house—I have never received a farthing of the money—this invoice has on it, "Discount five per cent.; settled, J. Whitbread"—he asked me to write that—he pro<lb/>mised to return the goods that night, or the money.</p>

I was sent for by the landlord of the ed Lion—(I do not know the day of the month,) and there Saville asked me to buy these two pigs—I asked what he wanted—he said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two—I told him I thought it was too much money, and asked how he came they them—he said he bought them of a man named Lyon; and they were his father's pigs—I asked if he would take 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said no—I walked a little stance, and he followed me, and asked if I would have them—I said, Drive them to market; I will see"—he drove them to the White Horse yard, and a man came to buy them for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said, "Don't pay, I think they are stolen," in Saville's presence, so that he could hear me—he did not wait for the money, but walked away about two hundred yards—I fol<lb/>lowed him, and told him I was certain they were stolen—after a little time he said he had stolen them from the forest, from Captain Fellows—he said, If you mean to take me, there are two others; you may as well have them" I had seen James Webster, before be came to me to buy the pigs, with John Webster—he was running up the hill, and was taken, from the informa<lb/>tion Saville gave me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Lay ton, in Essex.

About nine o'clock in the evening of the 20th of November I was in the parlour of my house, and the prisoner brought this piece of metal—he said he brought it for sale, and placed it on the counter of the shop for ✗—he asked no price—I told him I did not think he had come by it honestly—I knew that persons who are possessed of metal of this kind never sell it in that kind of way—he said it was perfectly right—I said "You must give me your name and address, and I must go with you"—I went, and then I found he did live there—I brought him back to my, and told him I should not buy it then, he must call the next morn<lb/>ing—directly he was gone I took the metal to the station-house, and asked inspector for an officer to go and take him.</p>
