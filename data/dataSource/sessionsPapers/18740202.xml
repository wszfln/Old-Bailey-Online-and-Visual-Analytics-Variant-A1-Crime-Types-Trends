                  <hi rend="italic">Thurlow. Q.</hi> Can you swear it was me who knocked the man down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; two of you came back afterwards—I am not bribed to do what I am doing, and I did not tell your mother so.</p>

I was on duty on 8th January, about midnight—Price spoke to me, and I found the prosecutor at the door of his house, bleeding from his mouth—Price gave me a description—I walked with him down George Street, and saw the two prisoners comeback, looking about on the ground, evidently for something which might have dropped in the scuffle—they ran away, and I chased them up Wells Street; I got near enough to Bryant to recognise his face, and called out to him "<hi rend="italic">Mat</hi> Bryant, that is you," and I thought I would secure Thurlow as he was more of a stranger to me, and I knew Bryant well—Bryant said that he would go</p>

I know that your Royal Highness cannot suppose that I intended any grievous bodily harm. My services in the field will, I hope, plead in my behalf against anything unbecoming the conduct of an officer and a gentleman. But for years I have been brooding over my wrongs until they had produced in me uncontrollable morbid imaginings. In this state of mind and feeling I came upon your Royal Highness, when I thought the moment had arrived for bringing my case before the public. Goaded on to the verge of madness, I committed the rash act; not to injure your Royal Highness, but to seek occasion of ventilating my wrongs. I do not seek by this letter to mitigate my offence, but simply to perform an act which, as a gentleman, I feel myself bound to do, regardless of all consequences. I regret deeply to have caused your Royal Highness the slightest inconvenience, and from my heart I deeply deplore it, not because of the punishment I so justly deserve, but for having given any annoyance to your Royal Highness. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES S.

With regard to Colonel Armstrong's evidence, I will only say that he is entirely wrong in stating that I struck the Commander-in-Chief on the back. That is disproved by the Com<lb/>mander-in-Chief himself and by the evidence of the police-constable. I never struck His Royal Highness on the back. I shall endeavour now to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020022"/>
               <p>deal with the evidence of the Assistant Military Secretary. Colonel Hawley commences his statement by showing that I served sixteen and a half years as a subaltern, thirteen and a half years abroad. The memorandum then shows that in October, 1871, I applied to realise the value of my commission. This is the case. I was offered an exchange into a regiment of the Line, with a view to the lieutenant purchasing succeeding me, the captain exchanging coming on the half-pay list in my place. I submitted this exchange for approval, but was informed by direction of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, that it could not be allowed as there was a supernumerary captain in the regiment. I wrote again, venturing to point out that the number of captains would not be influenced by the exchange, and stating, further, that the captain desirous of exchanging with me had been but recently appointed, to the Staff—an appointment he was likely, in the usual course, to hold for five years, rendering him unavailable for regimental duty for that period, while the lieutenant purchasing the step, and succeeding me, would be available. I was not well off—having no means beyond, what my profession afforded, and it was an object to me to sell before the Army Bill came into force. I applied often that my retirement might be allowed in the manner I describe, bringing forward past services and every claim I possessed in support of my request; but my appeals were not listened to. I then applied to sell my half-pay commission; but it is a long story, and I would rather not go into it. Colonel Hawley's memorandum next states: 'In the interval he wrote numerous letters asking for a step of rank on retirement.' On the 24th of July, 1871, he says it was too late then to do anything for me, for I was no longer in the service; nevertheless, as the memorandum states, 'after he had left the army'—speaking of me—'he reiterated his claims to a step of rank, and to be brought back into the Army to obtain it.' This is the truth, for up to my retirement I did not cease to ask for a step of brevet or honorary rank, bringing forward every claim I possessed in support of my request, and it was after receiving the value of my commission I wrote the letter from which the Military Secretary quotes. But after writing that letter I received a communication from the Military Secretary, written a few days previous to my retirement, from which I concluded that the honorary rank would be conferred, although I saw clearly that the brevet rank would not. But this letter I did not receive for weeks after it had been written, owing to my having left London, and it was after receiving it I renewed my application, the rank not appearing on my retirement being gazetted. Without following Colonel Hawley through many portions of his memorandum, and which, if I were to take them separately, would occupy the Court longer than I desire, I will state that from the time of receiving the Military Secretary's letter referred to I renewed my application for a step of rank, and to be brought back into the Army in view of being gazetted out with it, bringing forward cases of men having been restored, mentioning one case in particular, where an officer of superior rank, who had resigned his commission to avoid trial by court-martial for behaving badly before the enemy at Cawnpore, was brought back into the Army to be gazetted out with a benefit conferred which he could not otherwise have obtained. I submitted that, if this man who did not do his duty were brought back to have a favour conferred on him, I, who was recognised as having done my duty, might at least with equal justice be brought back for a similar purpose; and I further submitted that although no longer in the service my claims were still as strong as before I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020023"/>
               <p>was gazetted out. About this period (and here is the secret of part of the injustice I so often and so long complained of) I received a communication, dated the 26th of August, 1872, and signed <hi rend="italic">"J.</hi> B. Johnstone," written by direction of the Field-Marshal Commander-in-Chief; its chief purport being His Royal Highness, although consenting to your application of the 2nd and 18th of May being considered as cancelled, in no way admitted your claim to receiving a step of Brevet or honorary rank, which were fully considered on your being promoted in 1869." Now, in the first place, the Commander-in-Chief must have been misinformed about these applications, as I have never requested they might be considered as cancelled; nor did I at any time, previously or subsequently, ask that I might be allowed to withdraw my application for a step of brevet rank on retiring. But one of my greatest causes of complaint was that while the Commander-in-Chief should, time after time, tell me he was fully sensible of the good service I rendered at Cawnpore, he should never have shown me any substantial appreciation of those services. I am told, but I can never admit it, that when promoted to a half-pay company, my services were rewarded. It is a hard and ungenerous thing to tell me this. I shall not again go into those services, but I can say that if I had never been commended for conspicuous conduct in the field; if I had never seen a shot fired in action; if I had never served 13 1/2 years abroad; if my health had never given way through many a severe illness during a long service in India, obliging me to return home on sick leave with an impaired constitution,—in fine, had I never served a day out of England, and had I simply gone to the Commander-in-Chief and said, 'I have served 16 1/2 years as a subaltern, give me a half-pay company,' His Royal Highness could not, without doing great injustice, and without promoting a junior over my head, on the next half-pay company being filled up, refuse my request, on the grounds of long service alone, and it was to my field services, in addition to these, I looked for some little recognition, in the shape of a step of rank on retiring from the Army. It was hard to go on half-pay after being four years the senior lieutenant of my regiment, and with one exception, of the whole Army; and with such long subaltern service as I possessed—giving up all hope of promotion, and becoming a poorer man than I was before. But my health was broken, and finding I could no longer perform subaltern's duty, I renewed my application for a half-pay company, which I had previously withdrawn. But I am told in a leading paper that my failing to obtain the rank of major seems to have been the sole cause, as it states, of my 'bitterness.' It is true I asked for this rank, and was greatly disappointed that my request was not granted, but I had other causes of complaint greater than this: I had long complained of a rule of the service having been broken through. When on the death of a captain of my regiment a junior officer was promoted by purchase to the death vacancy, and afterwards when a captain of the regiment was pro<lb/>moted without purchase, the vacancy thus created was sold to an officer fifth on the list of lieutenants. I complained of these wrongs till I found myself drifting into expressing my feelings in language stronger perhaps than I ought to have used, telling the Commander-in-Chief that I had been twice robbed of promotion that I should in fairness and in justice have succeeded to. I hoped that an inquiry would be made, that the Com<lb/>mandor-in-Chief would, in fairness to me, direct an inquiry, and cause the result to be made known to me. This was never done, and I left the Army feeling that the step of rank I sought, which was refused me, was but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020024"/>
               <p>another act of wrong and injustice added to the many already inflicted on <hi rend="italic">inc.</hi> I searched in my mind for a reason for all this; I had performed my duty honestly and devotedly in quarters and in the field; and 1 was at a loss to know why so much injustice should have been done me, and my thoughts dwelt on these things, driving me at last into an act which I could not believe it were possible I could ever have committed. I tried every means I could think of to bring my case before the public, but all my efforts were unavailing. It is needless for me to say that I bore no malice towards the Commander-in-Chief. In my last letter to His Royal Highness this feeling is expressed. That short letter is included in Colonel Hawley's memorandum; only he has omitted the last few words; but I will ask permission to read them, for it is unfair to hold back any portion of that short letter. The memorandum says:—' The following answer was received, and it is his last communication, "I have no longer hope of justice from your Royal Highness, you have wronged me to the utmost limits of your power;" the memorandum omitting the remaining words, 'but I bear your Royal Highness no malice.'" These latter words were and are still the words of my heart. I plead for no mitigated sentence. I ask only that it may not be believed that any malicious feeling prompted the act for which I stand here. No man in England would hurt the Duke of Cambridge. I myself would cheerfully shed my blood for any member of the Royal Family, and this has ever been my feeling. I cannot recall the past; I can only say that I am deeply sorry for what has happened. The object of the assault was to oblige the Commander-in-Chief to direct my arrest, my last, and the only, hope left to me of bringing my wrongs before the public. I am punished, and shall be further punished for the act I have committed, but some day the Duke of Cambridge will forgive me freely from his heart."</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a clerk in the service of Robarts, Lubbock &amp; Co., and I was so in July, 1872—I had been in their service for fourteen years up to July, 1873, when I was discharged—I was employed in the country office—in May, 1871,1 was in want of money, and Mr. McLean, an acquaintance of mine, drew upon me for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I accepted the bill, and Mr. McLean was to get it discounted for me—I did not receive any money upon that bill—it was a three months' bill—before it became due Mr. Tuck called upon me about it, he is a stationer in Union Court, City—when it became due it was presented by the prisoner Templeman—I had never seen him before—he left me his address, No. 1, Aldermanbury Postern, and he said he was a solicitor—the bill was presented to me at the bank, and he asked for the payment of the bill—I said that I had not received any consideration for the amount, and that Mr. McLean would attend to it—nothing further passed at that time—I was afterwards sued in the Mayor's Court upon that acceptance by a person named Brown—my solicitors were Messrs. Peckham, Maitland, &amp; Peckham, of Doctors' Commons, and Mr. Templeman was the solicitor for the plaintiff—the action was not tried—the arrangement was made that I was to pay 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by instalments, and I was to make those payments at Mr. Templeman's office in Aldermanbury Postern—after the compromise I made the monthly payments until the whole of it was paid—I used to pay the money personally, and I received from Templeman these receipts (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) from time to time; they are signed by him—there was also an action by Brown against a person that I knew, relating to another bill, and they were both included in one settlement, so that on the two bills 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Allard and Co., in Paris, and get into a cab, that after following the cab for some little distance, it took a contrary direction to what had been arranged between them, and it was lost sight of—I saw Templeman continually after that, from day to day, and at last he told me that the man had come back to London; that was three or four days after—he told me before that that the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020027"/>
               <p>man had the money with him—he told me that the man had come back to London, that he had mentioned the business to some friend of his, who advised him to keep the money, or at least half of it, if not the whole—he afterwards told me that an arrangement that the man should give up half the money and keep the remainder, and the half would be divided between himself, myself, and a third person—he said the odd money, the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid in expenses to the man who went to the bank—on Friday, the 12th July, I think it was, he gave me either 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 183<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the difference between that and the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was to receive he accounted for by commission, exchange—at that time I did not know at all who the man was who had gone to Paris—I knew that a man had gone, but I did not know his name, nor who he was—I knew nothing of Giraud—at the end of the year 1872, I was in want of money again, and I applied to Temple man upon the subject, and he drew a bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I accepted, and he got it discounted for me of a Mr. Pilley—I lodged a bond as security, and this memorandum was signed by Templeman (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "7th December, 1872.—Bond 1,000 dollars, Cincinatti Water Works, deposited with Mr. Pilley as security for the payment of bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two months.

Peckham &amp; Co., my solicitors, from time to time, and I agreed to give evidence, and I attended at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor after Templeman was in custody—the 2nd December was the first day I went there, and on that occasion I saw a man named Asselin—I had never seen Asselin up to that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and reside at Brix<lb/>ton—in June, 1872, I knew Mr. Louis Bonbernard—he had an office in St. Benet's Place, Gracechurch Street—I had known him about two years at that time—about that time; about June, I think, I made the acquaintance of the prisoner Giraud—I met him at other places besides Bonbernard's, I met him in some wine vaults near the penny boats, in Thames Street, and at the Lombard Rooms—I remember his speaking to me about some business at Paris—that was in the commencement of June, as far as I can remember, about a week before I started—he told me that a friend of his who had an office in Lombard Street, was the son of a rich proprietor or land owner in the country, and that he was in the habit of having from his father, who was very ill in bed at the time, cheques in blank to pay for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020029"/>
               <p>whatever was necessary in the business; that a short time previous to that he had incurred some debts for betting, or in business, which he did not explain to me, and that he wanted to fill up a cheque for a rather larger amount than he usually used to draw, and as the father was very ill he was afraid to cause his death by showing that he was drawing for such a large amount—he never told me the amount, but he said if I was willing to go over to Paris with him and cash the cheque for him, which he could not do, because he was too well known in the Exchange there, and by everybody, that I should be paid a commission, and he added "There is nothing to fear, as I have the clerk of the bank who will let me know if the cheque has been paid, or if they will send a telegram to the father and if the father has said that the cheque is not to be paid, in which case you shall not present it, you shall not go to receive the money"—I was to have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble—I asked five guineas a day, and Giraud agreed to give me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I agreed to go about three days before I started—we were in Gracechurch Street, and he said "If you go over you must not receive the money in your own name, because if the father does recover (he is very ill, and it is a crisis in his illness that may recover or kill him), he will at once sue against you; and that is why you must not go in your own name, you can take any name, you can call yourself Jones, or Jack, or James, or any name you like"—he told me to take the name of Foster, and I took it—I wrote this slip of paper "Captain J. Foster, 10, Albert Terrace, Clapham"—Giraud suggested that address; he took a piece of paper out of his pocket-book and tore it and said he had no eye-glass, and could not write it himself, and asked me to write it, which I did—he took it away with him and said "In half an hour I shall bring you the cards printed"—he came back in about an hour with the cards printed—he arranged with me to start the same evening, Wednesday, 3rd July—I saw Bonbernard at the London Bridge Railway Station, and Giraud and a woman—I don't know who she was; she was some friend of Giraud's—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given me before I started—Giraud got the tickets—Bonbernard left us just a moment before we went into the train—we went to Newhaven, Dieppe, and on to Paris—we arrived at Paris on Thursday, 4th July, and went to the Hotel de Lille et d'Albion, in the Rue St. Honore—I do not know where Giraud stayed, we parted at Paris—we arranged to meet in the Palais Royal, at the Cafe de la Rotonde—I stayed at the hotel as Captain Foster—I met Giraud that same day at the Cafe de Rotonde, and we went together to the Comptoir Escompte, near the Post Office—it is a discount office—Giraud there gave me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he gave it me just at the door, and told me to go up stairs and ask one of the clerks if they would send it for cash ment—I went on to the first floor and saw-one of the cashiers—he told me something—I came outside with the cheque, and told Giraud that they told me I had come to the wrong place, that I ought to have gone to a banker's instead of them, that they would send it for cashment if I required, but they would not pay it till twenty-two days after—he said "That will not do at all, then you come with me;" we then went together to Allard's bank—Giraud had the cheque in the meantime—he told me to give it to Mr. Allard, and send it for cashment to London—I left it with Messrs. Allard, and they told me if I came in two or three days that they would have a telegram and would let me know in a couple of days—Giraud had told me to ask for a telegram when it was paid—I left the cheque and gave a card, one of those I had</p>

               <p>received from Giraud, with "Captain Foster" upon it, and I wrote on it the "Hotel de Lille et d'Albion"—this is the card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I left the cheque Messrs. Allard gave me this receipt—I gave it to Giraud when I came out, and told him what had occurred inside—he said that he was expecting his friend, the son of the gentleman who was ill, over on the Sunday with a clerk of the bank, that the clerk of the bank was to meet him late on the Saturday afternoon to sec if any opposition had been put by the father to the payment of the cheque—on the Thursday night I went back to the Hotel de Lille et d'Albion—on Friday I saw Giraud again, and he told me he thought it would be better for me to change my hotel in case they were not coming, to keep my room at the hotel but simply to state that I was going over to Versailles—I did as he told me; I left the Hotel de Lille et d'Albion and went to the Grande Hotel de Paris in the Boulevard de Strasbourg—I knew that house, and had been staying there once before; I then stayed there in my own name of Asselin—on the Sunday I went with Giraud to the railway-station at the Chemin de fer du Nord; he told me he was waiting for his friends to come over; we remained there about three hours but nobody came—we then parted, but he said he knew where to find them if they had come—I saw him next day, Monday, the 8th, in front of my hotel, he said "My friends have arrived, it is all right, you have only to go and receive the money, I shall wait for you at the Cafe Cardinal"—he put me into a cab, gave me a receipt, and I went to Allard's; I there presented the receipt and received the money, 30,000 francs in French notes, thirty notes of 1,000 francs each, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in English money, notes, and gold, and 19 francs and 60 centimes in French money; the telegram was 6 francs, and the other was only the difference of exchange—I signed my name to the receipt, "J. Foster"—while I was at Allard's I saw two persons there, I think Templeman was one of them; I had never seen him before—I did not know his name, or who ho was—the counter is like a corner counter, those two persons were at one corner whilst I was at the other corner, so one was near me and the other was further from me—they were exchanging some English coins or English notes for French money; one was speaking English and the other French—I came out with the money and got into a cab—I went to Gibus, the hat maker's, and bought a hat there; I had a hat which was paining me very much, and I left it to be put in shape, and went to the hotel in the one I bought instead—after that I met a friend and went with him to the Palais Royale; I remained with him about three-quarters of an hour—I discharged the cab; I left my friend and went to the Cafe Cardinal to meet Giraud and give him the money; he was not there, I waited there about two hours, he did not come; I afterwards went to my hotel—I saw the landlord, M. Chevallier, and he told me something—I remained at the hotel that night and next day; that day, the 9th, I loft for London—at the time I was in Paris I did not know where Giraud or Templeman were staying—I went to Dieppe and stayed there about ten hours—I lost a portmonnaie there, with about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it; with that exception I had all the rest of the money in my possession—I left Dieppe at 8 o'clock that night, and arrived in London on the Wednesday morning—I went first to the City; I went everywhere where 1 could think of meeting Giraud, as 1 did not know his address—I went to the Lombard Rooms and afterwards to Bonbernard's office—I had the money with me, and I gave it to Bonbernard to take care of, not liking to carry it about me—I handed to him 30,000 francs as they were handed</p>

               <p>to me, pinned as Mr. Allard had given them to me, by ten each—I owed Bonbernard about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time and I paid him 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account; the rest of the money I kept, I only handed Bonbernard the notes—I saw Giraud I think the same evening—I told him that I ought not to be the loser of what I had lost at Dieppe, that it was through his own fault in not waiting for me; he wanted mo to be the loser of it, and also to pay back the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had advanced tome—I did not agree to that, I told Bonber<lb/>nard not to pay over the money until I gave him my authority to pay it—I got the notes back from him the same evening, and I returned them to him about an hour or two after; that was after I had seen Giraud—on the following day I saw Giraud again in the wino vaults, and went with him to Bonbernard's—I believe it was forty-eight hours after that we came to an arrangement that he was to indemnify me for my loss, and he was to take the 30,000 francs; I was to keep the rest—we went to Bonbernard's together, and Bonbernard produced the notes and gave them to Giraud in my presence that was two days after my arrival, on the Friday—that was the whole of the money at I 'had for my share in this matter—some three or four weeks after this I saw Templeman near my house in Malpas Road, New Cross—a man was with him, who told me that his name was Walker—I recognised Tem<lb/>pleman as the man I had seen at Allard's—Walker first spoke to me, Templeman was only a few yards off—I was in a shop, buying something—Walker came to me and said "Mr. Asselin?"—I said "That is my name"—he said "I want to talk to you"—I came out—he said "You have been to Paris, and you have received' 1,242<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Templeman was on the other side of the road at this time—Walker made a statement to me—I did not have any conversation with Templeman on that occasion—about two or three days afterwards Walker called again, Templeman was just by—I would not answer Walker, seeing somebody very near, and he said "Oh, it is no matter, he is a friend of mine"—Templeman then came near, and said "You can say all, because I know all about it"—then I said "Your name must be Mr. Templeman"—he said "That is my name"—he said that Giraud was a scoundrel and a thief, that he believed I had paid over the whole of the money, but that he had kept it, giving them only 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, and then 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, and keeping the remainder—I said I could prove that I had paid the whole of it, because I deposited it with a merchant in the City, and he handed it over—he said "Will you name the merchant?"—I said "No"—he said "Will you come and meet Mr. Giraud, and then you shall have your share, your share is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you have not received it"—I said "If I had known that I would not have had anything to do with the matter, because I would have known then that there was something wrong in it"—I said "I am prepared to meet Mr. Giraud"—I told them I had received only about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which I had lost about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then made an appointment with the person who gave the name of Walker for the next day—I did not see Giraud next day, I saw him perhaps six or seven, or eight weeks after—I told him I was quite annoyed at having these people coming and annoying me, I meant Walker and Templeman—I told him they had annoyed me by going about and telling everybody that I had been a thief and robbed them of their money—he said "I don't know thorn at all; the best thing you can do is to give them in charge when they come' to trouble you"—in the following year, 1873. I saw Sergeant Reimers, of the detective police, at Scotland Yard; something passed between us—</p>

               <p>after that I saw Giraud, that was about a fortnight before I was arrested—I was arrested on 24th June—after seeing Giraud, I went with him to Templeman, at his office at Aldermanbury—I told Templeman that I had been met by Sergeant Reimers, who had asked me some questions, and wanted my handwriting, which I had given him, and I said I was sure it was about this business—Templeman said "No, it can't be, they would never employ a Scotland Yard officer for that business, it must be for some other matter"—I told him that could not be, because I had nothing at all except this business—he said "Oh, it can't be, it must be something else, they would employ a City officer for this case; but if you are wanted send for me"—Giraud was waiting down stairs for me at this time—Templeman said that Giraud had been robbing them, there was no mistake about it; then he stopped me not to speak any more, because the clerk or somebody in the office understood French; we were talking in French all the time—he said that there was some other business, a large transaction, that Giraud knew all about it, and he asked me if Giraud had spoken to me about it—Giraud had spoken to me about another transaction—I did not agree to do anything else—I met Giraud down stairs after seeing Templeman, and I told him what Templeman had told me—Giraud said "Will you come up stairs with me, and I shall tell him before you that I gave him the whole of the money"—I said "No, I have had enough of the business"—I would not return—I told him that he had spoken to me about the large business—as to this matter, I said if I was arrested of course I would tell as it had passed—on 24th June, I was arrested, taken before the Lord Mayor, and committed for trial—Mr. Wontner was my solicitor—while I was in Newgate I was visited by a person named Hauzau—I knew him—I afterwards saw Mr. Mullens in Newgate, and made some statement to him; Mr. Wontner, my solicitor, introduced me to him—I was examined as a witness against Templeman before the Lord Mayor in December—up to that time I had never seen Hawkins at all, or heard his name, or knew who he was, until I saw him there—I was afterwards acquitted in this Court of the charge upon which I was sent for trial.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. I did not arrange with Mr. Mullens that I was to be acquitted—I never made any terms with him at all—I was taken into custody by Inspector Clark—he told me the charge was going to Paris and uttering a forged cheque, and I said I knew nothing about it—I did not say I had not been to Paris, because I had been to Paris four times that year; I said nothing more than that I knew nothing about it—I think it was about two months after I was in custody that I was introduced to Mr. Mullens—I was not pressed in the least to go to Mr. Mullens—the moment I was taken I gave my statement in full to Mr. Wontner, I mean the day I saw Mr. Wontner, that was three days after I was taken into custody; he had the whole of my statement—my notion was that this was a cheque drawn by a son for his father who was dying, for a larger amount than he ought to draw, so that he would cheat his dying father; but I was told he was the only son, he was only cheating himself—I was helping nobody, I was helping myself, to have my commission—I helped myself to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was told he was an only son, that if his father recovered he would of course make it right with his father, who was very sick, and if he died he was the heir, and he would lose nothing—if the father recovered, I was told he would be very angry, and therefore I was to give a false name</p>

               <p>in order to give the son time to pacify the father—I wrote my name as "Captain Foster, 10, Albert Terrace," on the cheque—I put the "10" in pencil—I did not put "23"—I have not been to Bonbernard's house more than twice in my life, I have been frequently to his office, he lived at 23, Albert Terrace—I don't know whether No. 10, was an empty house at the time I wrote this, or whether it belonged to the same landlord as No. 23, I had never been there at all at that time—that address was suggested to me by Giraud—I did not see Bonbernard, it was not at his office, I swear that—I saw Giraud at Bonbernard's office once, that was the first time I had a conversation about these matters—I afterwards saw him in the wine vaults near the penny boats in Thames Street, and in the Lombard—Bonbernard's office is just opposite the Lombard—I don't know whether Robart's bank is very close to it—I never saw Bonbernard at the Lombard but once or twice perhaps; I went there frequently, to the refreshment part—when I had no office of my own I used to receive my letters at Bonber<lb/>nard's; my letters were addressed to me there—my name has been always Asselin; I never changed it except this time—I did nothing else there, more than doing some commissions; the letters were about commissions for me to do; I used to do some transactions with Bonbernard on business—when I executed commissions I frequently gave the parties Bonbernard's office as my place of business—he is a commission agent; he has one room on the ground floor, a large room at the back—he was frequently there when I was—I have only seen Giraud there once—Bonbernard first told me that Giraud had offered him to go over to Paris for a certain business—I afterwards told Bonbernard that I was going on the business that he had proposed to me—I did not tell him about getting the cheque cashed—he came to the station to see us off by the train—a lady went with us, I don't know who she was; it was a lady with Mr. Giraud—I did not start from Bonbernard's office, I told him we were starting by that train—he saw the last of me when I left, and I went to his office when I came back, and I gave him all the money except the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I lost at Dieppe—I paid him 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for myself, besides that—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given me to go with—I did not make a very bad thing of it—I signed the name of Foster to the cheque, I knew that was no forgery—I changed my hotel because Giraud told me that it was not advisable for me to remain there, and to say that I was going to Versailles for a day or two—that was not to keep me out of danger; there was no danger, but he told me too so, and I did so, I was under him—I went to the Grande Hotel de Paris, in the Boulevard de Strasbourg, that is not quite at the other side of Paris, it is near the Northern Railway; it is a very good hotel, I went there by my own name, I was obliged to, I was known there—the hat I changed was one that I bought a few days before I left London, it was a very hard one, and pained me, and I left it to be put in shape, and bought one of those soft hats; the other was sent to the hotel, and it is there now—the hat I bought was not a slouching hat that came over my face, it was a small hat, not a chimney-pot, I had had enough of that—my luggage was sent to London forty-eight hours previous—I had merely a hand-bag with me—I did not go to Barton's, the printer's, I swear that—I heard Barton say that I gave him the card; that was wrong, he swore it, it was a perjury—there was a watch factory in the Malpas Road, near where I lived—there was no watch factory that Bonbernard was carrying on at that-time, that I knew of—Bonbernard came once to see me in prison; that was long after I</p>

There is no ground for saying that I am not a perfectly honest man—I am honest as much as you are—this money was to be obtained without the father's knowledge because he was too ill, and if he knew so much was obtained it might kill him—if he was to be killed I would have stuck to the money, which I did not, which shows I did not know anything about it; I shared nothing—the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I was robbed of them—I don't know how many people were there, perhaps about forty; the money was in a small portmonnaie, it was a pocket-book and portemonnaie—I had separated that 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the other on purpose, and put it into my portemonnaie, and it was in my pocket—I did not know that I had lost it till I was on board the steamer—I had no bill to pay, I had a return ticket—I was at no hotel, I arrived in the morning and started in the evening—I had some loose silver—I am married—I gave my wife 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that makes 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was only to receive 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a dispute with Giraud—that would be the difference that I had lost; I wanted not to return the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the dispute was about the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believed at the time that this was a perfectly fair transaction—I had met Giraud many times before I met him at the wine vaults, without knowing even his name; I had met him at Bonbernard's—you ought to know what a commission agent is; it is an English term, I am a foreigner—I sell and buy for persons, upon which I receive a commission—I have been in that line for the last five or six years in London—I have no shop—I had an office for about a year in Lawrence Pountney Hill—I did not do anything in English races—I keep no books and no clerk, and no banking account; I have nothing at all—I could tell you firms that I did business with, no great firms—I had dealings with Sir Antonio Brady, of the Admiralty—I had a large estate in Australia, and his brother was my partner—I came over here about that estate, Sir Antonio Brady will give you an account of it—I don't want to give any other firms, I think that is enough—I have not gone to Paris before to cash a cheque—I have never been called Foster before—I wrote that name on the cheque at Giraud's suggestion, and he had no spectacles, he could not see—he speaks English as well as I can—I did not think there was anything suspicious about my going over in a false name, or in changing my name when I got there, because it was explained what it was for—I was first apprehended on the 24th June, I think—I met Giraud, and told him that complaints were made about my being a thief, that was very annoying, I did not much like it, and he told me to give them in charge—they said I had stolen the money—I never did give anybody in charge; I</p>

Renaud Freres, for one—Reimers said he wanted some of my handwriting to know where to send for me, and I gave it him—I said "You want my handwriting, not my wine," and he had it in his pocket-book—it was after that that I went to Giraud—I was taken in custody about a fortnight afterwards, and then two months afterwards I made a clean breast of it—I was not told that if I saw Mr. Mullens no doubt I could square it, if I would implicate somebody—two days after I was arrested I saw Mr. Wontner, and made a clean breast of it—I told him all I knew, and left it in his hands—Mr. Mullens came to me to know all that I told to Mr. Wontner; he came with Mr. Wontner, Mr. Wontner remained with him—I then told this story about picking up Giraud, and his paying me to go to Paris, I had never had such a transaction before—Bonbernard never told me that the cheque I had uttered in Paris was a forged cheque—I told him so after I had seen the man who calls himself Walker.</p>

I am a commission agent, residing at 23, Albert Terrace, Clapham Road—I had an office at 10, St. Benet's Place, Grace-church Street, but I left it last December—I had been there about four years—I have known Asselin for about three years, and Giraud a little over two years—Asselin was in the habit of coming to my office from time to time—about June, 1872, I remember Giraud coming to my office and asking me if I would go over to Paris on a certain financial business he had to conclude over there, that he would pay my expenses, and besides that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or a certain sum for my trouble—I had business to attend to at that time, and I declined—Giraud did not tell me what the business was—I could not say that Asselin was present at that conversation, he might have been—I don't remember whether I communicated with him, or whether he was present when Giraud came, but he made a proposition to Giraud, and after that I saw them together at a public-house in Bell Yard, and also in Talbot Court—I ultimately saw Asselin and Giraud at the London Bridge Station, with a female, that was the end of June or the beginning of July, 1872—Giraud told me that he was going to Paris with Asselin—I don't know whether he or Asselin told me that they were going by Newhaven and Dieppe—I did not see them go by the train—some <hi rend="italic">few</hi> days after seeing them at London Bridge Station, I saw Giraud at my office—he was very excited, and he asked me for Asselin's private address—he told me that he had missed Asselin on the road from Paris to London, and that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187402020036"/>
               <p>he wished to sec him as soon as possible—I refused at first to give the address—he asked me to go with him, but I told him I had no time to do so, and then he said he wished only to see him for his own good, and I ultimately gave him Asselin's address—on the following day Giraud came again and told me that he had not seen Asselin—he said he was very sorry to have made the acquaintance of Asselin, because Asselin had robbed him of a large sum of money—I don't think he mentioned the sum at that time, but he may have done so—when he told me that Asselin did not behave honestly, I told him I was surprised at the accusation, and he told me then he had an appointment in Paris at the Cafe Cardinal, and he did wait for Asselin there, but he did not come, and so he did suppose that he had run away with the money entrusted to him—I said that I did not believe it—he said I would be obliged to believe after Asselin did not come back, and he was afraid he would not return—I afterwards went with Giraud to Malpas Road, New Cross, where Asselin was living, to try and find him—I went to the house, and Giraud waited for me at a public-house opposite—Asselin was not at home, and I went to the public-house and told Giraud—he said that Asselin was a thief, and had robbed him of his money—I asked him if he was quite certain that nothing had happened to Asselin at Paris, and he said that he was quite certain that Asselin was very well, and that no accident had happened to him—I knew a person named Walker at this time, but I did not know him before—I also knew Temple<lb/>man—I took him for a solicitor—after I had been to New Cross with Giraud he came to me again, and wanted me to go to New Cross again, but I declined to go—Walker came to my office after Giraud came back from Paris, but never before—he came twenty times during the day and wanted Asselin—I saw Templeman outside once when Walker was in the office, but I never saw him in Walker's company—on Wednesday, 10th July, Asselin came to me at the office and made some communication to me, and I communicated to him the fact that Walker had called, and Giraud wanted him—Asselin handed to mo on that day some French notes—I did not notice how many there were—they were 1,000 franc notes; there was a bundle of them—he told me there were 30,000 francs, and they were left for me to take care of—Asselin owed me some money at that time, and he paid me 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—after Asselin had left the money in my charge, Giraud came to my office—he ultimately mot Asselin, and I heard part of the conversation between them—Giraud was very pleased to see Asselin come back, and Asselin said "I am surprised that you accused me before Mr. Bonbernard, my friend, of having robbed you; if you had waited for me in Paris we would have met each other there, and you would not have been in anxiety, and you would have saved my anxiety"—Giraud said that he was waiting at the Hotel Cardinal a certain time, and Asseliu did not come as appointed—Asselin told him it was impossible that he could have waited there, that he had his breakfast and his lunch there—Giraud said that he did wait at the cafe, and afterwards went to the hotel and inquired for him—Asselin said "I can't understand it, because after I left the caft I went to my hotel, I slept there all the night and left Paris the next morning"—there was considerable conversation between them as to how they came to miss each other, and after that Asselin asked me to hand over to him the bank-notes, as he wanted to give them to Giraud—I handed Asselin the notes, and he and Giraud left my office together—Asselin afterwards returned alone, and again handed me the notes to take care of—I afterwards saw</p>

               <p>Giraud in reference to the commission Asselin was to get for his trouble—I told Girand that I was surprised that after accusing the man as he did, that he was disputing the commission—he told me that if the business was in his own hands he would not dispute it at all, but as he had to give account to some other people he could not deal with it—Walker came after that, and on the day following, Giraud and Asselin were together at my office, and I then handed to Giraud the notes that Asselin had handed to me to take care of—I said to Giraud "Now the matter between you and Asselin is settled, I should like to get rid of that man Walker, if he comes again to trouble me at my office, I shall ask a policeman to put him out"—Giraud said "When Walker comes again, tell him that you know that he comes from Mr. Templeman, and he will never trouble you again"—about the commencement of January, 1873, I went with a friend by train from Cannon Street to Charing Cross—I saw Templeman at the Charing Cross platform—he asked me to have a glass, and I did so—I remained with him in conversation two or three hours—we went from the station to a cigar shop, and then to the Alhambra—he mentioned Giraud's name more than once in the course of conversation—he told me that Giraud was not one of my friends, that ho accused me of robbing him of five or six hundred pounds—I said it was perfect nonsense, because if I had robbed him of anything he would have had plenty of means to ask for it—he said that Giraud had told him that out of the 30,000 francs Asselin brought from Paris, he had only received 15,000, saying that I had kept 15,000 myself—I said that it was a perfect lie, and that if I had robbed Giraud of anything he would not have left without asking me for the difference—'when I told Templeman that Giraud had received all the money, he said that Giraud was a very great rogue because he told him that he had only received 15,000 francs, and he took him one-third of it, leaving to Templeman and another person 5,000 francs each—he said that the other person was a banker's clerk; the 15,000 francs had been divided between Templeman, Giraud and the clerk—Templeman said he would not do any more business with. Giraud, because having taken the trouble to bring the business to a certain point, he thought it was a shame of Giraud to rob them afterwards—he said "If I have any more business, I will call upon you instead of going to Giraud"—I said I would not like the business, because I could not understand that the business in which the proceeds were to be divided was an honest one—he said "Oh, you are a child, you don't understand business, there is no fear at all"—I said "You say there is no fear, anyone would have known that the proceeds were to be divided, and in what case would poor Asseliu be"—he said it was all perfectly arranged that nothing could happen to Asselin—he said, through a money lender in Union Court, he knew a clerk of a bank who was in difficulties, and through that clerk he had certain information which enabled him to do the kind of business he was doing, Asselin went over to Paris to cash a cheque there, but there was no danger for him at all, because he did not go to the counter and ask for the money, but he did go and say "Here is a cheque, cash it, and when you have received the news from London that the cheque has been paid, then I will call and fetch the money;" and at the same time that he did so that they were looking out here in London to know from the clerk at the bank if the cheque was paid or not; if it would not have been paid in London, Asselin would have been prevented in Paris from going back to the bank to receive the money—I am not quite certain whether Temple<lb/>man told me that he was in Paris with Giraud, but he said that he told</p>

               <p>Giraud when the cheque was paid, and Giraud told Asselin, and he went and fetched the money—I don't know whether he sent a telegram to Giraud, or whether he went to Paris with him—Templeman told me that some one was in the bank when Assclin received the money, that Asselin left the bank and drove off in a cab or carriage, and from that time he was missed in Paris—he also told me that between the time that Asselin presented the cheque at the bank and the time for fetching the money he had changed his hotel—I knew before that that Assclin had gone to Paris to get some money on a certain paper, but I did not know, until that conversation with Templeman, whether it was a cheque or a bill, or what it was—I did not know Hawkins the clerk at all—from the time of the conversation with Templeman to the time of his being taken into custody, I saw Asselin frequently.</p>

I am a commission agent—I buy and sell goods and take a commission upon them—I did act for people and firms upon the Continent, but I don't now—the office at St. Benet's Place was a back room on the ground-floor—Asselin did not use it jointly with me—he received some letters there—he did not do a commission business there at all—if he says so, that is utterly untrue—he was a commission agent—at first he did his business at Mr. Deacon's, where I knew him—he had an office in Cannon Street in the beginning of 1872—he had no office in July, 1872—he came to my place at that time—he was there every day—I did not use the Lombard Rooms—I went to the refreshment rooms from time to time, but not often—I don't know that I heard the first conversation between Asselin and Giraud—they had twenty or thirty conversations altogether—I did hear one—I did not hear anything said about cashing a cheque for a dying man—it was that the son wanted to get a larger cheque, or something of that kind—the son wanted to get some money, but I don't know whether that was at the first meeting—I don't remember when it took place, but I heard it said that Asselin was to go to get the cheque for a son who was drawing on a father beyond what he ought to do, or something of that sort—that the father was ill, and the son was in his business—I declined to go over to Paris—I said I was too busy to go—I went to see Asselin off at the railway-station, and Asselin came to me directly he came back—he was not clean when he came, and he went out afterwards to get shaved and washed, and left the money with me—I did not count the notes—I think I told Assclin, after 1 had seen Templeman, that I was afraid that the cheque was a forgery about which he went to Paris—I know when Asselin was taken into custody; it might be six months after my conversation with Templeman—I told the solicitor after Asselin was in custody—I don't know whether it was after he was sent for trial—I did not give any information of what Templeman had told me before Assclin was taken into custody—I was about four years in St. Benet's Place—before that I had an office in George Street, Westminster—I called at the Union and Credit Bank, or something of that kind, but I did not speak English at that time, so I don't remember the English name—I had a partner at that time in Spain, and it was to do some business with Spain—I lost my money by it, and the landlord distrained and swept off everything—nobody trusted to the bank, so nobody lost any money—I am a bankrupt at the present time, and I have been bankrupt once before—I did not pay anything, because I had done no business at that time—there were no creditors in fact—I was not a bankrupt in Switzerland before I came to this country—I male an arrangement, but it was in my father's name—I did not come over here</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARRIS</hi>. Giraud asked me to go to Paris on some financial transaction—that was not at all in the way of my business; I am a merchant, I was then a commission agent—I was doing business then in my own name, for myself—I did business for nobody but myself—I did not ask him what the nature of the transaction was, because I declined it altogether; I had not the least idea what it was—it was long after that that I went to see them off by the train—I had only known Giraud about six months at that time, I had very seldom seen him—I did not know what ho was—I did not know whether he had got plenty of money, or if he was poor—I had known Asselin for some time—I knew he was not a man of wealth, I knew ho was poor—I was certain that the 30,000 francs was not his, it was merely entrusted to have—if it had been 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should not have been more surprised than at its being 30,000 francs; I thought he was an honest man, it was not his own money, it was only entrusted to him; I knew that from Giraud first and from him afterwards—I did not know at all what Giraud's means were, but I knew perfectly well that Asselin was only acting as an agent for Giraud—he told me it belonged to Giraud—I had seen Giraud at my office an hour or two before, and he said that Asselin had not come back, and he was going to New Cross to see if he was at home, and if he came to my place to tell him he would return and see him there—he said that Asselin was coming with 30,000 francs—he did not say that it belonged to him, he did not say at that time who it belonged to, but an hour or two afterwards he told me that the money did belong to him and somebody else—he afterwards came back in a state of excitement, saying that he had missed Asselin in Paris; I had not then got the 30,000 francs—he did not come to me after I was in possession of the money; if he did it was only for a few minutes—I told him I would not give up the money to him without the presence of Asselin; Asselin told me not to part with it without his presence—I did not find out who the third party was to whom it belonged; I did not wait till he came on the scene; I had the money from Asselin, and I had only to return it to Asselin—I had no share of it, certainly not—I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was no share of the 30,000 francs, I got the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Asselin, it was part of his commission, he owed me about 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—he was ill more than once before, and when he was ill I lent him some money—I was not a bankrupt in 1872, I had money to lend—I got it in my business—when Asseliu gave me the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he said "Here is 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the money I owe you"—no I O U passed between us—I did not give him a receipt for the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think he paid me in English money, I don't know—Giraud said, but not to me, that I had</p>

               <p>kept half the 30,000 francs; he charged me with stealing it; he said so to Templeman, if Templeman told me the truth—I had such a little amount of prospect from Giraud, and such a low opinion of him at that time, that whatever he would think or say of me would be quite equal to me—he never accused me of stealing the money, I was told by Templeman that he did—I took no means to put it right, my character was not affected by such a charge—I had heard before that that I was accused of keeping some of the money, and I met Giraud and Asselin together at the corner of Cornhill and said, "What does this rumour mean?" and they said it was all nonsense, they never did say a word of the kind, it was not true—Giraud himself told me so—I could only see him accidentally because I did not know where he was living.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The charge that was made against me at the Clerkenwell Police Court, was last year; it was dismissed—I was a bankrupt in 1869—it was when I first came here, I could not speak a word of English—I bought some furniture of a man, and paid him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a bill—I knew Templeman at that time, and through him I came to be a bankrupt, but I did not owe anything in business at the time; Templeman acted for me at that time, as my solicitor was away, Mr. Plews of the firm of Plews and Irving—I think I have known Asselin since 1871, I knew him long before, but only to see him often since the end of 1870 or 1871—he told me before he went to Paris that his travel was to be paid, his expenses, and he was to have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something of the kind, I don't know exactly—Templeman speaks French, I only spoke French with him—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing, I wrote it the day after I had seen Templeman and had the conversation with him, the letter was dated 3rd January, it was on the 2nd that I had the conversation with him.</p>

On 17th January, I was at Eltham—Mr. Larking came to me, and I went to the King's Arms and saw Howden in front of the bar—I told him he was charged with receiving a quantity of forage belonging to Mr. Larking—he said that he did not know anything about any forage, and he had not received any—I sent a man to call Mr. Larking, and told Howden I must search his place, that is the lockup—he said "You can search here," and unlocked the door—Mr. Larking examined a quantity of forage in the bin, and found that it was not his—he said that there was a sack on a cart in the yard which he should like to examine—I called Frisby out into the yard and said "What is that you have got in that sack in your cart?"—he said "What has that to do with you?"—I said "I wish to know"—he said "I suppose you will want to know where I got the other things next; there is some pig wash in the-cart"—Mr. Larking said "It is my property"—he said "I bought it of Joe, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. George Sanger's niece, and am thirteen years old—I have been with them six years—I was going about with them last summer to different towns in England with the troupe—the prisoners were employed by my uncles—Froude was musician, and Lemmon was wardrobe keeper—Lemmon left before Christmas; she was paid off the next morning after we came to London to Astley's—she said to me last summer "If you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> money enough to buy a nice horse, you can go to France with me and make a good living"—she told me to get as much money as I could from my uncle to get the horse, which she said could be bought for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this riding habit belongs to one of the Miss Sangers; it was kept in a box in a tent with the other things, and I took them out of a box at Edgware and gave them to Mrs. Froude, who said she would mind them for me—no one but Mrs. Froude was present when I took them out of Miss Sanger's box—I took a riding habit, a saddle cloth, and a bridle—this opera glass is Mrs. George Sanger's; it was kept in the carriage where we lived, and Mrs. Lemmon said "Do you mind lending them to me to-night?"—I said "No, but you must give them back to-morrow morning, because they belong to Mrs. George Sanger"—that was three weeks before we were at Edgware—I asked her for them two days after, and she said "Have you not got them?"—I said "No"—she said "I don't know where I put them"—I said "My aunt will be sure to miss them"—they were not talked of after that, and I did not get them back—after we got to London I took a lady's saddle from Astley's—I told Lemmon I had got it, and it was taken to Mrs. Moore's house—Lemmon was paid off on the morning after we got to Astley's; but she used to come there for me, and I have seen her six times since—she said she had sent the money for the horse to the man, but had had no answer, and she did not know whether the ship was lost in going over there—we were afterwards both put in the same cell, and she said "Mind, Ellen, when you get into Court don't you say you ever gave me a halfpenny; if you do it will be worse for you, and you will get transported, "and she kept saying" Keep up <hi rend="italic">yourpedcer</hi>, Ellen; keep up your <hi rend="italic">pecker"—I</hi> was frightened, because I thought I should be transported if I spoke about it—it is a fact that 1 told Moore to go to them at one time.</p>

I am a hammerman, of Southwark Bridge Road—on 17th January, between 6 and 7 p.m., I was in Lant Street, with a young woman—the prisoner came up to us; he was interfering with everybody who came about, knocking up against them and then furning round and speaking to them—he knocked up against me—I said "Mind who you are knocking against"—he used foul language and challenged me to fight—I said "I will," but before I had time to take my coat off he struck me, and when I got my coat off I struck him—he fell, and while he was on the ground I saw his hand in his pocket—when he got up I saw a knife in his hand—he rushed at me three times with the knife, and then I found I was stabbed under the right ear—it bled, and I was taken to a doctor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He might have had a drop, but he did not seem drunk—he was staggering about—I cannot tell where I hit him, I was quite sober—my blow did not knock him down, but he seemed to slip off the kerb—I said before the Magistrate "he reeled from my blow"—two friends of mine came up as it happened, but neither of them pushed him or touched him.</p>

I am surgeon to the gaol of Newgate—the prisoner came in on 6th January, since when he has had a fit—I believe it was epileptic, for his his tongue was moving—I consider that he is subject to fits of that character—at the time of the seizure, his mind would be confused and deranged—the time which the aberration lasts depends on the individual; it may last two or three days, and sometimes it passes off very quickly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at this lodging-house—I was with the prosecutor in the parlour when the prisoner came down to the door—the master was standing at the door, and he says to the missis "Give this lodger his money, I shall not have him here"—and he gave him his money and the prisoner put it in his pocket and said "I will pay you before I have done with you, and he brought his hand out of another pocket and he brought out something and struck the master twice with it—I did not see what it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there and I examined him—he had a wound on the loft side of his chest, just below the second rib; it was a clean cut wound, about 1 1/2 inches long, and the lung was wounded—it was a dangerous wound—he is now convalescent—I saw the knife at the Police Court, it would produce such a wound as I saw.</p>
