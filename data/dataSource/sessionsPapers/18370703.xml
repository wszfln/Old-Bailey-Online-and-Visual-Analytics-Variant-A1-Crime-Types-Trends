                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Tuesday morning, the 20th of June, about half-past one o'clock, I was High-street, Bow, in the parish of St. Mary, Stratford—I was at the further end, near Bow-bridge, looking up the town, and saw the prisoner come from about the spot where Mr. Sturgeon lives—he appeared to have something in his hand—he was a few yards from the house when I saw him—it might be five yards—I did not see any body with him—there was not a soul moving about the town—I followed him up the town, and saw him go to his father's door—his father is a jobbing carpenter, and lives nearly knocking—I knew who it was, and did not go to him—I returned a few steps, and waited—about two o'clock I had occasion to go to a shop opposite his father's house, and he was still knocking at the door—two more of our men came up to me, and said something—the poisoner then walked away—we went across the road, and saw some fowls lying close against where he had been standing, at his father's door—there were five live ones and two dead ones one with the head pulled right off—the prisoner went to the corner—one of the policeman, who is not here, went to lay hold of him, and he ran away—the man sprang his rattle—I went to his assistance, but the prisoner got right away from us—he ran through Bow Church-yard, and directly he got away I went back and picked up a white pillow-case over blood, with white feathers of fowls in it—it was in a narrow passage in the church-yard through which he had run—I took him into custody on Wed<lb/>nesday morning the 21st, which was next direction in Whitechapel—I am quite sure he was the man I saw come in a direction from Mr. Sturgeon's house, and afterwards run from his father's door—I have known him many years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 42, Old-street-road—my place of business is at No. 5, Old Broad-street—I am a merchant. On the night of the 27th of June, I was passing through Giltspur-street, at some minutes past ten o'clock—I saw both the prisoner at the bar—Jones' had four or five um<lb/>brellas and parasols under his arm as if for sale—I did not say anything to him at that moment—the other one, Millward, accosted me and asked me would I purchase an umbrella—they were together—I looked at one and purchased it for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was an old umbrellas—Millward asked me would I purchase the other three, and he would make them cheaper—I purchased the other and was to pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I was sober—before I would pay for these three I wished to go to some place to examine them—I occasionally deal in umbrellas—there were two parasols and two umbrellas—I went into a public-house, and had a glass of run and water with these two men—I examined the umbrellas—they told me they had from sixty to seventy gross of the same description in their ware-house in Bishopsagte-street—I do not knew whether people who keep warehouse stand in the-street—they asked me to go their were house down in Bishopsgate-street, and I walked with them, where they said they made them—I was stopped in the neighbourhood of Angle-alley, I think is the name of the place—(I went a considerable distance with these men—two or three streets—we were going in the direction of Bishopsgate-street, and Mill<lb/>ward said the quantity he had would come to a considerable sum of money, and asked me had I money enongh to pay for them-street—I told him I supposed I had, but I would see better when I examined the goods—Angel-alley is near Bishopsgate-street)—Millward was walking behind me, and Jones was in front—then Millward seized me by the arms, and pulled me back to the ground, while Jones put his hand into my pocket, and took away my purse and ran off with it—it contained fifty sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and two £5 notes of the Bank of England—after I recovered I cried for the police—Note appeared to be handy, and I went to the first public-house and made inquiry for a watchhouse, and I was directed to one in Bishops<lb/>gate-street—I gate-street—I called there, and informed the officers the dress and appear<lb/>ance of the prisoners, and I remained there some little time, when the officer brought in Millward—I think it could not be more than half an hour, if I recollect—when I was in the public-house Millward had a piece of ivory, and offered to sell it to me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I would not buy it—I mentioned that circumstance at the station-house, and Millward put his hand into his pocket and produced the piece, and asked was that that it—I said it was—I lost a silk purse, blue and black stripped—I think it was light blue with a black stripe in it—there were two pieces of foreign silver coin in the purse—I do not know the number of the notes—Jones Jones was not brought in while I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house painter, and live in Backeridge-street, St. Giles's I knew the deceased, John Goulding; he was a bricklayer, and lodged in the same house with me. on the 30th of last September the deceased was in the house, and the prisoner came in between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—there were several persons in the house—the deceased came to the five-place to light his pipe, and the prisoner took off his won hat and struck the deceased on the head with it—nothing had passed between them preivous to that—Goulding had a hat on—he said, "If you dio that again I will knock you down"—the prisoner directly struck him again with his hat, and the deceased made a blow at Welch, but it did not hit him—he then seized the tea-pot, which stood on the hob, and threatened to throw it at the prisoner—a man named Smith, who it belonged to, came and took it out of his hand—Welch came from behind the stool, where he stood, and took hold of the deceased—he laid hold of him with both hands by the collar and threw him down on the floor—Goulding was intoxiented at the time—I had not known much of him before—I have seen him several times—I have seen him very often tipsy—I should think he was between forty and fity years old—he was not a large pawerful man, but a small man—when he fell I observed his head come in conteact with a wooden form—he never spoke or moved after he fell—the pirosner lified him up into a sitting position on the floor, and by his order soemwater was brought in, and he (the prisoner) btached the man's temples—several persons said a cotor ought to be sent for as he seemed in dying state—one was sent for but did not come—the person is not court who went for the docotr—he prisoner lifited the deceased off the floor and put him on a sent—he oblised to be held no by the prisoner and another person—he appeared quite senseless from the moment he fell on the floor—he could not sit without being assisted—he was quite helpless—the prisoner then said, "some persons come and hold him, and I will go for a doctor"—some person come and hold him, and I never returned at all afterwards—I went to the station-house and got a policeman, who took the deceased to a doctor's in Oxford-street—the doctor said he was quite dead—I never heard of their having had any previous quarrel.</p>

                  </hi> I was in the home in Buckeridge-stret, and saw Goulding and Welch there—I went out to fetch some things in for tea, leaving Goulding and the prisoner together in the kitchen—when I came back I saw the prisoner and the deceased at the fire quarelling—I do not exactly know what they were saying—they said they had ben <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with the deceased—I was not there at the commencement of it—the first thing I saw was the deceased had got hold of the tea-pot, that was by the fire-place, and said he would <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it at the prisoner—he attempted to do so, but I took it out of his hand—he then held up his fist towards the prisoner's face—the prisoner said, "Do you mean to strike me?"—directly afterwards the prisoner took him by the coat and threw him down—that was the first blow I saw pass between them—the prisoner appeared to be intoxicated—I knew him before, and have seen him intoxicted several times—the decessed's head came in contact with the from that was in the from that was in the room—he appeared to be hurt—he struck the back of his head against the form as he fell—he was not sensible after that—he never spoke nor moved, but lay on his back about a minutes or two—some one in the room said a doctor should be sent for, that the man appeared to be dying—the prisoner and another man assisted him up in a sitting position—he appeared to me to be dead at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Henderson, an outfitter, in Tottenham-court-road.

On the Monday I was called to the station-house between ten and eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner there—I recognised him directly as the man who had attacked me—it was about tweilight when it happaned—there were no gas lights in the field.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 25, Princes-street, Drury-lane. On the 4th of July, I had a pair of trowsers hanging in the stop—I saw the prisoner and another looking at the trowsers and a waist<lb/>coat that was pinned to them—they looked as if they were going to make a purchase—I was behind the counter—I thought they did not see me—they took them down, and I could see through the wires of the guard that the prisoner was packing them up in his apron—I went round and he walked away—when I got outside he was against my window, and was tucking the things close in his apron—he went off and I ran after him, and said he had got my property—he got six or seven doors off, and then shook them out into a passage—I followed him till he was taken, and the trowsers and waistcoat were brought to my house—these are them.</p>

               <p>but I made sure of his being there on Monday morning—this was on Saturday—when I went to his lodgings on Monday they told me he had been ill at first, and afterwards that he had gone to be shaved—when I took him to did not tell me he had been ill on the Monday—his party told me so, but he did not—he was there as usual on Tuesday—I should say he had been there six years, and if I were to say ten years—I should say he had—he sells oranges, fish, and lemons, and is very well known in the neigh<lb/>bourhood.</p>

The prisoner has lodged with me from last Christmas twelvemonths up to the time of his being taken into custody—I remember the Monday after the robbery—he was taken very ill on Saturday evening—he came home between seven and eight o'clock, which was his usual hour of returning—I fetched him six pennyworth of castor oil on Monday morning—he was very ill on Sunday with a pain in the chest—he is a very ailing man—he took the castor oil on Monday morning and staid at home all that day—I remember Mills coming to took after him on the Monday afternoon—I cannot tell at what time—the prisoner had then just gone out—Mills asked it a person named Horrogan lodged there, as he wanted him to go very particularly with him—I told him he was not within, but if he was I thought he would not be able to go with him—I did not know Mills—he did not state who he was—when Horrogan came home I told him a person had been for him, and what he had said—he went out on the Tuesday morning as usual—he is an hones, hard-working man, and has a wife and family.</p>

About April last the prisoner came to me with some watch-guards, chains, and fingers—he said he knew a man who was in difficulties for some money, and if I would sell the goods, he would divide the profits between him and me; that the man wanted to raise the money to pay some bills—I sold half a dozen watch-guards to Mr. Danieli, and some to Mr. Isaacs—he came very often to my house—one Saturday</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ROBERT BROWN</hi>. I am a baker, and live in Union-street, Borough, in the parish of St. Saviour's. On Saturday, the 17th of June, the prisoner Frances came, between six and seven o'clock, to my house alone, to show my wife some dresses she had made for a lady—she showed them to her in the back parlour, behind the shop—she continued there about half an hour—I was not in the shop when she first came in, but I went into the shop while she was there, and gave my wife a cheque for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which she put into the cash-box in the shop, on the counter, while the prisoner was there—she locked the box, and took it into the parlour where the prisoner was—a few minutes after that, my wife came to me in the shop, and said she must go up and clean herself—she went up stairs, and in a few minutes the prisoner came into the shop to me, and said, "I cannot stop any longer, I must go"—I said "You had better stop till my wife comes down, she will not be many minutes"—she said, "No, I cannot stop I must go;" and she went—I did not observe whether she had any thing with her—I could not see, because she had got a cloak on—the cash<lb/>box was eight or ten inches long, and three or four wide—my wife came down about ten minutes after she was gone, but we did not miss the cash<lb/>box till between twelve and one o'clock at night, when I went to put the money from the till into the cash-box, and could not find it—I cannot tell what it contained, but I believe there was about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, sovereigns and half-sovereigns, a £5 note, a cheque for £28 on the Borough bank, and a bill of exchange for £50, drawn by me and accepted by Mr. Whitton—I afterwards saw my cash-box in the possession of Hornsby—this is it.</p>

I had a warrant on the 19th of June to search the house No. 59, Friar-street, St. George's—the daugh<lb/>ter was then in custody—I went between twelve and one o'clock in the day—I found the mother and father there—I told them what I come for—the mother appeared anxious to get out of the front room—I let her go out, and followed her into the back room on the first floor—I saw her go to the cupboard, and doing something in a great hurry at the cupboard, under the sideboard—I immediately went up to her, and asked what she was doing—she became very agitated, and took up a gown, and threw it over a green glass jar—I asked what she was doing there—she turned her back to the place, and endeavoured to keep me away—she was almost in a fainting state—I removed the gown, and, on looking into the glass jar, I found a canvass bag, containing seventy-five sovereigns and half-sovereigns, a £5 Bank of England note, and a banker's cheque for £28—I found nothing further that day—I asked her whose money it was—she said she knew nothing about it—on the following day, before the Magistrate, I beard the younger Prisoner say that the cash-box, with the bill for £50, was in the copper hole at her mother's house—in consequence of that, I went to the house again, and found it where she had stated, with the £50 bill in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a paper-merchant, and live at No. 228, Hoxton. On the 1st or 2nd June I saw the prisoner in Red Lion court, Fleet-street—he said he had some waste-paper to dispose of—I went into the office of "The Guide"—he had the key of it—he showed me a sample of waste-paper—what he showed me was in sheets—I ultimately purchased on the 7th about 6 1/2 cwt.—I paid him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have got the receipt—I sold 5 1/4 cwt. to Mr. Bliss, in Barbican, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I kept some quires of it at home, which I gave up to the officer after the second transaction—I went to Webber-street, Surrey, on the 7th, where I made the purchase, and the work was there—I was introduced to the parlour, and in the back room was this paper—this was part of the work of 1833, 1834, 1835, and 1836.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Willis, a meal-man, of South-place, Camberwell. I knew a young woman of the name of Ann May—on the 16th of April I saw her standing at the door of her mis<lb/>tress's house about ten minutes before ten o'clock—I sure of that—I had seen the prisoner go into Onion's house three times before the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was acquainted with her, but I had no been in the house, only up to the door. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw you go into the house and come out when I have been going to my employ at half-past six o'clock in the morning, and in the evening towards nine o'clock.</p>
