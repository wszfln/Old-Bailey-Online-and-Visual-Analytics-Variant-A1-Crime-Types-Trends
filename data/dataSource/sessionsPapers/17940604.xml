               <p>Q. Did you miss these things while you lodged with her, or after? - The gown I missed while I was with her; after I went away I missed the other things.</p>

               <p>Q. These things that you left wet, had she washed them for you? - No, I had washed them myself, and I was obliged to go, and left the things in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come for them afterwards? - I left them on Saturday, on Saturday morning she came to me, and said she was going out to dinner, and it would be very late before she should be at home; she came again on Monday morning, and brought one gown, apron, and handkerchief of mine, and she left them with the woman where I was; I was not at home; she said that she was going out to Kingston on Thames, and she would not be home again till Tuesday night, and that if I wanted any thing, I must come again on Wednesday; I went on Wednesday evening, and she was not at home; after I had been there she came in and took a candle, and went out, and came no more all night; on Thursday morning she took a bundle of clothes and wanted to leave them in the public house, and they would not let her leave them, and she went back to her room, and took a bonnet box of mine, and never was seen at the room any more.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you trace the other things? - By the duplicate; I asked the pawnbroker if they had got any thing more in that name, she had not pawned the gown in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get to the pawnbroker? - I was persuaded to go to different pawnbrokers, and I should find the things that she had stole.</p>

               <p>Q. Do they correspond with the things that were pawned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The two muslin aprons I have had them a great while, I made them myself; one of the cotton handkerchiefs is marked B. the other is nor marked; I know the pattern of the half shawl, and the gown I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On Monday Mrs. Vaughan, whom this young woman lived with gave me an invitation to come and sup with her, and I went and supped with, her, and she told me that Mr. Vanghan had been too indecent with this girl, and that she should not stay there any longer, she said, she could not let her stop; the girl came down and told me of it, and asked me if I could let her have a lodging? I told her I could not think of taking a person into my apartment, I had but one bed, but she said she knew not where to go; and so I gave her the key of my room, and told her where to go home to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040005"/>apartment, and in the course of a day she might provide herself. My husband thought it very odd that I should suffer another woman to come home to his lodgings and so after the had been there about a fornight I got her another lodging, where she is now; and she is now indebted to me one pound seventeen shillings, and I asked her for some money; and that gown that is there she gave me, and desired me to pledge it for part of what she owed me, and she desired that I would not make the least hesitation, but take any thing that was wanted. I got rid of her with a deal of difficulty, and I got her a lodging at No. 9, Duke-street.</p>
               <p>Q. To Ann Broton. Do you owe this woman any money? - No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She owes it me for board and lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutrix. Did you give her these things to pawn? - I did not, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any resentment between you? Have you had any quarrel with her? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no friends here, they are all in Devonshire, and I did not think it worth while to trouble them on this affair.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutrix. Has this woman a husband? - She has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My husband was laying in bed when she gave me the gown to pawn.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by the duplicate? - She gave it to me among some papers, and the next day I shewed it her, and asked her how she could come to pawn my gown.</p>
               <p>Jury. What were the papers? - Some papers that she took out of a drawer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carried this woman's box to where she now lodges, and every rag that was left of her's; further than that, she was wicked enough to ask me to get her a box of pills to take; says sh:, I believe I am with child this time with a girl, for it appears as if it would stick by me, says she, I have found the pills do me good when I have been with child before; and also she has brought an action against the reverend Mr. Green, to extort money from him, with whom she once lived.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never brought an action against him in my life, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gowns did you lose at first? - I lost three at first.</p>

               <p>About the middle of July 1791, the prisoner came to Mr. Oldham's warehouse in a carriage, in the character of a gentleman. Mr. Oldham's warehouse is at the corner of Brook-street, in Holborn; he said that he had taken a house in Upper Norman-street, No.46, Mary-le-bone, and desired that we would send somebody to measure the place for the stoves, and send such as we thought proper for his inspection, stoves, and other things that he ordered. I am in Mr. Oldham's shop. I sent up a person to measure, and afterwards I sent up such goods as I thought most proper for his inspection.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you send a bill of parcels? - Never, they were not considered as sold, they were only sent for his inspection; I waited on him myself the next morning, and found he was not in town, and enquired of him in the neighbourhood, and found he was an indifferent character, and I sent some porters up to take away what goods were then left, and they were re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040007"/>moved to Steven-street, in Rathbone place. I never saw the prisoner after he ordered them in, till I saw him after he was advertised. I went to Steven-street, and the woman of the house acknowledged the having of them, and that I should have them in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter the goods in the waste books? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the porter here that delivered them? - No, he is not, that porter has left our service, and we know not where to find him.</p>

             was one? - Because he first entered the room, and Leatherby followed him, and there was a large window by my right hand, and he came and drawed the curtain on me, and pretended that he came for money that was due to him; he had worked for me about a month before that, and he insisted on the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other? - William Leatherby; I see him; they both came up to the bed side by my right hand and told their names, and said they were come for their money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you owe them any thing? - Yes. Barber was a great masculine man; and he took me by the collar of my shirt; I told him not to use me ill, to come on Sunday morning, and it should be settled; Barber held me by the shirt and right arm; and Leatherby went to the foot of the bed, and drawed the bed from under me, and left me at last on the sacking, and I held the top of the clothes on with my left hand. Then my wife dressed herself, she says, I have lost my pockets; but I don't accuse them of that, because she got them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the men got her pockets at any time? - No, Leatherby had not got her pockets, nor do I charge them with it. Barber pulled me about terribly, and dislocated my right arm, and I never shall have the right use of it any more; and Leatherby was searching about for the breeches and pockets, whilst Barber was laying on me; after this my wife says, Barber, says she, go down and get a light, and my husband shall settle with you, and told them they should be paid what their demand was; and he said, no, I shall not go down stairs, d-mn you, you old b-ch; and they said they would throw us down stairs to the mercy of the people that were under, and there was a vast number of seditious people got about at that time. Then they went on and took me by the shirt and by the right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040008"/>arm, and I struggled hard, and got me out of bed, as soon as I was out I was on my feet, and I saw a light come into the room, I see an arm slide it in at the doorway, about six or eight inches; but who brought it there I cannot tell, and then two of the foremen came into my assistance, and my wife took the light and looked at my bed side, and saw my watch was gone; says she, my dear, your watch is gone; Barber then went down stairs, and no person stopped him; this Leatherby was stopped, the foremen that he went towards put their hands into his pocket, and searched him, and there was nothing found, and he was let go; and I don't know that I have any more to say with regard to the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came into your house when your wife went down to open the door? - A gang master, he lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him? - No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the gang master? -  I don't know where he is now; he went up into his own apartment at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He never offered to help you at all? - He was the man that brought that light, as he told us afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact he did not come into your room to help you at all? - He did not</p>
               <p>Q. Had Leatherby or Barber ever lodged there before? - They never had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got any part of your things again? - No part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the looking glass? - In the stair case window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had your watch when you went to bed? - Yes; I and my wife can both assert that, because she saw me wind it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your looking glass on the stair case window the over night, when you went to bed? - I cannot swear that.</p>

               <p>Q. Who said they should have it in the morning? - My husband said so, and I told them so. We expected nothing but murder every minute; when the foreman came in just at the door, then this Barber rushed out, and I went round to the bed side, and I missed the watch, and I said, my dear, you have lost your watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said that before or after Barber rushed out? - Before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Barber afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the glass? - That was gone; I saw the glass the night before I went to bed, at the window.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040009"/>Q. Were they drunk? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I worked for this man on the Canal eight days and a quarter; we were paid once a fortnight on a Saturday night, at a public house, at Uxbridge; when we came to take our money, I called for some beer and victuals, and we sat there for about two hours, and he went out after his money, never paid us, and left us to pay our reckoning, and so we did not know what to do, and we went and called this Mr. Douglas, the foreman, to get some money to rescue us out of pawn, and we thought it was hard to go home without our money, and we went to Mr. Hallatt's house along with the lodger, and Mrs. Hallatt came down and opened the door, and we went up stairs, and went and asked him for the money, and he would not pay us; we said it was a sad case that we must not have our money to pay our way; he said we should not have it; Mrs. Hallatt says, you shall have it in the morning; he says, no, I will not pay it you; Mr. Douglas came into the room, and we were charged with the watch and glass, but I never knew any thing about the watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Hallatt. How much was there due from you to Leatherby and Barber? - I suppose about a guinea. The foreman rents a shop of me, and he told them as he rented a shop of me it should be settled the next morning. Six of the men that worked with me went home quiet, but these two would not; I was to receive the money of the foreman, and I was to pay them; there was a shop bill to be settled; it was at Uxbridge we were paid.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told them that the bill should be paid the next morning, did Leatherby or Barber make any objection? - Leatherby came up to my bed side and wrung his sift at me.</p>

            Did you see these men at all on the evening before? - Yes, and parted from them; there was a dispute between me and the foreman, that we could not get money enough to pay them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see this man yourself in the course of the evening before? - Yes, when I was with the foreman I took all the eight men to Uxbridge to pay them there, at the sign of the Bell, and when I got there there was no person came there for an hour, or an hour and a half after; there was a dispute between the foreman and me about the work, and I went away without saying any thing to the men why I did not pay them, I was afraid; the foreman told them.</p>

               <p>I live at Pimlico, I keep a private house. The 20th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I lost a gold watch chain and trinkets, taken from my side, coming out of <placeName id="t17940604-5-crimeloc20">Kensington Gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. How soon did you discover the loss? - I put my hand behind me to take up part of my dress, and in bringing my hand round again, my arm entangled her's. I turned my head round and see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040010"/>that she had got my watch in her hand, and I took hold of it out of her hand immediately. I told my friend that was with me, and he immediately laid hold of her and charged a constable with her. I have got the watch now, I am certain it is my watch and my trinkets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming out of Kensington Garden Gate, and a hole in the lining of my cloak caught the watch. I never was in Kensington Gardens before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Had you seen her in the Gardens at all? - I had not.</p>

            Was you outside or inside when the watch was taken from you? - Inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great crowd? - There was a crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw it first was it fastened to her cloak, or was it in her hand? - I conceive it impossible it could catch any how at all; there could be no force or I must have felt it; there was a pin very near it, and it was a very clear muslin, and it must have torn it if there had been any force.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe a little how she conducted herself when you saw the watch in her hand? - I turned my head about and saw the watch in her hand; and she said, I beg your pardon; that she said before I said any thing to her.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether she was endeavouring to put her hands away? - She had the watch in her hand, the watch hanging up as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>- CRANNAGE sworn.</p>
               <p>In attempting to get through Kensington Garden Gate, on Sunday, the 20th of April, there was a very great crowd, and this lady had hold of my arm, and she told me that the women had taken her watch. I asked her which woman? She pointed to the prisoner at the bar; I said are you sure that is the woman? she said, I am, in consequence of that I took hold of her, and put the prisoner in the Park Keeper's possession. I did not see anything of the transaction of the watch being taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the watch when you took the prisoner? - In possession of the prosecutrix; she had got the watch again then.</p>
               <p>JONES sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the constable of Hyde Park, I attend the door every Sunday; a person cried out that a person had robbed a lady of a watch, and this here gentleman here delivered the woman to me, and I brought her to Mount-street, to the watch-house, and from there to Bond-street, the next day, this was Sunday afternoon, about three or four o'clock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I keep a green-grocer's shop, I never was in Kensington-gardens before that day in my life; I have always lived with honesty and industry for this six and thirty years; the watch catched hold of my cloak.</p>
               <p>Court to Crannage. Did the prisoner when you took hold of her, say that it had catched hold of her cloak? - When I laid hold of her she said, do I look like a pickpocket? says I, is there any body here that knows you? she said no.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did the prisoner at that time say that the watch had catched hold of her cloak? - No.</p>

               <p>HANKEY DICKENSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a drover to Mr. Fearnley. On Monday the 27th of December I was employed to drive ten bullocks to the market; exactly at six o'clock, I saw the prisoner that morning, at the turnpike gate, in St. John's-street; I had seen him before, I knew him; as soon as he came up, he momentarily looked at me, and then immediately drove this bullock away from me, and hallooed out this ball-faced one; he called out to some of his companions that were near, I don't know who they were; he then drove it through Corporation-row, into Rosamond's-row, and when I was going into Corporation-row, I met it again, with the patrole following it, it then joined my drove again, he then drove it away a second time, I then called out stop thief, the patrole came up to my assistance, and he presented his pistol to him, and it missed fire, or else he would have shot him; the bullock then went clear away through the posts, by the side of the turnpike gate, the prisoner followed him, but we lost sight of him, and then I returned to the others, and took them to market; when I came to St. John's street, there were some people that came up and struck me with sticks, and I was obliged to take shelter in the turnpike house till they were gone, and then I went to my master to the market.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had gone to the market, and you and your master had disposed of the other nine, what did you do? - We were told that it was in the roads up at Islington, then I sent my servant, that works for me, for it, and he went and brought it to market, and master sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before you recovered it? - About ten o'clock, about four hours.</p>

            Perhaps you said something of this sort to him at the time. When you have done your diversion in hunting the bullock, be so good as to let me know where you have left it? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. He was there charged with bullock hunting? - We took a warrant out for stealing the bullock from me; I never was at Hatton-garden with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether you was not asked by the magistrates at Hattongarden, whether you believed that they took it for their own use, or for the diversion of hunting? and you said, that you firmly believed that they took it for the diversion of hunting? - I am correct, I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Q. They did hunt this bullock, did not they? - They took this bullock; he drove this bullock away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You know what the practice of bullock hunting is, that they are fined a sum of money for it? was not this bullock hunted? - He drove it away against my will; it was drove away.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the distinction, you know what bullock driving is? - Driving them about, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not this bullock been hunted? - Not before he was taken away from me; he was drove about, it you call that hunting.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he drove about? - I was not there to see, I lost him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he hunted as they would hunt a bull to make sort of, woman he very much heated? - I cannot say, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040012"/>did not see it for four hours, the man that found it is here.</p>
               <p>Q. You had conversation with this man, had not you? - No.</p>

               <p>Q. When you discharged the piece was he driving the bullock? - No, he ran away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the magistrate put any question to him about the intention with which he conceived it was taken? - They said that he was going to take an oath which a thousand people would not take, and they said that they rather thought that he wanted to do it for the sake of the reward, and then he was confused at the time, and there was his master, or somebody spoke, and then there was a warrant granted for apprehending him, on suspicion of taking the bullock away for the intention of hunting.</p>

We then goes to work to get the dies out of the press. I and Blackiter, and I saw Blackiter take a halfpenny with a saint stamp out of the dies, and I saw him take the dies out of the press, and the instant that was done, the prisoners were brought into the cellar, three of them, one made his escape afterwards that night; the other two were the two prisoners at the bar; we were in a sort of confusion then, we could not cleverly go to work to take the tools down; I said we had better take the prisoners to the office, and come back to take the tools down; I and Ray and Armstrong took the prisoners to the office, and I searched Levi and the other; in the pocket of Levi, his breeches pocket, I found it quite full with the halfpence that, I believe, correspond with the halfpence that were found near the press. Besides that, I forgot to tell you, in the cellar there was a watch hung up as if to work by.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand the process of coining? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many can work the press? - I am sure three can, and there were three found.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say the other prisoner escaped? - Yes, after being brought to the office; I and Armstrong took them two prisoners to our watch-house, and Blackiter took the other to Moorfields watch-house, and Blackiter let one slip out of the watch-house, by what means God knows.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that escaped claimed the watch? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down into the cellar were the prisoners in the cellar? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody was in the cellar? - No, but there had been, I heard somebody.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a halfpenny, was the head on the halfpenny compleat? - There was a sort of a saint head.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the halfpenny appear to be finished? - I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you mean now that this was a finished halfpenny? On your oath will you swear that it was a finished halfpenny? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this halfpenny so set off from the blank that it might pass in the world? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Finished with a woman and a head? - I don't know what you mean by a finished halfpenny, I am telling the truth, it is finished as well a great many that are among the parcel.</p>
               <p>Court. Where there any finished among the parcel? - Yes, there were a great many as well as ever they were designed to be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Do you know whether it is customary when they quit the press, to put in a piece of copper to keep the two dies from coming together? - I don't know, I cannot give you an answer to that.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know so much of the prosess of coining, as to know, that when they leave off work, they put a blank between the dies? - That I don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any halfpence laying by the press? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Harper. Here is a basket full of them.</p>
               <p>Blackiter. These halfpence were under the chair, it appeared from where they were, as if they had been sitting putting them in, they correspond with the dies; at the right hand of the press there were blanks, none at all at the front of the press.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. There was another man taken up, how came he to escape? - Yes, he went out of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you him in custody? - I was sitting by the fire, and I told him he might sit down by the fire and warm himself, and he jumped out over the half door, and I ran out after him, and knocked my head backward.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you receive a bank note on this occasion from that prisoner? - Not a farthing.</p>

I told him to go up to the top of the street, and then to ask; he then parted with me, and a young man, in a blue coat went up to him and got into conversation along with the boy; and the man there, the prisoner, was close behind the boy, walking up the street all the time, walking near the opposite side of the way. The man that was talking to the boy tilted up the box and looked at the directions; he then left the boy and the boy went on, the prisoner turned down Pancras-lane and came up Bucklersbury again, and met that person that looked at the directions; he then left the boy, and the boy went on; the prisoner turned down Pancras-lane and came up Bucklersbury again, and met that person that looked at the directions; the boy then went down the Old Jewry, they all three followed him, there were three of them in all. I saw no more of it till they came to the bottom of Princes-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040019"/>street, and when I came to the botton of Princes-street the prisoner had got the box on his head, and the boy was going away from him. I called to the boy and asked him if he knew the man to whom he delivered the box? he said no, I told the boy he had robbed him of it; I then called out, you, with the box, where are you going? He did not turn at that, I called him again, and he turned about then, I asked him then where he was going with the box? he said, to Bishopsgate-street; I said, you rascal you have robbed the boy of it, he said, here you may have it, and he took it off from his head and gave it to me, I gave it to the boy; a gentleman coming by, said, we ought to charge a constable with him; he said, we need not charge him with a constable, he would go with us; I told him he should. Just as we got to the corner of Wormwood-street, he then fat off to run, and I ran after him, and catched him by the collar. I took him to Mr. Wilson's house, where the box was directed.</p>

I have no friend existing, but a mother and father.</p>

               <p>This bag of feathers was taken out of my house the 22d of May, one of my apprentices saw it taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to apprehend the prisoner? - From the information that was given me; I was sent for home on this discovery, and brought a constable, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040020"/>gave him charge of him, this was Thursday evening, about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this at your own house? - Yes, the prisoner was a servant, he had lived with me three years and five months, a weekly servant; the next morning I visited him in the Poultry Compter, and he acknowledged that he robbed me of feathers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I would wish to ask you whether you did not tell him before he confessed, that it would be better for him if he told it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, David, tell me the whole truth, and what you have robbed me of, and it shall be better for you, or I will not prosecute you, or words to that effect? - No.</p>

            Do you mean the gentlemen of the jury to understand, that the moment you got into the Compter, you said nothing to him, and he confessed as soon as you got in? - I told him as to evidence against him, I had sufficient, I had found some property; all that I wanted was to find out where my property was, to bring the people to justice, the I only wanted to know of him where he had taken the property to namely, sacking, feathers, down, and other articles, the answer was -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp here contended that the confession could not be received under these circumstances.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. When did you see your property again? - At the house where I was directed, I had the search warrant the 23d, the same day as I had the conversation with him in the Compter, and I found some bed sacking, a canvas apron, and several other things, that I could not be certain of; I found these things at the house of

               <p>Mr. Knapp. You went some where, and found a feather bag, marked as you have described; and two brass cloak pins? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar was not there, I take it for granted? - No, he was not.</p>

            Perhaps he had told you during the time of his confession, that they were his lodgings? - There is no doubt about it being his lodgings, I knew his lodgings before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not tell you so at the time? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You described a feather bag? - yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a feather merchant? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Shatter, I see the prisoner go from my master's house, the same evening that he was taken to the computer. On Thursday the 22d of May last, about twenty minutes past seven, my master being out he asked me to give him leave to go out, for about a quarter of an hour? I asked him where he was going? he said to London Bridge, or that way; I said he might go if he would return in time to shut up the shop; he said, he certainly would; and I had my eye on him, and as he was going out of the house, I perceived before he opened the door to go out, that he stopped down and picked up a bundle, a coarse bag, that appeared to be Hessings, or something of that nature, with some feathers, which I saw through the bag; he opened the door and went out; as soon as he shut the door, I opened the door and looked out after him, I perceived he turned a turning which was quite a contrary way to London Bridge, which gave me a suspicion that he was carrying away my master's property; then I immediately set my fellow apprentice to watch him where he carried it to; his name is William Evans.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of those that afterwards searched his lodgings? - Yes, I was with the constable, and we found a bag with a mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. What stuff was the bag made of? - A kind of coarse linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master with you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. First of all you told my lord and jury that you see the prisoner pick up a bundle before he went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to alter your manner of statement; saying a bag of feather? - Is not a bag of feathers, a bundle?</p>
               <p>Q. If you ask me Mr. Impertinence, I tell you no. How long have you lived with your master? - Five years, the 1st of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always marked his bags? - Yes, always down to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. It never happened to you to make the same marks on another bag, exactly as you have done on this? - No, never with that number.</p>
               <p>Q. Not during the whole course of five years; your bags are marked regularly down, are not they? - Yes; they are, from one, two, three, and so on.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never marked more than one with that mark? - Never. When I first came there where some of my master's master's marking, but they were never marked as I have marked them, they were much smaller than any that I marked.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of the mark of tare, the quantity, do you recollect whether any of your master's master's marking might express the same quantity on a bag? - I suppose it might.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, during the time that you have been in your master's service, have you had the same bags down to this time? - Yes, I never marked but one set since I have been with him.</p>

            Are those all now complete? - No, there are some missing since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to swear that before this man was apprehended, the one that you have talked of, the No. 9, was not missing before that time? - No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in this trade before you came to your present master? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never, in the course of your trade, been sent to other feather merchants? - No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have seen other feather bags brought to your house? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. It never occurred to you to happen to see the same number as this bag, on other bags brought to your house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you apprehend that other feather merchants may have the same tare and number on their bags? - This bag that I am now speaking of was made up for the purpose of beating the feathers in.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever mark a bag for any other master? - No.</p>

            Whose house did you first search? - I went to his lodgings first, but I found nothing that night; but on the 24th, the next day, there were several search warrants granted; and I went with the gentleman to Mrs. Boss's house; we light of her in the feather room up stairs, she was coming down out of that room, we searched the under part of the house, and in the one pair of stairs we found a piece of sacking, and in the shop we found this outside piece, it is called a canvas apron; the day after we went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040023"/>his lodgings, and there we found a bag which feathers had been in with marks on it, belonging to his master, under the bedstead, on the ground; it has been in my custody ever since; I have it here now; this is the bag, and two cloak pins we found below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards take the prisoner before the Lord Mayor? - I did before that.</p>
               <p>Court. How was that bag marked? - I cannot positively say; there was a 9 on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you attend the prisoner before the Lord Mayor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag was found where the clothes pins were? - No, not in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was delivered to you was he ssurried at that time? - He really was trembling; he was charged to me for robbing of his master of a bag of feathers.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This bed sacking was found in the house of Mrs. Boss, but I cannot swear to it positively, because there is other sacking like this, but the bag I can swear to, that was found at at his lodgings, it is worth about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That bag I took for a blanket weapper that was wet, and I took it to go to either William-street, or Bell-yard, Temple Bar, I don't know which. In the Compter I told master of that bag, that it was under my bed, and he said the children were in bed, and he did not search under, and he went the next day and got it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called Henry Welch, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Why do you charge that man with taking them? - I know the man, it was the man that I had suspicion of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the barge his? - No, he laid his barge along side of ours, and my man had some suspicion that he would take something out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him with the barge along side of your's? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the things out of the barge? - I did, the officer commanded me to take them out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between him and the prisoner at the time? - No, not that I heard, he told me to take the bed out of the barge, and he would take the prisoner, and while I was taking the bed out, the prisoner ran from him, and he took him again.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these things let to her with the lodgings? - No,</p>
               <p>Q. When were the things stole? - Monday the 26th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the day you missed the property? - Yes, the same day; she was a lodger in my house, I had suspicion; I had been out, and when I came home I went to a chest of drawers in the lower apartment, the ground floor. I found the wood cut and the two top drawers disfigured very much. When I missed the things first I went to work again, because I did not miss at that time any thing but the five shillings worth of halfpence, and then my wife sent after me and told me that she missed the two half guineas of gold; and I went and searched about the pawnbrokers and found the apron, and the silver tea spoon, in Shoe-lane, pawned there; that was the same day about two o'clock, as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you came home and missed the halfpence? - About ten minutes after one.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you took up the prisoner? - The same day. I found her in the street, she was coming up towards my house, and I was standing at my door, and as soon as she see me she runs back again, this was between two and three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her into custody? - Yes, she had bought a parcel of things with the money; she had a new blue apron, and a new stuff bed gown, and a lining for it, and a new shawl; they were about her at the time that I took her, and a new cravat that was for a man; then she was taken to Hatton Garden, and was examined there, she said she had fifteen shillings; the examination was taken in writing.</p>

               <p>I am the wife. I was robbed Monday the 26th of May last, Monday was a week; the prisoner was in the room when I went to Barn; I went a quarter after twelve, to milking. I was left in the house after my husband, and I got my husband's dinner ready, and went a quarter after twelve to milking, and locked the door and put the key where I always put it, for my husband to come in to dinner. She was watching me to see where I put the key, she unlocked the door and let herself in, I suppose so. She was in her own room, in the one pair of stairs, when I went to milking, she got to the drawers and broke the wood about the locks and took five shillings worth of halfpence out of one drawer, and unlocked the drawer next to it the same way; the wood was cut away from the lock of both of them, and took out of one two half guineas, a silver tea spoon, a garnet ring set in gold, and a muslin apron.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the five shillings worth of halfpence done up in papers or loose? - Loose. I came home after my husband, about half after one; my husband told me of the place being robbed while I had been out, and I went and looked and missed these halfpence first, I missed no more till he went to work, when I missed the other things, and he went to the pawnbrokers to try if he could make any thing out, he could not make any thing out, and he came back and stood at the door, and he saw her coming to the door with the new things about her, and he took her, and she was taken to the office and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any property of your's found about her? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her business? - I never see her do any thing but just keeping the room.</p>

               <p>I live in High Holborn, I am a silversmith and jeweller, I have got the fork in question, about nine o'clock on Thursday the 22d of May the prisoner came to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in this state when he brought it in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the name distinguishable on it? - I see the name on it, and I suspected him from that; my son was in the shop and a maid servant when he came in, and he gave her the fork, she came up to me, and says, sir, here is some old silver brought to sell; I looked at it, says I, it is stole; and I came down and says to the prisoner, you have stole this; no, says he, I have not; says I, how did you come by it? and at last he said, the dustmen had been at their house, and he found it in a chimney corner. I asked him where he lived? he said, at the Crown in Charing Cross, and his master's name was Smith, I told him it was very proper for me to go down with him to his master; he said very well, but he had had a letter that his mother was very ill, and he could not get out any other time; says he, you can keep the fork, and I will call as I come back Says I, that will not do, and at last he agreed to go, I took him down Drury-lane, and he walked down very quietly, and when we came near to the office I said, you had better settle the business here; he seemed disposed to go towards Charing Cross; I took hold of his collar and told him he had better go quietly, and I took him into the Brown Bear, and put him into an officer's hands, and he acknowledged where he did live; he said, he lived at Mr. Holyland's. in the Strand, and I went down to Mr. Holyland's and asked him if he had lost any thing? and shewed him the fork, and he brought me five more directly out of the drawer that matched them. The name is attempted to be seratched out, but it matches the other forks exactly; and we had him before the justice, and is the evening he was committed.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my fork; it is the same as Mr. Holyland produced; the prisoner at the bar was a servant of mine, he came to me the 23d of April last.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Thomas. At the time that Vaux comes up to me, he comes and tells me that my daughter was taken for theft? I am very sorry for it, says I, and says he, you must come and bail her; I said then if she had been a thief, I would not come nigh her; and I went all about with him to the pawnbrokers, and never knew I was a prisoner. I told them if she had thieved, there were some of the goods in my place, a piece of cotton, and a pair of white stockings, I acknowledged this to him, and if I had thought they had been wrong got, I should not have permitted them to have been there.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, I was coming down Ratcliff-highway, I heard a hue and cry, I saw the prisoner. I took hold of him, and found this ribbon in his coat pocket, it was sealed before the justice, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You knew this man before, you have had him in custody two or three times? - I had him in custody about three months ago, and I found a parcel of oranges about him, and an egg in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he passes as an insane man? - Some people say so.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The silk has no mark, I believe it to be mine, I am sure we had the pattern in the shop.</p>
               <p>Court to Back. Did the prisoner say how he came by it? - He said nothing at all, I could not get any thing out of him, he stood like a foolish man, with froathing out at his mouth.</p>

Rogers made answer and said, if you look, I fancy you will find one somewhere about, Pryor then with his cutlass pulled the carpet aside, and under the carpet that laid on the floor, there was a trap-door, he then took a little iron crow out of his pocket, and put it in, and listed up the trap-door, he looked down, and said d-mn me, Musprat, here they are, I then momentarily jumped down, Pryor staid up, and I see as I went down, a man stand by the side of the steps, who endeavoured to pass me, I told him he should not, if he dared to attempt, he should find what he did not like; I went down backwards, and the man was on my right hand, that man was the prisoner William Martin, I told him to stand, if he made any resistance I would blow his brains out; I looked about, and I saw three women, these are the women all of them, I then came up; they were standing all up, one at one end of the fly, and the other at the other, and according to the situation of the place, the other woman stood as near as could be before the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation on their hands? - The women came up and followed me up, two of them, the man was attempting to follow afterwards; as soon as two women came up I coupled them together; they said, pray don't take us away in this manner, we have no stockings on, I must change my petticoat, I must have another gown; they desired time to change the dress.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040038"/>Q. Did you permit them to do it? - Yes.</p>

            What became of the third woman? - The third woman followed them up, after the two came up; I think, to the best of my recollection, the third woman did not change her clothes at all. While I was hand cuffing Martin he says, what a pity it is, let a poor fellow go, it is in your power, I will give you a couple of guineas. Says I, if you give me two thousand I will not. After we had hand cuffed him, Rogers was tied with a cord, and the women had changed their apparel, we sent for a coach, and sent them to the Compter, and they were brought before a justice and committed. I examined the cellar, and I found a fly for coming the halfpence; I examined that fly, and in that fly I found this piece of copper between the dies; this die is for coining halfpence; the fly is a part of the press.</p>
               <p>Q. In that fly or press you found a pair of dies? - Yes, here is one, and Pryor has got the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find this piece of money in that die? - Yes, and these halfpence about the die, and I found several other dies. There was a sieve with some blanks in it, where we suppose the person sit to supply the die with blanks; the other dies were some for halfpence and some for farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any farthings? - Yes, a great quantity stampt, and a great quantity of blanks for farthings? - I found the farthings in a box by the side of the sieve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare any of these farthings with the dies? - Yes, I did; they corresponded. I found a great number of other blanks, and two pair of womens pockets, all containing blanks for halfpence. The same day we went to ask Mrs. Gilbert if she wished to have any clean linen, or any thing sent for, as we had got the key, Pryor and I went; says she, I don't know what we shall do in this, we would very willingly give you twenty pounds a piece, if you would make away with these dies, and only bring the other things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Rogers was at the door, he was not at work at all? - He was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. His hands were not all dirty? - I did not observe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not at work however. This is a piece of copper that you found between the dies, it is not a perfect thing I believe? - No, I believe it is not; but the others that were round are perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Martin is the wife of Martin? - They say so.</p>
               <p>Q. They were doing nothing at the time that you went down into the cellar, only standing by? - They were so; the candles were just blown out, the sulphur came up enough to stifle me.</p>

               <p>I stopped the prisoner with the casks on Friday, the 9th of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I live in Leadenhall-street, I just then came from my breakfast going to my labour, I saw the prisoner up in a court along with another man, I then placed myself opposite to see the proceedings, and it led me to a suspicion that he had stole the things, I saw him and the other man, they quarrelled who should carry them, the other man had got something in his apron; the prisoner said, I will take them, he put one on each hip and went on, and I followed him and got close to him, I then examined the casks and see one had got a private mark on it, and the other a dealer's mark, he then went down an alley and thought it was a thoroughfare and it was not, and I got up to him, and I said, my friend, I really think you have stole these casks, and if you have not stole them shew me your permit, then I shall be satisfied you have not; he then said that his fellow servant had got the permit, behind him, he went down Jewry-street, I then said to him, I really think you have not come honestly by these; I then saw Mr. Cooke, an officer, coming, and I told him he had better stop him on suspicion; he then said he was going to Thames-street, into Darkhouse-lane, at the Antigalican, when we got there he said he was employed by a man to carry them to that house, we staid there a few minutes and then we carried the man and liquor to the Magistrate, at Guildhall, before Sir James Sanderson; and Mr. Read swore to the casks the next day.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was at work that morning for Mr. Fitch and another salesman, carrying mackarel pads, I was done about eleven o'clock, I was coming through Leadenhall-street, a man comes up to me and says, my friend, do you want a job; seeing me a porter, says he, here is a couple of small cags if you will carry them for me to the Antigalican in Dark House-lane, and wait there till I come I will satisfy you, in going along I went into a wrong passage instead of the right, I made a mistake it was no thoroughfare, and the man called to me and I came round by Aldgate pump into Fenchurch-street, and this man comes up to me and says, my friend, where are you going with these cags? my friend, says I, you are not the man that delivered them to me, says he, I will charge an officer with you, have you got any permit? I said I had none, but I supposed the man that delivered them to me had the permit, accordingly I went along and I stopped to make water, and went on again, and accordingly he followed me and charged that gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040041"/>with me, and when I came to that place I gave that gentleman satisfaction how I got the property and where I was going with it, and when I came to the place I put down the cags on the table, and the gentleman asked me where the gentleman was that I worked for? I said, I supposed he would be in in a few minutes; now had I delivered the property to that man he would have let me gone about my business.</p>
               <p>Court to Samson. What did he say to you when you first stopped him? - My fellow servant has got the permit, them were the very words he said.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Waddington? - Three years almost. On the 21st of February, between seven and eight at night, I was in the kitchen and somebody rung at the bell, and I went up and opened the door, and I saw the prisoner at the bar; I did not see any body with him at that time; I asked the prisoner what he wanted? - I thought I knew him in the dress he was in; it was quite dark, there was no light but the lamp; I asked him the reason why he called on me; he said he was going abroad, there was a draft of soldiers going abroad, and he called to know if I had any thing to send to one Hill, who went away the first time any soldiers went.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you understand by this Hill? - The Hill that is mentioned in the indictment. He said he called to know if I had any thing to send to one Paul Hill that was abroad; I told him no, I had nothing at all to send, if he see him he might tell him that I was very well, if he happened to be alive and should see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known this Hill? - I cannot recollect, I suppose about four or five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a soldier? - Yes; he said if I had nothing to send him, he wanted something for himself; I asked him what he wanted, or what his demands were? he told me a guinea; I told him I should give him none on no account whatever, I had none to give away; I was going to shut the door, as he stood by the side of the door he put his foot against it, he told me he would not go away till he had some money of me, he said I was a bloody b-gg-r, and such things as that, and that he would not go away without money, and that he understood that there were connections between Hill and me, and therefore he would expose me if I did not give it him, he said, that I had been guilty of sodemy, he said that in plain terms; while he was speaking to me a woman came up to the door, and she told me that she was the wife of Paul Hill, she comes while he was there, and I asked her what she wanted with me, if she was his wife I had nothing to do with her, I asked her what she had to demand of me? she told me what Steward had told me before, and she was going abroad the next morning to her husband, and she wanted money to prepare herself for going; I told her she might go if she liked, I had no money for her, nor none I should give her on any account whatever, I told her I should give her no money at all; she told me that I had given her husband many pounds, and I should give some to her to carry her abroad to her husband? I told her she should have none of me, I should give her none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever given her husband any money? - No, nor I never knew her husband; and then she gave me a good deal of bad language, and said that I had been intimate with her husband, and slept along with him, and all such as that, and been guilty of indecencies; while this was going forward, there was another woman came up to the door, and she began calling me a great many abusive names, as the other did, and made a very great noise, she called me b-gg-r, and a sodomite, the same as the other did, repeatedly, I suppose a hundred times, and got a great mob about the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other woman, did you know her? - Her name is in the indictment, they call her

            . This Jane Hutchinson she did not do any thing more than being abusive in her language. When the mob came about the door, Steward said, I think it is the best way for you to make the matter up, give them half a guinea, they are all going in the morning and I am going too, and then there will be an end to it. I told them I supposed they did not know what they were about, they were drunk or something or other; I would give them a shilling if that would satisfy them, and they should go, because my mistress was brought to bed, and I was afraid of the noise, the woman, Margaret, Solomons said, if I would give her five shillings she would go about her business and make no more noise; then I came down the steps of the door to see if the watch was set in the square; I left the door open and went to the bottom of the steps, I did not go from the door, but only to look at the corner if there was a watchman, and he was not set; I told them they had better go about their business, or I must have some assistance and have them taken up. One of the maids, that were below stairs, came up and I asked her for my hat, I asked her several times before she would let me have it, then at last when the people made such a noise and riot she brought me my hat, I then went and turned to the left hand corner, where there is a public house, the man's name that keeps it, is Gerard, I went in and asked if there were any watchman in his house; the man saw that I was very much starried, and asked me what was the matter? I told him that there was a man and woman at my master's door, and that they behaved in such a manner, that I wanted assistance, they were still remaining at my master's door; he told me he would come and bring some assistance, and in less than five minutes he came with the watchman, I got back before he came, and told them that there was assistance coming to take them, they said they did not care, there should be charge for charge, then when the assistance came, we walked down to the watch house, and went in there, when we left them there, the people belonging to Bridewell, sent for some assistance from the Compter, and the person that went with me, Mr. Gerard, bailed me that night, to answer for my appearance the next morning at Guildhall, they went to the Compter that night, and on Saturday morning they went before the Alderman; they insisted on the charge against me at the watch-house.</p>

I said I did not rightly recollect the name of Butts, there was a man servant lived there, but I did not rightly recollect his name, if he ringed the bell there would somebody come to the door, and he would know whether the person was there that be wanted or not, he rung the bell and Butts came to the door, when Butts opened the door, he asked Butts, how do you do? to the best of my remembrance; and I went down and walked by the side of the horses for a minute or two, or a short time, and I heard them at high words quarrelling as I thought, I then stepped up to the door to know what was the matter. Butts said, I shall give you no money, I have no right to give you any money, and you have no business here to make a riot, if you do I shall charge a constable with you, or send for somebody or another to send you away from the door; they seemed to abuse him a good deal and called him some disagreeable names.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was abusive? - The man and woman in particular, they semed to signify that he promised or ought to send money to some man. I cannot take upon me particularly to say what they wanted the money for, but they wanted some money; I don't know what to say about the words, they said he was a sodomite,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040045"/>old I - r, or something of the kind; he said, if they would not quit the premises he must go and get somebody to take them away; he went to get a watchman or constable, or somebody, and I stood at the door while he was gone; the first time he could not get any body, and then he said, he most get somebody to take them away, and he went again and some came to his assistance to take them away, and they all went away together, I believe with the constable and all together, I was obliged to attend my horses and carriage, and there was a great mob in the street.</p>

            's said, that this Mr. Butts used to pay for Paul Hill's washing; I have seen him often coming after Paul Hill myself; so she asked if I would stop with her, and she would go along with me, so I was a little the worse for liquor, and it was too late for going to the Tower, so she went to Mr. Butts's there, and rang the bell, and Mr. Butts came to the door himself, and she asked him how he did? and I the same, as I had seen him before several times, coming after that Paul Hill, and she asked him if he would be so kind to pay her some of the money that Paul Hill owed her, he offered her a shilling, she refused it, and then they had words together, then he said that he would not give her any more then that, she might either take it or leave it alone, and he said you must call again, for my mistress is bad to night; so she began scolding and making a piece of noise, and I stopped along with her, and he said he would step and get a constable, so she would not go, I asked her to come away, and Mr. Butts went for a constable, or patrol, and he gave charge of the woman; so I asked him what he was going to do with her? and then he gave charge of me. It was the woman asked him for the money, as he used to pay Paul Hill's debts, she asked him if he would be so kind to pay part of what he owed her, which was eleven shillings.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You have heard the defence made by this prisoner, and he says with regard to this money, that the woman only asked for some money that was owing by this Hill and nothing more? - The story upon my oath is the same as I have told it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you for any money that you owed Hill? - She asked me for money, but not speaking that I owed Hill any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner drunk at the time? - I don't think he was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying that you did not know her husband? - I meant I did not know that she was the wife of that Hill, I never knew that he had a wife.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, I am a poor distressed man, not able to see a counsel nor capable of speaking in my own defence, I never was brought before a court of justice before, and therefore humbly hope that as your Lordship is my judge, that you will also humanely become my advocate. I had three sons, in London, and wishing to live with my children, I came from Ireland about eleven months ago, and found, when I arrived,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040048"/>that one of my sons were dead, and the other was gone on board of man of war; I was obliged to get my living by labouring work, and I had been our of work for some days, when this unfortunate affair happened, on which day I had but one and nine-pence left, and being resolved to go into the country to seek for work, I pledged a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, for five shillings, to have something to support me till I could get into employ, as may appear from the pawnbroker's duplicate; when I got the money from the pawnbroker's I had not the least suspicion of any being bad, nor can I from the dimness of my sight be able to distinguish a good shilling from a bad one. I called at a public house near the pawnbroker's for a pint of beer, and the landlord said the shilling I offered him was a bad one, and I went and changed it at the pawnbroker's, who gave me another, I afterwards called at this cook shop, and had two-penny halfpennyworth of meat and bread, and gave a six-pence to pay for it, which they said was bad, I then gave another, which was likewife refused, and words arose, and they forcibly took what money I had from me; the next day I was brought before an alderman, and the people appeared and produced the money, I could not hear what the people said; but I am since told that I had eighteen-pence bad among the money; I cannot pretend to say whether the pawnbroker gave me the bad money, or whether these people themselves might not change it. This is my real distressing cafe, which I humbly submit to your lordship's penetration; I have been now six weeks confined, and I humbly hope that your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury, will take my cafe into consideration, and acquit me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It was in the evening that you charged Mr. King with this? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you afterwards take him to a public-house? - The clerk of the office told us when we applied for a warrant, that we did not want any warrant at all,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040049"/>we might go and take Mr. King; and bring him down to the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go afterwards, and tell him that you found there was a mistake, and that you found the deals in Fitzroy-square, and that those were the deals that you lost? - No, no such thing, I deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to Bow-street with him that evening? - I did not, I went, but they were gone when I went.</p>
               <p>Q. He appeared the next morning to answer this charge? - He did, Mr. Malpas passed his word for him.</p>

               <p>Q. He gave bail for his appearance here to answer the charge, and here he has come and surendered himself? - Yes, he has.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Tomlin, I was at work for him the 13th and 14th of May; on the 14th of May I missed a great quantity of deals, I cannot tell you directly how many, I suppose as much as a one horse cart would hold, or more, we found many of them again, we found some in Fitzroy-square, I believe there to be about a one horse load, but there was more lost than that; we got information, and we made search after them, we went away down to Goswell-street, where were some, but I could not swear to what I saw there, we came back again to Mr. Tomlin's, a neighbour said, you have gone too far, and he pointed over to Mr. King's yard, we went there and Mr. Mitchell said, here is, I believe, the plank, and Mitchell turned the plank over and there was my own name on the plank, that I did myself for the doing up of Dadoes, I marked them while I was in Mr. Tomlin's service, I marked them with my own mark; the prisoner would not tell me where he bought them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time did you go Mr. King's premises in the evening? this was after the hours of work that you went there? - It might be between seven and eight for what I know, we had not been at work, we had been doing all in our power to try to trace this out on purpose to save our own credit.</p>
               <p>Q. What you was under suspicion, was you? - and therefore, you to prevent the suspicion falling on you, went about to several public houses to look after them? - Perhaps we did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was as sober as you are now.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite in your sober senses? - I told you so, so don't ask me no more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told Mr. King that you had this suspicion of him, he told you that he bought all this timber of Mr. Nicholson, his timber Merchant? - I don't know who he bought it of; and if you talk to me till to-morrow morning, you will get no more than what I have told you.</p>
               <p>Q. Satisfy my question? - I never heard Mr. King mention the word.</p>
               <p>Q. He went with you to Bow-street? - He did not go with me, he went with Claxton.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back you gave him leave to go home? - I did not, he was gone when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. He came the next morning voluntarily to answer this charge, and there he was admitted to bail; and now he has surrendered himself to take his trial? - He has so, and if he has got any thing to say, let him say it.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this charge did you go to his yard? - I did not, he came to our counting house and told the misfortune that had taken place, the next day; he has dealt with Mr. Nicholson four or five years to a very considerable amount; he is a person that is concerned in large buildings, and has quantities of deals of all descriptions.</p>

They would not let him go into his house, so much as to put on his coat, they lugged him into the coach like another thief, this other man was along with us, well says I, if you will resign him up to me, I will be answerable for his appearance to-morrow morning at Bow-street, and he took me to his warehouse, there were five large deals.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any mark on them? - Mr. King asked me to look, and I saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these three men? were they drunk or sober? - The second man, Mitchell, took me out of the parlour into the public house, and said for God's sake let it all drop, for I believe Mr. King is an innocent man, for the deals are found in Fitzroy Square; then says I, Mr. King has a right to take you up, to accuse such a man as that.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been the character that Mr. King has borne in the neighbourhood? - Not a better character in England.</p>

Mitchell said, that he was sorry, and hoped it would all be dropped, however, this fellow Penn, seemed more obstreperous than the other; and he said, if Mr. King would give them all a pot of beer a piece it should all drop.

            Was there any mark as this man has described? - No mark at all.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that these were the boards that were challenged, either by Mitchell or Penn? - My master shewed them me when I went in the morning.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three more of his journeymen who corroborated Goodlass and eight other witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Mitchell. You hear what the witnesses have said the other side that you admitted that you had no charge against King, is that so? - I could not swear to the deals, but there is a man that has been examined that told me that the deals were not there the night before, it was Brown.</p>
               <p>Brown. They were deals that stood outside of the door, that I spoke of.</p>
               <p>Penn. When we found the deals, this man and his master was at work in the yard, Mitchell was the first man that brought the men out of the yard, we took them to a public house adjoining to Mr. King's yard, and Mr. Mitchell gave them a pot of porter, I asked this man, Brown, whether these deals were in Mr. King's yard last night? he said no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see the deals that you pointed out and fixed upon to be Tomlins? - Yes, he said they were not there when he left off work, and in the morning he found them.</p>
               <p>Q. To Brown. Was you in the yard when Penn came there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him look at any deals particular? - No, I did nor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say that any deals were his master's? - I never heard him say any thing till we were in the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. What deals was it you told him were not in the yard? - They were deals pitched outside of Mr. King's premises, in the Mews, the property of Mr. Hoare, who is a bankrupt, a waste place, adjoining my master's yard.</p>
               <p>Penn. When I asked him about this, I asked him about planks, I did not say deals; I asked him whether the planks which laid by the pit side, were there when he left work? he said no; says I, were they there when you came in the morning? he said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me at first they were marked with your name? - They were, I had two inches breadth taken off from one side, there were two marks for the two cuts, there was a cross and a P. for my own name on it, it was all in chalk, we never scarcely work with any thing else, without it is red chalk or white.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long ago you made these marks? - It might be four or five days, I cannot rightly say for a day.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mitchell. Was you present when Brown was asked any questions about the planks or deals? - asked him whether the planks was in the yard the night before, and I rather suppose that his master had been guilty of the crime, and I told him if those deals could be got back again, there would be nothing said about it.</p>
               <p>Penn. The two deals that I swear to was taken away in the night.</p>

               <p>Q. What past when he came? - As near as I can recollect, I enquired how Mr. Tuting was, supposing Mr. Tuting, at that time, unwell; for I took the prisoner at the bar, to be Mr. Tuting's servant; he made answer, he was better than he was; and I then enquired, how he would wish to receive the thirty pounds?</p>

            Did he present a draft to you? -  The prisoner at the bar did, I had it then in my hand, in my possession, a draft for thirty pounds. I enquired, how he would chuse to receive the draft? he told me some part in Bank notes, and part in money; I paid him twenty pounds in bank notes, and ten pounds in money; and that is all that passed between us. This is the draft, I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to know the character and hand writing of Mr. Tuting at all? - I do, I believe that not to be Mr. Tuting's writing.</p>

               <p>Jury. At the time you must believe it was, or else you would not have paid the money? - I looked upon the prisoner to be Mr. Tuting's servant, therefore I placed more confidence in him than I otherwise should do.</p>

               <p>Q. You supposed him a very respectable character or else, no doubt, you would not have kept company with him; you permitted him to draw in your name on this Bank. You had so great a reliance on him? - No, I no otherwise authorized him, than by sending him with a draft of mine to receive the money, because I was ill and could not go myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you, at one particular period, which I shall be able to point out to you, given the prisoner permission to draw on the Bank? - No, I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. And you are certain he gave this toleration to the prisoner at the bar? - I am certain of it.</p>

            You are speaking, I presume, only of one draft? - I never saw but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was the reason of Mr. Tuting giving your son free toleration to draw on his banker? - Mr. Tuting not being well, he said, he would thank him to fill up the check, and sign his name on it, as he had been in a counting house in the City he would be better able to do it than himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember when this was? - It was some time in February 1793, I don't know exactly the day.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean February twelve month, or last February? - Last February.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Then, I suppose, last February Mr. Tuting lived in Chelsea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue to live long there? - He lived there all the time I kept the house at Chelsea. I have left it about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect exactly when you left it? - I did not leave it on a Quarter Day.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Quarter Day before you quitted the house? - I left it about four months.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040056"/>Q. What month did you leave it in? - I cannot tell, but I think it is about four months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave it at March? - I cannot certainly say to a month.</p>
               <p>Court. You say he gave your son liberty to fill up the check, was it to fill up the body or write his name? - He both filled up the check and signed Mr. Tuting's name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby to Dempsey. You have been speaking of debtor and creditor account with Mr. Tuting, of course you keep an account with Mr. Tuting; will you be good enough to tell me whether you credited this sum in consequence of money that you had in your hands at the time, or in consequence of the general credit of Mr. Tuting? - He had always money in our hands.</p>
               <p>Jury to Tuting. How came the prisoner in possession of that check? - I believed I had some checks about where I lodged.</p>

               <p>Jury to Dempsey. Is it not usual when you pay the draft to take down the name that you pay it to, and mark the day on the check? - Knowing the prisoner at the bar, I entered this in the name of Tuting.</p>

I did not go to bed till past twelve o'clock, the clock strock twelve when I went down to see the cellar window was fast, and that was fast; and I locked the cellar door, and all the parts were secure, as far as I know. My wife and I both went to bed together. My family consists of two servant maids, my wife, and four children. Before I went to bed I went down into the cellar, particularly, which I always do every night; to the best of my knowledge the house was all safe. I generally gets up at five o'clock in the morning, just as I was getting up, the man that keeps the tap called out, Mr. Clipson, come down, for God's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040057"/>sake, for you are robbed; his name is Horsefall. There are shutters that part the tap from the vine vaults at night. I immediately came down stairs, and I found my shop covered with papers and linen, several odds and ends of things, and three pair of sheets that they did not take away, and the till turned toply turvy, and I missed several things. I advertised a reward of twenty pounds, and I received some information; Saturday morning I went to Hatton Garden, and there I got a search warrant; I went to Bowler's lodgings, in Turtle street, Gray's-inn lane, the prisoner and his wife were in the room; the first thing we found was a pistol in a box of leathers, loaded and primed, it seemed to be quite fresh in a box of loose feathers. In searching in a box I found three yards of muslin and a piece of irish, both of which I immediately said was my property; these were found in another box, not in the box of feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that box contain any thing else? - Nothing that I can speak to. These things are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in the course of your search, find any thing else? - No, I did not, in that room the prisoner was in, and we brought him away with us to the office.</p>

            Where were the other things found? - I did not find any more.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt that that night these things were in your house? - I cannot particularly say, my wife can.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it for granted that it was light at the time when you got up? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. And had been so some time? - It certainly had.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it, and what month was it you found these things in the possession of the prisoner? - Saturday morning, the 26th of April, the very next day.</p>
               <p>Q. The commitment is dated I see the 28th of May? - I found the things the 26th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the man not to be committed till the 28th of May? - He made some voluntary confession before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations did he undergo at the magistrate's, before he was committed? - I cannot tell, I never was there against him but three times, the day he was taken and the next Tuesday, and they sent for me over, just before this sessions, when they bound me over to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>Q. You I believe, have been frequently in this court, sometimes as defendant, and sometimes as prosecutor? - I have been as defendant.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here prosecuting for perjury, and sometimes prosecuted for perjury? - Never for perjury, I was tried for murder, by the prosecution of Mr. Jacques, and acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you a witness on the prosecution of Crosley, the attorney? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been a witness in this court? - The first time was when I was a witness against Mrs. Brownrigg.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. In the first place, with regard to the elapse of time, between the time that that man was taken up, and his commitment, it was in consequence of something that he said he had to impart that might be of public benefit, and no favour to him, that he was not committed? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the service of the sheriff of Middlesex? - Yes, and now am an officer of the Sheriff of London.</p>

               <p>MARY CLIPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the wife of William Clipson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the night of the 25th of April, going to bed? Do you remember whether the house was fast? - I saw it all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Horsefall calling to you? - I do. When I came down stairs, and I believe I was down about a quarter of a minute before any body else, I found the house in that state that it appeared to be broke open from the cellar, I found two doors that locked away the taphouse, from the wine vaults, broke open, that parts the tap house from our house; our man that keeps the tap house can speak better to the cellar than I can. The middle street door was open likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was the shop? - There were a great number of things laying about, my childrens clothes, and three large new pair of sheets, I saw some of the things on Saturday, at the justice's office, in Hatton-garden, a small piece of muslin, and a piece of irish; this is the muslin, and this is the irish.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself to say that is your property? - I will, I had seen it on Thursday, in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any mark on it? - Here is a mark that I cut out some gussets for sleeves from it.</p>
               <p>Court. That might have happened to other pieces of cloth? - It might, but I firmly believe it is mine, the muslin I have some frocks that will match, except that they have been washed, and there is the same quantity as was left to make a younger child one, and it corresponds with the quality.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then there is no mark whatever on the muslin, and these childrens frocks of your's will not match with it, because they have been washed? - I can bring them if you require them.</p>
               <p>Q. That linen has no mark on it, except that soute person has cut out such a piece from it, as may be cut out by any person that is making shirts. Will you swear positively to that piece, when a man's life is at a stake? - I believe it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. But you will not take on yourself to be positive; it is a common way in which a person would cut out gussets? - I don't know how any other person would cut it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it any extraordinary size to cut out for gussets? - It is the size that I wanted it.</p>
               <p>Q. If this man is convicted there is a reward? - Very possible there may, I never enquired, I don't wish to get money in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband has been familiar with courts of justice? - He has been.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you don't know there is a reward of forty pounds? - I have heard it, but I don't want any forty pounds; I could not have lived these years in the world, and not have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you married Mr. Clipson, where did you live? - In St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you live in Drury-lane? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The neighbours were unkind enough to say that it was a bad house I believe? Did not they call it a baudy house? - I really don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard them reproach you with keeping a baudy house? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor have you never been charged with keeping a baudy house? - No, ne-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040059"/>never; I cannot help what people may please to say, I don't know that they ever did, I never heard they did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodged in your house? - I really don't know, I have three in my house now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been charged with keeping a baudy house? - I don't know that I have a right to answer all your questions, and I shall appeal to my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. You have no right to answer any questions that accuse yourself of any crime; and whatever you might have been you may be an honest woman now.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Clipson came down, and in searching I found my cellar door broke open, and the lines belonging to the bells were cut, that the bells might not ring, and the ventilator tore out of the window of the tap room.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner and his wife, and have known them a great while, he is a hackney coachman, I never knew him to be any thing else; I get my bread by working at my needle, some time ago his wife asked me if I could make some shirts for her little boy, and afterwards she told me she should not breech her child this Easter, therefore she would have the shirting made up for her husband, this was I me time before this man was taken up for this charge.

               <p>On the 28th of March, a man came to me, of the name of Thomas, a little after nine o'clock, he presented a draft for thirty pounds, signed Frederick Tuting, I observed there was a little alteration in the draft, the which I took notice of, I says, March seems to have been scratched out and wrote over again? he told me if I disputed his being a proper person, I might step over to the

            , and found the prisoner at the bar, he was then in a state of inebriety, and in custody; I told him he had better send to Mr. Tuting, to get himself released, for he was in custody, and to tell Mr. Tuting to call on us at our house, or himself when he was sober, and I should pay the money, he promised he would, and he immediately proposed sending Thomas to Mr. Tuting; I went home. Finding neither the prisoner nor Mr. Tuting to call for two or three days, I enquired what became of the prisoner, we sent to Mr. Tuting to Chelsea, and could not find him there, we wrote to Newmarket to Mr. Tuting, he answered the next morning and came I believe the second or third day. That is the letter we sent.</p>

            Look at that draft which you say was the one presented? - This is the draft. I don't think that this is Mr. Tuting's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner about the draft when you went to him? - I did not suppose at that time that it was wrong; I withheld the money from him then, from his then state supposing he would make a bad use of it, my suspicion arose afterwards from his not coming in two or three days.</p>

            , the school master that wrote that will.</p>
               <p>Q. Who directed you to find out the house? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You went by his direction to find out Garratt? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing in the course of your going with him there about this will? - He said he himself carried it to Garratt's, for to have it copied.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that will produced and shewn to him at Bow-street? - I was not on the spot; I cannot say that. When we got to Garratt's. the prisoner immediately pointed out Garratt as the man that wrote the will, and Garratt said, this is the man that I did it for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You went to two or three houses before you went to the house where this school master lived? - We knocked at two or three doors.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar could not take you to the house, as you was at a difficulty in discovering it? - He had forgot the spot, that was the true statement of it; I did not know the spot, I enquired with him, after some degree of difficulty there we found him.</p>
               <p>Q. In your examination you said you took the prisoner, and not he took you? - As to my taking him or his taking me, we both rid in a coach together.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say then? - He then was extremely impertinent; he talked of my having used indecencies with him in the Park, and that somebody had seen me do it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the purport of it? - Meet me at twelve o'clock to-morrow, at or near Grosvenor-gate. I wrote that note on Sunday the 25th.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - He then said if I did not give him money, he had it in his power to prove that I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040066"/>used indecencies to him in the Park, and that a third person saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to that? - I was very much struck with the charge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing further? - Yes; on my observing it was a very horrid charge; he then said that I had great interest with the present government, and that he should be glad of a place either in the Customs or in the Excise, where clerks were employed; I said, to the best of my recollection, that I would apply for him; on which Watkins wished me a good morning; Rayne then said, as I had given that man a certainty, or I had done something for that man, he would have a certainty also; I said, he should; this happened on Monday. On Tuesday the following day, I see Rayne again, near Tyburn Turnpike, between twelve and one; he then said, that he had considered what he would have; I asked him what? he said that he would have twenty pounds in cash, and that he would have a bond for security for fifty pounds annually. I said I could not do it then; but that if he would wait till Thursday I would bring him the money and the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to that? - He was perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. On Thursday the 20th of May, did you see him again? - I did at the same place, Rayne was alone then.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then? - I offered him twenty pounds, but not the bond; he expressed himself much dissatisfied, and would not take the twenty pounds, he would have the bond.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you went home for the bond? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you see him again, I suppose? - He waited.</p>
               <p>Q. This was very near your house? - close by.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you brought him the twenty pounds and bond? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you give him the twenty pounds? - In nineteen guineas and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the bond likewise? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What said he to that? - He wished me a good morning, and said that he would give me no further trouble, to the best of my recollection.</p>

Friend Rayne, don't secret the business from me, as I am partly sure it was you: find out his name and where he lives, and I will make him quit the Kingdom, or give you an handsome settlement for life. There is another young man that saw the same, whose name I don't know; but, I believe, he knows me. Fail not of coming. Your's,

Believe me, he declares he will give me a hundred a year; I told him I knew nothing of the business, I was not there. He would not let me come away without signing my name to a bond, to be there to-morrow morning, one o'clock, as he is determined to put me to my oath, in the presence of a justice, whom he hath appointed to be there, to declare whether I was the person or no; and he says, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040068"/>do swear he shall be satisfied.

               <p>"Albermarle-street, May 29, 1794. I am rather surprised at not hearing from you since Monday last, as you premised to write the next day. The other person whom I mentioned to you, has called on me several times; he is a man of very considerable property, and lives in Westminster. After I left you on Monday he called and offered me a very considerable sum, if I would discover your name and address; I told him I knew not where you lived nor your name. He called again yesterday morning, and likewise offered to settle fifty guineas a year for my life, if I could find you out. I therefore expect you to settle something handsome on me for my life; I shall leave the sum to your honour, as I have so much respect for your family. I therefore mean to quit my place and go into the country for some time, to get rid of the abovementioned person. Fail not of answering this to night, as the person calls to morrow, to know whether I will accept of his offer; you will please to mention in your answer when and where I am to meet you, to settle the business; and let me know what you mean to settle on me for life, on a bond of security. You likewise promised to get me a place at some office; there are several places vacant; these are the places vacant, a deputy King land waiter, a house and window surveyors, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. I shall expect your answer to night, to know your determination. I am your sincere humble servant, David Watkins.</p>
               <p>Albermarle-street, No.24, Thursday morning, nine o'clock."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to Prosecutor. I would ask you first of all whether, during the time or any of the times that any conversation passed between you and either of the prisoners, you was under any apprehension from fear to your person or injury to your character? - At first I was, certainly; but the answer I gave the magistrate was, that at the time I gave the money, I did not apprehend any thing, either for my character or person; I said I gave the bond and money under the idea of substantiating the fact, of his having extorted money on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. So then we have got to this, that you was not under any apprehension of any violence to your person, nor injury to your character; but that you meant it for the purpose of entrapping them? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the parting with your money and the parting with the bond to Rayne, was perfect voluntarily on your part? - I cannot call it voluntary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The charge being above made, it occurred to you that it was necessary for you to go to the length of parting with your money and bond, in order to fix the crime? - It was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that at first you was alarmed, but that at the time of giving the money you was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you have parted with either your bond or money, if these various applications had not been made? - Why?</p>
               <p>Q. You ask me very naturally, why? Had you any the smallest connections with the persons whom you parted with it to? - I had not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040069"/>Q. Did not you part with it having the hopes it would accomplish their conviction? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp here stated an objection that the parting with the money, under these circumstances, could not amount to a violent or felonious taking it, puting the person in fear, and taking it against his will: which was answered by the counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Court. I look on this to be a transaction that commenced on Monday the 18th, and was not compleated till the bond and nineteen guineas were taken; but all the circumstances must be taken into the consideration. We will go on with the trial, and I will save the point, for the consideration of all the judges.</p>

               <p>I live at present with a gentleman in the Temple; I am a pleader, not called to the bar. I first became acquainted with Mr. Yard in the year eighty five; I went to France with him for about a couple of months in the summer of eighty five; we were students at Oxford together; we were of the same college for about three years afterwards, as long as Mr. Yard stayed at the University, I was in the situation of a private tutor to Mr. Yard; we left the University nearly about the same time, and came to town.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you continued in a state of Intimacy with him from that time? - I have; I am as often at his house as the difference of our situations and engagements will allow.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, on Friday you assisted in discovering and apprehending these people? - I did.</p>

            Where did you apprehend them? - Rayne was apprehended in Oxford street, coming down the street. Mr. Yard, and I, and Grant, went from Bow street together, thinking it probable that we should find Rayne some where about Park-lane, come home from or going towards his dinner. Mr. Yard got out of the coach, meaning to go a different way; and I and Grant endeavoured to follow him different ways; as soon as he got out of the coach he returned again to me and said, the man is coming down Oxford-street; I then got out of the coach, and Mr. Yard and I walked arm in arm to meet him, leaving the constable in the coach; when Mr. Yard met him Mr. Yard looked him full in the face; and he touched his hat to Mr. Yard; I then put my hand on his shoulder, and told him he was a prisoner, and the constable took him to Bow-street. I did not see the other prisoner till late at night; Rayne was examined that evening, at Bow-street, before Watkins was taken into custody; on his examination, the subject to which I directed my attention, was, the account which the prisoner would give of

He then gave me half a guinea to buy a dinner, he told me he would procure a better situation, than that of a gentleman's servant, and that if I would meet him the next day at twelve o'clock, be certainly would give me the situation that he spoke of; with that I met him the next day, and he told me to give him my address, he told me that if he heard of a situation to suit me, he would come to me the next day, and if he did not, he would send to let me know; afterwards he was at the drawing room I was passing, and could not go by for the crowd, and heard the gentleman's carriage called out for, not knowing that gentleman was the same by the name, till he came and stepped into the coach, on which I wrote to him, to acquaint him of this man's meeting me in the Park, this man was waiting for me, and when I came up to him, he said do you know who that was that was with you in the Park?

I was returning from Hammersmith, on the 19th of May, about two o'clock, as near as I can remember; as I was coming through Hyde Park, I saw the prisoner James Rayne, and a gentleman rather of a low statute, in a dark coloured coat; it was as I was returning across Hyde Park, in that walk that leads down to Grosvenor Gate, a considerable way; they were both of them conversing together, under a tree, which joined on to the road almost. I did not know Rayne at the first sight, but as I drew nearer the gentleman in the black coat left Rayne and walked a few yards out of the road; when I came opposite I nodded to Rayne, and he did to me the same; but he appeared very much confused; the other gentleman's face I could not see, his back was towards me at the time I past him. That was all I knew of the transaction.</p>

            What street in Bristol? - It was situated on the hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was your tenant? - I was in possession of it so short a time, that I never received but four pounds rent for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the name of the tenant? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner Rayne? - About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you first acquainted? - He was at his mother's house, in Gloucester.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him any where else? - Yes; I saw him last February, at No. 11 Fleet-lane, he lodged there at a sadler's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lodge in Fleet-lane? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you visit him there? - I used to be with the man that kept the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040074"/>his name was Ireland; I saw him there four or five times in the course of a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me any one place that Mr. Rayne ever was in, since you knew him? - He might have been in fifty places for all I know; but I had never seen him since I saw him at his mother's house, in Gloucester, till I saw him in Fleet-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. And never see him since, till you see him in the Park? - O, yes; I met him frequently in the Park; I have heard him himself say, that he used to live with Lady Aberdeen.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what time of the day was it you saw him in the Park? - Near two o'clock, as near as I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain it was not on a Sunday, instead of Monday? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. And as near as you can tell about two o'clock? - As near as I can tell about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are a good judge of writing. Whose writing is that? (Shewn the first letter the prosecutor received, signed, William Gough)-Upon my oath I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any objection to writing your name? - If it is absolutely necessary I will write my name, if not I would rather not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you object to it I will not press you. Do you say that you don't know whose hand that is? - Upon my oath I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What objection have you to writing your name? - I will write it if you desire it. (Writes his name.)</p>
               <p>Q. You write a very decent hand; a clever fellow. When did you see your friend Rayne first after you saw him under the tree in the Park? - I met him as I was going along, a few days after, I suppose it might be three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was as much as three? - I am sure I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was the next day? - I am sure it was not the next day; I think it was three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good opinion of him? - I had no opinion at all of him; I could form no opinion, neither good nor bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him when you met him in the Park? - Yes, he was telling me of that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Not you him? - I had no idea of such a matter; he told me the treatment that he had experienced from a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the gentleman's name? - I never heard the gentleman's name till I heard it in the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very angry at it, was not he? - He seemed inclineable to say that he meant to bring the gentleman to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there many people passing in the Park at the time that you saw him with the gentleman under the tree? - I did not take particular notice; but I never go through the Park but there are people passing; it was a very fine day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you whether you took any particular notice of the gentleman or of the indecencies? - He asked me if I remembered seeing a gentleman there? I told him I did; and then he told me how he was treated.</p>
               <p>Q. And that treatment was in the open Park at two o'clock in the day? - I see nothing of the treatment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you whether you should know the gentleman again? - I don't recollect that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Mr. Buller Yard's name in the news paper? - Not till last Thursday when I see it in Wednesday's paper; I see him on the 30th in the morning; he then told me that he had received a bond of fifty pounds a year, as a compensation for loss of character, and so forth.</p>

            Did he tell you who the gentleman was? - That was on the 30th morning; he even took the bond out to shew me; he shewed me the witness's name, but concealed the gentleman's name at the bottom of the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you never came to the knowledge of the gentleman's name till you see it in the paper? - I never did; he told me that he had found out the gentleman's name by seeing him get into a carriage, and that he had got his bond for fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that the gentleman had taken down his address in his pocket book? - He told me that, and shewed me them two letters that he had received of the gentleman; but there were no signatures to them; I did not want to know the gentleman's name.</p>
               <p>Q. As far as you collected from him, was there any body that had seen him with this gentleman in the Park besides yourself? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not mention any body of the name of Gough? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never used that name yourself? - No other but my right name.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you met with him, you did not upbraid him at all; but he set about it immediately and told you the whole story? - I suppose taking every thing together, that he thought I thought something must be the matter, by his appearing so much confused when I met him in the Park.</p>
               <p>Q. As you seem to know but little how the prisoner supported himself, have you ever been in service? - Never as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. What services have you been in? - Is it necessary for me to give my genealogy.</p>
               <p>Q. I will tell you very fairly why I ask you. I am going to satisfy the jury that they cannot believe one word that you say? - I have told you where I was employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, I have heard of Mr. Mason. Where did you write last for any person? - No. 8, Cornhill, for the same parties.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a hosiery business? - No, a lottery office, a licensed lottery office.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether, when you met the prisoner, you made any reproach to him, about his having been in the Park at two o'clock on Monday? - I could make no reproach to him, because I was a total stranger to what had past.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the Park on Tuesday with any gentleman? - I never did to the best of knowledge; I am sure I never reproached the prisoner Rayne with having been in the Park with a gentleman on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you never did see him in the Park but on Monday? - Never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know Rayne's hand writing do you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever correspond with you? - I never received any letter from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that to be an answer? - He never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever read any letter which he addressed to you, or caused to be addressed to you? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at that hand writing, and tell me whose writing you take it to be? - Upon my word I cannot form any judgment of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw that letter before? Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever write to him? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Or cause any thing to be written? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge on Monday, the 19th of May? - No. 37, Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>The letter read by the clerk, found by Grant in Rayne's possession.</p>
               <p>"Friend Lester, I am very much surprised at your thinking I should ever suffer any man to take that liberty with me, as for your thinking you have seen me in the Park, you are much mistaken,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179406040076"/>for on Tuesday I was with a most intimate friend of mine, in Albermarle-street, I went there to breakfast, and stopped all the remainder of the day there, for to justify which, all the servants will inform you the same; I must confess I thought you had a better opinion of me, than to think I should ever suffer any such thing; I confess I was sorry I was not at home when you called, to justify and clear myself."</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rayne. That letter this young man Watkins copied for me at my lodgings, I told him of Gough's coming threatening to take me up, I did not tell him Gough's name, and that made me write that name.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Watkins lived with me at this time, he had lived with me about four years, he behaved so well to me, that I have no occasion to reproach him, I meant to make him my upper butler; and it was not a month ago that they applied to have him put on the list as a yeoman, he said, that he had got a friend that could pay the money for him.</p>
