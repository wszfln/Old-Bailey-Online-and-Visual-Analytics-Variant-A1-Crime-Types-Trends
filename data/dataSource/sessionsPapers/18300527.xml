At the selling price - I should think Mr. Kimber could not have bought it under 9l. - it is fine strong Congon tea, at 5s. 6d. a pound- it fetched 2s. 6d. or 2s. 7d., without duty, at the sale; it could not be got at the India-house for 5l. or 6l., I am positive - here is the invoice and permit in the bag.</p>

            . I live at No. 34, Great Sutton-street. On the 23rd of April I met Marlborough in Smithfield, and spoke to him; Crawley was attempting to steal a box from a boy, and Brown was following him; when he found we were watching them, Brown tapped Crawley on the shoulder, and called him away - Marlborough then went away, and I went towards Smithfield; while I was there the prisoners came up to me arm-in-arm, and Brown said,</p>
               <p>"What bl - y cove was that you were speaking to?" I said a neighbour - he said, "He is a bl - y nose, and so are you, you b - r; I will shove out your bl - y eye for you; and if the other b - r was here I would serve him the same;" Crawley then said, "Punch the b - r's bl - y head about," and just as I turned the corner, Crawley struck me twice over the head with his fist, and my hat fell off; I went to pick it up, and a boy not above a handfull high struck me under the chin, and one of the party said,</p>
               <p>"You b - rs go to work;" Brown jobbed his umbrella against my face, and it went through into my month - I gave both the prisoners in charge; a person named Stevens collared Brown till the officer came and took him - I went to the hospital; this happened about half-past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You gave no bad language? A. No, I never said a word; I could not - I did not say a word; there was a great crowd of people - there are persons here who saw it; I gave them no provocation -I do not know whether Brown was drunk; I cannot say whether he was or not - he might be; Crawley appeared to be drunk - Brown might be in liquor; he was a little in liquor - he was not so much in liquor but he knew what he was about; I had never known him in my life before - he had no quarrel against me; I never said a single word from beginning to end.</p>

               <p>Crawley. Q. Why did you not give me into custody when I hit you? A. Because you struck me, and I was wounded at the same time with the umbrella.</p>
               <p>Crawley. I was standing looking on, and the officer took me - I know nothing of the transaction.</p>

            . I am a drover. I was in Smithfield, and met the two prisoners and the prosecutor against the Bull's Head; the prisoners appeared to be stopping the prosecutor, and just as they turned the corner, Crawley struck him on the head - Childs had a pail in his hand, and he put it up to keep Crawley away from him; Brown in the meantime came up and jobbed his umbrella right through his cheek; this was done directly- there was some language used by Brown, but I did not hear it; a butcher held Brown, and the officer came in three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near were you? A. About eight yards; I did not hear Childs say any thing - he did not appear to me to be speaking; I was standing by him while he was giving his evidence, but did not listen - I do not give my evidence by what he said; I was not noticing what he said to give my evidence by it - he did not say one word about having the pail; it was an old pail - he held it before him; he did not appear to be making a blow at Brown, nor at the other - he made no blow; Crawley was right before him - I will not swear it did not touch him; they appeared both to be in liquor, and Crawley more in liquor than Brown - I have no doubt they were both in liquor.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took Brown on the 23rd of April - I saw Childs standing by the Bull's Head, with his face severely cut; I went to the bars, and Crawley came up to me, but he did not interfere with me till I got to Long-lane, and then he pressed the mob against me, and a man not in custody, named Crowder, called out,"You b - rs, cut away, there is not a moment to lose;" he repeated the words, "You b - rs, cut away there is not a moment to lose - the traps are coming."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was not Brown nor Crawley? A. No; they did not say a word - Brown endeavoured to get away.</p>

            . I am a painter. I was in Smithfield on the 23rd, standing at the corner of the public-house, as you go into St. John-street; I saw the two prisoners come up - one of them had an umbrella in his hand- Crawley said, "I should have had the box, if it had not been for that b-g - ring fellow with the pail - see how I will serve him when he comes round the corner;" Childs was coming round from St. John-street, and as soon as he turned, Crawley struck him on the right side, and directly the other struck him on the left side with the umbrella; this was done directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you stated all you saw? A. I have stated all that has been asked - I saw an attempt to rescue; Crawley hit him first, and Brown immediately after - he did nothing in the meantime of any kind or sort; he did not put up any pail - he had not time to put it up; he was carrying it before him - there was another man in the crowd, who struck him as he was in the act of falling; Crawley seemed to sham a little, but he did not appear to be drunk; I smelt Brown's breath in the office; he was not at all in liquor - that is my impression; the reason I did so, was because Crawley appeared to be drunk, but when inside he did not appear so - I did not smell him, because I considered he had shammed it; I smelt Brown because I thought he might say he was in liquor - I did not smell Crawley, because I went to take the prosecutor to the hospital; Brown would not be searched by the officer, and I took hold of him that he might be searched, and smelt him.</p>
               <p>Crawley. I was looking inside like the other people, and the officer came and took me; I never hit the man at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it appear to be done with a blunt instrument? A. I should think not; if it had been a blunt instrument the parts would have been contused; it was not a severe wound.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. They have stated quite different to what they stated against me; the officer stated he followed me up St. John-street - I am very sorry it happened; it was done in the heat of passion.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street. On Saturday, the 8th of May, I saw the prisoners in custody in Giltspur-street Compter - I took Madame Vestris' coachman there to identify them; he pointed them out - nobody told either of them it would be better to confess, or worse if they did not; I told them I would hold out neither threat nor promise to them, and they were not bound to answer me, but I was directed by Madame Vestris to put some questions to them - I first asked the prisoner Thomas what he had done with the prosecutrix's two gold rings, one a diamond, and the other an emerald set with six diamonds; he said he had lost them out of his coat pocket the first day that he went away - I then asked what he had done with Madame Vestris' black face veil; he said he had pledged it at Philimore's, in the Old Kentroad for 10s.; I asked what he had done with the purse which the money was in, and the duplicate of the veil - he said he had thrown them both away in the Old Kent-road; I then asked what money it was he had stolen - he said three 10l. notes, six sovereigns, and some silver; I took the hat off his head, and asked if he had not bought that at a hatter's in Newington-causeway, left his old hat behind, and changed a 10l. note to pay for it; he said, Yes - I asked if he had not written on the note, "Thomas Garland, near the Swan, Old Kent-road;" he said he had - I asked if 4l. 13s. 6d., which is all that was found on him, was all he had left out of what he had taken away; he said, Yes, On Sunday, the 9th, I went to the Compter again, by direction of Madame Vestris, and saw Thomas first; I did not threaten or make him any promise - I told him Madame Vestris was very uneasy about her rings, and if they were not lost, to tell me where I could find them; he again said he had lost them out of his pocket the first day he left; I asked if he had changed any of the notes himself at the Bank; he said No, he had got a porter to change one of them for him - I took out the notices I had received from the Bank, of the notes having been stopped, and asked if he had given the porter the name of "

On the Monday following I received charge of them at Marlborough-street, and as I was locking Thomas up (I did not either threaten or promise him) he said one of the rings could be recovered, but the other it was of no use to look for - he then told me he had thrown one ring into the dust-hole at the watch-house, and the other he had thrown away in the street, opposite the Compter, on being taken there - I had the dust-hole at the watch-house searched, and the ring was brought to me; I have it here - this was on Monday, the 10th of May; I forgot to say that I asked Charles on Sunday, if he knew how his brother came by the money - he said Yes, of course he did; those were his words - I asked why he did not advise his brother better, when he knew how he got it; he replied, "What could I do?" that is all that passed -I went on the Monday morning to the pawnbroker's, with the lady's maid, who identified the veil; I produce the hat and a ring set with six diamonds; neither of the prisoners read the notices or the letter, but I had them in my hand when I asked the questions; the hatter had given the old hat away.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street, Marylebone. On Thursday, the 22nd of April, at a quarter to six o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Salisbury-street, near Lisson-grove, about one hundred and fifty yards before me; I think he caught sight of me as soon as I did him, for he kept turning his head round to look at me, and as soon as I believe he convinced himself it was me, he turned down Little Exeter-street, and ran as hard as he could - I ran down Earl-street; both streets lead into Exeter-street; he turned to the right at the end, and I to the left, and met him; I asked what made him run when he saw me - he said he thought I was going to beat him; I asked if I had ever beat him - he said No; I searched his right-hand coat pocket, and found this flute in it, and in his left-hand waistcoat pocket this snuff-box, and inside the box this brooch; I asked how he came in possession of them - he said the flute was his father's, and he had brought it from home; I asked how he accounted for the snuff-box - he said he bought it in Marylebone-lane, and gave 1s. 6d. for it, and the brooch he bought of a boy who works on the dust-heap, and gave him 2d. for it- I then locked him up; I had no information of this robbery at the time, but took him to the office on suspicion that evening - he was examined, but the prosecutor did not appear till the Tuesday, as he was remanded till then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not see him for five days? A. It was Tuesday - the robbery was on the 22nd; I stopped him at a quarter to six o'clock in the afternoon - there were two boys in his company when I met him in Exeter-street, after he had run away - I saw nobody with him when I first saw him, but there might be; I saw nobody else running away - he was not running when I met and stopped him; I found no knife or housebreaking implements on him - a pane of glass could be broken without a knife.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JOHNSON. If the glass was broken and pulled out I have no doubt the putty and all would come out together, as it is a new house; any one might have pulled it out - it had been put in about twelve months; I call that new putty - this property is mine: here is the box the flute, and brooch.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The sixteen handkerchiefs are not found? A. No; I have seen the prisoner about the neighbourhood - his father is a razor grinder: I know the flute by having it in my hands many times and the maker's name; the glass is out of the brooch in the centre.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going across the green about four o'clock; there were a lot of boys playing at spy boy - I asked if I might play; they said Yes - I was going along, and went into the carcase of a house; several more went in - a boy pulled out these things; I said,"Let us look at them;" he said, "You may keep them," and I went home with them; a lot of boys looked at them besides me.[Thursday, May 27.] <rs id="t18300527-4-verdict32" type="verdictDescription">

I ran to the door, and another young man that was in my shop ran in the direction the voice came from; I stood at my door for a minute, and saw two young men approach my window, one of them had a hat in his hand, and both had hats or caps on; their heads were covered - the man with the hat in his hand said, "Before they shall take the hat away from me, the b-rs, I will take and job his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270008"/>eye out;" they were as near the size of the prisoners as I can calculate - the man who had the hat wore an open short jacket; the other, a coat, but what colour I cannot say - I did not notice them much; I saw them pass up Vinegar-lane, and kept them in sight till they came to the next lamp, then one ran across - both ran away, and one of them sang out Jack, and separated; it then struck me they were the men who took the hat from the man, instead of him trying to take it from them - I believe the prisoners to be the men I saw pass my door; they answer the description I gave to the Police at twelve o'clock the same night - I cannot swear to them, but I certainly think they are the men.</p>

On Monday, the 17th of May, about ten o'clock, Quin and the prisoner Collins' sister came in, and had a pint of beer; in about a quarter of an hour Collins came in with a hat on his head and a cap under his arm - when he came in he said to Quin, "Jack, I have found a hat;" Quin said, "Where did you find it?" he said on the dung-hill, and said.</p>
               <p>"Shall I sell it;" Quin said, "What do you want for it?" he said, "Oh, I shan't sell it now;" in about five minutes another girl came in - the officer came in, and took Collins and the hat; Quin was taken next day.</p>

I asked what he meant by saying that - one of the females rose up, and said, "Oh, he knows nothing at all about it;" I had said nothing about any robbery or any thing; I told her to mind her own business; she sat down, and the colour came in Quin's face very much - I went to the landlady, made inquiry, and then took Collins with the hat; I found some receipts in it - Collins had a jacket on: I did not search him.</p>

I said, "Yes, if you don't, somebody else will," and he took it - the dung-heap is in the turning in Vinegar-lane; he went strait along into the Robert's Arms with it; I went with him, and was there when the Police-man took him out - I had been no where; we came from Bluegatefields - I know Quin; the next witness keeps company with him - I live with my mother, who does needlework for a shop in Smithfield; I get my bread by needlework- I had finished my work, and came out for a walk; Collins asked me to walk with him - I left home about ten o'clock, and went into the public-house between ten and eleven, it was nearer eleven; I have known him for years- I was standing at my door, and he asked me to go to the Robart's Arms with him; they say the prosecutor was knocked down at this turning, but we do not know it - I did not cry "Halves" when the hat was found.</p>

I was on duty about a quarter before four o'clock in the morning of the 11th of May, and saw three men crossing the bottom of Rosemary-lane, about four hundred yards from the prosecutor's - two of the men were before the prisoner; the prisoner had got a bundle, and I thought it my duty to see what he had, as I knew the two men to be suspicious characters; I went and asked him what he had got - he said some pieces of cloth which he had purchased the day before: he was going into a house in Mill-yard, Rosemary-lane - I told the man who was letting him in not to let him in, as I thought he had stolen property, and then the man put him out of doors, and I took him in charge - the two men had run away; the prisoner said."It is all right," and said, "I will tell you the truth - the two men who ran away gave me 1s. to carry the bundle to this house;" I said I had no doubt of its being stolen, and as I took him to the watch-house we passed Cohen's house, and the Police-men were there - he was ten or twelve yards from the other men; they looked very suspicious characters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk or sober? A. I think he had had a little liquor - he did not seem very drunk: the two men ran away directly I went up - he pointed them out at the time they were running away - I have made inquiry about the prisoner, and understand he is the son of a respectable man, and I have not ascertained any thing at all against him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I beg you will receive this as my Defence, and not consider it written by a prisoner as a fabricated story; but for the want of confidence, being overpowered with grief, thinking that I shall be the only cause of making my parents and family wretched, by being inthraled into my present situation by persons whom I had not the least knowledge of. The night the prosecutor's house was broken open (as he stated before the Magistrates) I was at my father's house until eleven o'clock, and had my supper, when I left it and went to my lodgings being obliged to sleep from home, in consequence of the large family), which was about twenty yards from my father's house - when I got there I found the door was locked; I knocked some time, but not being heard by the landlady, I very imprudently walked away, and wandered into a public-house, which I have learned since is the harbour of an organized gang of thieves, whom at that moment I did not know - I sat down, and drank a pint of beer, and in a short time got into conversation with two young men who were quite strangers to me; after setting in the house until two o'clock in the morning, the young men asked me if I would go out for a spree: they were going towards Ratcliff-highway, amongst the girls - I, knowing there were houses of that description in Ratcliff-highway, accompanied them until we came to the corner of Ship-alley, in Ratcliff-highway, when they requested me to stop at the corner two or three minutes - I had not been there more than five minutes, when one of them came running to me, and told me they had had a lark with a girl, and she was after them - he gave me the bundle, and told me to put it into my handkerchief; having no pocket handkerchief, I took my handkerchief from my neck, and wrapped them in - I was running towards the public-house where we had left when I was stopped by a Police-man. It is not reasonable to be supposed that if I was a housebreaker that I should make choice of a house like the prosecutor's to break into, whom I know well, and to have known my family since my infancy - we were educated at one school; the property which was stolen was not worth half a crown, and the whole of the property in the prosecutor's window would not fetch 20s., only consisting of small pieces of cloth, which is of no use to any person excepting to tailors who mend old clothes. I have by my Industry and frugality maintained myself for the last four years, and have assisted my father in supporting a large family of eleven children.</p>

I went to bed on the night Cohen was robbed, at eleven o'clock; the prisoner usually came home by eleven o'clock; his father lived about twenty-five doors from me, but the family was too large to accommodate him - I heard him knock at the door that night, but I make it a rule never to get out of bed to let a lodger in- he bore an honest and industrious character; I never knew him out so late.</p>

No - he knocked at the door between eleven and twelve o'clock; I am afflicted with rhenmatism, and never get up - I do not know who lives at Mill-yard, and do not know any body he visited there; it is near a quarter of a mile from my house - I have lived eight years in my house.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Friday morning, the 21st of May, about twenty minutes to nine o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Wilmington-place, Spring-street, Spa-fields, and saw the prisoner coming with a bag over his shoulder; I knew him before - I looked at him, and he at me: I watched him some little distance, and after turning the corner of St. Helena-place, I saw a person (who I had before seen in his company,) knocking at No. 29, St. Helena-place; I did not then know who lived there - the prisoner was going on; he looked round after he had passed the person knocking at the door - he looked back towards where I was; I followed, having suspicion, quickened my pace, and laid hold of his collar - immediately as I laid hold of the bag something pointed came to my hand - it seemed to me to be silver; I knocked at a door opposite, where Duke, my brother officer lived, and took him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270012"/>in there - Duke was not at home; I found this wine-cooler in the bag, and asked if it belonged to him - he declined answering any questions: Duke came in in a few minutes - I took the property to my own house, which is in the same street, and went to look for the other, but missed him; I returned, took the prisoner and property to Hatton-garden, and on the Saturday Mr. Solomon claimed it; I met him in Queen-street, Longacre, as I was going to his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you asked what was in his bag, did he not tell you it was an article in the way of his trade, as a silversmith? A. No - I stopped him, and asked what he had there; he said, Nothing, immediately, but then said, "I shan't answer any questions;" and when I got him into Duke's house, I said, "Is this your property?" he said, "No, it is yours."</p>

            . I am a coal-porter, and live at No. 4, Off-alley, Buckingham-street, Strand, nearer to Charing-cross than the prosecutor's shop. Last Friday week, the 21st, as near as could be, five minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, I was standing in George-court, Which joins off-alley, and leads down towards the Adelphi (I was not in sight of Soloman's shop) I saw two men coming down George-court; they the stopped just before they got to the top of the steps - the prisoner is one of those men I am certain, because I took my oath of it before; I took notice of him, and swear now that he is one of the two men - the other man had got a long white bag; before they came down the steps I saw them put something, which looked to me like a silver tankard, into the bag - I was about ten yards off, but the court is very narrow; they were on the top of the steps - I was looking up towards the Strand; I saw them put it into the bag - they came down the court and passed me; I took particular notice of them - it is not possible for me to be mistaken in the prisoner's person; I only just turned round, and when they got to the bottom of the court, they turned up the hill to the left, towards Adam-street, Adelphi - I saw the prisoner on the Saturday at Hatton-garden, and was certain of his person.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was it the prisoner or the other man that put the thing into the bag? A. The prisoner, because the other, who held the bag, was a little taller; I am positive he is the man who put it into the bag; the prisoner carried the tankard, and the other the bag; the prisoner put it into the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What have you said? A. That the other held the bag, and the prisoner put it in; the other looked a darkish man - I do not exactly know whether I should know him again; if I had seen him the next day, perhaps I should have recognized him - I did not suspect any thing; I thought it was curious to have such a thing in the court, but being such respectable dressed men, I took no more notice - I did not notice them for more than two or three minutes; I had my eyes fixed on them both at the same time - it was a long white bag; the other man had a black hat on, I am certain of that - I cannot say what colour his coat was; it was a body coat, I believe, but will not be certain - I cannot say whether I should know him again; I might or might not, it is so long ago - he had dark eyes, and a dark complexion altogether; it was quite light where I was - I do not think the other man squinted; I will swear he did not squint.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say you thought not? A. Because I was never in a Court of Justice before, and you flurry me; I observed the prisoner as he came down; he pretty well touched me with his arm, and I looked him in the face - I looked at both of them; the prisoner passed me close - they were by the side of one another; I did not observe the colour of the prisoner's coat - there was nothing remarkable about him; I never knew him before, but am certain of him - I took notice of his face; I know very particularly that he had got a very large nose - I took notice of his nose; it was rather a long nose - the prisoner has rather a long nose in my judgment; I do not call it a snub nose, and I know him by his features; he is a slim young man - they were both slim; I gave information of what I had seen before nine o'clock - I happened to see one of Mr. Solomon's men, who had heard that I had heard something of the case; that man is not here - I never saw any thing of the kind in the court before, but as they were such respectable looking young men, I did not suspect any thing till I heard of the robbery; I am sorry to think I mentioned it, as it has got me into trouble - I am sure I have not accused the wrong man; Mr. Solomon's shop is about one hundred yards from George-court.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man tells me the received this from some body to carry, are you sure you do not know who gave it to him? A. No, I do not - it is not because I heard he carried the bag, that I swear to him - if I had seen him so soon afterwards I could have sworn to him any where.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is this the vessel you call a silver tankard? A. Yes, for I saw so much chasing about it, and I saw this goat - to the best of my belief this is the vessel; I am confident the prisoner is the man I saw put it into the bag.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Solomon. I know this wine cooler; I saw it safe about two minutes before eight o'clock, on the further end of the counter - I did not see it taken; I was absent from the shop about five hours - I left to go to another establishment in Holborn; it was safe then - I left nobody in the shop; there are two folding doors, which are fastened by a weight against them, and another by a spring - all the doors face the Strand; there is a kind of lobby - the prisoner is a stranger; I never saw him in master's shop - I saw the property at Hatton-garden on Saturday morning, and knew it to be master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the mark of the weight inside the did, 230 ozs. or 320ozs. - I will not be sure which; the figures are 230, but how they are placed I do not know - it may be 320 or 230, and I know it by a mark on the lid, in order to fix it in its proper place; that is the figure 2 on the ridge inside - I cleaned it the morning it was stolen, before I left the premises, and saw that mark - I had the lid off, and was obliged to look for the figure 2 to put it on; I never saw one with the number 2 before - I generally see them marked No. 1; I do not remember seeing any suspicious<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270013"/>character about the house in a blue frock coat - I never saw the prisoner about, to the best of my knowledge - we have a number of people call; I am not always there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is that the identical vessel you left on your master's counter that morning? A. I verily believe it to be so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is that a common article? A. I never saw one resembling it in the least; it is of considerable value - it would be worth 5s. an ounce as old silver; I cannot be mistaken in it.</p>

            . I rent this house. On the night of the 7th of May my family consisted of my brother-in-law, my wife, the maid-servant, my son, and four other children - I went to bed last, about twelve o'clock; the staircase window was secured by a shutter and two iron bars across; the back and front doors were fastened, and the windows were secure; I was alarmed by my son calling out, and making a very great noise - I burn a light; I got up, lighted a candle, and went down to the first floor - I got a poker, and went down into the shop, but did not discover any thing gone; I did not observe the window, as I came down hastily, but on coming up I found the window-sash drawn up to the top, the shutter removed to the outside, and laid on the tiles of the privy, which is nearly on a line with the window - I went down to call the Police, and by the time I opened the door they had taken the prisoner; they brought him into the house; there is a wall between mine and the next house, which is a public-house under repair - it is empty; a man could get into that house without difficulty from the court, and from there into the yard; the wall is five or six feet high - he could get on that, draw up the window, and put up the shutter, which was inside, by lifting up the bar with an instrument; part of the shutter would come forward, and he easily removed, neither the bar or shutter were broken - the sash had not been hasped - I have a good many clocks and parts of watches in my shop; I missed nothing - I knew nothing of the prisoner before.</p>

            . I am a Police-man. I was coming out of Cranbourne-street and crossing Castle-street, about a quarter past two o'clock in the morning, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went down St. Martin's-court, and heard a cry of Murder! I tried to force the door open next to Mr. Grant's; that is a small haherdasher's shop, which I believe belongs to his house, and is between his door and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270014"/>the empty house; while I was trying to force that, I saw the prisoner running from the door of the empty house - I followed him down the street into St. Martin's-lane, up Cecil-street, into Castle-street, till he was taken by Howlett; I lost sight of him for a moment only, as he turned from Cecil-street into Castle-street - he had no hat on; nobody but myself was following him - I turned the corner immediately after him; I swear he is the man who ran out of the empty house - he had his hat on when he came out- he dropped it in St. Martin's-court; I found this hammer laying in the court, close to the cellar flap of the empty house - the cellar was open; it is an old shutter, which had been fastened with a nail or two - they could get into the cellar, and into the back yard, out of the back door-way; there was no back door to the doorway.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always given the same account of this? A. Yes - I never said he came out of the prosecutor's house; I am the only Police-man that saw him come out - I am certain the prisoner is the man; I did not tell the prosecutor I had seen him come out of his door - nor did he say I must be mistaken, for his door was fastened - I do not think the prisoner was searched at all; I saw him taken - there is a shop between Grant's and the empty house; Dean was the sergeant of the section - he was not in the watch-house that night to my knowledge; he might come in without my seeing him - page searched the prisoner, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>MR. GRANT. The haberdasher's shop is divided off from mine, and let to another tenant, who secures his shop inside, and comes through my shop to go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there a door from their shop to yours? A. There is; I tried that door after this happened, and it was locked I am sure - I saw the person lock it.</p>

No; I was in the shop when the prisoner and Clark were there - I have no recollection of Mr. Grant saying it was impossible he could have come out of his door, for it was fast; we were all sober - I was going to Covent-garden-market; I am sure the Policeman was trying with his foot to get in at Grant's door, and not at the haberdasher's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not examine the prisoner's shoes at the watch-house? A. Yes; I saw the mark of the heel of a shoe in some mortar in the adjoining house - his shoes did not fit or agree with that mark; I did not examine the empty house that night - I was not called in till between four and five o'clock.</p>

            . I am under-butler in the family. I was coming up staire, and saw the prisoner coming out of the dining-room - I asked the witness who he was; he told me what he had heard - I followed the prisoner up stairs, and asked who he wanted; he said he wanted to see Lady Strong - I collared him, and shook his coat; I heard something jungle - I said, "I should wish to know what you have in your pocket?" I took one spoon from him in the presence of the witness, and then sent him for an officer - I found these other two spoons on him likewise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does not this property belong to Lady Strong? A. No. I suppose to Mr. Holmes - I do not know that her Ladyship had her own property settled on herself at her marriage - this one spoon I know is Mr. Holmes'; it has his crest on it - I think the prisoner was tipsy.</p>

            . I remember the bundle of handkerchiefs lying about a yard within the door; I saw the prisoner come and take them - he dropped part of them just outside the door; I pursued him across the road, and he dropped these fifty-six at the corner of Market-street - I only lost sight of him while I picked them up, and swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Where was I taken? A. Just inside the market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going through Oxford-market, and heard a cry of Stop him! I turned round, and saw two persons pass me in a great hurry; I was then stopped, not by a soldier, but by two butchers, who said,"There is a call after you; Stop!" I said," It can't be after me, but I will stop;" the first witness then came up, and charged me with taking these handkerchiefs - I have not been in Europe for fifteen years, and never in my life committed an offence of this kind; why these two young gentlemen should he so positive that I entered the shop and took them, I do not know; my situation in life has been very different from shop-lifting, and I will say, if it were the last sentence that ever passed my lips, I am not guilty.</p>
               <p>EDWARD MEREDITH. I never lost sight of him at all; he dropped part of them at the door, and I followed him directly - I did not see any other person running; there was a soldier who was drunk, and he reeled up against him - he said, "Here he is, take him, and hang him."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It would have been very easy for that soldier to have been brought. Witness. The Prisoner said he had a wish to bring the butchers forward.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How soon after he dropped the last bundle was he taken? A. Directly - he was not then above fifty yards from my master's door; I certainly lost sight of him while I was coming across the counter - I saw him take the handkerchiefs from the door; when I got to the door I saw him running, and knew he was the same person.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 7th of May, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Windmill-street, talking to two prostitutes - he had something bulky in his pocket; when he saw me he walked briskly away - I followed him to Golden-square, and asked what he had in his pocket - he said what was that to me; I said I had a reason for wanting to know, and if he would satisfy me he might go about his business - he would not, and I took him; I found this crucible, and silver in it, on him - he said it was his master's, and he was going to take it to a refiner's to be melted; I took him to his master, who said to him, "How could you serve me so?" he burst into tears, and said it was his first offence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you take his watch? A. Yes, and I kept it two or three days by the Magistrate's order - I did inquire the value of it, and went to see for an owner for it; his master said it belonged to the prisoner - he gave me his master's name and address.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not a good character? A. Yes - I apprehend he did not refer to this silver, but to some that had been missed before; he generally works in the back shop - it is usual to take silver from the back shop and deposit it in the front - the prisoner might have forgotten this; what he said about its being his first offence did not allude to this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you miss any silver before this? A. Yes, I think three months ago; when the officer brought him and the silver to my shop he said he was very sorry, and I supposed that what he said about a first offence, alluded to an event that happened before; I cannot account for his speaking of a former event, and giving no answer to what was produced - this signature to the deposition is mine, and I swore to it. (read.)</p>

               <p>"The silver now produced, weighing about 3ozs., is I believe, my property, and is worth 14s.; when the prisoner was brought to my house this afternoon in custody, he said he was very sorry, and that it was his first offence, and he meant to restore the silver which had been recently missing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you state this? A. Yes - I think it must have referred to the present case, but I did not recall it to my mind.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You know it is false to say I took them from my pocket; you found them on your counter. Witness. I did not, they were taken from your pocket - he took off his coat and gave it me, but not till he had taken them out of his left hand pocket.</p>

Yes; these are the things which I had pawned for Mrs. James, and the prisoner gave the duplicates; James was with the prisoner when she took the lodging - I heard a gentleman say he would send to Warwickshire to find James; the prosecutrix refused to appear against James - I do not know whether the prisoner was an apprentice; her mother lives at Chelsea; I know nothing of the picture; I did not pawn that - James lived in the same house with Banks and the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a wheelwright. On the 26th of April the prisoner came to me, between seven and eight o'clock, and said, "Are you busy?" I said, "Yes, doing a little;" he said, "Will you buy an adze?" I said, "Is it your own?" he said Yes, and I bought it for 1s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was drinking that was the occasion of this crime - I have been twenty-nine years in the army.</p>
               <p>MR. BOSBURY. I believe that is correct - he has been in the army, and has a fracture on the head, which affects him very much when he is in liquor.</p>

            . I live at Camden-town. On the 17th of April, about ten minutes past four o'clock, I saw two young men in Bayley-street - the prisoner was one, and he had a large box-coat; I watched, and saw his companion beckon him to go round by the Red Cap - I followed them up the North-road, and when he was going to break out of my road, I asked what he would take for the coat - he made no answer, but called to his companion and said, "This young man wants to buy the coat" his companion said, "It is not for sale, and what do you want with it?" I said I thought they might have it for sale - I followed them on to another road, and asked a man where there was a Police-man; he said higher up -I then saw them get into a field; the other got away - I followed the prisoner, but lost sight of him in a hayrick yard - I waited, and he came out without the coat; I hid myself, thinking he would come back for it, which he did - I asked him what he had done with the coat; he said he had had no coat, and if he had he should not tell me- I collared him, and beckoned to two Police-men, whom I saw; he saw them, and struck me twice in the face -I turned upon him, and the officer came and took him; the coat was just by him.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. The witness told me he had been robbed of his watch - I went in search of the prisoner, but she was gone; I found her four days afterwards - she denied the robbery; I got this watch through the medium of a woman who called herself her sister.</p>

On the second examination he asked the Magistrate to let me be remanded another week, and during that time he came to Clerkenwell-prison to me - he said he suspected a person who frequented the road, and wished to find out the right person, and if the right person could be found, or he could give any account of the watch, the boy would give him 1l., and he would keep him away - he put several questions to me to know if I knew where the woman lived; I never saw the prosecutor till I was at the office.</p>

Yes, but she turned the things over so fast, that I did not see any thing of mine, but they were found in her box afterwards; I have no reason to suspect that my husband was too intimate with her - he loathed the sight of her; I am surprised she should dare to say so - the Police-man took her, and brought her box.</p>

I do not know his name - I lodged with the prisoner; I remember sending the prisoner for some sugar of lead to make a lotion - whether I meant to drink it or not, has nothing to do with this; I did not drink it - she did not, exactly prevent me from drinking it; I had before this lived at Miss Reginald's, in Sloane-street, and at Mr. Gregory's - I left there because Mrs. Gregory said she wanted the lodgings for some one else; she did give another reason, but I am not obliged to say what - she turned me out for a fault she found with me; I lived in Sloane-street as cook -I did not go there to open my boxes till I went to fetch them away; the lady did not turn me out, saying I was a drunken strumpet - I left because I was ill; I did not see the mistress - she called to me, and said she was doubtful whether it was not a fever; that was the only reason I left - Mr. Gregory keeps the White Swan; I was there from the Sunday afternoon till the Thursday afternoon; I slept in the house every night - I did sleep one night in the watch-house, because I was taken by the Police.</p>

On the 12th of May, about five o'clock, I was standing in the court; the prosecutrix came and asked where Mrs. Savage was - I went in with her, and found three knives and forks up the kitchen chimney of the prisoner's house; the prisoner was at that time in custody - I took them to the office, but did not tell the prisoner I had found them; Mrs. Parsons owned the knives and forks when they tumbled down the chimney.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe she has been very kind to you? A. I was a pensioner, and she had some children to nurse for me, but I paid her for them.</p>

               <p>"I don't know what to do," and he let him go, but the prisoner did not come back, as I understand - I went home; the apprentice and two or three more came to my house about ten o'clock, with the prisoner; I said that was him - the prisoner said he knew nothing of it; he then began to beg and pray that they would let him go, and said he would take us to where the brushes were; we went along - he said, "One of them is in pawn, and I have not enough by 6d. to get it out:" we went to the pawnbroker's, and while there the prisoner ran away.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met this young man - he gave me a quartern of rum, and then we went home; he went into the yard, and staid half an hour - he then came in, and said he had forgotten something; he went back, and was counting money - we went up stairs, and then he said he was thirsty; I went for some water, and there was none in the yard - I picked up this medal; I went to the witness for a pint of water, and told her to mind it for me.</p>

On the 13th of April I examined the body of a male infant in the dead-house, at the workhouse; from its appearance I should imagine it had been born ten days or a fortnight - it was in a state of decomposition; I found a mark on the right side of the head - it had the appearance of a bruise, as if it had proceeded from a fall on the ground, or some hard instrument; it was a confused bruise, from coming in contact with some hard substance - the body being putrid I did not examine the lungs; it was a full grown child; the bruise might, or might not, occasion its death - the bruise had been received either while it was alive, or immediately after death - I feel convinced such an appearance could not be produced by a blow on a body, which had been deceased any considerable time; I cannot form any judgment whether the child had been born alive or not- there was nothing on which I could ground an opinion- the navel-string was not tied; I did not notice whether it appeared to have been torn; I went to the watch-house, in Little Albany-street, and saw the prisoner - I asked how long she had been confined; she said about a fortnight, and as she acknowledged having been confined I did not examine her person - I went to the Police-office that evening, and saw some linen produced; it had the appearance of the linen of a woman who had been delivered - the navel-string not being tied would, in all probability, cause the child to bleed to death, if it was born alive.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the Police. I first saw the prisoner on the 13th of April at No. 7, Suffolk-street; I went there in consequence of information - she was in her room with Mrs. Williams; I was not in my Police dress, but had Shayler with me in his dress - she appeared very much confused on my entering; I told her not to alarm herself but to be composed - I said there was a very serious charge against her, but I wished her to say nothing that might injure her hereafter; I then said, "Is it true that you have been delivered of a child?" she asked if her punishment would be great - I said that was not for me to say; Mrs. Williams then said, "Sophia, you had better tell the truth;" she then said that to hide one crime she had committed a greater; I said "Then it is true that you have been delivered of a child?" she said Yes - I asked if it was alive when it came from her: she said she could not tell - I asked if she had heard it cry; she said No - I asked if it was down the privy; she said Yes; I asked if she had looked down the privy - she said No; I then asked if she took any means to force it under the soil - she said No - I asked how long it had occurred, and after recollecting some time, she said a fortnight last Saturday, and that no person was aware of her situation; I took her and Williams into custody - I left Deller to search the privy, and Shayler to prevent any one going there before I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not omitted to state that she said she believed the child had slipped from her when she went to the privy? A. She did say so - I then took her to the station, and on returning I found Deller had searched the privy, and a male child was produced; I perceived a bruise on the right side of its head, about the size of a halfpenny, on the bony part of the forehead, not on the soft part - it was black and blue, and appeared to have been given with some hard substance; I got the key from Williams and searched the apartment - I saw a plasterer's hammer laying by the fire-place, and conceiving the child had been struck with something, I compared that with the bruise; the blunt end of the hammer appeared to correspond with the bruise - I produce the hammer; I found linen with marks of blood on it - I searched several boxes for baby-linen, but could find none but clouts, except a child's old shirt completely in rags; I searched particularly for flannel, but could find none, except one of her petticoats - I am married; there was certainly no appearance of any provision for the birth of a child; I returned to the station and took her in a coach to Marylebone Office - I asked her who was the father of the child; she said she could not tell me his name, but she had been living with a Mrs. Cox in Hunter-street, and in her mistress' absence a gentleman called and prevailed over her - she said she had washed a greater part of the linen she had on at the time of her delivery; I asked if she felt any pains - she said not much, that her labours were always very easy; I asked if she had gone her full time - she said Yes she conceived she had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q, Did she not say her labours were quick as well as easy? A. I do not recollect - she might have said so; I went to a pawnbroker's, and a bundle was produced containing two petticoats and six clouts, or more properly napkins, for they were a very superior quality - there were some petticoats, but whether an infant's or a grown person's I cannot say; I examined them on going a second time - they were certainly not an infant's, but probably a child's two months old; they were long - I believe it is not usual to dress young infants in long petticoats; my wife has no children - I saw no frocks among the things the first time, but there was an infant's long frock the second time I went to the pawnbroker's; I might have overlooked it at first, but believe I did not - I found in her box in Williams' room a week after, a child's cap and blanket, but I swear they were not there when I first searched, for I was particular in looking for such things - she lodged with Williams; the soil in the privy is about four feet deep, and the seat about three feet and a half from the soil; I did not have it cleaned out, and cannot say what substance might be in it - there was not the least appearance of black about the child except the bruise; I conceive if it was putrid it would be black.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270031"/>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long after you found the child did you go to the pawnbroker's? A. Probably within a fortnight; I went in consequence of some duplicates that were in her possession - I forgot to bring them here; I was fetched to the pawnbroker's again about a fortnight after, and on the bundle being then opened I immediately said to the pawnbroker, "That is not the bundle I saw before, "but on examining, there were some of the articles, but I had not seen the frock, which was the first thing I then saw - I am certain the blanket I found in her box at Williams" was not there the first time I searched; I found it almost instantly that I opened the box - the body of the child was a natural flesh colour.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what hour did you see it? A. It might he about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. EASTCOTT. I saw the child about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What signs of putrefaction did you perceive? A. It was exceedingly green about the neck and the flextures of the joints - it was not a natural colour in other parts - it was not black; the bruise was easily to be discovered.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On the 13th of April, in consequence of information, I went to Suffolk-street, got a light, and on looking into the privy I could see nothing; I had the floor and seat taken up-I got a prop which stood in the yard, with a kind of book nail at the top of it, and previous to putting that into the soil, there was a quantity of blood and corruption on the right-hand side; that was taken up, a further search made, and nearly in the centre of the soil the infant was raised from the bottom with the prop, by its knees, the knees being bent; I ultimately succeeded in getting it up - I had it; washed, and then observed a bruise on the right side of the head, and marks of blood round it - the blood had come through the skin; it was taken into a back room - I saw the hammer brought in and compared with the wound; they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you brought the prop here? A. No-it was a common clothes-prop: this hammer is a good size, and heavy - I cannot say whether the bone of the infant's head was broken; the prop was about eight feet long - I cannot say what hard substance might be at the bottom of the privy; the child could not have fallen through four feet of soil to the bottom; there was no projection of bricks but what were regular-some projected further out than the rest, but there was none rough, or any thing to fall against - there might be some under the the soil.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there any brick in such a situation that any thing dropping through the hole could fall against it? A. No - the wall is about a foot and a half behind the seat; the projecting brick is near the soil - the body was in the centre, and could not have fallen against it, I should conceive.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not stirred the soil up? A. No, the prop was gradually put down.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MR. EASTCOTT. Q. Was the bone broken? A. No - if the hammer had been used with any force it would be likely to break the bone; it is heavy and the skull bone rather thin.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The bone being broken would depend on the strength of the blow? A. Yes, if given with any degree of force I think the weight of the hammer would break it.</p>

            , and live at No. 7, Suffolk-street, Battle-bridge. I have known the prisoner all her life-her husband is dead; she has been married, and had four children - two of them are living; I do not know when her husband died - she lived with me for some time before she was apprehended; she had a small allowance from the parish to support her children, and <rs id="t18300527-67-viclabel356" type="occupation">worked at Mrs. Ricket's laundry</rs>, Northampton-street, from Tuesday till Saturday night - she had lived with me for about seven weeks before the 17th of March, and I had slept with her for about a fortnight, for I was not at home before; I was always intimate with her - I once told her I thought she looked very large; she said it was the dropsy and a tumor, and that she was under a doctor's hands, but did not name him, and that it would come from her with the force of water - she always slept very sound, and never laid near me; she usually got up to go to work before nine o'clock, but one morning she got up a little before seven - she had told me the night before that they were very busy, and she was to go by seven; at eight o'clock a person from her employer came to inquire why she had not come - I said she was gone to work, believing it was so; she had left the room about seven - I got out of bed at nine, and was dressing; she came up into the room, and sat in a chair by the door - I perceived that she looked a good deal smaller than usual, and looked very poorly, I spole to her - she told me she had been taken poorly, and, as the doctor said, a gush of water had come from her - she had come into the room with a shawl over her, and her arms bolding her body; I pulled the shawl aside, and saw she was smaller - I sent for a midwife, who came; she felt her, and said there was a substance, but if it was a child it was dead, and she had better have a doctor, as she thought she was dangerously ill; the midwife went away, and Mr. Sandell came - she still denied having had a child; this was on Saturday - on the Tuesday following I had been out all day, from five o'clock till nine: when I came home she had been washing her clothes, for I saw them next day hanging out to dry; before that she had always taken her clothes to her place to wash-she never washed them at home; I never saw her making up babylinen - I did not go to the privy for three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she still denied having a child-did you say any thing to her about it? A. No, not till the Monday before the Thursday on which she was taken-I then said it was a shocking thing for her to destroy her child down the privy, (there had been a talk about it in the neighbourhood); the answer she made me was, she had done the deed, and was sorry for it-that was all she said; I do not recollect her saying the child had slipped from her down the privy-she might have said so; this hammer always hung on a nail in my room - I never saw any of her soiled clothes, till I pulled them from under the bed when Mr. Sandell came; he said it appeared to him nothing but water - I pointed out what I thought was blood, and said, "What do you think of that?" he said nothing more about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you not know of the prisoner's having pawned some child's apparel? A. Yes, she got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270032"/>me to take some things to pawn-I took them to several pawnbroker's, but they would not take them in; I did not see what they were - I saw them on the pawnbroker's counter; they were clouts, and things of that kind - that was a few days or a week after her trouble; it was before the officers came - I was taken into custody; when I went to the privy I did not look down - she told me the morning she was taken ill that something had come from her at the privy, but I did not go there; she said it was a gush of water and a bit of skin, and that it came with great force - I was too much frightened to go there; Mrs. Bennett went - I know she has had four children before, and a miscarriage.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Chichester-place, Gray's Inn-road. On the 27th of March I was called on to attend the prisoner, at No. 7, Suffolk-street, West - I asked her the nature of her complaint; she said she was labouring under a discharge of blood and water: I asked how long that had been the case - she said but latterly; I asked if she felt any of the aymptoms that usually attend pregnancy - she said not, that she had passed the turn of life three years, and had been treated by some medical gentleman for the dropsy; I could not from her information form any judgment what her disorder was - she never admitted to me that she had been pregnant, or had been delivered; a napkin was shown to me - it was in a condition it might be in if used by a pregnant woman; I went to her again next day - she said she was a considerable deal better, and the discharge had nearly stopped; I did not see her again.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what condition was the napkin? A. It appeared completely moistened with blood and water - that might proceed from another cause; I have heard of women being delivered very suddenly at the water-closet, in which case a child might fall headforemost, and receive a contusion if there was a projection.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Whether there was a projection you do not know? A. No - I do not think it likely that a woman who had had four children could mistake delivery for a gush of blood and water; I have read of women being delivered in their sleep without their knowledge -I cannot call to mind the name of the book, but I was told of it by a medical gentleman; I should not think it probable or possible.</p>

On the 27th of March, about eight o'clock-in the morning, Mrs. Rickets called to ask for the prisoner - I afterwards saw the prisoner go out at the street-door, and up the street with her shawl and bonnet on; this was a little after eight o'clock-I knocked at Williams' door, and told her Mrs. Morgan was gone out; I heard the prisoner say she was in the privy when called, and heard Mrs. Rickets call her-she returned in a quarter of an hour after I saw her go out; I went to the privy, and saw the floor had a stain of blood, which had been wiped up; I immediately told Mrs. Long of it- this was about half-past eight o'clock; I went into Mrs. Williams' room, and saw the prisoner at nine o'clock - she had her bonnet and shawl on, as I had seen her in the street; I went for Mrs. Piddington - I was present when Mr. Sandell was in the room, and after he left I asked how she felt; she told me she was taken as the doctor said she would be - that she was troubled with a tumor and water for a long time - that a gush of water had come from her, and a substance of skin - that she had taken it up, and thrown it down the privy; after this I observed all through the passage marks of blood on the paper and oil-cloth, and on the mat of the street door - the marks on the paper appeared finger-marks, those on the oil-cloth and mat had dropped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Any body could have seen them? A. Yes; they had not been washed out - the mat was turned over; twelve persons in all live in the house, including children - I went to search the privy in the evening, I took the clothes-prop, and moved it about the soil; the fork of the prop was broken, and there was a nail at the end of it to support the line - I moved it about in the soil, and took some rags up with it, nothing else; I might disturb what was there, or knock any thing against a brick - I moved it to ascertain whether I could find the skin or substance she named; I searched as well as I could - others were present, but nobody else stirred it about.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you put the nail end of the prop downwards? A. Yes, and raked up the rag-I put it down lightly, and not far; there are five children in the house - they could reach high enough to make the marks on the paper; some of my children had been out of my room that morning.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270033"/>EDWARD SHAYLER. I am a Police-man. On the 13th of April I received information about this child, and went to Williams' house with Deller - I examined the privy, and saw, laying on the top of the soil, the after-birth, which satisfied me there had been a delivery - we had the floor taken up, took up the after-birth, and then the child, which I got out with the carpenter's assistance -I washed it, and discovered a wound on the right side of the head; it appeared to have been struck by a blunt instrument - I took it to the workhouse; I saw the prisoner before this, but desired her to go into the next room while I examined Mrs. Williams; after examining the privy I returned to the room, sent for the prisoner, and asked how she could so far lose all the feelings of a mother, as to destroy her infant (this was before Deller had seen her) - she said the deed was done, and what would they do with her; I said it was impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was any body present at this conversation? A. Mrs. Williams; she heard all that was said - I cannot tell whether she stated this before, or after Williams said any thing, but believe it was before; Mrs. Williams said, "Mrs. Morgan, you had better state," as she was not satisfied what Mrs. Morgan had said to me - I swear this was said before Mrs. Williams advised her at all; I believe nothing passed after Williams said she had better state - I believe Williams was satisfied she had destroyed the child.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You believe, after Mrs. Williams said she had better state, that nothing more passed? A. No, it was after the prisoner said what she did, that Williams said she had better state.</p>

             re-examined. I cannot say how many rags there were, as I did not take them out of the privy - they did not appear to have been fresh put in, they appeared very dirty.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. - I declare myself totally innocent either of the murder or the concealment of the poor child; I did not attempt its destrnction - on the contrary I would have shuddered at such an act. The plain fact is, I went to the privy, and while there something came from me, as of a gush of water, while I sat upon the seat; I never supposed I should have been taken when in the privy, and the moment I left it, in pain as I was, I even directed Mrs. Williams' attention myself to the privy, and submitted to every scarch by the midwife and doctor - I did not even know a child had come away, as I never heard a cry or any noise to make me suppose it, and what I mentioned to Mrs. Williams' was of itself sufficient to direct a search in the privy, which I never would have done had I supposed there was an infant there, as I must have at once been detected.</p>

            . I am a sergeant of the Police.

On the way to the station-house the prisoner told me he had a finger in the pie, but he knew nothing of him or the jacket; the prosecutor did not appear drunk when I saw him; when I searched the prisoner he said, "How was it possible for me to commit such an offence when I hold this relic?" (Producing a bottle of holy water) and here is an oath I found on him, in his own writing, on which he swears not to commit drunkenness or any unlawful desires - he was drunk that night when I took him, but not incapable of walking.</p>

On the 2nd of May, about two o'clock, I was called up into his sleeping room, to search his box, which had been opened about two minutes before I got up, by a key belonging to the house; he was not at home - I found seven different handkerchiefs in his box; they had never been used - I knew four by different marks on them - only one had our private mark; that was in my own writing; I had been in the country some time, and do not know when it had been safe - I knew the other six by their having passed through my hands so frequently, and by the pattern and folds; he never purchased goods of us, nor applied to purchase any - he came home in about two hours, and I told him I wanted to look into his box; he said certainly - I took him up stairs, and showed him the handkerchiefs, which were taken out and thrown on the bed; I told him I had discovered them in his box - he asserted most positively that he had never seen them there before, and repeated that several times; on my turning round, and saying I should fetch an officer, he took hold of my brother's arm, and said, "Mr. Smith, I wish to speak to you;" my brother said, "What you have to say speak loud;" he then said, "Well, if I die for it, I put them there;" he had 20l. a year, board and lodging - my brother's wife had opened the box in the first instance; nobody else slept in the room - they are worth 18s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are the handkerchiefs modern, or old shopkeepers? A. Some of them are old, and by that I know them; one or two are modern - I cannot say that he was alarmed at first; he became much so after having said if he was hung for it he had done it; he said he had taken them to send to his friends in Wales, and afterwards said, "No, I took them to sell to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270035"/>my friends in London;" if he had paid for them I should not have approved of his taking them without leave - I had a very good character with him.</p>

             was a boy to attend him; I had a clerk named Rodgers, who came to keep my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen that your memory is generally treacherous about accounts? A. I cannot say I never make a mistake; I received some money from Mr. Brown, of Seymour-street, a fortnight or a month before the prisoner left - I think it was 6s. and 4s.; it was under 15s. - I did not charge the prisoner with embezzling that; I asked him why he had not paid me 6s. from Brown, (as he represented him as a friend of his keeping a private house) it was a trifling sum and I did not wish to have it on my books; I asked him for it and he brought it -I do not know whether I entered it at the moment, but I did enter it; I never asked him for it after I had received it - on the Saturday night I asked him for the money; in balancing the account it might have been paid, and not put down, then as I balance every Saturday I might have said I had not had it, till it was recollected on balancing the account - I received 6l. from Mr. Good; I never charged him with not having paid that after I received it - the cash is balanced every Saturday, and if there is any error it is settled in balancing; I might ask my young men on Saturday if they had received such a sum, and if so I have put it down - I mean that in the hurry of business in the course of seven years I may have omitted to have put a sum down; it may happen five or six times in the course of a year, but the prisoner was never charged with keeping it to himself - if money is not put down at the moment, the balance on Saturday sets it right.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not repeatedly happened that you had a larger balance of cash than you could account for? A. Not repeatedly, it has always been settled; I occasion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270036"/>ally preach at Woolwich - (refers to a cash-book) Brown's name would not be entered in my book, as it was so trifling a sum; I had a sum of 10s. for two accounts of 6s. and 4s. between the 1st and 20th of March, but cannot say on what day, as these small accounts are not entered in separate lines, and have no names to them - I received the 6l. from Good on the 15th of April, that was entered within a week of its being received, because it could not go over the Saturday; Good had an account with me, and it is entered in his name - if it was not entered directly, it was entered next day at the furthest - it is my writing; the impression of my mind is that it was entered at the instant - I remember four years ago a piece of Irish being sold, and I never knew it for three months after, when it was paid for; I might have sold it myself -I did not charge my men with applying that to their own purpose; Bates might have reminded me of receiving the 10s. from Brown, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any means of knowing whether money was accounted for by your clerks, except finding on Saturday more money than the book shewed, and your asking your clerks to make out the difference? A. There is no other way in such a case.</p>

(read)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When were you applied to for the money? A. About six weeks after the prisoner had left them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMPER. I am a constable. On the 4th of May Mr. Sibley gave the prisoner into my charge at his warehouse, and charged him with embezzling money to a great amount; he did not say what - the prisoner said nothing; I found 3l. 2s. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was no specific charge? A. It was for embezzling at various times to a very large amount; no name was mentioned - Sibley said he had not had time to get up evidence, as he had unexpectedly met him in the street.</p>
               <p>MR. SIBLEY. The 2l. from Hamper has never been accounted for - it stands in my book against him now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Point out the entry? A. Here it is in Rogers', the clerk's, writing; he is not here - it was not Rogers' place to receive money - he is a clerk in the India-house, and comes to make up my books; the goods are entered in the prisoner's memorandum-book in his own hand as sold, and he had put in here"cash;" I found this book the day after he left; it has never been paid to me - I dismissed him from my employ on suspicion of robbing to a great extent; I never looked into this book till after he left - I had only seen it in his hand before; I made this charge before the Magistrate - he did not say he had paid it; he said nothing - I have known him ten years; I took him with an honest character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his duty to account for this sum before the 15th of April? A. He should have paid it the day he received it; the money, as it is brought to me, is entered in the cash-book - I post it from that to the ledger; I swear I have not received it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I conceive my innocence is very palpable, and it is useless for me to make the slightest observation - the money I received I always paid to Sibley; payments were frequently made to him and not entered in the cash account.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any distinct recollection whatever of having sent the prisoner himself to the Gazette-office? A. Yes, Sir, I gave it him, but did not see him go - I never ordered him to hand the cash and advertisements to other clerks, to my recollection - it never was the custom in the office; I am sure I never told the prisoner to do it myself - there was a clerk named Jones; I do not know that I ever, in his presence, told the prisoner to hand the cash and advertisements to other clerks, or that Mr. Jones was the person sent on any occasion - I never knew the prisoner to hand over the cash to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270037"/>Mr. Walter, or Henderson, or Murray, Jun.; the prisoner has never settled these accounts with other persons in my presence - nor general money accounts; the cash given the prisoner was on account of Messrs. Adlington, Gregory, and Faulkner, and to be paid at the Gazette-office; he has not been often absent from indisposition, since I have been there - I have no idea of what is disbursed in a day in that office; I have been there about four months - I cannot tell what has been the custom of the office so well as the elder clerks.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the 2nd and 22nd of March were you the person from whom the prisoner received these sums of money? A. Yes, and he ought to have accounted to me for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that your department? A. Yes; I do not know whether he had the disbursement of any other money! except for advertisements - the 3l. he had from me was for the purpose of paying for the advertisements; he stated he paid 1l. 0s. 6d. for that, 18s. for the insertion in the Times, 2s. 9d. for a copy of the Gazette, and 7d. for the Times newspaper - I have no doubt but he brought me the difference.</p>

            . I was clerk to the prosecutors. On the 25th of March I gave the prisoner an advertisement to take to the London Gazette; I do not know what money I gave him, but he generally told me about what he thought it would come to; it was the custom of our office to give a clerk the money before we sent him - I know he accounted to me that day, because it was the custom; I made the entry at the time from what he told me - this is it; (reads)"Advertisement 1l. 4s., Gazette 2s. 9d.;" Mr. Gregory asked the prisoner how it was that a common advertisement of that kind was so high a charge - the prisoner said if there was one word more than usual, or even an alteration, 10s. was added.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you made any memorandum in your book of whom you gave the money? A. No; the prisoner was often absent three or four days from ill health - he was not absent on the 6th of February, or on the 25th of March; we omitted the charge on the 6th of February, but the one of the 25th of March is in this indictment - I am not aware that it ever happened that the advertisement and money has been left on the desk for the first clerk who was at liberty to take it; it was never done, to the best of my recollection - I cannot say that I have ever done it; I do not recollect it; I do not recollect one instance - there was a clerk named Jones in the office, and one named Sands - I may have left advertisements and money for insertion in the Gazette or Times with instructions that they should be forwarded by the first clerk that should be disengaged, but I do not recollect it - I think I have not done it often; I have heard that the prisoner has handed the money and advertisement to other clerks, but if I gave him the money I took the account from him; I cannot tell whether he has been charged by other clerks, the money he has charged me - to the best of my recollection I never gave Mr. Sands money and advertisements to be taken down by the first clerk; I think I should have recollected it if I had.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever see him hand over any money? A. No, I am sure that on the 25th of March was before March - I do not know how long I was there the prisoner was the person I gave it to - here is his writing on the advertisement.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You charged him on the 6th of February? A. Yes, at Hatton-garden; but that is not now persisted in, because we considered these charged strong enough -I do not think there was any mistake made about it.</p>

            . I am the publisher of the London Gazette, and have my book here - I know the prisoner; I supposed he was clerk to Adlington and Gregory. On the 2nd of March there was paid for Matthews' assignment 10s. 6d.; there was nothing that day for which 1l. 0s. 6d. was paid - on the 22nd of March there were six advertisements for Adlington and Gregory, for one of which 1l. 0s. 6d. was paid - there was no payment of 2l. 0s. 6d. that day; on the 25th of March there were two advertisements from them - one is of "Leach and Leach," for which 14s. was paid; there is not any entry of 1l. 4s. paid that day - it is not the custom at our office to give receipts, they are scarcely ever asked for; I cannot recollect whether the prisoner brought these advertisements.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not the habit for other clerks to come with these advertisements? A. Yes, pretty often, and there may be clerks I am not acquainted with - other clerks might have brought these.</p>

            . I was a clerk of the prosecutor's.

            . I live with Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker, in Long-acre. I have a watch, which was offered in pawn by Bell one Saturday in April; he asked 6l. 6s. for it, and said if I pushed in the how it would play a tune - I did so, and found it repeated; I then thought he had not come honestly by it - I recollected there had been a bill sent round to stop such a watch; and sent for an officer - in the mean time I pretended to write him a duplicate, and asked what name he would have it put in - he said he would go outside and see; he went out, and I went to see he did not run away - he came in again, and told me to put it in the name of Worman; I had to go round the counter to look at him - he might have communicated with some person and I not see him.</p>

            . On the night stated, Bell was brought to the station on a charge of having offered this watch; I inquired whose it was - he said he supposed it belonged to a young man named Worman, who I gave it him; inquired his description, and sent an officer to fetch him; I showed him the watch, and asked whose it was; he said Mr. Vansitart's; I asked where the seal was - he said in his pocket; this is it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; I do not know what way of life the prisoner is in - I have missed property like this; I am certain the bag of nails had not been sold; I do not suppose I have sold half a dozen scythes within the last twelve months - we sell very few now; that hammer could not have been sold - it is an old one; I do not know the hand-writing of Mr. Freeman - he has never bought nails of me; I have discharged a shopman lately who I suspected had robbed my till.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>- CLARK. I am a boot and shoe-maker, and live in Northampton-street. I sold the prisoner a lot of goods some time back, and among them was a small hammer, similar to this - it was broken, but I think not so much as this; I should claim this as mine - I think it was about three months ago; I sold him goods to the amount of about 8l. - there were some axes and other things.</p>

             had his hat- I said I would see him home; I then saw the prisoner put his hand against his breast, and draw it away suddenly - I heard him say some words, the last of which were that he had his money; I then saw the Police-officer, who came, and took the prisoner - he gave him three shillings, one by one; the half-crown piece then fell - the prisoner took it up, and said he had more right to keep it as he was a friend of his - at last, with a great deal of persuasion, he gave him a penny - piece instead of the half-crown; several persons said it was a half-crown - the prisoner said so help him God that was all the money he had; the Police-man said if he would not give him the money he would take him into custody - he then took it from some part of his person, and gave it him, saying if he must have it he must.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner said at once that he had the money? A. He did; he was let off on bail before the Magistrate; but I was not at the first examination; I considered him sober - they said he had been drinking, but I did not believe it; the officer was there at the time he said he had his money, and he refused to give up all the money; he followed us with a great deal of abuse, in a very ridiculous manner.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor together; Gogay was holding up the prosecutor, who said he was robbed - I seized the prisoner with 5s. 6d. in his hand; the half-crown fell from his hand - he took it up, and gave me one penny-piece, and said that was all he had got; I said I had seen a piece of silver, but could not tell whether it was a crown or half-crown - he at last gave it me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he had the prosecutor's money, and he would keep it? A. He said he took it for fear he would be robbed - he was well aware that I knew he had it, as he did say something to the effect that he would keep his money, as he had as good a right to it as I had; I hardly knew what to think of it - I did not see him strike any body, but I believe he did strike two or three; he was a little gone I believe.</p>

The latter end of April, and I sold him one about the middle of March; I do not know the size of either of them - I am sure the one I made him a present of was the latter end of April; he required a bill, and I made out a bill for two hats bought of me, though I gave him one of them - it is about a fortnight since Mrs. Helsham came to me for the bill for two hats, and I gave it her; I made him a debtor for both the hats.</p>

               <p>- AMOS. I am a hat-maker. I have sold the prisoner hats on his own account, and generally sent them to No. 5, Norfolk-street - I sold hats to Mr. Perring, and generally sent them to No. 85, Strand; I do not know whether Mr. Perring knew the prisoner dealt in hats.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Has he bought a hat of you this year? A. No.</p>
               <p>- PEECH. I am a hat-maker, and live in John-street, Blackfriars-road. The prisoner has bought hats of me - I think he bought some in January last; one was delivered at his own house, and one he sent a person for- I do not know whether Mr. Perring knew that he dealt hats.</p>
               <p>J. S. THOMAS re-examined. I got the duplicate from his fob on the 21st of April; I questioned him as to the hat - he said, "It is all right, it is my own property;" Mr. Perring was in the shop at that time, and we were in the back parlour - the prisoner did not produce the duplicate himself; he said before the Magistrate that Mr. Perring knew he dealt in hats.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employ on the 10th of April; I had a hat with red leather, and the others had red silk in them - I saw that hat at twelve o'clock at night, when the shop was closed, at No. 85, <placeName id="t18300527-99-crimeloc536">Strand</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This is your own hand-writing? A. Yes; what was set down on the slate was rubbed out when I entered it in the book - the prisoner was sometimes there to read it to me; I do sometimes leave it for two or three nights - I cannot say whether it was left as much as a week; I might have been out of town, and then it must have been left - no one but the prisoner had access to that slate; it hung behind my desk- I had a porter, an errand-boy, and a work-girl there - the prisoner was not always present when I entered my accounts; I cannot recollect whether I took it down that Monday night or not; I might leave it till Tuesday - here are two hats marked C. sold on the Tuesday; the one to Mr. Wilde was not sold that day - it was paid for.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Should you know the hat again that was lined with red leather? A. Yes; I have seen it in the possession of Mr. Sharp - it was a guinea hat; I missed it about eleven or twelve o'clock on Monday, when I wanted to show it to a gentleman; I am sure I saw it on the Saturday night, and I had no account from the prisoner of the sale of it - he had no authority to sell my hats without accounting to me for the proceeds.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you inquire of the prisoner for it? A. No, I thought very likely it was in another place, and I might find it - the only hat I received a guinea for on the Tuesday, was one which had been previously supplied to Mr. Wilde.</p>

            . I am a groom. I went to Mr. Perring's shop for a hat; it was brought down to the stable to me - I said I did not like it, and the prisoner said, "If you will bring it back to the shop I will give you another;" and on Easter Sunday, the 11th of April, the errand-boy brought me another - on the Monday I saw the prisoner, and he said, "How do you like your hat?"

               <p>MR. PERRING. This is the hat which I looked for on the Monday; I had seen it on the Saturday - the prisoner had no interest in it; I have received no account of the payment for it; here is one hat sold by the prisoner on the 20th of March, for a guinea; one hat for 1l., one silk hat 12s., and another hat 21s. - I do not know who that was to, but it is marked W. P., another quality; the other one sold at 21s. was to Mr. Sheldon.</p>

I met the prisoner on the 21st of April in the London-fields, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and went to several public-houses with her; we then went to an empty house - I went to sleep, and when I awoke I missed my watch; the prisoner was gone, and the front window was open - I went home, and went to bed; when I got up in the morning I went with Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270047"/>Waters, to where the prisoner said she lived - I found her getting up, and charged her with having my watch; she denied it: Mr. Waters said he would pull the house down, but what he would have it - she then said she wanted to go out; he said he would go with her - she went to the door, and said it was under the tiles of the house; she gave him this watch, which is mine - I was a little the worse for liquor that night, and cannot say whether I gave her any money.</p>

Yes - I had about 6s. in money left the next morning; I had had about 18s. 6d. that evening - I did not take off my clothes in the house we went to; I had asked her address in the evening, and she said No. 6, Cooper's-gardens.</p>

It was an eating knife; I did not see them go into the field - it was grass; I could not trace footsteps there - four or five places had been turned up about six yards from where the property was found; I did not examine them - there had been some rain, but I cannot say whether it rained on the following night; there was some little rain on the Monday before we went to examine the footmarks; they went over the fence to where there was no road - the field is private property; persons there would be trespassers - I gave them leave to get worms; I lost sight of the prisoner for a short time.</p>

On Saturday, the 17th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went with Humphries to the field behind Mr. Antrobus' house; Harris was with us; I saw a part of the field where the grass had been moved - I raked the grass on one side, and found a silver pepper-box and some silver spoons, which I did not count - also a silver butter-slice, a centre-bit gimblet, and a small crow-bar; I delivered them to Humphries, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270050"/>put them into the hole again - I am not certain whether he put the whole back, he put some of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had it been raining that morning? A. I do not recollect; I only found one hole in the field at that time - I saw more places on the Monday following; my business lays on the premises - I think it was the week following.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Prince of Wales, Charles-street, Chelsea. On Friday, the 16th of April, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and Murless walking up and down Arthur-street, which runs out of the King's-road at the corner of the King's-parade; I watched them there for about a quarter of an hour - I saw them again in Arthur-street about ten o'clock that night, and again at eleven in the King's-parade; I only saw them there once. On the Monday morning I heard somebody cry out Stop thief! I was sweeping the front of our house - I ran, and followed them to the end of Arthur-street; I only saw one of them, that was Murless - I lost sight of him at the corner of Arthur-street(the prisoner had ran down Steward's-grove) - I returned, and on coming into Steward's-grove I saw Murless running again; I did not see Harper till after he was taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live in the same place now? A. Yes; I knew these men by sight and by name - I had seen them three or four years ago, but not since; I should consider myself a trespasser if I went to Mr. Autrobus' field.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 19th of April, after Harper's examination, his shoes were taken off; I took them with Harris to the King's-parade I compared them with the foot-marks at the back of several houses there; I do not know the numbers, but it was four or five gardens - not Dr. Whitsed's, as they had been raked out there; but in the next garden to his there was the exact impression of the shoes which I took off Harper's feet - also in the next garden, and three or four others; the impression was not so perfect as in the garden adjoining the prosecutor's, but there was the exact size to and from; the ground was dry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the ground appear to be newly raked in the prosecutor's garden? A. I cannot tell whether it had been raked since the robbery - I do not know the numbers of the houses; the marks in the gardens next the prosecutor's were more distinct than the rest, with respect to Harper's shoes; I only speak of his shoes - I speak of them from the size, and the patches in the shoe - it is a very particular shoe; there is a patch on one side, and that showed the impression on the ground - the mould would not show the nail marks, the ground was dry; the shoe is an ordinary size - I saw no marks of the patches distinctly except in the next garden; I think it was the right shoe; it had the heel higher on one side than the other, and I think the left shoe had a patch on the upper leather; the mould would fall and fill up the nail marks - it had not fallen into the impressions, they were on a bed in the garden; I suppose it had been raked over at some time or other - the mark was pretty deep, and appeared as if the man had jumped from the wall.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Saturday, the 17th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, I went into Mr. Antrobus' field with the gardener and groom; I first viewed the prosecutor's house, and traced footsteps into this field - I searched the field, and found a muffineer a pepper-box, two salt-spoons, a tea-spoon, a butter-knife, a silver label, two centre-bits, a crow-bar, two screwdrivers, and a gimblet; seeing some fresh mould in the field I got the gardener to rake it up, and found these things in the hole - I put the muffineer into my pocket, and the rest of the things into the hole; I showed the muffineer to the prosecutor, then returned it to the hole, and watched till ten o'clock at night - an alarm was given that somebody had come, but it was so dark I could not see; I took all the things away at half-past ten o'clock, and returned them to the prosecutor - I do not recollect seeing more than one place where the mould was loose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It must have been a pretty large hole? A. Not very - the crow-bar laid alongside, and was not in the hole; the screw-driver was.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I knew the prisoner Pullen for three or four weeks previous to the 24th of December; he represented himself as a solicitor, and used my house at times, On the 24th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw him in my parlour, in company with the other two prisoners - I had not seen them come in; I was called into the parlour, and Pullen said in a friendly manner that he wanted a favour, that he had two gentlemen with him, who were clients of his, that he had just recovered them a large sum of money, and had that evening received a cheque in part payment, and I should do him a most essential favour to cash it for him, as it was then too late to go to the banking-house - I asked the amount; he showed me this cheque (looking at it) it is for 42l. 10s. - I said No, I never kept so much money in the house; he then asked if I could not accommodate him with part - this was in the hearing of the other two; he said for this reason, that those two gentlemen were his clients, and the one a country gentleman was going out of town next morning - the country gentleman was next to him, and within hearing; he said if I could accommodate him with part of it, it would be the means of serving him most essentially - I returned the cheque, and told him I could do no such thing; he introduced the others to me - he said Taylor had been a most extensive skin-merchant in the City, and Sharp was a highly respectable country gentleman; I left the parlour - Pullen followed me to the bar door; the others were not then within hearing - he requested me as a friend knowing his (Pullen's) family to be highly respectable, to let him have as much as I possibly could afford, as it would make him look respectable in the eyes of his clients; I told him I had no money in the house, except what I had taken that afternoon, and should consult my wife, which I did, and agreed to let him have 3l. - he said it would make him look rather mean and low, as he was just commencing for himself, if he had not a little money about him, after recovering so large an amount; I went to him at the bar door, and told him I would bring him what I could afford; I asked him to endorse the cheque there, which he did - I went to the parlour with him; the two others were sitting there - I counted 3l. in silver into his hands, principally in half-crowns; they all three sat in an angle, and all leaned their heads over the table - Sharp sat in the corner; they had a conversation in a low tone among themselves - I then noticed Pullen's hands under the table, and heard silver money rattling; he remained there better than two hours; they came to the bar between nine and ten o'clock, and had a bottle of wine there, and afterwards another - Sharp then praised the quality of the wine, and asked if I had a stock, as it was in his power to recommend me several good customers - I proposed to show him the stock; he accompanied me into the cellar with one of the others, and seemed quite astonished at the stock - he said he would certainly recommend me some friends, who would perhaps take twenty or thirty dozen: we returned up stairs - I then stood a bottle of wine; after that was drank they each had a glass of brandy, and so much approved of the quality, they said they would have some to take home with them; Pullen had a pint of brandy, and he had pint of whiskey to treat the country gentleman before he went out of town in the morning - Taylor had a quart of rum, a quart of brandy, and I think, a quart of whiskey - I then asked who was to pay for what Taylor had, he being a stranger to me; I considered Pullen responsible for Sharp - Taylor seemed indignant, and said,"You have got plenty in your power to pay yourself," and referred to Pullen, who said when I received the cash for the cheque, I was to pay myself for whatever they had, and return him the balance; Pullen said his money was gone, for he could not pay for the bottle of wine - Sharp paid for his bottle of wine; they were then about to part - Sharp carried Pullen's bottles for him, as he had a top coat, and large pockets - Pullen told me to let the country gentleman and the skin-merchant (as he called them, he never mentioned their names,) have whatever they pleased; I was to be paid out of the cheque - they left about one o'clock at night; Christmas-day was on Friday - I saw Pullen at my house about two in the afternoon; another person was with him, but neither of the prisoners - Pullen said his money was gone, and I must oblige him with more; I let him have 2l. more - he left, and I received this written order; in consequence of which I sent my son with half a dozen of wine to Compton-street, Goswell-street, to see if it was correct, as I did not know the man who brought it - I made that man sign the order, and had a conversation with him respecting Taylor; Pullen was in the parlour at eight o'clock when my son returned, and while I was chiding my son for stopping so long, Taylor and his man came - Taylor was angry at my doubting his respectability, and asked why I should take his man to task in the manner I did, and if I had any doubt about him, to send my bill next morning and it should be discharged; that he had come on purpose to give me another order, but now he should decline it - I (in dread of losing a good customer,) appeased him as well as I could, and told him Pullen was in the parlour; I called him out - Taylor told him what happened about his man and the wine; the order was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270052"/>then on the counter - I showed it to them; Pullen said,"That is all right, let him have as much as he wants, and pay yourself" - Taylor then ordered another half dozen of wine, half a gallon of rum, half a gallon of brandy, and a quart of whiskey; he and his man took them away - Pullen staid at the bar at the time; Pullen had himself that morning half a gallon of brandy, half a gallon of rum, and a bottle of whiskey, but that I recovered - I sent it to No. 8, Winchester-street, which address he gave me on the cheque; on the following morning, (Saturday.) before ten o'clock, I presented the cheque at Messrs. Glyn's, in Lombard-street - it was refused as forged, not being

            Smith's hand-writing; I went to No. 8, Winchester-street, but saw nobody there - I found pullen lived there, but he was not at home; I saw a woman and a little girl there - I returned, and asked the bankers for the real Mr. Smith's address, which they would not tell me: on the following Monday I went with Birch, the officer, to a house in Fan-street, which my son pointed out, in search of Taylor; we got in after a little trouble, and I saw some bottles, which I suppose were what my wine and spirits had been in - there were no marks on them; I brought away a stone bottle, which I believe to be mine - I there learned Taylor's address to be No. 28, Compton-street, Clerkenwell; I went there, and found the house uninhabited - between five and six o'clock that evening Sharp brought me this letter - (read)</p>

               <p>28th December, 8, Great Winchester-street.</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - Whatever money I borrowed of you, or whatever I owe, in regard to my score, &amp;c., shall be paid in the course of this week, as I shall be in the receipt of a sum of money towards the latter end, and you may rely on my punctuality; you need not alarm yourself, for it twenty times as much it would be perfectly safe; I should have called on you yesterday, but I assure you the effects of Christmas had completely upset me - however, I will call on you no doubt this evening or to-morrow, and arrange with you to your satisfaction; I am obliged to go and attend to some business at the west-end of the town, or I should have seen you to-day. J. PULLEN.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURKE, in continuation. I had given Pullen credit for a few shillings besides the articles alluded to; the 2l. and 3l. was advanced to him on the cheque, which he represented as good; when Sharp brought the letter, he said he was a man of great respectability himself; that every day of his life he could command 100,000l., and if not his own money his clients had the command of it; I said I did not know he was in business - he said he was an agent and surveyor, and so highly connected, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was a particular friend of his; he said Pullen would call on me - I thought him a man of such respectability. I did not like to have any thing to do with him; that was my reason for not taking any steps, thinking I might get nothing for my trouble -I told him I was perfectly satisfied the cheque was a forgery, and I really thought he was concerned, and was as bad as the rest - I told him this on the Monday; he protested his innocence, said he was above such a thing, and he was sure Pullen would not engage in such a thing; that there must be a mistake in it, it could not be forged, and that Pullen would certainly call that night or to-morrow - I saw none of the prisoners after that till Saturday, the 8th of May, when I saw Taylor by St. Luke's church, Old-street, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>The order being read, was for half a dozen of port wine.</p>
               <p>(Signed) W. TAYLOR.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Pullen become pretty intimate with you? A. Yes - I have made inquiry about his friends, they are highly respectable; I have been personally known to them some years - he told me he had received the cheque from a man named Smith - that was the man he had recovered the money from; he endorsed the cheque at my request - I found the address correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say you asked the bankers for the real

            ? A. Because there was an acknowledged E. Smith at the bankers' - I did not ask Pullen for the drawer's address; I have stated all he said about the cheque - the prisoners were in my bar from about ten o'clock till half-past twelve; three bottles of wine were drauk, which I partook of; I had no whiskey or brandy- I may have tasted liquor with other customers; Pullen had run a score with me before - it was under 15s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Taylor and Sharp were strangers to you? A. Quite; I did not invite them into the bar - I did not ask them to endorse the cheque; Taylor himself said he was a skin-merchant; I drank with Taylor on the 26th of December; when I went to look for his house about twelve o'clock, I met him in Fan-street - I had been to the bankers at half-past nine; we had a quartern of gin among three or four of us - I paid for it, as I wanted to find who and what they were, and what steps to take; I had no assistance to secure him - I had no assistance when I did take him, but I was then in a place where I was well known; Fan-street is not a quarter of a mile from Old-street; I had not the slightest suspicion when I heard the silver jingling, but recollected it when I came to reflect afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure Pullen told you he had received the cheque from Smith? A. He told me distinctly that he had received it in part payment of money he had recovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say he had received it from? A. He did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Sharp. Q. Did you speak to me or I to you, after we left the bar and came into the parlour? A. No; you paid for your wine at the bar, but what was drank in the parlour was on the strength of the cheque; what was taken into the parlour was put down in my book to the credit of the cheque, but I did not serve that.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Sharp within hearing during all the transaction, while Pullen was telling you who and what he was? A. Certainly; he must have heard all that passed - he said nothing pro. or con.; the cheque was first presented to me in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You cannot tell whether you might not, some time before, have had another customer of that name? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you generally sign your name? A. Differently to this; when I sign cheques I put "Edw." and never a d at the top, which there is here - I generally dot the i; I am very particular in my manner of signing - I should not think it possible for this to be mistaken for my signature; it is not an imitation of my signature to cheques - the prisoners have had no opportunity of knowing how I sign.</p>

            . I live in Chapel-street, Shoreditch On the 28th of December I was a constable, and accompanied Mr. Burke to Fan-street, and to Goswell-street, On the 12th of May, in consequence of information, I accompanied Robertson, an officer, to No. 8, Great Winchester-street, about eight o'clock in the morning, and found Sharp standing in the front room, in his shirt and trousers; Pullen was in bed in the adjoining room - their beds were both in one room; Sharp asked me what I took him for - I told him he stood charged with felony, a capital offence, concerning a forged cheque which was passed to Mr. Burke; he said he knew nothing of it being forged at the time, nor till Monday, the 28th of December; he considered that Mr. Burke was doing extremely wrong, for he (Sharp) ought to become a witness, and if he was a witness he could tell me the particulars of the forged cheque passed to Burke, and several other forgeries; I asked what profession he was he said a broker and collector of rents, that he had then a suit in the King's Bench, and had several estates in the contry of his own, and was not at all afraid to meet the charge - the door between the rooms was open, so that Pullen could hear all this conversation; there is painted on the door-jam, "Sharp and Co's. chambers;" Pullen's name was not written there, but it might be up stairs; a young man came in afterwards, who Sharp called his clerk - he said, "My clerk will bring me some papers out," Robertson took Pullen.</p>

               <p>JOHN ROBERTSON. I was with Birch, and took Pullen in the back room, on the second floor; I told him I took him for the forged cheque that was passed to Burke- he said, "Oh, very well, I will get up and dress myself - I have a very bad foot;" I told him not to hurry - when he got up he said he had sent to Burke to ask him for his bill, and he would have paid it if he had sent it; I told him whatever he said would be given in evidence, and he had better say no more - he said he should take my advice; I found on Sharp several notices of trial and other things, bearing Pullen's name, as well as his own; and some brokers' tickets with Pullen's name as well as Sharp's.

I went to Burke's house to get a man to paint my name on my door, as Pullen told me several painters used the house; I had a glass or two of liquor in the parlour, which I paid the servant for - I fell asleep for some time, with my head on the table, and never heard Burke speak to Pullen or Taylor - as I was coming out by the bar, Pullen said, "Stop, let us have a drop," and we had some mulled wine - another bottle was had, which I paid for; but I never said a word about a cheque; I never saw it, nor did I know it had been passed till the Monday, when Pullen asked me to take the letter; he then said the cheque he had received had become a forgery - I said I knew nothing about a cheque; he said, "Well you were here, I hope you was not concerned" - I said I did not know a word about it, but I consider Mr. Pullen must have thought it good, or he would not have given it you, and what he had on it he will pay you no doubt - I stopped about two hours with him; he said he was very glad he had not met Pullen on Saturday, when he was in a passion, or he should very likely have given him in charge, and if he would return in the course of the week and pay him, he would return the cheque to him; I paid for what I had, and if I was concerned, why did I not order liquor as well as others? and if he suspected me, why not give me into custody then?</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURKE re-examined. When Pullen first showed me the cheque he was sitting in the parlour - he afterwards brought it to the bar; the conversation about it was partly in the parlour, and partly at the bar - what he said about his clients was in the parlour, and loud enough for them to hear; they were sitting together as close as could be, by the door, when the cheque was produced - he held it in his hand then, and I did not take it.</p>

               <p>Sharp. Q. When I brought the letter, did I not tell you I was a great money lender; that I lent money for other persons on mortgage? A. I do not recollect any such thing - he said he was a land agent, and could command 100,000l. every day of his life.</p>

            . On the 24th of December I was at the White Swan, Bunhill-row - Taylor was there; Pullen came in in a quarter of an hour - Taylor asked him if he could advance him some money on a cheque which he had got; Pullen said he had got no money - they were both nearly intoxicated; it was about five o'clock -Taylor then asked if he knew where he could get a few pounds on the cheque; Pullen said he believed there was a friend or somebody down in Shoreditch, where he would endeavour to see what he could do - Pullen asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270054"/>if I would go down there; I said no, that I had to go to Hackney, and the best thing he and Taylor could do would be to go to bed - after that, when I came from Hackney, I accidentally called in at the City of Carlisle, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, and saw them drinking whiskey and water - I said I was not found of whiskey; they said they were going to have some wine, but I did not stop.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known Pullen? A. Seven or eight years, and Taylor twelve or fifteen months - I believe Pullen gets his bread by the profession of the law; I work at the straw-hat business, and live at No. 18, Coburg-street, Euston-square, in apartments - I have no shop; I do not know how Taylor lives - I have seen him perhaps twenty times; he is no skin-merchant that I know of - I know Sharp by seeing him at Pullen's place in Winchester-street, about seven months ago; it may be his place, but not that I know of- Sharp's name is on the door; I believe they lived there together - Sharp is not a country gentleman of large property that I know of; he is a broker or something in the agency way - I did not hear of their receiving a large sum about Christmas: I understand Pullen and Sharp's chambers were distict - I believe they lived in the same room; I know

            * examined. Q. Take this cheque in your hand, you need not answer my question, and the account you give may be used against you another day; it is quite at you option to answer or not, it may affect your life another day - look at that cheque (does so), whose hand-writing is that " E. Smith," signed to that cheque? A. It is mine; I passed the cheque to Taylor, the prisoner - Pullen had no knowledge whatever of any fraud as to the cheque; I never kept an account at Messrs. Glyn's.</p>
               <p>*This is not the former witness of that name.</p>

             When did you sign it? A. The cheque was in existence on the 19th - it was post dated the 24th of December; I delivered it to Taylor on the 19th - I have known him about eight years intimately; we lived together for about three years - I was living with him on the 19th of December; he got his living in the commission way in the Birmingham and Sheffield trade - he has not been either very much distressed or very flourishing for the last three years; I have not been distressed particularly - he had no office as a skin-merchant while living with me; I once kept cash at Sharp and Sons, Smithfield; that was twenty years ago -Taylor knew my business; I am chiefly in the Sheffield commission trade, not in the skin line - I had some cheese to sell about Christmas last.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose cheeses? A. Am I bound to answer? I did not know Edward Smith, of Basing hall-street, on the 24th of December; I had no idea of such a person.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe, before you came into the witness-box, you received, from Mr. Harmer's clerk, every intimation and caution, as to the situation in which you stand? A. I did; I insisted on being heard as a witness, that innocent men might not be convicted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You first saw the coach two or three yards from the deceased, driving at a very speedy rate? A. Yes - I immediately called to the coachman; the coach was about the middle of the road - I am sure of that; I did not see the deceased come off the curb - he was about the middle of the road, as near as I could see; there was no other carriage near the spot - there might be some up at the Freemasons' tavern; the street was newly paved - I did not hear him call to the deceased to take care; I was too far off.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You swear he whipped the horses afterwards? A. Yes - I was twenty or thirty yards from the Freemasons' tavern, and could not see it where I stood; the carriage was coming along Great Queen-street - it happened three or four yards nearer to Lincoln's Inn-fields than Little Queen-street.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason - I was employed on the pavement. I first saw the deceased under the horses' feet; I had not seen the carriage before- after he was rode over, the horses kept going at a very quick pace, between a trot and a gallop; I and two more stopped them - I did not see the prisoner do any thing; he might attempt to stop, but I was not observing him -I was before him, trying to stop the horses; he might strike the horses without my observing him - they were going a good deal quicker than they ought; I cannot tell at what rate - Jacobs was taken into a doctor's shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Lane with you attempting to stop the horses? A. Yes - he was working within six yards of me, further from the coach than me; I was twenty or thirty yards from where the man was run over- the prisoner gave his card, and offered to take the man any where in his master's carriage.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the horses difficult or easy to stop? A. When the prisoner saw persons come before the horses, he directly pulled up - a man caught hold of the reins at the time he was pulling up; I heard a cry before the man was under the horses at all - I could not distinguish from whom it came; the cry was, "Take care of the man!" I rose my head, and saw him under the horses' feet - I heard nothing more before he was run over.</p>

            . I am a boot and shoe maker, and live in Queen-street. I saw the prisoner on the coach-box - he appeared driving at a quick rate, not such as a careful driver should drive at; I did not hear any cry out before this happened - my attention was called to the driver by hearing a carriage going as quick, or quicker, than I ever saw one - I cannot say at how many miles an hour; I saw it go over the body of the man - I then looked after the man, and not the carriage; it kept going on as far as I saw it for about twenty yards - I afterwards saw it had been stopped about forty yards off; I did not see the coachman make the slightest attempt to stop it - I do not think the pace at all slackened, but I did not pay much attention to it; the deceased was taken to a surgeon's - when I saw him he was kicking and plunging about, and in a minute he lay still, and was carried away by the mob.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your shop nearer to, or further from, Lincoln's Inn-fields than where the accident happened? A. Rather farther - it is six houses from where it happened; the Freemasons' tavern is nearer to Drury-lane - my shop is on the opposite side to Great Queen-street; there were a number of carriages at the tavern, waiting for some public meeting - I saw the man step off the curb, and was sure he would be struck down when he stepped off, for he could not escape, the carriage was going so quick; he could not have been above four or five steps from the pavement before he was struck down - I should say he was one-third across; the coach must have come three times the distance he did, in the time - he was not looking towards the coach, or he certainly would not have stepped off the pavement if he had valued his life; his head was inclined the reverse way - I was behind the coach when it happened; I saw the prisoner taken into custody - he offered to take the deceased any where in his master's carriage, but he had then gone to the hospital.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could any body who happened to be crossing have escaped from the coach? A. They might have escaped with difficulty, but this man was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270056"/>looking - the horses were trotting very fast indeed when I saw them.</p>

            . I am a japanner, and live in New-street, St. James'. I was standing in Queen-street, near the archway of Lincoln's Inn-fields - I heard a voice at some distance say, "Take care," and shortly after I turned my head, and saw the deceased lying upon his face; some person took him up - the coachman pulled up, I conceive, as soon as he possibly could; he might be from ten to fifteen yards from the deceased when he pulled up - I conceive that when two persons ran before the horses he was endeavouring to pull up, but had not completely stopped them, when they got in front and stopped them; I conceive the horses were not going more than seven miles an hour - it is a great thoroughfare, and there was a public meeting that day; I went over to assist the man, but there were so many round him - I mentioned that the carriage was Admiral Owen's, having seen it stand in Piccadilly, before the coachman gave the card; he gave his card when the Police-man came up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that he heard you tell whose it was? A. No - the horses were on the trot, and I conceive at a family pace; the horses appeared to be frightened after the accident, and I have no doubt forced themselves on - he appeared to do all he could to stop them; I cannot say who said, "Take care" - it was only one voice.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you observed at what rate the carriage went when it came down the street? A. I saw it before the accident; it seemed going at the same pace, and I thought began to slacken a little after it went over the man - as soon as he could he endeavoured to pull up, which was ten or fifteen yards further on.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was in Queen-street, and saw a carriage and horses about thirty yards from the deceased; it was going at about fourteen of sixteen miles an hour - it appeared an alarming pace; I saw the deceased run over; the coachman did not appear to slacken his pace before he was run over, nor attempt to stop his horses at all, till he was stopped by others.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you a judge of horses? A. Yes, I have been accustomed to them a long time; they were black like cattle - they were in a half-headed barouche, and going at a smart trot; I did not hear him call to the deceased.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the carriage was about thirty paces from the man, how long was it getting to him? A. Not many second - it probably was not a minute; I venture to say it was not half a minute - I call a pace a step.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was fifty or sixty feet off, and half a minute going, at the rate of fourteen miles an hour? A. Yes - he was going at a very smart trot; I was speaking to the deceased about three minutes before, three or four yards from the spot, at the corner of Little Queen-street - he was attempting to cross when I saw the carriage; he was just in the middle of the road when he was knocked down - the horses were about ten yards from him, when he began to cross; when he put his foot on the curb the carriage was about five or six paces from him - I did not tell him not to cross; I was not aware of the danger at first - I have every reason to believe nobody told him to take care.</p>

            , Esq., of Red Lion-square. I have known the prisoner five years; I was in Great Queen-street - I was talking to him at the Freemasons'-tavern, and observed to him that one of his horses was very cold and shivering; I have been subpoenaed on the prisoner's behalf - I saw the hind wheel of the carriage go over the man; before that I heard the coachman call out, "Hoy! take care;" I should think he was going at the rate of seven miles an hour, which appears a quick trot in the street - the street was crowded, on account of the stones laying on one side; the pavement was free for passengers - there was plenty of room to cross where it happened; I was about forty yards behind the coach when it went over the body - I could see he did not whip his horses, for I saw the whip hanging over his left arm; my attention was directed to the deceased - I saw him on the ground; I could not see whether he stopped the horses - I ran up, and saw persons round the horses' heads, about ten yards from where the man was rode over; I do not think it was more - when it happened I saw the horses make a bolt; they went quicker for a time, but I thought the coachman was in the act of pulling up - I could not see; I saw two men hold the deceased up, and went away - his head was four or five feet from the pavement; he was lying across the street, but did not lay right across the street.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What sort of a carriage was this? A. A half-headed barouche; it belongs to Admiral 
               <persName id="t18300527-112-person977">Tolmash</persName>
             - the box was fixed to the body of the carriage, which made it more difficult to pull up; the prisoner had driven off to exercise the horses - they were nearly thorough blood horses - seven miles an hour is a moderate trot for such horses; I am sure I heard the prisoner cry out, "Hoy! take care," and should think the man had time to take care of himself - the horses going faster was entirely their own act; I saw the whip across his arm till he was stopped - another man took possession of his horses; the bystanders would not let him drive the deceased to the hospital - he offered to give himself into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any luggage on the carriage? A. No, nor any body in it - the people wanted to pull him off the box; the man had time to get away if he saw the carriage - I saw him on the pavement; I saw him come down on the payment, but did not see him cross.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him at all in the road-way, before the carriage ran over him? A. I did not - I did not see him in the road before he was rode over.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you tell whether he had power to clear the carriage? A. I cannot say; the road is eight or ten feet wide in that street - the carriage was four or five yards from him, when I saw him on the pavement.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Theobald's-road. I was in Queen-street - the horses appeared going at a very fast rate; if it was possible to continue at that rate, I think they would go about twelve miles an hour - they were nine or ten yards from the deceased; I saw both the left wheels go over his head - the coach still continued at the same pace, till it was stopped - I cannot be mistaken; some labourers stopped it - the man was taken into a shop, and then to a surgeon's in Lincoln's Inn-fields; I stopped with the carriage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you in the employ of the witness Wilkinson? A. Yes; I had gone out of his shop rather before him, and was seven or eight yards behind the carriage when it happened - I was five or six houses off; I was rather confused, seeing the danger the man was in - the coach was nine or ten yards from him when he began to cross; the carriage was going at a terrible rate - the man might have seen it coming, if he had looked; I did not hear the coachman cry "Hoy! take care;" I was fifteen or sixteen yards off when it went over him - I had come from my master's door in the same direction as the carriage; I was about twenty yards from the door when it passed me - I was walking very fast: I was coming out of the shop, and saw the carriage coming by at a very furious rate, galloping - I swear it was galloping.</p>

            . I am porter to a gentleman in Great Queen-street. The first I saw of this was the coachman singing out to the man who was crossing, "Hoy! take care;" this caused me to look round - I was within ten yards of the coach, at my master's shop door; it was going at a smartish high trot, but I cannot tell at what rate; I saw the man knocked down - he was nearer the left side, leading from Lincoln's Inn-fields, than to the right, at the time the coachman sung out - he was knocked down in the middle of the street; the men who were at work stopped the coach twenty or thirty yards further on; I think it went quicker after the accident than before - my eyes were on the deceased - I could not see whether the prisoner struck the horses; I crossed over to my master, Mr. Jowitt, who stood at his door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What you saw was merely accidental? A. I think so - I gave this account before the Coroner and Grand Jury; I imagine that this was an accident - the prisoner called out "Hoy! take care;" I think it was impossible for the man to get out of the way then - he was about two yards from the pavement when the coachman sung out; he could not get across the road- I suppose he could have returned to the pavement, but he was agitated, and might not know what was best.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the coachman, in your hearing, call out to him till it was impossible for him to get out of the way? A. I cannot say; he could not in the direction he took - there were several carriages, but they did not reach up to that spot; they were closer to the tavern a good deal.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. At what distance was the coachman from the man when he called out to him? A. To the best of my belief he was within five yards of him.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw the man knocked down - the coach passed me just before; it was going at a sharp trot - I saw the man knocked down; he was three or four paces from the curb - the prisoner tried to stop his horses all he could, but some mason's held their hammers up - I did not see the labourers catch hold of the reins, and do not think they could do so without my seeing them; I cannot say they did not - I ran to assist in stopping the horses, and Mr. Hamilton, who I work for, went to assist the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is Mr. Hamilton? A. A lapidary - he was with me; the carriage passed me by Mrs. Cutmore's, nearly opposite Little Queen-street - the horses did not gallop at all, while I saw them; I never saw the coachman use his whip - the deceased was just stepping off the curb when I saw him, and I just then heard somebody cry "Hoy! take care;" I cannot say whether that was the coachman - if the deceased had drawn back one foot instead of going on, it would not have happened, in my judgment; he had a hat in his hand, and a bag on his shoulder - when the man was knocked down I think the horses plunged, and went on faster; it appeared to me a mere accident.</p>

            , (examined by MR. ADOLPHUS.) Q. Were you examined before the Coroner? A. Yes; I did not go into the Grand Jury room: I am groom to Miss Le Blanc, of Lincoln's Inn-fields; I saw the prisoner in Great Queen-street, eight or ten yards before the accident happened - the horses were going at the rate of six or seven miles an hour, not exceeding seven; they were trotting, and did not gallop till after the accident - I did not see the man crossing; I knew the prisoner when he lived with Lord Melville, but had not seen him for two years; as he drew up towards me, I called to him Jack - he took no notice of me, and after he had passed I heard a voice distinctly call out "Take care;" I cannot say whose voice it was - this drew my attention, and at that moment I saw the man under the horses; they made a plunge afterwards which threw the prisoner back in his attempting to draw them up; I think the carriage went eight or ten yards before it was stopped, but who it was stopped by, I do not know - the prisoner did not use his whip in my presence,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270058"/>either before or after the accident; he appeared to do his best to stop the horses - there was only room for one carriage to pass there, the street being under repair; when I knew the prisoner he was a humane, good tempered man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never heard of an accident happening before? A. Never; I heard "Take care" called twice - I did not hear Hoy! I did not know the prisoner's voice - I was not six yards from the carriage when it happened; I was behind it, but could see perfectly well what the prisoner did, it being a half-headed barouche - he threw himself back, pulling with all his might, to draw the horses up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him do his best to stop the horses - was that after the man was under the horses or before? A. After; the horses plunged when the man was between their legs; no man in the world could stop them.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. The deceased was brought there on a Thursday, labouring under three severe wounds on the head, one on the right cheek, and one on the left; he lived till the Wednesday morning - every care was taken of him; he died in the hospital - there was a very extensive fracture of the skull, which I have no doubt caused his death; his intellects were affected for the last two days - there was laceration of the brain; he had his full faculties till the Monday night - he never expressed that he was near death, nor did I tell him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You conversed with him several times? A. Yes; he talked rational till the Monday; when he came in he was perfectly sensible, but faint from the loss of blood - I was engaged attending to his wounds when he said something about the accident; I did not hear it.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he not in a most lamentable state from pain and loss of blood? A. he was; but was perfectly sensible - he gave an answer the first time, but the prisoner was agitated, and put the question over again.</p>

               <p>THOMAS, LORD RANELAGH. On the 17th of May I hired a boat, and took off my coat and waistcoat to row - I placed them and my watch in the bottom of the boat; the watch had been in my watch in the bottom of the boat; the watch had been in my waistcoat pocket - I took it out, and placed it under one of the benches; when I had quitted the boat a minute or two, I was told by Mr. Biddulph that my watch had been taken, and I saw the prisoner deliver the watch to him - he was not at all concerned with that boat; he had just landed a passenger from another boat.</p>

            , ESQ. I was with Lord Ranelagh, and saw the prisoner take the watch from the boat his Lordship had just quitted - he put it into his right-hand breeches pocket, got into his own boat, and was pushing off; I jumped in, and demanded the watch of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What distance was the boat you got out of from the shore? A. There was one boat between that and the prisoner's; his Lordship had quitted the boat perhaps a minute - there were eight or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270060"/>ten boatmen about the stairs; any of them might have seen the prisoner take it - the waterman was in the boat his Lordship had quitted, but his back was turned towards the prisoner. The prisoner had not inquired for the owner - he jumped into his own boat, and was pushing off; perhaps twenty minutes elapsed before the prisoner was taken - his Lordship had hired the boat at Battersea.</p>

            . I took the prisoner, and produce the watch; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>LORD RANELAGH. This is my watch; I had asked for my clothes; I was putting them on, and then I should have asked for the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had left the boat? A. Yes, and the man had given me my waistcoat out of it; I am a Viscount.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is common for us to step over one another's boats, and any one might have taken it; it is no place to lay a watch - it is as common as any place can be; I did not take it to keep it: I meant to make my boat fast and take it up to the stairs - when the gentleman asked me for it, I gave it him; had I been disposed I could have thrown it overboard.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I said Yes - he said, "I think I know who has your money - a man of the name of Joe;" I said, "No, he has not got it" - I took the prisoner to the watch-house the next morning; he gave me three sovereigns first, and then three sovereigns more and the gold ring - he made an attempt to run away; I took him by the collar, and took him and the money to the watch-house - I had never seen him before that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not come up to you that night, after you left the house, and tell you he knew who had your money? A. Yes - I was tired, and a little intoxicated, but not much so; I was sleeping in the public-house - there was a man named Benning sitting beside me, as he informed me, but I believe not next to me - there was a fiddle playing, and several persons were there; I did say that if the prisoner would make my money up within 1l., I would go away; I do not recollect seeing him there at all that night - I said openly that I had been robbed of my money; if he was there he had the opportunity of hearing it; I never said before the Magistrate that if he would admit the money was mine he should be let go - I did not hear that he was the person that night, or I could have taken him; I said to him, "How do you know I have been robbed?" and he replied, "I heard you say so in the public-house" - I do not remember seeing Mr. Benning.</p>

I went into the public-house, and saw the prosecutor sitting there; I saw the prisoner put his left hand into his right-hand pocket and pull something out, but I saw no money - I tried to awaken the prosecutor but could not - I had other business and left them; I had worked for the prosecutor once, and I knew the prisoner very well; I am quite sure I saw what I have stated.</p>

Yes, and he said he was innocent - that a boy gave him 6d. to pledge it; and as I was taking him to the station-house, he said a man offered him 1s.; he was dressed as he is now, but had a red handkerchief round his neck, and to the best of my knowledge a different waistcoat; he had no money.</p>

             NELSON re-examined. I saw the prisoner take the necklace from the child's neck; he ran down Great James-street - I think he had the clothes on he has now; I knew him by his face when I saw him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were there any other little boys? A. No; I did say he had a blue coat and striped trousers on - he has not them on now; I stood and looked at him, and then went and told Mrs. Cox.</p>

            . I live in Old Castle-street. I saw this little girl run into the road - I did not see any other person run; I did not see any boy in a fustian Jacket - I was with another young girl, and we were behind the prisoner and this boy, about a yard and a half; we walked with them till they ran - they had not left us till the girl cried Stop thief!</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you were all four in company? A. Yes - we were behind the boys; I was a little acquainted with them: I saw the shop, and heard the girl scream Stop thief! I saw no one run but these two boys - the market might be about five yards off; I saw no boy in a fustian coat or jacket - I ran as far as the market, and they ran round.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you state before the Magistrate that you did not know what money you had? A. No - I did not state you robbed me of 1l. 2s. 6d.; I was not all over mud - I had some mud on my coat tail - they did not tell me at the watch-house to go home and get collected; I had drank two glasses of ale and three glasses of wine- I went out early on business, and had not eaten any thing.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. On Monday, night, the 17th, the prosecutor applied to me, and on Tuesday morning, the 18th, I went down Mileend-road, between five and six o'clock - I waited for Stern coming out with his cart: he came out with two nose-bags on the shafts full of something, but I did not know what; a young man was with me - we followed the cart, and saw him drive up the yard of the Plough, which is in the road, with the nose-bags on the shafts - I told Ashford to go, and see what was done with them; he returned in about a minute, and said they were taken away- we then went after Stern as he drove towards Bow; we brought him back, and asked what he had done with what was in the bags - he said he had nothing in them; we went into the stable at the Plough, and in a bin we saw a quantity of chaff, bran, and beans, mixed - I sent to the prosecutor, who came and said, "If it is mine you will find some bits of paper wrapped up, with numbers and letters on them;" Rowe was present - he is the ostler at the Plough; we found four bits of paper in the chaff, and one in the manger, which Mr. Kemp's horse was feeding out of - Kemp keeps the Plough.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you brought any sample of chaff to satisfy the Jury that these papers were in it? A. No; I took them out, and brought them here - our inspectors told us to go disguised; we had blue coats on, not those we generally wear - when Stern came out of the prosecutor's, the bags were strapped on the shafts of the cart; the Plough is about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - I saw the bags were full; I cannot say what of - there were two or three persons when I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270068"/>these papers; none of them are here - Mr. Gardner saw me find them; I took up no one but Rowe - Ashford brought in another person, who I believe was charged with the offence - he was brought from the public-house into the stable; I took Rowe, because Ashford said he took the nose-bag off the shaft.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ASHFORD. I went with Mitchell from Mr. Gardner's to the Plough yard - there were two nose-bags on the near shaft: I went down the yard, because Mitchell was known - one bag was then gone from the shaft, and the other I saw Rowe take off and carry into the stable; I do not know where he put it - the cart was between me and the stable; a man came out of the stable with him, in a white frock - I then followed the cart towards Bow; this was about six o'clock or soon after - we brought Stern back, and then I sent Mitchell to take Rowe and the man in a white frock; he took Rowe, but the man in a white frock I could not be certain of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Mitchell you wanted a man in a white frock? A. Yes, but I could not swear to him - I did not take him into custody; I took him into the stable with the two prisoners, and set him down - when we were going to bring them away I put the handcuffs on the prisoners; I said I could not be sure of the other - I did not seize Perry: I called him out of the tap-room, took him by the arm, and said, "Now you go into the stable along with the rest;" I cannot say how long I detained him - I did not charge him as being the man who took off the nose-bag; I said he came out of the stable with the Ostler.</p>
               <p>Rowe's Defence. I think it a very hard case to be taken away, when I was taking off a bundle of tares from the man's cart - then Mitchell came and collared me; he demanded the key of the stable - I refused to give it, and they took it from me.</p>

            . I was at the Plough that morning; Ashford came and ordered me out - I had two bundles of tares to carry down into the stable; I took one, and called Rowe to take the other - I suppose that was the reason why I was seized; I was kept in the stable about twenty minutes - I said, "I will go and get my breakfast;" he said,"You stay there, and don't be obstinate;" he did not tell me he was an officer.</p>
               <p>Stern's Defence. When they came to me I was half a mile from the public-house - Ashford jumped into the cart, and told me to stop; he asked where my victuals for the horses was - I said in the sack; he then asked where the corn was that should be in the nose-bags - I said I had not put any in.</p>

I saw this plank safe on Saturday, the 24th of April; I' missed it afterwards, and having some suspicion, I got a warrant, and searched the premises where the prisoner lodged - I found this plank in a shed adjoining the house, cut in two pieces, and sawed again in the middle; it had been twenty feet long when we had it - the prisoner was taken on Monday, the 26th; he said he had found it, but did not say where - I had seen it in the gravel-pit on the 24th- there is no way through there: it cost me 1l. 0s. 8d., but it is not worth much now, as it has been used.</p>

            . I am constable of Heston. I had the search-warrant, and found this plank in the shed; and these irons, which were burnt out of it, were in a cupboard in the prisoner's house - I have matched them; they fit exactly - his house is about a mile from the gravel-pit.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up that Sunday morning, and went to a house where my mate lived, to help him dig up a piece of ground - I picked up this plank, and thinking it no more than fire-wood I threw it into my shed; if any one had come to own it, there it was; Mr. Hill found it neither locked up nor concealed - it is a public shed, which forty persons pass in a day.</p>
               <p>MR. HILL. It was in a shed, and the pieces were set one against the other, and an old board wider than this set before them - there is no road only to where he lodged.</p>

On the 22nd of May I saw the prisoner looking at a fender outside my house - I was engaged, and could not go out then; when I had served my customer, and went to the door, the prisoner was going away, with it under her arm - she had gone ten or twenty yards; I asked what she was going to do with it - she said she had bought it, and was going to take it home; I said, "You have taken it from my house;" she denied it, and would not let it go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took it in my hand with no intention of stealing it; I had got very much intoxicated, and took the fender - the prosecutor came and took me, and so did the Police-man: I lost a half-sovereign out of my hand between them.</p>

               <p>JAMES HUMPHRIES re-examined. I suppose she had got at least ten yards; she had the fender under her arm- she walked pretty well, but from her language I think she was more tipsy than any thing else, as I told the Police-man. GUILTY.</p>
               <p>The indictment further charged that the prisoner had before been convicted of felony.</p>
               <p>- LINNEY. I was present at her trial on the 9th of July, 1828; she was found guilty of stealing two decanters, the goods of Benjamin Brooks, and was confined one month in the House of Correction - I am certain she is the person: I produce a certificate of her conviction.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This is a sixpence that, I dare say, you would take for your wages if it was offered you? A. I should be very sorry to take one like it - it is clear enough that it is bad; there are lumps on the edge of it - it would not impose on me for a moment; I consider it in that rough state that no one would take it - a solid piece of metal was found in my presence, also more plaster of Paris; a tea-cup and teaspoon, with plaster of Paris in it, and eleven more sixpences - one man could easily carry the things; the thing the fire was in, could he carried into the room, but not in the state it was then in - I took it off with the tongs; it could have been lighted after it was brought in - I went to the house in consequence of information.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know they were brought there a very short time before, by the person who gave you the information, for the purpose of getting a reward? A. I do not - I have known the person who gave the information for several years; he is a bricklayer and plasterer - he had never given me information before; I promised him nothing, nor did any body else to my knowledge - he is a poor man; I saw him about a week ago - I found nobody but the prisoners in the room; I had seen the man, who gave the information, looking out of the window not many minutes before I went in; he gave me a signal out of window - he was quite able to carry the things there; I know his name, and where he did live - when I looked through the crevice, the male prisoner was examining the sixpences; his wife was nearly opposite - it is a small round table; I never saw them before, and cannot say they live there - the man who gave the information had spoken to me about it in the early part of the day, but did not tell me where the place was till the afternoon, it might be two hours before; he had been in the company of Goodson during those two hours; I saw him part of the time - I became acquainted with him by living in the neighbourhood where he was brought up; I was a patrol of the parish before I joined the Police - I do not know where the informer is now; he could have been here, no doubt.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. I accompanied Phillips and the other officers to the prisoners' room - we could see between the door and door-post; I looked through there, and saw the moulds on the table, and the money piled up by the side - the man appeared to have some money in his hand; the woman stood against the table, and seemed as if she was rubbing a sixpence with a piece of paper - she returned it to her husband; he looked at it, and then appeared, by the movement of his hand, to put it on the others, which laid by his side - I assisted to break the door open, and tried tosecure the woman, but could not at first; she attempted to strike Phillips -I kept her from doing so, and she cried out, "Oh, you villains!" the man said, "Oh, I am done!" and seemed much affected; the woman put her hand on the table, and struck the moulds off; one fell at her feet - she stamped on that, so that it was all powder; the other fell against the fender and broke - I saw Phillips pick up a sixpence from the powder under her feet, and one or two pieces of metal were taken up with the sixpence -Phillips picked up part of the mould which fell against the fender; it was put together afterwards - he kept it in his possession; I saw it again when I went to Mr. Field's to have it put together - this is the same (looking at it) - I searched the male prisoner, and found on him six good sixpences, and one had one, which I produce; I found in the cupboard a tea-cup with plaster of Paris in it, and a metal tea-spoon which stuck to the plaster of Paris; it appeared to have been watted - I produce a mould, which I found in the iron pot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Suppose that sixpence was paid you in your salary, I dare say you would hand it back again? A. I should certainly - I should know it was not good if I examined it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose any body had paid you a number of half-crowns, shillings and five or six sixpences, and this was one of them, and you just looked at it among others, should you take it? A. I should take it if I was not to examine it, or if I only examined it in the ordinary way among others.</p>

               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. You think this might impose on you in common circulation? A. Yes - if my attention was called to it I should see that it was bad, but not without; if it was offered to me casually I should take it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say that with ordinary care, looking at it as you ought at money, that you should take it? A. Yes, if it merely passed from one hand to another I should, and so might any one looking at it with ordinary care, taking it with more money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a person named Bradford? A. No; nor Rose or Pope - I was desired to go to the house by the inspector; I did not myself observe a man at the window - we were not all exactly together; Phillips or Dove informed me when to go in - we might be a yard or two apart; I knew I was going about some coin, and was informed we were to have a signal -I heard so while we were walking there, and before we went in; we did not find the man who gave the signal in the room, nor meet him on the stairs - one person could carry all the things into the room; I am not aware which way the man went out - we went up gently and found nobody but the prisoners in the room; I did not hear the informer's name, and was not acquained with him at all -I was merely fetched from the station to go with the officers; I believe my brother officers saw the man looking out of window - I have seen a man who I was told was him; he came to Phillips - I saw him with Phillips about an hour before we went to the room, and he walked before us; I do not remember in what street he left Phillips - it might be half a quarter of a mile or a quarter; Phillips followed him at about twenty yards distance, but when they turned the corner I did not see them - Phillips came back to us without the man, before we went to the house; that man could not have put the thigns on the fire - I cannot say there was any thing to prevent his putting them on, and lighting the charcoal afterwards; he might be absent from us about three quarters of an hour, out of my sight - I did not speak a word to him; I do not know whether he was to be paid any thing - I was told he was to accompany us to the house; he was going towards the house at the time he left us - Phillips left us at the same time; I did not go to the house for an hour after Phillips returned to us - the man was then out of his sight.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe a man looking out of window? A. No; he might have been there - I had not seen the informer that day; I went with the other Police-man - I had been with Phillips for about three quarters of an hour; no man came up and spoke to him to my knowledge - Phillips did not follow a man who had been speaking to the Police-man, while I was with him - if any one has sworn so, he must be mistaken.</p>

               <p>Q. You never heard of it till now? A. Oh Yes, we heard it that morning before we went to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you swore it was by accident you went to the house? A. It was accidentally that we happened of them - we had received information in the morning, but that was not in the evening; I say we went there by accident - we did not know whether we should have it right then or not; I saw the man in the morning on my beat - I did not hear him give the information; I did not speak to him - I saw him afterwards at one o'clock, and he spoke to me; he did not give me the information - he was walking about, and I was on duty; he was not an acquaintance of mine - he had been speaking to somebody before; we went accidentally whether we should light on this man or not.</p>

Yes - we went to the house at five; I have not seen the man since, and do not know who he is - he did not tell me to be there at five; we went accidentally - I did not know he was to have been at the window to give a signal; I never heard a word about a signal till now.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Under whose direction did you act? A. Phillips.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GUTTERIDGE. I occupy the house, No. 30, Lower Northampton-street. The prisoners came to lodge there in June last, and have been with me in the same room ever since till they were apprehended - it was the second floor front room; the woman paid the rent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a man there the day they were taken up? A. Yes - I did not see him look out of window; I saw him come out of the door, and had seen him go up - I understood he was an acquaintance of theirs; I saw him there four or five times in the course of a fortnight, and had seen him that morning - the Police came in, I suppose, a quarter of an hour after he went out, but I saw him go in again with something in a jug, and shortly after the Police-men went up stairs he came to the door from the back-yard; I have not seen him since - I always supposed the prisoners to be well conducted persons.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. What size was the jug? A. A blue jug, about a pint - he had something in it, but a handkerchief was thrown over the top of the jug, as he had it in his hand; he had nothing more in his hands.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would not that crucible go into the jug? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin, I had two counterfeit sixpences produced to me at Hatton-garden, which I compared with the broken mould which has the obverse impression - this is the mould;(two sixpences handed to the witness,) neither of these correspond with that mould - (looking at another mould) I apprehend this is a counterpart of the other; the two from one mould - these two sixpences are a different impression altogether; I compared two sixpences with the mould at Hatton-garden, which corresponded in every respect - here they are; these were cast from the mould - they are not completely finished.</p>
               <p>Q. These two correspond with the mould? A. Yes - they appear to be the two that were produced at Hatton-garden; I observed a small indented mark under the neck, and I think I can distinguish a similar mark on the obverse side of the mould - I have compared the sixpences as accurately as I can, from the broken state of the mould, and believe them to have been made by that mould; there is a small part of the impression left on the reverse side, and that fits the counterfeit sixpences exactly - these two sixpences yet want their finishing; to the best of my belief they were formed by this mould - the eight counterfeit sixpences are from a different mould altogether; the good sixpence is of the same pattern as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270073"/>the two counterfeit ones produced - it is dated 1816; the two first that I saw corresponded with the eight - one of them appears to be completely finished; I should say the other was not finished, and should doubt whether it would be taken - it is in a very rough state; the two which fit the mould are not fit for circulation - the eight are all unfinished; they want something removed from them, which points out that they are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing them to have been put into circulation, would they he rejected at once? A. Certainly, common observation would point out that they were not finished - the two corresponding with the mould would be rejected by the most common observer; the one that is finished has the rough edges taken off.</p>

               <p>The mould upon which this indictment was framed was the one alluded to in the last case, and which was found by the fender in the officers' search; the witnesses gave the same evidence as in the former case, except that Phillips, on his cross-examination, stated that the informer had been in custody for uttering counterfeit coin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past four o'clock on Saturday afternoon the man, Skinner, came up and asked if I would let him do a job in my room; I said I did not care - he wore a jacket, with great pockets inside and out- he pulled out the charcoal in a small bag, and said,"Will you lend me a saucepan to burn this charcoal in?" I said I did not care - he asked if I would have some beer - he went out, came in with a pot with a handkerchief over it, and said, "I have not brought the beer, but something that will fetch you a good deal of money;" I said, "I will have nothing to do with it" - he said,"Well, I will go into the yard, and fetch them directly;" he had scarcely got down stairs before the Police-men came up - I was looking at them in my hand, and was so, confused on their entering, that I dropped them.</p>

             - I am certain of him- they have the prosecutor's name marked on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a stranger to you? A. Yes - we frequently have such things pawned; he came into the last box, which is rather dark, with his hat over his eyes, and stood rather back, but I took them from him myself, and noticed him, as he asked for 8s.; I could not give that, and gave them back to him; he was about ten minutes in the box - it was between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. DYMOCK. I know these seven table-spoons by the crest; I missed them on the 7th of May, which was the day he left - he used to sleep in the house; the other things are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he come into your service? A. On the 9th of May, 1829, and left me on the 7th of May, as he was apprehended that day on this charge, at my complaint - I believe Tomlinson lived in the service of the person who preceeded me in the chambers; I bought the sheets from him - the plate was about in use: the female prisoner attended the chambers three or four months ago - I employed her as a laundress till within three or four months of the 7th of May; I once gave the prisoner a coat, but not the one produced - I had a good character with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You occupy one set of apartments? A. Yes, one floor exclusively - I sleep there; Smith slept in the garret, which I rent with the floor.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. Mr. Dymock called his property over; I took the rest of the plate down to him, and he missed this - I explained to him; I said I had no suspicion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270074"/>of any one except it was Tomlinson - I asked her if she had pawned it; she acknowledged that she had, and said as soon as she received her money from her employer, she would fetch it home - I returned, and told Mr. Dymock she had pawned it, and refused to give me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>MR. DYMOCK. He did not at first attempt to throw the blame on Tomlinson; he said she had a hand in it - he brought me down the plate, and examined it with me: I said nothing to him - he hegan by saying he had given it to Tomlinson himself to pawn - that she had pawned it, and she had the duplicates, and that he had part of the money for it; I had him apprehended that day - I did not mention this before, because I considered it a confession made previons to his having any idea of my having him apprehended - it was quite voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Smith. I knew nothing of the criminal conduct that was going on, till the property was called over; if I had a mind to be a rogue a few days before, I could, for I brought money from the Bank to him.</p>
               <p>MR. DYMOCK. I have sent him three or four times to the Bank for 20l. or 30l. - I had not given him notice to leave me; I suspected he had made away with plate, and ordered him to bring it down, which he delayed for a day or more, and then made this confession.</p>
               <p>Tomlinson's Defence. I did not receive them as stolen- every bit of plate that I pawned was brought at different times to my house; I was to get so much for it, and Smith used to wait at my house till I returned - he would never take the duplicates, but always the money; the next time he came he said he wanted to buy a pair of boots; I received every bit of the plate from his hands; and he had the money - I have been a mother to him; I mended his clothes and boarded him when he had not a shilling.</p>

            . Tomlinson lodged at my house; I saw Smith bring the five spoons there - I think it was in April last; he brought them up to the second floor front room, and put them on the ironing-board; Tomlinson was gone to the Temple; I went into the room, and took them in my hands - I sighed, and said, "Ah! I have been in possession of as much plate as this;" I am sure these are the spoons - he left them on the table till Tomlinson returned - he went out, and told her sister, who was in the room, that Tomlinson knew what was to be done with them; I said they were such plate as I used to have; the sister said, "Oh, they are brought here to be cleaned."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was this from Lincoln's Inn-fields? A. Not far; I knew Smith as the prosecutor's servant, but had no suspicion, as she said it was to be cleaned; Smith was at the house three times on the day he was taken.</p>

On the 19th of May, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, I was on London-bridge, going into the Borough; I am sure I had a handkerchief in my outside coat pocket when I left home - I felt a motion, turned round, and it was gone; I did not see the prisoners - my handkerchief was produced by the officer of the bridge; the Police-man had stopped the prisoners, and brought them to the watch-house; the handkerchief has no private mark - I know it by the wear and pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You seem rather to doubt about it - you had no private mark on it? A. No; it is not an uncommon pattern - there may possibly be another like it; I had used it a few minutes before, and was particular in putting it into my pocket, having been robbed twice before on the same spot - neither of the prisoners were in custody when the officer spoke to me: they were brought to the watch-house in about five minutes - nobody but the officer stated they had seen this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You felt your handkerchief go? A. I felt that I had lost it; I did not distinctly feel my coat moved.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 19th of May I was on London-bridge, and as I was pass<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270075"/>ing, I saw the prisoners both close behind Mr. Harris -Hall was in the act of trying Mr. Harris' pocket; I stopped and crossed over the bridge - I lost sight of them while I crossed; I looked over, and saw Mr. Harris feeling in his pocket - I went up and asked if he had lost his handkerchief; he said Yes - I told him to stop; I went after the prisoners about twenty yards further on - I seized Hall, left him with Bowler, went on, seized Brown, and brought him back, took him to the watch-house, and Bowler produced a handkerchief, which Mr. Harris claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Hall trying the pocket, and Brown in his company, was there another person between them who could have done the act? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You lost sight of them? A. Yes; there was a great crowd on the bridge - persons might have intervened while I was crossing, or the handkerchief might have dropped on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. I have heard it said you are a preventive Police, why not try to prevent the robbery, instead of putting the County to the expence of the trial? A. I always understood we were to apprehend criminals; I suspected them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think a job at the Session would be a good thing for you? A. No, I did not - I know if they are found guilty I shall have my expences; it depends on circumstances, whether I shall have the expences if they are not found guilty - it depends on good evidence; I cannot say how much I expect, for I never received it - I know none of the Police who have had expences at these Sessions: I have been a Police-man four months - I was never at Clerkenwell; I gave evidence at Kingston, and got 7s. a day there - I cannot say what I expect here; it depends on my Lord's pleasure, whether I get any thing - I cannot saw how it will be: I may be mistaken about the amount I got at Kingston - I received 1l. 12s. altogether there; I said I got 7s., but did not say "a day;" I mentioned 7s., because you asked what I got a day - I did mean that I got 7s. a day, but I may have made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think your expences depend on whether the prisoners are found guilty? A. I cannot say which way it will be.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you believe if the prisoners are found guilty you will have your expences, and if acquitted, you will not? A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What, do not you? A. What my Lord put to me; I cannot say whether I shall have them, if they are found guilty - I do not expect them if they are acquitted, nor if they are found guilty; if I say I do, you will say I came on purpose for them - it is left to my Lord's pleasure whether I have them or not.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know whether you expect any thing or not? A. I said just now I could not ascertain that: I do not expect the expences if they are found guilty - I have come here for the sake of pure justice; I do not mean to apply for the expences.</p>

            . I am an officer of London-bridge. I was standing on the middle of the bridge and saw the Police-man running, he had hold of Hall and gave him to me, and then went after the other; I had not seen either of them before - I took Hall to the watch-house, and found the handkerchief on him; Mr. Harris claimed it - I asked Hall where he got it; he said he had found it - the Police-man immediately brought Brown in; all he said was that he had seen Hall pick it up - I asked him what he was going to do with it, and he said any gentleman should have it who owned it, that he had picked it up; I had found it inside his shirt - his waistcoat was half unbuttoned.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Brown had not heard Hall's story when he said this? A. No; the bridge is always crowded from nine o'clock till eleven, with people as thick as they can walk - I do, and I do not expect my expences: I do not think about them when I come here for justice, and do not care whether I have them - I expect them.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you search Hall on the bridge? A. No, because it would cause a mob - I found the handkerchief in his breast between his shirt and body; it was an open shirt - nobody was in the watch-house then.</p>
               <p>Hall's Defence. I was going over the bridge, and on the turn of the bridge I saw a handkerchief lying: Brown was just before me - he attempted to pick it up; I took it up and put it into my bosom - he asked what I meant to do with it; I said if any gentleman owned it he should have it directly.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was about the centre of the bridge and saw the handkerchief lying - I was going to take it up; this young man took it up - I asked what he meant to do with it; he said to give it to the first gentleman who owned it - I went on, and the Police-man seized me.</p>

            . I am a constable of Portsoken ward. I was in St. Paul's church-yard about twenty minutes to six o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another one with him - I had seen them together a little time before this happened; they stopped at Harris' window, then went to Ludgate-hill - I went and stopped at the window myself; they came back - the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's left hand pocket; there was nothing there - he then made a motion to his companion, who put his hand into the prosecutor's right hand pocket, and pulled the handkerchief a little way out; then the prisoner put his apron up, and they took it quite out between them; I called to the prosecutor and caught hold of the prisoner; he dropped the handkerchief from his apron - I caught hold of the other, but he got away; Mr. Billett owned the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is most all false that he has said.</p>
               <p>MR. BILLETT. The handkerchief corresponds in pattern and appearance with mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Is there not more handkerchiefs than one alike? I was passing this picture-shop and saw a mob looking at the books and things, and had not been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270076"/>there a minute before the constable caught hold of me by the shoulder: another young man stood by my side, but I knew nothing of him - a handkerchief laid on the ground; he took hold of the young man, and let go of him instantly; he walked away, and he never called Stop thief! after him or any thing.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HORTON PULLEY. I am a solicitor, and live at Hackney. On the 13th of February, about a five o'clock in the evening, I was passing through <placeName id="t18300527-157-crimeloc854">Dalston-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. You knew this to be her husband's house? A. Yes, he lives with her - I should think about the same quantity of turnips had been taken from the heap that was found in the bin; I believe they put them there to feed cows.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What length of time elapsed between your first and second going in? A. Perhaps a quarter of an hour - I went up to Hackney, and back again directly.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Laycock. On the 13th of February I went with the carts; we were coming from Essex - I missed Bishop and Wood at Dalston-rise; there were nine teams in all; I rode back, but could not find the men - I could not detain the teams on the road - I drove them home, and on examining I missed one bag from Bishop's and one bag from Wood's team - I then heard the men were in the watch-house; these are the nose-bags; I can particularly swear to this one - it belonged to Wood's team; the other I cannot swear to, but it is the same as our bags are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you venture to swear that is the bag that Wood had that morning? A. Yes - I saw it filled that morning; each man has his own bag.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see it again? A. On that day with the turnips it it, and on the Monday.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you notice the particular bag of each carter? A. Yes, and if any other man had taken this I should have known it in a moment.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. That niece was there? A. Yes; I should think she was twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH D - . I was there, and asked the prisoner how she managed to get these turnips: she said her niece bought them during her absence, and gave 4s. for them - this was a little after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the niece say so? A. No. - the prisoner went to the office, and went away; she has surrendered to-day - I had a warrant, but could not find her.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took Clark on the 4th of May, on the complaint of the prosecutrix, because I understood she had been in company with Coleman - the prosecutrix came to me at half-past five o'clock, and gave the same account she has to-day; she knew Coleman by name, but not the other - she described their persons; Clark said she knew nothing of it, and very willingly went to find the prosecutrix - I went in the morning, but as I was a little too late Clark had been discharged; I had then found the prosecutrix, and went and took Clark again - the prosecutrix then said she had been robbed, and Clark was the person who was with Coleman; she had told me so before, but did not know her name; I took Clark to the Thames Police, and the next morning Coleman's mother came and spoke to Clark- I heard Clark say, "Perhaps, if she could have the money she would make it up;" the mother said she would go and see if she could find her - I thought if I followed the mother I should trace out Coleman; I went - she went into a house in Gravel-lane; I went in, and asked if Mrs. Coleman had come in - they denied it, but I went up stairs and found the mother and daughter; there was nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Coleman. That woman said at the office that she lost fifteen shillings; she stood godmother to my child - we all got intoxicated, and I took the watch from her for safety.</p>

I did stand godmother to her child the same day, and after we left the church I bought this shirt, and a seal for my husband's watch, for which I gave 6d. - they called for a quartern and a half of gin, and I paid 7d. for it; I had a pint of beer - I swear I was perfectly sober; we were not long with the priest, and he scolded her very much - we went between four and five o'clock with the child.</p>

I had a brother named James; he lived at Deptford in 1805 - he was married in April that year, but I was not present; I saw the prisoner before the 23rd of April, and heard from her and my brother then, that they were about to be married - and from her mother likewise; her mother's name was Savage - she had a second husband; I heard from the prisoner, and my brother likewise, that they were married at Lewisham, in Kent; after I understood they were married, I called on them in a little street down Butt-lane, Deptford - that was about the 12th of May following; I saw them in their own room, and in bed together - that was when my brother told me he was married; I said as he had made his bed so he must lie on it, and not to trouble me as he had done - I breakfasted with them; I remember their living together about six months, but I believe they were longer together - they passed as man and wife; I saw my brother in March, 1820 - this signature in the register is his writing.</p>

A sawyer; I was called on in April last to give information, and I went to Mr. Waite's, the attorney, to give information - I have not received any money nor any thing else, nor the promise of any thing but what the county allow; I lived at the corner of Great Eastcheap and Crooked-lane in 1805, and my mother lived at Chiselhurst - it was about five o'clock on the 12th of May, 1805, that I saw my brother in bed with the prisoner; I will swear it was in May - I cannot exactly say the day; about six months after his marriage was the last time I saw my brother, till March, 1820 - I never stated he was dead in the interim; I never got any thing by representing him as dead - I heard upon casualty that he was dead, but never heard he was drowned; I have never seen him since 1820 - he may be dead; I did not know

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you yourself married since? A. Yes, in 1819, at Islington; the person I married died in 1827; I do not recollect seeing the prisoner between 1819 and 1827 - I left her in 1814; I heard she had had a child - the child was with her; I did not appoint any meeting with her after 1819 - I called on her occasionally in Buckingham-street; I gave her money, but swear I did not receive any from her - she was keeping a bad house there I believe; I believe I stopped two days once, and slept with her, but this was not while my wife was alive, it was in 1828; I cannot tell where she lived in 1826 or 1827, or when she began to live in Buckingham-street - I believe it was in 1828.</p>
               <p>Q. From 1814 to 1828 had you not been in correspondence with her, in connexion with her, and living with her? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did it fall? A. Close at his feet; there was another person passing at my right-hand, but I saw the prisoner passing it behind him - it had been on my left side when the prisoner was close to me; I secured him, but did not take notice of the other, who walked off quick - it is most improbable that he could have robbed me.</p>

            . I live with my father, in Green-street, near the prosecutor's. On Sunday, the 25th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was talking with Sampton - I saw the prisoner take a knife out of his pocket, and cut the prosecutor's cow; he ran up the court, and I followed him - I saw him go into a public-house; when the prosecutor came, he said he had been cutting his cow - he said, "I have no knife;" he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said nothing about a knife till the prosecutor said he had been cutting his cow? A. No; I stood at the door of the public-house, and saw him go in - I did not see him throw the knife away; I think I must have seen if he had - he was in the tap-room about ten minutes; I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the handle of the knife? A. No, only the blade; it was a pen-knife - the cow was cut down the neck, between the horns; I had not been in that cow-house - the door was not open; it leads into Green-street - the door was bolted inside, but the prisoner put his hand through the bars - he did not speak to me.</p>

            . I live in Green-street, Theobald's-road. On the 25th of April I had a cow, which I saw safe, half an hour before the witness called out that it was stabbed - it had no cut, or mark, or blood, on it before; there was no nail, or hook, or any thing in the cow-house - it is all iron bars, higher than the cow can reach; I went to the public-house, and found the prisoner in the tap-room - I got the officer, and we took him to the watch-house; we there charged him with it - he did not deny it, but said he had no knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? A. No, I never saw him before; I cannot tell bow he came to do this - there was a good deal of blood; I washed the cuts, and sent for a cow-doctor - one cut was six inches long, and very deep; no part of the cowshed is wood but the roof, which the cow could not reach - there was no wood before the cow; the little girl said he was the man - I did not search him; I was in a flurry - I left him for ten minutes, while I got the Police-officer.</p>

            . I am a cow-doctor. I was called by the prosecutor to see his cow, on the 26th of April - I found one cut, from six to eight inches, on the top of the neck, and one about an inch long, which was not through the skin; the wound on the top of the neck was very near the pith, but it was cut the wrong way for the pith - it was a cut, not a stab.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you did not see any blood? A. No, it was merely a scratch not half-way through the skin; it was done with something sharp - the cow was not injured, and did not require attendance; I was not sent for till Monday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could it produce any considerable flow of blood? A. I should think not much - I dare say there was a little.</p>

Yes, except where the creases are - I do not know how it was; it was only half cut through on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270082"/>Monday - I only found a key and a comb on the prisoner - the prosecutor only asked him, in my presence, if he had cut the cow, and he denied it; there were eight or nine other cows there, but this was the only one he could get at - he was three parts drunk; I found no knife.</p>

            . I was standing in the middle of the room of my house, opposite the public-house - I saw Carney get up to the cart, take out the bag, and hand it to Bryant; Bryant came and threw it into the corner of my room, and said, "Let it be, you shall have part of it" - I said, "It shall not be here;" I went out, and told what I saw - I knew the prisoners very well; they both ran away at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you on good terms with them? A. We never quarrelled; I knew them by sight- I never said to either of their mothers, "I have got them into a hobble, but if you will give me 20s., I will not appear;" they laid the money on the table, but I never received it.</p>

            . I am a printer. On the 20th of March I was coming from the house I lodge in, and the prisoner asked me to take this coat to Hall and Murray's, to pawn - I took it to my sister, who pawned it about nine o'clock that morning; I saw a coat of the same colour afterwards, but I could not swear to it - the prisoner had been an occasional customer at the public-house where I lodge.</p>
               <p>MR. MURRAY. My young man received the coat in pawn; we received orders to attend at the Grand Jury, which we did, but the prosecutor was not there, and they discharged the bill - we did not think it necessary that my young man should attend again; we attended on Friday: we have not had another notice.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. The pawnbrokers have done every thing they could to prevent this prosecution - I served them with three notices to attend, and when they knew I was not there, they attended, and got the bill thrown out.</p>

On the 10th of April I was introduced to the prisoner in Blackfriars-road, between seven and eight o'clock - we walked down Holland-street, into Green-walk; the person who introduced me said, "This is the man;" he said, "Very well" - he gave me a parcel containing some base half-crowns; on the 19th of April I met Goff and Myers, by appointment, at the Plough in Carey-street, between four and five o'clock -Goff searched me in the presence of Myers; I had nothing; Goff gave me sixteen good shillings - I went into Carey-street, saw the prisoner, and went with him into <placeName id="t18300527-189-crimeloc1013">Grange-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who has accommodated you with those gentlemanly habiliments to come here? A. My own labour; I did not appear against Bishop - I was never convicted in my life; I have a brother - he does not go by the name of Bradbury of Pope; I never went by the name of Howard or Dunn - I have known Mr. Powell five or six years; I was employed in one case before, four or five years ago - I get nothing except my expences; I appeared against a person of the name of Phillips and another; I never was abroad - I do not know that I ever was at the Coach and Horses, Mutton-hill; I never had a case against me - Goff asked me to detect a man in selling bad coin; a man named Bill introduced me to the prisoner - I never saw Bill till the 8th of April; the officer brought him to me at the Angel - I do not know that his name is Brathwaite; I was never at the Mint with him - I do not know that I have a relation who has been transported: Goff was by when I bought the parcel of the prisoner - I suppose I was searched to see if I had any money; I have heard the word tush before - I heard Bill use it - I never used it; I have seen bad money in Whitechapel, and other places - I never was a smasher; I have in my hand a little book, in which I sometimes write - here is the prisoner's name, but nothing else respecting this; I would rather you did not look at it- Goff has known me ten or eleven years; he first knew me by taking a person for robbing my house - Bill was there when I bought the money, and when the prisoner was taken up; he then ran away.</p>

            . I am an officer, and live in Union-street, Lambeth. I have known the witness several years; as far as I know he is a respectable man - I employed him to assist me in taking the prisoner; I contrived to have him introduced to him by a person named Bill - I went with Myers to the Plough, on the 19th of April; I saw Rose there, and gave him sixteen good shillings, after I had searched him to see that he had no other money; he left me - I went into Carey-street and watched him; the prisoner joined him - they went into Grange-court; I saw them in the court - the prisoner came out, and went towards Chancery-lane; Rose came to me - we went to the Plough, and he gave me this paper, which I have in my hand, with twenty-four bad half-crowns in it - he said there were twenty-six; I gave them to him to mark, and have had them ever since - a man named Simmonds was at the Plough on the 12th of May, when the prisoner was taken; I had given Simmonds 8s., to buy twelve half-crowns of the prisoner, but he was intercepted - when the prisoner was taken, a pocket-book, a knife, and some good money were found on him; I received from Lee at that time, four crowns and four half-crowns, which are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What Police do you belong to? A. I am a constable of Lambeth; a young man informed me that he knew a gang of coiners - he is a person in a respectable situation; I do not know that ever he was transported - he introduced Bill to me; I never gave them any thing; I will swear I do not know of their having any thing but the purchase money - I do not know that Bill has been in the Mint - Bill was present on the 19th of April, and on 12th of May; he is not here - I do not know where he lives; he did live near John-o'-Groats house, in the neighbourhood of Blackfriars-road - I have been there several times; I was there three weeks back -I did not take him before a Magistrate; I trusted to the witness - I sent for the witness because I knew him, and knew he was trustworthy; it is common to search persons, and I did not like to omit it - I went to the Mint, and saw Mr. Powell, about the 4th or 5th of April, a day or two after I received the information; I had seen Rose once before in the case of Lipman and Phillips, in 1825 - I do not recollect being present at the trial of a man of the name of Bishop, when a man of the name of Rose was a witness - I do not know a person named Bradbury; I know Pope - he was the man that robbed Rose, and he was tried and transported for seven years; that was the first I knew of Rose; he did not go by the name of Rose that I know of, nor Howard - Pope and Rose are not the same: Pope was a young fellow. I employed Rose because I knew he was offered a bribe and would not take it; I did not see the prisoner give Rose any thing - I passed the end of the court; Bill went into that court with the other two - I depended on Rose to give me what he received.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Where was Pope convicted? A. At the Newington Session; Rose and his wife prosecuted- I believe Pope was a lodger of theirs: I found some of articles.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you sent Rose up Grange-court did you keep your eyes upon them? A. I passed the end of the court so as to see they were together - when they parted Bill went away, and Rose came to me.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist. On the 19th of April I went with Goff to the Plough, in Carey-street -Lee went with us, and Simmonds, and a person named Kemble; Goff directed me to go to the bottom of Grange-court - I saw Rose searched by Goff; he had nothing -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270087"/>sixteen good shillings were given to him; Rose went out. and shortly after we saw the prisoner go up to him at the corner of Grange-court; they went up the court, and soon after Rose came to us, and brought a parcel of money - I saw him part with the prisoner, and he came directly to us- when Rose came he produced twenty-four half-crowns, wrapped up in paper. On the 12th of May I took the prisoner with twenty-four bad half-crowns in his hand; he was dealing with Simmonds, and I ran up and seized him, while he was counting twenty-four half-crowns -Kemble was with me: I took the prisoner to the public-house, marked the half-crowns, and gave them to Goff; as we were going along the prisoner dropped a parcell at my feet, from which I had seen him take the twenty-four - a woman picked it up, and gave it to Lee; she said the man in the white jacket dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been at this kind of work? A. Ten years; I have been parish constable and my time is up; Goff came and informed me of this - I went with him; I was not employed by any body - I went with Goff to the Mint, to tell them we had the bad money; we did not get any thing from the Mint, nor any where else; Bill was no acquaintance of mine - I have seen him since this was in hand; I did not know him before - Rose is a respectable man; I have known him a great many years - Bill was with Rose on the 19th of April, when he went to the prisoner; we did leave Bill and Rose together - they were gone about three minutes to buy the money; I do not know whether there was time for Bill to have given Rose this money - I was not present when they turned up the court.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and did work at a stone pottery. I was with Goff and Myers nt the Plough on the 12th of May; I was employed to deal with the prisoner for bad coin - I was searched, and received 8s. - I went into Carey-street, and saw the prisoner; we went into Grange-court, and he asked what I wanted - I said a dozen; he said, "What, a dozen tush?" I said Yes; he put his hand into his pocket, and counted them out - Myers came round the corner, and said, "Halloo! what have you got here? you are a wholesale dealer;" he took him while he was counting the half-crowns into his right hand - Myers took them; I do not know how many he had counted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you labour last? A. For Dalton and Watts, at Lambeth; they are potters - I swear I worked for them about a month ago; I am not acquainted with Rose or Bill - I knew Mr. Goff twelve years; I never did a job of this sort for him before - I did not know Bill but by name; Goff introduced me to him to make a purchase of the prisoner - Mr. Goff came to my house that morning, at No. 2, Sander's-street, Lambeth-walk - I do not know where Bill lodged; I met Myers, Rose Lee, and Bill at the public-house - when I went in we had something to drink: we drank there for about five minutes' Myers paid for it - I think Bill and Goff had some - Bill and I then went out, and went with the prisoner down Grange-court; Myers was at the top of the court - I should think he could see; the counterfeit coin came from the prisoner's pocket: as I hope to be saved, and upon the oath I have taken, it did not come from Bill's - I have not seen Bill since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say Myers was by? A. Yes, Bill was with me when I received the money from the prisoner - Bill was a friend of the prisoner's, and of Goff; I received the money from the prisoner - no one saw it but Bill; I kept a butcher's shop for many years in Union-street, Lambeth - I have done business for Mr. Bartram, in Lock's-fields, and Mr. White, in the New-cut; I was not surprised when the officer came to me to do this - I considered I was doing my duty; I did not deny before the Magistrate that I had received the sixpence of Goff - I never told the Magistrate that I had received no money; Bill took me to the prisoner on that occasion.</p>

            . I employed Rose to deal with the prisoner - I was with Myers and him at the Plough on the 5th of May; I gave Rose 16s., after searching him - he quitted me; I watched him into the street, and into Grange-court - he stopped there a short time, came out, and went to the Seven Stars, on the opposite side of the way; he said there twenty minutes or half an hour - I saw the prisoner meet him in the street; Bill went into the public-house with him - I saw the prisoner in there as I passed the window; Rose came to the Plough, and gave me this money, which he marked - I have had it ever since; Rose had no counterfeit money when he went out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was the first person Rose went to when he left the Plough? A. To Bill - he went with him; I saw Bill give a signal to Rose - Bill is not a convicted utterer of bad coin; I do not know that he has been transported, nor do I believe it - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270088"/>know that he has been in custody; Kemble introduced him to me by Newington-causeway - Kemble was not present on the 5th of May - nor on the 12th; he is in a respectable situation in the India-house; he is well, but has nothing to do with this case - I do not know that Bill was ever in the India-house, or that he was tried for a robbery at the India-house, and convicted, or that while he was in prison he robbed one of his fellow-prisoners; I sent Rose, because I would not trust him - I searched Rose, because it is customary; I took off his hat, robbed him down, and felt his pockets; if I had been searching a thief I might have searched a little closer.</p>

            . On the 5th of May I was at the Plough - I saw Goff search Rose, and give him sixteen good shillings; I soon after saw Rose and the prisoner join, and go into Grange-court - I was at the Plough when Rose came back and brought this money; I was at the apprehension of the prisoner at his own place, in Plomtree-court - we went and found him there; the room was searched, and behind a tea-caddy I found a great number of skeleton keys - I went with Brand into the cellar, where we found a great quantity of money; we came up to the room, and asked the prisoner whose cellar it was - he said he knew nothing about it, but they had the use of it, and went there for water; we found some gloves in the room half-burnt, and some shapes for moulds and sand paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the transaction on the 5th of May? A. Yes, except when they turned into the court - I was not able to see what was done there, and I cannot tell whether Bill was with him all the time, as he left us in the court; Bill was introduced to me by another Bill, whose name I believe is Kemble - Bill and Rose were together when they left the Plough, and they went together to the prisoner's in Grange-court; Bill was a little behind - Rose said he had given the good money to the prisoner; we did not take the prisoner then, because we had others to take, and if we had apprehended him first, the others would have got off - the news would soon have flown; I have not tried to find Bill - I saw him, I suppose, a week ago: I did not tell him to come here; he might have come here if he chose.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where is Bill? A.

Having reason to suspect all was not right, on the 27th of May, I marked two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, and sent them by my brother to Mr. Leach - I remained up stairs while Leach came to the shop and purchased some articles; I came down immediately he left, and told my brother to give me the money out of the till - I examined it, found two marked shillings and a sixpence in the till, and no more marked money; neither of the half-crowns were there -I sent for an officer, and the two half-crowns were found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner was very confidential with you? A. I liked him as a <rs id="t18300527-192-deflabel1026" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Then you owe him nothing? A. Yes, a promissory note; he holds my promisory note for 70l. - he was in business for himself, and I bought articles of him which were not exactly saleable, and gave him this promissory note till I was able to sell them - this was about three months ago; he could not sell his goods, and came into my employ - when the note is presented I will pay it; I never asked him to enter into partnership with me - I know Mr. Jordan; I deal with him, and owe him about 400l. - the prisoner was in his service, but went into business for himself on leaving him; I sell mercery goods, and Jordan is in the mercery line - Jordan did not threaten to call in his debt, if I did not get rid of the prisoner - I knew the prisoner in Jordan's service; I cannot exactly say how long he was in business for himself, perhaps about three months - I did not apply to him to come to me; he came because he could not get a living in business.</p>
               <p>Q. No doubt he got ready money for you for his goods then? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the audacity to swear that? A. I bought a few articles of him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the goods you gave the promissory note for? A. I have the greater part of them now - I paid him ready money for little things when he was in business; he gave me this little assistance with his goods, because I am a poor man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not say you was ready to pay the promissory note? A. Immediately it is presented it shall be paid; if I have not got the money friends will assist me - there were several half-crowns found in the till; I did not count them.</p>

            . I am porter to Lord Bath. I let the prisoner in at the front door a little before seven o'clock in the evening before the plate was missed; the area gate was locked at that time, and I had the key - he went down stairs, came up, and spoke to the steward very soon afterwards; the plate was kept down in the pantry, where all the servants apartments are; he went down again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he came up again about eight o'clock, or it might be a little after; he was down stairs perhaps three quarters of an hour, but from the confusion I was in I cannot say, for Lady Bath was very ill, and I had so many inquiries to answer; she died soon after - he said he had heard about a situation at Lady Malmsbury's, and was going to decline it; that is all the conversation I had with him - he went out about that situation, and came back in about a quarter of an hour; he said he would not go, but should give it up, and take his chance - this was about half-past eight o'clock; he the staid till near half-past nine - he remained with me in the porter's hall all that time; I was busy, and he sat very quietly in my chair - I thought he was asleep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him go away the the last time? A. Yes, I let him out; he had sat in my chair all the time - there were a vast number of inquiries at the door while her Ladyship was ill; sometimes we had gentlemen and servants to the amount of two hundred in a day - he declined going to Lady Malmsbury's, as it did not suit him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had the two hundred persons who called any thing to do with the area gate? A. Nothing; the area gate was locked at five o'clock, and the key in my possession - that was the custom of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the key hanging up, or in your pocket? A. It hung up - I was never out of the hall; he could not have taken it without my knowledge: the area gate and hall door are the only entrances - the pantry is nearly in the centre of the house; I was confused, as I had to take the names of the persons calling, and enter them in a book - nobody was let in but by me - I know the servants had no visitors that night.</p>

            . I am boy in the steward's room at the Marquis'. On the 21st of April, about seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in the pantry in which the plate-closet is - nobody else was there; that was where he used to be when he was under-butler - I was merely going by the pantry, and saw him there; he was standing with his back to the fire, with a card in his hand: I saw him again in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, coming in a direction from the area - he went into the pantry again; I did not speak to him - I saw him up in the hall rather better than half an hour after, when dinner was over; I saw no more of him - I had no conversation with him, except asking how he was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are a great many servants in his Lordship's house? A. Yes; they were waiting at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270091"/>dinner, which was not then over - the under-butler cleans the plate.</p>

            . I am under-butler to the Marquis of Bath. On the 21st of April, after seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner on the landing of the stairs leading from the servants' apartments to the porter's hall; I had put the plate into the strong-closet on the afternoon of that day; but that which has been stolen I had cleaned, and put into the closet on the morning of the 21st, and on the 22nd, in the evening, I missed sixty-one silver plates from the strong-closet in the pantry - none of them had been used at dinner on the 21st.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were they so placed that a person going to the closet would necessarily see them? A. It is rather a dark place - unless a person goes in to put something by them, or on purpose to look for them, he might not see them; they had not been taken out for the use of the family - I saw the prisoner again about half-past seven o'clock, coming in a direction for the area door; Freeman was in the dining-room at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have succeeded to the prisoner's situation? A. Yes; I am accountable for the plate - I have lived fourteen months with the Marquis, and four years in this country: I was with Lord Ravensworth before I went to the Marquis - I am a Scotchman; I cleaned the plate on the Tuesday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and put it into the strong-room - it was missed on Thursday evening; I saw it safe on the Tuesday night, but not on Wednesday; there was nobody in the strong-room on Wednesday - I was going from the pantry to the dining-room; the strong-room is kept locked, and so is the pantry - the key was left in the pantry door; it was the custom to do so, but there was a private spring on the pantry door, which no stranger could open; I was about an hour laying the dinner cloth, but was up and down continually during that time - I was about an hour attending at dinner, up and down; I might be up stairs ten minutes or a quarter of an hour without going down.</p>
               <p>Q. How then can you say nobody could have gone into the strong-room? A. There was nobody down stairs but the prisoner and the maid-servants; I saw him at one time when I came down - I cannot say a stranger might not have gone down.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course the blame of losing the plate rests on you. and you will be glad to throw it on any body else? A. Any body I should suspect.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you steal the plate, or know who did it? A. No; the male servants were waiting at dinner - when the area gate is locked there is no way to the house but through the front door; the strong-room is large enough for a person to go into, and turn himself round - it is stone, and the door iron.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which of the servants have business in the pantry? A. I, and the footman who comes in after dinner, and assists to wipe up the things; it is my business to put plate away; I leave it in the pantry at night, and lock it up in the morning - the pantry door was fastened with a secret spring; the servants' hall, the kitchen, and pantry all have doors.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You succeeded the prisoner fifteen months ago? A. Yes - I never quarrelled with him; I did not know him till I came into the service.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he visited there daily from the time he left? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How soon did you tell the steward? A. About an hour after; the prisoner was not the man - he was dressed in a brown surtout coat; he was a perfect stranger.</p>

            . I am coachman to Dr. Warren. On the 21st of April I was on the box of the coach just opposite the Maquis' area gate, which was on my right hand, about ten o'clock, or a little after; I had set Dr. Warren down at the house, and did not move away - I saw a man stoop down, lift something in a cloth over the area gate, and go away with it; it was inside the area, and the man was outside - I did not see any one inside the area; I did not see what was in the cloth, but thought I heard a slight jink just as it came over the gate - it was the sound of plate or metal I should suppose.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. This was at ten o'clock or after? A. Yes - the man was not so stout as the prisoner; I think it was not the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Friday, the 28th of April, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, which Patmore pointed out - a woman was there who said she was the prisoner's wife: I saw a great many glasses on the sideboard, and seized six, in consequence of what the steward said - I afterwards went with the steward to Lord Henry Thynne's at Roehampton, and apprehended the prisoner; I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing the Marquis of Bath's plate and also some glasses - nothing was said to induce him to confess; I cantioned him to say nothing to me that might hurt him hereafter - he said he knew nothing about the plate, and that he had bought the glasses; he mentioned some place, and said his wife bought some of them - we came to town in my chaise; the steward and him were in conversation, and I heard him say to the steward, "If I must tell you, I did take a part of the glass;" in consequence of that I again went to his lodging, and brought away in all thirty-six glasses - I left about a dozen plain ones behind; there are seven different patterns here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you hear all the conversation between him and the steward? A. Not the beginning of it, but to the best of my recollection the steward told him the maker could swear to the glasses - his wife was at home when I took away the six; I left her there, returned in the evening, and still found the rest on the sideboard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had him in custody all the time? A. Yes - I did not tell his wife I was going to apprehend him.</p>

               <p>"I did take part of them" - these are such glasses as were in the Marquis' possession, and to the best of my belief, every one of them are his; they are exactly the sort of glass I missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not tell him he had better admit the fact to you? A. Nothing of the kind - our coachman tells me he has visited the prisoner once; he told me where he lived - I do not suppose he would know the glasses if he saw them; he never waited at table - when the officer brought the six away, I told the prisoner's wife that every glass belonged to the Marquis, to the best of my belief, and she said her husband bought them; I brought away one of each pattern; part of them were bought of Mr. Brumsley, and part of Mr. Naylor - they were made to my order by an exact pattern, which I have kept for the last eleven years; I always furnish a pattern to have them made by, except this one, which is quite a new pattern in his Lordship's stock - here is one pattern I never saw any where else; these two goblets are Mr. Brumsley's pattern.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You brought away one of each? A. Yes: here are two large goblets, four of these, six of another, and six of each pattern wine glasses; they are the exact pattern we use - I give out the glass.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you not forced to keep up the stock of glass at your own expence? A. No; I never paid for a glass; the servants are never called on to pay for broken glasses - there is not an allowance made for it; I would not live in such a family - when I want glass his Lordship desires me to get it, and he pays for it.</p>

            . I am a glass-dealer, and live in St. James'-street. I supplied the Marquis of Bath with some glass; here is one pattern of goblets of which he had two dozen, on the 26th of March, 1829; and on the 11th of July four dozen goblets similar to this pattern - I had sold the pattern before; there are no more patterns which I can identify - I sell wine-glasses, such as these, but did not supply them to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These are not a new pattern? A. No; I supply many noblemen, and have sold a great many of this pattern - I can swear these came out of my shop, but not that I sold them to the Marquis of Bath.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You sold the Marquis two dozen of one, and forty of the other? A. Yes - I never sold the Marquis such glasses before; these cut tumblers are about 30s. a dozen, and the goblets 36s. - one pattern of wines 18s., and the other 20s.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MRS. PATMORE. Q. What floor did they lodge in? A. The first - I have gone in and out of their apartment, and so have their friends; I do not recollect Lord Bath's coachman coming to see them - these glasses were always on the sideboard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long had they lodged with you? A. From the 6th of March - they had only one room, at 5s. a week, and furnished it themselves; the sideboard is a shelf in a recess by the fire-place - they slept and lived in one room; I did not observe whether the glasses increased or diminished after they came - I was not often in the room; they brought the rent down to me generally.</p>

            . I live at Kennington - I am not in business, I was in service; I was in the brokery line in the New-cut about six months ago, (about Christmas,) and sold the prisoner some glass of this kind, to the best of my knowledge (looking at a tumbler) - I cannot say how many I sold him - I think I sold him glasses like these two wines.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have now fixed on three patterns - take one; how many did you sell him of that description? A. I cannot say - I keep no books; I was only employed as a servant - there is no mark on the glasses; they are patterns I was in the habit of selling, and had generally in the house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In what line are you now? A. In the book line - I live in Clayton-street, Kennington; I buy books at sales, and sell them - I keep no shop; I was servant to a broker nine months ago - his name was Laurence; he lives in the New-cut now - he knew of my selling these glasses; he is not here - I left him at Christmas - I was in his service nine months ago, and left him six months ago - I had been in his service three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what do you mean by being his servant nine months ago? A. I was his servant for three years, up to about six months - I left about Christmas; there has been no glass like this brought to me since this inquiry - I was not before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know you could swear to any glass to-day? A. I was subpoenaed to attend, and speak to glass which I sold him; I could tell the pattern of every sort of glass I have sold for these twelve months - we sold a great many; we bought them of the maker; these large ones were bought of a man named Lazarus - we bought glass of that pattern of him, and the same quality; he lives in Houndsditch - we used to give about 2s. 6d. a pair - I sold them for 3s. 6d. a pair; I am not acquainted with the prisoner - they found me out by going to Mr. Lazarus to enquire for his servant; they did not know my name - I sold him glasses three or four times, but how many I cannot tell.</p>

            . I am an headborough of St. Luke's. About eight o'clock on Sunday morning, the 23rd of May, I was coming up Golden-lane, and saw a crowd at Cow-heel-alley; I went up, and saw Archer crying and bleeding at the mouth; she complained of having been ill-treated, and her handkerchief taken off her neck; she went with me, and pointed out the prisoners running down the lane - I followed, and lost them in Playhouse-yard; I took Dockerty in half an hour, and in half an hour afterwards I took Carlton at her mother's - she said they were the girls; Carlton told me at the station-house that she had not got the handkerchief, for a girl named Burke had it - I went to Burke, found her in bed, and the handkerchief in her room.</p>
               <p>Carlton put in a written Defence, stating that they had quarrelled with the prosecutrix, and the handkerchief had come off her neck and was picked up by the other girls.</p>

On the 16th of March I asked the prisoner up to breakfast - he said as Mr. Sutherland was stopping in the house he preferred dieting with him, as he was only going to stop in the house a few days; I had given Sutherland apartments in my house. I asked the prisoner on the 17th for some oil of lavender; he pointed to a drawer in the shop where it was kept - I did not go to ascertain if it was there, as he was out when I first wanted it: we had some conversation about alterations in the shop that afternoon, and he suggested to me the propriety of locking the door between the shop and parlour every night, to prevent the shopmen handling the medicines in the shop. On the 18th a person called for citron ointment - the shopman reported to me that there was none; I told Marshall of it that evening - he said he thought there ought to be some, but where it was he could not tell; he always intimated to me that he was going to leave on the 18th, and as he did not quit, I asked him next morning why he had not, as I had a young man coming that day: he said he should quit directly, and would endeavour to take apartments to remove his things - the 19th was Friday; I had invited Sutherland and a friend of his to dinner that day - they did not dine with me; I had seen Sutherland and the prisoner that morning having private conversation over the counter - Sutherland had no business in my shop then; this excited my suspicion, and about dinner time that day my servant gave me information - the prisoner attempted to remove his trunks off the premises that day (19th) - I told him they should not be removed till Mr. Sutherland came home, and I had an explanation with him about the things I missed: Sutherland came in between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, and I told him what had taken place - the prisoner was not present; about six o'clock in the morning of the 20th, on hearing a noise when in my bed-room, which is over the surgery, I went down, and found the prisoner and Sutherland there together; I had had the prisoner's trunk conveyed into my shop the night before, and know it was there then - the prisoner and Sutherland applied to me for the chest, and observed that there was no property in it belonging to any body but the prisoner; I said I would not give it up - I desired the prisoner to leave the house directly, and Sutherland observed that as I had allowed him to have apartments in the house, he thought it very hard he could not have a friend there: finding I would not give up the trunk they called down Mr. Davision, a friend of theirs, and the three began to threaten me, saying I had no right to detain the trunk, and endeavoured to alarm me; I was determined to keep the trunk till I got advice how to act; they went for their adviser, or some attorney's clerk, or something of that kind.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. By threatening, you mean they threatened legal proceedings? A. Yes; a Mr. Rolph came and had a conversation with the prisoner - Sutherland and Davision, as I suppose, but I did not hear it; Sutherland and the attorney came down to my parlour - the attorney asked on what ground I detained the prisoner's chest; I said on suspicion that some of my property was in it - the prisoner was not present; Rolph had come down stairs from where the prisoner was, and demanded the trunk -I refused to give it up, and immediately after breakfast had a Police-man called in - when Rolph came down to my room there was an acknowledgement that there were drugs in the chest, but the prisoner was not present - the officer came, a smith was sent for, and the trunk opened; I do not think I asked the prisoner for the key - it was opened by Sutherland's direction; the prisoner was not present - in the trunk were found forty-seven different articles, drugs scales, weights, and things; the scales had been mine, and my shopman can prove they were in the shop - I had seen such things in the shop, but I had taken a very casual survey - I cannot say that any of the drugs had been in the shop; there had been citron ointment in a large earthen pot with the name painted on it- that had been removed from the shop, and put into the trunk there was oil of lavender found - I had asked the prisoner for oil of lavender; he pointed to a drawer, and said it was there - I went to the drawer afterwards, and there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever given him or Sutherland leave to take these things? A. During my engaging with Sutherland he said, "In case of my requiring any little medicine for my own personal use, I hope you will let me have it?" I answered if he would point out any thing he wanted he should have it - neither he nor the prisoner had ever asked me for any; the prisoner left the house -I went in search of him several times, but could not find him; I at last had Sutherland taken up and taken to the watch-house, and the prisoner appeared at Bow-street by Sutherland's desire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. So you took up Sutherland for robbing you? A. Yes, for aiding and assisting in stealing the drugs and things contained in the schedule - he was discharged, and has brought an action against me since; when he was taken up the prisoner was sent for on his behalf - I cannot say whether an officer was sent for him or not; I saw him come into the office - I cannot say whether he came in custody or not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270095"/>- the office was full of officers and Police-men; I did not agree with Sutherland to leave him a portion of the medicine which he was to select, not beyond what I have mentioned that he was to have for his personal use; that is Mr. Sutherland by you - he was to pay the rent up to the 25th of March by agreement, but I took possession on the 19th, and might have put him out of the house that very day - I gave him permission to stay; the prisoner set up business in Greek-street - it may be one hundred and fifty yards from my shop, or it may be more; I never measured it - I should say it was not four hundred yards; it is not nearer than I wish - I do not think he will in the least injure me; I cannot say whether he interferes with me - I do not know his business; I should not care if he lived next door - he may or may not interfere with me; I cannot form an opinion one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Sutherland tell you at the time that he opened the trunks at Marshall's desire? A. I do not recollect it; he desired the locksmith to open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Marshall himself desire you to open the box in the presence of Mr. Sutherland? A. I do not recollect it; he did not desire that the box should be opened to my recollection - I remember his applying to me for his keys; I had not seen them - he asked for them for the purpose of taking away his box and keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not say, "Since the keys cannot be got at, I insist on your opening the box?" A. I never heard such words expressed, nor any thing of the kind; I never heard him give any instructions about the box being opened - I told him I had a warrant to take him up; I had not one - it was in consequence of the Police-officer telling me I might have one by applying for it; I cannot now tell who the officer was, I had occasion for so many times - I had not applied for a warrant; Mr. Sutherland was to have dined with me on Friday; I took him up on the Monday - he did not dine with me on Friday; he made a false representation to me - I did not invite Marshall.</p>
               <p>Q. I should not wonder if Marshall was kept in prison ever since this charge of robbery - has he been kept in prison by the Magistrate, in consequence of this charge? A. I understand he has; I know he was in prison - he has been bailed; I have met him in the street - I did not understand your question before; I thought you meant to say if he was taken out of prison - I know he has been in prison; in consequence of receiving a document from his attorney I know he has been bailed, but did not understand your question - but I have since reflected on the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Marshall brought an action against you? A. That was dropped; he brought an action - my attorney has told me it was stopped; the action was for this trunk and some of the goods in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any proceedings against Marshall till after Sutherland had brought his action? A. My mind was made up in the morning of the 20th; I declared the business must take its course - I cannot say when Sutherland instituted his action; Marshall was taken up after the action was brought - the indictment was found after the action was commenced, and he was not taken till after it was found - Marshall brought his action before I preferred the indictment, but I declared on the morning of the 20th, before Sutherland and Rolph, that the business must take its course; he had set up business against me before I began these proceedings.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was there a written agreement, or was it by your verbal permission that Sutherland was to remain in the house? A. It was a verbal permission, by invitation from me, thought he was to pay the rent to the 25th - that was provided for by what I paid him; I do not know of any person not employing me on account of the prisoner having set up - I should not have interfered to prevent his setting up even next door to me; he did not desire that his box should be opened on the 19th; when I asked him what was in it, he never told me there were drugs in it, but they were Sutherland's; Sutherland desired it should be opened by a smith - it was at that time in my custody, and nobody could get it away; Sutherland and his friend had told me they were going to Godstone on Friday for a few days, and were very sorry they could not dine with me; but I unexpectedly saw Sutherland in my house the same night - Marshall appeared at Bow-street for Sutherland; I then said I should take criminal proceedings against him - and before that; it was on Tuesday the 23rd March, they served writs on me in Easter term, which was after that; I have never seen the declaration - I gave Marshall up his trunk and clothes, and was informed his action was put an end to; I only know that Sutherland sent for the prisoner to the office; after going before the Magistrate, I came here the first Session and filed my bill; I went with the officer to point him out, and saw him taken; and two or three days after I was served with notice of a habeas being applied for, and heard he was bailed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner was sent for to come to Bow-street when you accused Sutherland? A. He was, and came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then make any charge against him of this kind? A. I threatened to give him into custody; I did not charge him before the Magistrate with taking these things.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a regular officer? A. Yes; I belong to Farringdon-ward; the prisoner was ten or fifteen yards before me when I heard the alarm -I was sitting at my dinner at the corner of Warwick-square; he tried to knock one or two young men down; there was not a soul to be seen, but the mob who were following him - I took him in Warwick-lane, near Amencorner.</p>

On the 20th of April I had left my shirt on a box at my lodging when I went out at seven o'clock in the morning; the prisoner lodged in the same house - when he came home at half-past twelve he told me he had pawned it, and said it must be a d-d good one, as he had got 4s. on it; I said I should get an officer, but, in consequence of some of his friends coming the next morning, I let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LEE. Q. Do not you know he had been out drinking the whole of that day? A. I do not know - he came to me while I was in bed and said he had pawned it; I had told him before this not to take any of my things - he did not say he took it by mistake; he said he would get it out - 4s. was put down, but I never accepted it; he was taken in bed on the 21st of April - I said if he got it out I did not care.</p>

            . I am clerk to a stock-broker. I saw Porter take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket and pass it to Rose, who put it into his pocket - I told the prosecutor; Porter passed the prosecutor - Rose passed me, and was taken by the officer; I went on, and saw Porter tying up his garter - I did not take him, as there were several boys about calling Bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. Near four o'clock in the Bank-chambers - there were only the prisoners, the prosecutor, and myself; I had never seen Porter before - I had plenty of opportunity of looking at him; he was taken the next day I believe - I suppose five or ten minutes elapsed from the time of his taking it, till I saw him again; he was then in a turning leading to Coleman-street - he walked away from the Bank-chambers; I did not think myself bound to take him - I swear distinctly he is the boy that took it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw both the prisoners go down Bartholomew-lane, and cross into Bank-chambers - they followed the prosecutor; Rose came running back just as I got to the gate, and I took him - I do not know that I had seen him before that day, but I knew Porter; I am sure they were together - there were two others who, I suppose, were with them, but they did not go in; when they saw the bustle they ran off.

No; I had seen these ribbons measured, and marked at each end; they were measured by being turned on a reel- there were eighteen yards each, and are now a yard short; they sometimes are a quarter of a yard or half a yard short - they were in my possession from the 12th to the 13th; I have three persons in my employ; I did not give them to the prisoner till the 13th - I was not absent from him above ten minutes; I had not measured them on the 13th, but I saw the mark at each end, when they passed through the machine; they do not shrink in watering, that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you leave the prisoner? A. About ten minutes; I went to the window, and he left the shop - I could hear him distinctly go to the bottom of the stairs; he said he went out, but if he had I must have seen him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were given to me to spindle which I did, and left them on the table; it might be as likely for my master to cut them - he has a bad character, so has his father.</p>

               <p>"Here is a paper, I wish you would pick it up," there might be a little dust in the paper; I do not think he was down there two minutes.</p>
               <p>JOHN WADE re-examined. I did not put it there - the officer did not search so much as he ought to have done.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you had any complaints before this? A. Yes, and we had detected a person two months before - the prisoner was not with us then; he had the best of characters, and a respectable house was going to take him as a blocker.</p>

On the 6th of May, before ten o'clock in the morning, I went to the house of Seager, who is inspector of the watch in the ward of Aldersgate; I was then searched by Bates, in his presence - they gave me two shillings which I had seen marked; I then went to a place in Little Britain, according to Seager's orders - I had seen Crouch once before in Smithfield; I waited in Little Britain till about half-past three o'clock - Crouch then came to me and asked what I wanted; I said I wanted ten pegs, which is a nick-name they give to counterfeit shillings - he was then 
by himself; he and I went on together down to the <placeName id="t18300527-222-crimeloc1175">Blue coat school gate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How do you get your living? A. By work - I worked for Mr. Seagar's brother, who is a gun-maker, for six years; I do not get my living by entrapping people for the Mint, but by honest industry, the whole of the last twelve months as a gun-maker and doing odd jobs; I never was engaged in any thing of this kind before - I do not know a person of the name of Bill, and never was employed but on this occasion; I swear I only heard the term pegs a fortnight before - Mr. Seager told me the slang names they gave them; Mr. Seager knew me by working for his brother; I do not expect to get any thing for this - I have had no promise held out to me; I do not know that I am to get any thing - I came here to serve Mr. Seager; I had seen Crouch in Little Britain before this, and I had seen him in Smithfield on the 4th, when I went to look after a man named Nash - not exactly on this business; I was employed by Seagar to detect him - I was never employed to entrap any but the prisoner and Nash; I was looking for Nash and the prisoner spoke to me - I had never seen him before; he came and asked who was I looking for, was I looking for Nash? I said I had rather see Winter-bank; I had never seen Winterbank; but I had heard of his name - I did not go after Winterbank, he was in the Compter; Mr. Seager had told me so, but I wanted the prisoner to think I was in the line; I said it as a blind -I understand Welch is about eleven years of age; the officers were about eight yards from me when I met Crouch; I was on one side of the way and they on the other, up a court - he might see them; I have not been drilled in this business - I was close to him when the little girl gave him the money open; it was not in paper; I did not say a word about paper - we went into the Bluecoat school yard and eight shillings were given to me; he had the ten shillings in his right hand - I watched his hand to see whether he put the two shillings away, as I wanted but eight; I did not then see Bates or Seager -I took it for granted they were not in the passage then; the Blue coat School-yard is a large open yard - when I took the money Bates came and took Crouch, and Seager took me; the two shillings I had given Crouch he gave to Welch - I had not been more than eight or ten minutes with him before he was taken; no one was by to hear any conversation between us.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. Had the officer any particular dress? A. No - Welch took the coin loose and gave it loose to Crouch; When Crouch came and introduced himself to me on the 4th, he and I walked down Hosier-lane - he said Tom was in the Compter and he had got the things - I said I did not know that it was right with him; he said if I thought it was not, I might go to the Compter, and ask Tom about it - he asked what I wanted - I said two tushes, meaning half-crowns; he wanted me to give him two shillings, but I would not - he then went in, and brought two half-crowns, wrapped in a piece of paper, and I gave him a shilling for it; I did that under the direction of Mr. Seager - I have worked for Mr. Wilk's, in Church-lane, at repairing guns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How much have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270103"/>you got by jobs of this sort? A. I never in my life received a farthing, or any thing else, nor do I expect it; on the 5th of May I went to the Fortune of War, at the corner of Cock-lane, with Crouch - we had a pint of porter, and I paid for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you get the money? A. I had it in my pocket; it has not been repaid.</p>

            . I am superintendent of the ward of Aldersgate. I know Zimmerman - he is a gun-polisher, and works generally for the trade; he is a hard working, industrious, sober man; I applied to him to assist me in detecting the prisoners, or any other person selling counterfeit coin; he acted under my direction on the 4th and 5th of May - on the 6th he came to my house, about nine o'clock in the morning; Bates searched him in my presence - I marked two shillings and gave them to him; I marked them so that I should know them again, and told him to go to Little Britain, and by no means to go out of my sight, but wait till Cronch came, who had appointed to meet him there that morning - Bates was in company with me - he waited at a public-house till three o'clock in the afternoon; we were waiting at a public-house opposite, till Cronch joined him - they then went on towards the Blue coat school; I followed, in company with Bates, till we came to Montague-court, and there I turned up and waited a few minutes - I saw Crouch set down by the side of Welch, on the coping which supports the iron railing - the witness was standing; Crouch got up in a minute or two; I saw him speak to Welch, who put her hand under her frock, and gave him something; I do not know what - I then saw the witness give Cronch something, which he transferred to Welch; they then went into the Blue coat school-yard - Welch remained outside; I then crossed from Montague-court, and looked through the iron railing; in the mean time I saw Crouch give something to the witness - Bates seized Crouch, and the witness proceeded on at a quick pace, but I went and took him; he gave me these eight shillings, much in the same state they are now in - they were not in paper; I marked them - Zimmerman went about his business; I saw Bates scuffling with the prisoner in the yard - I saw Bates pick up one shilling, and a blue coat boy picked up another; I then took the prisoner to the Compter -Bates searched him, and I searched him afterwards; nothing was found on him - I said,</p>
               <p>"You thought you were very cunning, did you not?" he said," I get my living in an honest way; I serve the hospital" - I believe that was all that passed; not finding any thing on Crouch, and knowing that the money had passed from Zimmerman, we thought Welch had got them - we took her under the archway of Bartholomew-hospital; two women were with her - seeing her so young a girl we thought she might be acting under instructions; we took them all three to a public-house, and upon Welch we found nineteen bad shillings, 7s. 6d. good money, and 5 1/2d. in copper; two of the good ones were those I had marked in the morning; these are them - they are marked in the middle of the letter G.; I also found on her fifteen half-crowns - the money was in a double pocket, under her frock; the good money was on the left side, and the bad on the right - here is the counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you followed this reputable employment? A. I have been superintendent of the ward some time - I have been about four months looking after these kind of persons; the ward employ me- I am not employed by the Mint; this was voluntary on my part - I consider it my duty to prevent crime; I do not encourage persons to go and entrap others - I get nothing for this whatever but my pay; these two shillings were my own money - I have never received any thing, nor do I expect any thing; I solemnly declare on my oath that not one word has passed between me and any officer of the Mint on this subject - I do not know whether the blue coat boy is here; I did not bring him - I left it to those who had the conducting of this business; I have known the witness six or eight years - I met him at my brother's, and told him I wanted him to do this business - he volunteered at once; though I was satisfied with his honesty, I thought it my duty to search and watch him - I kept him in sight all the way, till he came to the Blue coat school-yard.</p>

               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. I understand for about four months your attention has been drawn to some transactions of this nature? A. Yes - I consider it my duty as an officer to look after these people, and to give information to the officers of the Mint - I am not in any other way employed by them; I am paid for the time I am in attendance by the County or the city; I believe expences of witnesses are usually paid.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in this employ? A. No time at all, but it is my duty as an officer; we have so many complaints in the ward of Aldersgate - every shopkeeper is burthened with bad coin; I took
