               <p>John Wall. The Prisoner came into the Field where my Horses were at Work, on the 8th of March, and view'd them: I had been sowing some Barley, and was then harrowing the Ground. After he had look'd at the Horses, he went into my Yard; I watched him, and saw him come out again. When we had done Work that Night, I put up the Horses and made the Stable Door fast. The next Evening, March the 9th, about 9 o'Clock, I saw them safe in the Stable again; and went to smoke a Pipe with my Landlord's Man, about 11 I return'd, and found the Stable Door broke open, and the Horse was gone: He was afterwards taken in the Hands of the Prisoner, at Staines, by the Bellman, who informed me of him the next Morning.</p>

            . While I was upon the Watch in the Morning, the Prisoner came driving the Horse before him along the Road; I cry'd Hallo, and he answered me once; I call'd to him a 2d Time, and he made no Answer, but kept beating the Horse on. I saw he had a Hempen Halter in his Mouth, so I got to his Head and stopp'd him; I asked the Prisoner where he had the Horse, he told me, and by his Directions I went down to Ivall, at South Warnborough, where the Prosecutor lives, and he claim'd it. The Prisoner confessed the Fact very plainly. <rs id="t17380412-4-verdict19" type="verdictDescription">

I begg'd of them not to use me ill, and told them they should have it; so I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out about 16 or 18s. Toon held his Hat for the Money, and as I threw it into his Hat, a half Crown and a Shilling stuck upon the Brims, and fell from thence to the Ground; he stoop'd down to look for the Money that was dropp'd, but found only the Shilling Toon then proposed to search me for more; and Blastock seeing the String of my Watch, he told Toon that I had got one, and Toon demanded it from me. As soon as I had delivered it, Blastock took off my Horse's Bridle, and flung it away, then he whipp'd my Horse out of the Road, and the Creature immediately fell to grazing. They had both dismounted to rob me, and when they had got my Money and Watch, they mounted again, and gallop'd away. Upon this, I went to catch my Horse: but he seeing their Horses galloping, he gallop'd after them, and they perceiving a Horse following them, were 'frighted (I suppose) and imagined I was pursuing them, so they quitted their Horses and made off on Foot. I went on to Highgate, and there I found all the 3 Horses. The People advised me to go before a Justice and make Oath of the Robbery; accordingly I went before Sir

             was born in Ireland. About the latter End of May last, I came from Ireland, with the two Murray's, and we arrived at Park-Gate. At this Place she shew'd me the bad Money, and said she was obliged to put it off for her Livelihood. She asked me if I would keep her Counsel? I promis'd I would; upon which she shewed me about 8l. in these Shillings, which they dispos'd of, upon the Road. She had a good Half Crown, which she gave her Brother Philip, and the Way was, to go to a House and call for something that came to a Groat or Six-pence: Philip threw down the Half Crown, and receiv'd the Change in good Money; then Judith would tell him he need not change his Half Crown, she would lend him a Shilling, so he used to take his Half Crown again, and return these Shillings for that and the Reckoning. Thus they changed the bad Money for good, and she told me, that was the Way in which she had got her Bread. I promis'd to keep her Counsel, if she would let me into the Secret, and inform me how she made them, which she accordingly did as we were upon the Road, on this Side of Park-Gate. When we came to London, we took a Lodging in <placeName id="t17380412-11-crimeloc55">Drury-Lane</placeName>

             in England, while we went there to put off our bad Money. In France we got acquainted with the Prisoner Tinman: He came back with us, and we all three landed at Dover At a Place call'd Hithe, we were detected, and though Judith Murray concealed her Molds, yet we were all taken up; but we were discharged by a Justice of the Town of Hithe, because the Person could not swear positively to us. From this Place we came to London, and took a Lodging in Cable-street; this was about three Months ago.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did you lodge at any Time in Holywell-Lane, in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Donnavin. Yes; the Prisoners were taken there: We had lodg'd there about three Weeks when they were taken; but I never saw any Money made there, 'till the Day they were apprehended; and that Morning Judith put the Chalk, (or something White) into the Molds, then she made an Impression, by putting a Shilling between them, and afterward fix'd them. When the Molds were ready, she took two pewter Spoons which I had bought the Day before, and having broke them to Peices, she fill'd a Tobacco Pipe: Phillip Murray held it in the Fire 'till the Pipe was red-hot; then Judith pour'd the Metal into the Molds, and Tinman clipp'd the edges of the Shilling thus made They had made 8 of these Pieces, and had given me 3 or 4 to put off, before I left the House that Morning to detect them. Tinman clipp'd the edges of some of the Pieces with a pair of Scissars, but not many, for Judith said, he did not do it right, and she could do them better herself. Phillip Murray colour'd over the 4 Shillings they gave me that Morning with Quicksilver, and when I went out to pass them away, Judith desired Phillip Murray to go with me, for fear of any accident happening to me; but I would not accept of his Company, because I intended to detect them. So I went out and got a Constable, and desired him to send for Mr. North. I told the Constable they were then at Work, and I placed him at a House over the way, where he was to stay 'till I went over to see whether they were still at Work, because she always hid her Molds out of the Room, when they had done with them. As I went up Stairs, I met Phillip coming down; and I ask'd him whether his Sister had done Coining. He told me No, and that he was going only for a Pint of Beer. I took the Pot out of his Hand, and said, I would fetch the Beer; so he went up again, and I went over the way and told the Constable, and the Man he had with him, they might now go up. I went with them into the Room, and Judith when the Men came up Stairs, had got the Flasks (or Molds) in her Lap, and would have thrown them out of Window; but I seiz'd them in her Hand, and deliver'd them to Mr. Rogers. There were about 18 s. found in the Room, besides the 4 they had finish'd for me to put off This I believe is some of the Money.</p>
               <p>Phillip Murray. I did not Lodge at this Place; Was not I sent for that Morning to Bleed my Sister?</p>
               <p>Donnavin. No; he was not sent for that Morning, but when he came he did Bleed her. He had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120006"/> been for some time from us, with a Friend, but he has put off this Money for us.</p>
               <p>Judith Murray. Had not you and I quarrell'd?</p>
               <p>Donnavin. We generally quarrell'd, because I did not put off her Money, and frequently had Battles.</p>
               <p>Phillip Murray. Did not Mr. Haines go with the Constable, and did not he ask you, What you could charge me with?</p>
               <p>Donnavin. Yes, and I said - with colouring the Money. I did not then recollect that he had melted the Metal, - I was in a Surprize.</p>
               <p>Phillip Murray. Did not you say you could charge me with nothing but putting off the Money?</p>
               <p>Donnavin. I can't say whether I did or not.</p>

             Donnavin came to me the 11th of March, about 9 in the Morning, and enquired for a Constable to take up some Coiners. She said she was a Party concern'd, and was as bad as They. She told me farther, that there had been a Quarrel among them, and if she did not discover Them, they would impeach Her. Upon this Information, I went to the King John on Horseback, in <placeName id="t17380412-11-crimeloc56">Holywell lane</placeName>

Presently Donnavin return'd to the Alehouse for a Pot of Purl, and bid us stay a little longer. She carry'd up the Purl, and came down again to call us; she went in first, we follow'd her closely and found the 3 Prisoners in the Room. I am not positive whether Judith was sitting or standing, but they were all by the Fire, and we lock'd the Door to keep all in, that were in. I asked Donnavin, who she charged with Coining? She charg'd all of them; upon which Judith lifted up her Hands and cry'd - What! have you serv'd me so! And immediately she fell upon her Knees and beg'd for Favour. They all seem'd to be in a great Surprize, and lest any Mischief should happen, I order'd them to turn out their Pockets. While this was doing, Mr. Barlow found the Molds, and opening of them, he said they were hot; there was on one of them a visible Impression of the Head side of a King William's Shilling, and on the other, the Impression was plain, but Blank. After this, Mr. Barlow found 18 Shillings in an old Cap, and I took 3 or 4 of them; here they are, and I have mark'd them. We carry'd the Prisoners before Mr. Justice Wroth, and he committed them.</p>

I found likewise 18 Shillings in the Crown of a Woman's Cap, fifteen of them I mark'd, and delivered to Mr. North. There was two or three Pipes lay upon the Table with the Moulds.

             with silvering the Shillings over, before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. I act for the Solicitor of the Mint; on Saturday the 11th of March, Mr. Hain called me to the Alehouse where the Prisoners were detain'd, and from thence I went with him to search their Room; we found in the Ashes some Bowls of Tobacco-pipes, discoloured with the Fire, as if Metal had been melted in them. I imagined the Holes in the Pipes would have been stopped by the running of the Metal when melted into them, but they were not. There were several Pieces of Metal in the Ashes, and in the Window I found this Bottle of Quicksilver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barlow. When we seized the Prisoners, and brought them out of the Room, I locked the Door, and kept the Key in my Pocket till<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120007"/> Mr. North came, then I gave it to Mr. Hain, that Mr. North and he might go and search the Room again.</p>
               <p>Mr. North. After I had searched the Room, I went to the Alehouse again and saw these Moulds, they were then perfect, and the Impression of the Head Side of the Shilling, was very plain upon one Part of the Moulds, upon the other it was plain. All the Pieces that were shewn to me exactly tally'd with the Impression; these are the same Moulds (or Flasks) which were then delivered to me, but the Chalk is now fell out and the Impression are destroyed. When they were before the Justice, Donnavin swore that Judith coin'd them, Tinman cut off the Knobs and finish'd the Edges, and Phil. Murray silver'd them with Quicksilver.</p>
               <p>Phil. Murray. I was sent for to bleed my Sister; I never had any Conversation with Donnavin, but work'd hard for my Bread.</p>
               <p>Tinman. I chanced to be in the Room at this Time, but I never knew any thing of their making or putting off bad Money.</p>
               <p>Judith Murray. No one ever knew any thing of the Matter but Donnavin and I. She transported her own Brother, and was whipped at Dublin.</p>

They took from me my Watch, with the String and Seal, a Clasp Penknife, a Wire Tobacco-stopper, a Whistle made in the Shape of a Bugle Horn, tipp'd with Silver, and a Flemish Pocket-Piece, which had Dantzick Skilling on the one Side, and a Crown, with a Flourish round it, on the other. I saw their Number by the Light of a Lamp at the Corner of the Place where they rifled me, but I don't know any of them. I have been to see Swift (the Evidence) and Golding, since they were taken, and I don't know any Thing of Swift, nor can I say the Prisoner was one of the Men that robbed me, nor was any of my Things found upon him.

The Prisoner put one of his Hands over one of the Prosecutor's Eyes, and clapped his Pistol to the other; Markham stood behind him, the other Man took the Goods from him, and I took his Money, which was Eleven Shillings. When we had robbed him, we bid him go about his Business; then we went to Daws's House, and shared the Money; the Watch we carried to Rumford, and there we sold it for a Guinea and a Half; Daws kept half a Guinea for his own Share, we three divided the Guinea between us, and had 7 s. apiece.</p>

               <p>Swift. I was not taken up for this Robbery. There were seven Aprons of Madam Beavis's taken from Charter-House Square, and the Woman that had pawned them quarrelling with me and my Wife, she went and told Mrs. Beavis, that I stole them; I was taken up for this Fact, but they were not able to swear any Thing against me, so I was discharged, and as I was coming Home, they desired me to make myself an Evidence, that I might get rid of my Companions, so I made my Information before Justice Poulson. The Prisoner pawned the Waistcoat and Shirt that is now upon his Back, to buy a Pair of Pistols for us to go out with I have been acquainted with him a Year, but this was the first Time we ever went out altogether.</p>

On the 26th of March, the Prisoner came to my House about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, with another Man, and told me, he was informed, that Swift, being taken up for stealing some Linnen, had made an Information, in which he was included, and that if he should be taken, he should be hang'd. Why your only Way, says I, is to make yourself an Evidence; and I went with him to Justice Farmer's at No. 14. in Princes-Square. We saw only his Clerk, and told him the Story, and that we desired the Prisoner's Information might be taken. Mr. Warrener (the Clerk) refused to do any Thing in it, without we would give him a Guinea. I told him, that as the Prisoner came voluntarily, I would give him a Guinea the next Day, and in the mean Time I would give him my Note to pay him two Guineas, if I was not as good as my Word; but he insisted upon having the Guinea down, so I was forced to send my Watch Home to my Spouse, as a Token for her to send me a Guinea; when the Guinea came, Mr. Warrener had it, and took the Information, and as soon as the Prisoner had sworn to it, he and I, and another Man, went in Search of the Persons he had nam'd in his Information, I remember this very Robbery was mentioned in it.</p>

I saw him in New-Prison about 11 o'Clock, and wanting to make himself an Evidence, he went before Mr. Justice Poulson, but some People being with the Justice, he did not care to make the Discovery before them; upon which he was remanded back till 2 o'Clock; we then had a Warrant to take the Prisoner, and went to Old-street Square to enquire for him, but he was not at Home.

About Michaelmas last he became acquainted with me, and told me, I should be well encourag'd and rewarded, if I could get any Men for him, that were 6 Foot high or upwards, out of his Majesty's Forces, in Order to their being carry'd to Prussia. To this End he has given me Money from Time to Time; I have had 23 or 24 Shillings of him since Michaelmas last. Twice I had 2 Half-Guineas; and at another Time, I had Half-a-Crown, which makes 23 s. 6 d Some trifling Pence I have had at other Times.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know Davison and White?</p>
               <p>Snafe. Yes; here they are.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you remember their being in Company with the Prisoner at your House?</p>
               <p>Snafe They were in his Company (much about the same Time that I became acquainted with him) in Windsor-Court in Drury-Lane; and they have likewise been in his Company at the House to which I remov'd, in Vinegar Yard in Guy's-Court, Drury-Lane; both Houses are in the County of Middlesex; Windsor-Court is on the other Side of Clare-Market, between Clare Market and Drury-Lane.</p>
               <p>Counc. When were they first in his Company?</p>
               <p>Snafe. I can't tell he Month, but 'twas before Christmas. We have been all of us in Company together several Times; and I have heard him encourage them, and seen him make them merry with Eatables and Drinking. I may express the Words I suppose - it was to encourage them to go with him to the King of Prussia, for his Service.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there any thing mentioned of the Time, in which they were to continue in the Prussian Service?</p>
               <p>Snafe. Yes, he told them they must continue in the Service 3 Year; and Davison and White were to have 10 l. each <note>[Text unreadable in original.]</note> at Hamburgh. They were not to have the Money here for Fear they should not go with him. He would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120010"/> not trust them; that was the Reason they were to be paid there.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you observe the Prisoner to give either of them any Money?</p>
               <p>Snafe. Yes; I saw him give White a Shilling, of which White told me the same Instant.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Security had they that the 10 l. should be paid them at Hamburgh?</p>
               <p>Snafe. He gave them Notes under his Hand: I saw one of the Notes deliver'd to Davison, by the Prisoner. I saw him write it, and then deliver it. They read it to me a little while after; and the Purport of it was, that they were to receive 10 l. on their Arrival at Hamburgh.</p>
               <p>Counc. What was the Shilling given for?</p>
               <p>Snafe. To enlist them, I take it. - Both Davison and White read their Notes to me, I did not see him give White his Note; but I saw him deliver Davison's to him, and they were both read to me.</p>
               <p>Counc. Should you know the Notes again if you was to see them?</p>
               <p>Snafe. To the best of my Knowledge these are the Notes: I can't read; but I believe they are the same.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was the Defendant present when they were read?</p>
               <p>Snafe. No; he was not.</p>
               <p>Counc. Does Davison go by any other Name?</p>
               <p>Snafe. By some Title of his Brother, I have heard him call'd Birk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Witnesses's Name is not Snafe, but Senett. Pray did you hear me seduce Birk or White, to enlist into the King of Prussia's Service?</p>
               <p>Snafe. I heard the Prisoner say he would give him 10 l. and the King of Prussia, and his Service, was named several Times.</p>
               <p>Counc. Do you know any thing of the Defendant's delivering colour'd Cloaths to Davison and White?</p>
               <p>Snafe. Yes; I saw him deliver a Snuff-colour'd Coat to White, in my House. This is the Coat he deliver'd to him; and I saw him likewise deliver this other Coat to

               <p>Davison. Yes; he desir'd me several Times to see if I could get him any Men, 6 Feet high, or more; and said, when they got to Hamburgh, they should be encourag'd and rewarded.

               <p>Counc. What farther was done in Order to your going beyond Sea?</p>
               <p>Davison. He contriv'd so far, that my Comerade and I were to go away the first of April. We were to go down to Gravesend with the Evening Tide, and he gave us colour'd Cloaths to go off in. After he had given us the Cloaths, he went down to St. Catherine's, to learn what Time the Hamburgh Ship was to sail, in which we were to be put; and he brought us Word, that the Ship would sail that Tide, and that we must go down to Gravesend that Afternoon. This is the Coat and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120011"/> Wastecoat he gave me to disguise myself in, that I might not be known to be a Soldier. I put the Cloaths on, but I discover'd the Design in the Morning to Serjeant Philips, and desir'd him to carry one of the Notes to Colonel Williamson, who came with some Men to Billingsgate: where the Colonel heard him say to us, - If you have either Honour or Honesty, come away directly; because we had promis'd to go along with him. I had one Shilling of him at first, a second he gave me to carry my Comerade White, and a third he gave me one Night, when I was a little longer than ordinary upon Guard.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was you present at any Time when any Conversation pass'd between him and White, in Relation to his going into the Service of the King of Prussia.</p>
               <p>Davison. Yes; White was to have so much a Week in the King of Prussia's Guards, nine Shillings per Week, and ten Pounds as soon as he landed at Hamburgh; this was his Promise to White, I don't say he promised the same to me.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was you present when the Prisoner wrote the Promissory Note which he gave to White?</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner since Michaelmas last; the very first Time of my being in his Company, was upon the Business of entering into the King of Prussia's Guards; upon this Account he daily treated me with Victuals and Drink, and was always reflecting upon his Majesty's Service, telling me it was poor sorry Bread, and what rare Things were to be done in Prussia, but nothing under six Foot would do for him, una every Man that was so much above six Foot high, should have so much the more Pay.</p>
               <p>Councel. How many Meetings had you before you took the Notes?</p>
               <p>White. Several; we met twenty or thirty Times I believe, but about the latter End of March we made the Agreement, and for our Encouragement he gave us Notes on the 30th of March, for ten Pounds payable when we got to Hamburgh, and we were to go aboard the next Day. He told us he had got Provisions on board, and all Things proper, if we would proceed to the Vessel. In order to disguise me he gave me a colour'd Coat, which I kept and have brought hither; he gave Davison Cloaths likewise, I saw him fit them upon him, and we were to have gone aboard the 1st of April, at 8 o'Clock at Night, but I gave Information to my Serjeant in the Morning, and he went to Colonel Williamson, who sent a Guard from the Tower, and he was taken and carried before the Colonel.</p>
               <p>Councel. Who writ the Notes?</p>
               <p>White. The Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Councel. Because 'tis said in them, - that 'tis your own Will and Proposal.</p>
               <p>White. We told him so to carry on the Scheme, and to find out his Roguery; but he writ the Notes himself, and delivered them in my Presence. This is the very Note the Prisoner gave to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you never deluded by Birk and Sennett to go abroad with them to Germany or France? And did not they tell you they had been in Foreign Service before?</p>
               <p>White. Davison and I intrigued all along in order to catch the Prisoner, and Birk spoke to me several Times on that Head, but between him and I he told me he had no Mind to go, nor should I go. We shew'd a Disposition to go that we might deceive and detect him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Sennet (Snafe) say he had a Disposition of Spight against me, concerning his Wife?</p>
               <p>White, No, never in this World, nor Davison neither.</p>

            . (Serjeant.) Davison and White are Soldiers in our Regiment. On the first of April, White came and enquired for Captain Parker, but he not being in the Way, his Servant came for me, and White told me that the Prisoner was going to carry him to Prussia, with his Comrade. He gave me the Ten Pound Note which the Prisoner had given him, and I carried it to Colonel Williamson. This is the very Note, I read it over and over, and have had it in my Pocket a Day or two. Colonel Williamson, when the Prisoner was before him, shewed him the Note, and he took hold of one End of it, but before he would let it go again, the Colonel was forced to hold a Candle to his Fingers. He was asked, what was the Reason of his giving those Notes? at first he would not resolve him, but afterwards he said the Men obliged him to it.</p>
               <p>Colonel Williamson. The Prisoner was brought before me in the Evening the 1st of April. This Serjeant came to me with one of these Notes, and told me what Design was going forwards, that a Man had enlisted two Grenadiers for the King of Prussia's Service. The Note I saw was full and distinct, therefore I thought it was very proper to look after this Fellow. The Serjeant told me the Men were to go away at 8 o'Clock that Evening, but they were honest and had given him this Information. He asked for a few Men that they might go and take him; I told him, I not only would let him have Men, but I would go with them myself; so I took a Serjeant and a File of Musquetteers, and planted them in the dark at Billingsgate, where they were to take Water.</p>
               <p>After we had waited some little Time, Davison came and told us, the Prisoner would be there presently, for his Time was come; he had then this brown Coat on, which has been produced here. About 8 o'Clock I perceived the Guard running, I pursued and caught him, just as they overtook him near Thomas-street by Billingsgate. When he was before me, both the Notes were produced, and I asked some Questions about them, he humm'd and haw'd, and said they were a Parcel of Rogues. But, says I, here are Notes (and shewing him one) is this your Hand-Writing? Let me see it, says he; I would not part with it out of my Hand, but I let him take hold of one End of the Note, and asked him again, if that was his Writing? He would make no answer, so I bid him let go the Note; he would not let it go, therefore I was forced to put the Candle to his Hand, and when he felt the Flame he quitted his Hold. On this full Evidence I committed him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Councel. Was it before or after this, that he said she was obliged to give the Men these Notes</p>
               <p>Serjeant Philips. It was after the Colonel had got the Note out of his Hand While we waited for the Prisoner at Billingsgate, I heard a Man say, - Now, if you have either Honour or Honesty, come along. I thought this must be the Man, so we all endeavour'd to take him, but he took to his Heels and run up a little Lane towards Thames-Street, the Guard ran after him, and somebody running against him threw him down; before he could get up again we took him.</p>
               <p>DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have fourteen or fifteen Witnesses to prove that Birk and Sennett have sent Men abroad these three Years, and that I did not instigate them to do this Thing.</p>

            . I live in Sennet's (Snafe's) House, and have seen Davison and White with Lawrence eating and drinking there. Snafe kept the House, - we call him Sennett. I never knew the Prisoner encourage a Man, but Sennett employ'd me once, - with Submission to your Lordship and the Honourable Jury, I am a Taylor, and he employ'd me to alter an old Suit of Cloaths once, and they were to be done against 6 o'Clock in the Evening, and he said I should be paid. When they were done, I carry'd them down to Sennett in the Kitchen, the Prisoner was there, but he did not employ me. Sennett helped the Cloaths upon Birk's Back, and White asked for a Room up-stairs to dress himself in.</p>

When White ask'd for a Room to dress himself in, Snafe cry'd, - Bl - d and W - ds, take the Key of the Cellar, and dress yourself there. This was about a Fortnight ago, but I did not (cannot) mention the Day.</p>

            . I am a Peruke-maker, and seeing the Prisoner frequently in Snafe's House, I got acquainted with him, and have known them to have several Quarrels, which as far as I understood, were from Jealousy of his Wife. Once I met him, and he told me, that the Prisoner and his own Wife had abus'd him, and he was going to swear against him. I have heard Snafe often say, he would be even with him, by Night or by Day, and that he would be one upon his Taw, swearing bloody Oaths. I have heard the Prisoner warn Davison from keeping Snafe Company, and tell him, that he (Snafe) was a spunging, lurking Companion It was entirely out of jealousy, and there was an Uneasiness between them. Snafe and Davison deserted out of France.</p>

            . I was one Day at Sennett's House, to drink a Glass of Gin, my Wife was with me; and she and I falling out, Sennett cry'd to me, G - d d - n it, come along to France, and I will provide for you. When you are got to France, I'll provide a better Master for you than ever you had in your Life. I am a Gentleman's Servant, and came out of Place about a Month ago; but I was afraid he would sell me like a Cow or a Horse, so I avoided the Fellow's Company.</p>
               <p>Patrick M'Cauly I have been in the French Service myself, Sennett was a Trooper there, and Birk was a Soldier.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Davis. I know nothing but - I'm upon Oath, and will speak Truth. Last Saturday was se'enight I met this Man Sennett in the Street, and he told me his Wife was gone to Lawrence in Newgate, and that he would be reveng'd on them both. I told him it was a vile thing in him to take such Exceptions, and swear so. G - d d - n it, says he, I wou'd not wish for a Million of Money that I was concern'd in the Action, for bringing this upon Lawrence. I had but very little Acquaintance with Sennett, and had not known him long; but he said he was sorry he had done the Thing.</p>

            . If I was to dye this Moment, it will be my Opinion, this Contrivance is owing to Sennett's Jealousy. Sometime ago he came and demanded to talk to me about Lawrence's having us'd him ill; and he said his Wife was a Bitch. I cannot say I know any thing ill of Sennett; but I believe this Affair proceeds from pure Jealousy.</p>
               <p>Counc. But do you think that Birk, (Davison) and White, who have no Wives to be jealous of, would work themselves up, and perjure themselves, because Sennett is jealous?</p>
               <p>Luttwyel. As to that I can't say. Birk must degenerate very much from that noble Family in Ireland, to which he is related, if he does so</p>
               <p>Col. Williamson. That very Man, under his own Hand, recommended Birk as a very honest Man.</p>
               <p>Counc. - to Mary Sennett. Look upon that Coat and Wastcoat.</p>
               <p>Sennett. I bought them myself of M'Cauly The other Coat I know nothing of; but I saw Sennett give it to White, and heard him bid White go down into the Cellar and put it on.</p>
               <p>Counc. Don't you know your Husband had Money, upon this Account, from the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sennett. I know of no more than 2 Half-Guineas, and that Money I sent my Husband to ask him for. - 'Twas part of a Debt of 5 Guineas which he ow'd me. As to the Cloaths, they had been in the House before; my Husband dusted them, and the 2 Men put them on, while the Prisoner stood at the Door; and they 3 went away half an Hour before the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did not you hear the Prisoner say -  Come make haste, we shall be too late?</p>
               <p>Sennett. No; only - Come let us go.</p>

               <p>Capt. Carr. Gave an Account of the Behaviour of Davison and White as Soldiers, and said he believ'd them to be very honest Men.</p>
               <p>Snafe, alias Sennett. What the Witnesses have sworn, with Relation to my saying the Prisoner was Innocent, and to my being sorry for being concerned in this Prosecution, is all false upon my Oath. I may have said I would be even with him to my Comerade, but it was because he often abus'd me for not getting him Men. I never had a Word with him in my Life about my Wife. He himself left the Cloaths with me, for Davison and White, and he put them on them himself. I would not forswear my self for the World.</p>

               <p>Turnham I was going Home that Night, and this Woman picked me up at Fleet-Ditch; she persuaded me to go with her, and I gave her 2 s. for her Company. We had no sooner laid down, but I caught her attempting to steal my Watch. I challeng'd her with it, and she slipp'd it down in the inside of my Breeches, and said, No, my Dear, I would not do such a thing for the World; Then she persuaded me to pull my Breeches off: I did so, and took off my Stock Buckle, laying all my Things on a Stool by the Bed-side. I had not lain down again a Minute, but Madam was dry, and must needs go get some small Beer, - I am a little confounded too - She went for the small Beer, and I did not see any thing of Madam for 3 or 4 Hours: My Watch and Stock Buckle were gone; I never got them again. The Neighbours persuaded me to stay till she came back, and then I got a Constable and secur'd her.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Rowley. I was last Tuesday to hear the Rehearsal at St. Paul's, and when it was over, I endeavour'd to avoid the Crowd, by going through <placeName id="t17380412-40-crimeloc191">Cannon Alley, in Pater-noster-Row</placeName>

Before I could get away, I felt her lift up the Side of my Hoop, and put her Hand into my Pocket. This Gentleman (Mr. Addy) was looking at the same out of his Window, and call'd out to me, - Madam, your Pocket is pick'd. I put my Hand into my Pocket, and found I had lost 8 s. 6 d. I brought 11 s. 6 d. out with me, but I had no more than a Half-Crown and a Six-pence left: Mr. Addy told me he knew the Woman, and if I would step into his House, he would go and take her; and he went out, and took her accordingly. She was carry'd before the Lord Mayor, but she was not search'd; for my Lord imagin'd she had her Receivers about her, and that it would be to no Purpose to search her. I felt her Hand, and cry'd at the same Time - What, are you picking Pockets here!</p>
               <p>Mr. Addy. I was looking out of my Window to see the Crowd at the Rehearsal, and had observ'd the Prisoner, with the Assistance of her 2 Fellows, to have pick'd a great many Pockets that Morning: But this Lady was robb'd under my very Window. I observ'd the 2 Men to shove the Gentlewoman against the Prisoner, and saw her put her Hand into her Pocket, and afterwards clap something into her own. I was positive she took Money out of this Gentlewoman's Pocket, and put it into her own; so I told her, if she would Prosecute her, I would take her, for I knew her. She had been an Hour and Half, or 2 Hours, about the Alley that Morning, and had pick'd a great many Pockets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Then why did not you call out before?</p>
               <p>Mr. Addy. Because that was at a Distance - She was hurrying and picking Pockets as fast as she could, at a Distance; but this was under my Window.</p>
               <p>

            . I was with Mrs. Rowley at this Time. The Prisoner and her Fellows stopp'd me first, and held me for some Time; but I had emptied my Pockets before I came out, so they let me go, and stopp'd her; she was close behind me. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120016"/> heard Mr. Addy call out to Mrs. Rowley, and tell her, the Prisoner had pick'd her Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in a Shop when that Man came up and accused me, and I offer'd to be searched. I told the People I had 7 s. 6 d. and a Guinea in my Pocket, and if I had any more, 'twas the Lady's</p>
               <p>Mr. Ashly With Relation to her asserting he was in the Shop when she was seiz'd, 'tis false. At the very Time he seiz'd her, she was going to pick Doctor Best's Lady's Pocket, and I call'd out to her. I have known her for a Pick-pocket these 5 Years, and saw her pick 20 Pockets that Day. She is so well known, that I could have brought a Dozen People to have prov'd this, if I had imagin'd it would been necessary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Addy. Her Janizaries have been with me since she was taken up, and offer'd me Money to keep out of the Way, that the Thing might be dropp'd before the Grand Jury.</p>

When he was gone, the Prisoner laid hold of my right Arm, and I got loose from him twice, but the 3d Time he seiz'd me, he held me so fast to his Breast, that it was with the utmost Difficulty I freed myself from him. As soon as I was disengag'd I felt for my Watch, and it was gone. I ask'd him the Reason of his laying hold of me, and imagin'd he had some Evil in his Breast; but he made no Answer at all, only held me fast. While I was struggling with him, I felt a Man behind me; and I suppose either the Prisoner, or some of his Confederates, then got my Watch, for there were several in Company with him, tho' the Prisoner only assaulted me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you call out to the People that attended the Funeral?</p>
               <p>Castella. I was in Fear, and apprehended that most of the Mob about him consisted of his Confederates, I was afraid of being knock'd on the Head. The Day before he went to offer Bail before a Judge, he sent me Word, I should have 3 Guineas, if I would not object to his Bail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you where I liv'd?</p>
               <p>Castella. When he was gone before the Justice, he said he <rs id="t17380412-43-deflabel215" type="occupation">kept a Cork cutter's Shop</rs>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I go with you before the Justice without a Constable?</p>
               <p>Castella. As soon as he was out of the Mob, I took him, and told him, I had lost my Watch while he held me. You joke, says he. I told him he should go before a Justice, and he said, he had rather go without a Constable, than be knock'd down, and forc'd to go</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many People might there be about the Burying?</p>
               <p>Castella. About 30 or 40, besides the Mourners. They were going into the last Coach, when this happen'd.</p>

There was a Man call'd me out, and desir'd he might drink with Castella and me: We went to a publick House, and he offer'd him 2 Guineas and the Watch to make up the Matter, because the Prisoner was but just come into Business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went with him before the Justice, the Justice would have nothing to say to me, because I did not come before him in charge of a Constable; upon which I went with Castella to the Constable of the Night.</p>

               <p>John Robins. Last Monday Night I was going up Holborn and met that Gentlewoman there, and another with her. So Countryman, said they, where are you going? Why Home, says I, where should I go? Go along with us, says one of them. What should I go along with you for, I can't Kiss you? Will you bung your Eyes, said I? Yes, if I pleas'd they said; and so they carry'd me to one Mrs. Wests House, - I don't know what Street 'tis in, not I, - I am but a stranger here. But that woman there, and I, went in and drank; I saw none but she and the Landlady. When we had drank together a while, I call'd for the Landlady to give me Change for the Liquor, but I never got my Change of her; when she came in, she said to the Prisoner, bilk him - make the best of him; so we drank together, and she grew mighty familiar, - more familiar than I thought she should be, - stand further off says I, - I am afraid of you. Presently after this the Landlady came in, and put out the Candles, and pushing me out of Doors, I had like to have broke my Shins. When I was out of the House they run me up against the Wall of a Brew-House, and left me. I found my Money was gone, so I ran roaring and hallooing out for a Watchman, and at last a Watchman found me, and carry'd me Home, Next Morning I was a little uneasy about my Money, and I told the Folks how I had been serv'd, and that I had lost 9 l. 3 s. What's her Name said they? Her Name, says I, - why I don't know her Name, - only they call'd her Peg. O! says one of them, we can help you to Peg again, and so they carry'd me from one House to to'ther House, and at last we found Peg at a Pawnbroker's redeeming her Cloaths out of Pawn, with my Money I suppose. I ran for a Warrant to take her up, and when I return'd, the People told me she had confess'd her taking my Money, and she had return'd a Guinea and a half, a 36 Shilling-piece, and Half-a-Crown. When she was before the Justice, she own'd the Fact again, and upon searching her, we found another Guinea in her Snuff-Box, and 13s in her Pocket, which she own'd was Part of my Money. Some of the Gold (she said) she had chang'd to redeem her Things, and three Guineas her Landlady took from her, for her Share. She said she took it out of my Fob-Pocket, - I don't know how she did it, not I, - 'twas in my Fob, in a green silk Wallet. I have no more to say, - not I.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you swear I pick'd your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Robins. Yes; and you know you did. I did not miss it 'till they push'd me out of the House. There was none but she in my Company; the Landlady only brought in the Liquor, and I felt for my Money and had it as I went into the House.</p>
               <p>Geo Thompson. The Prisoner was brought to my House, by some People, to whom she had return'd the 36 Shilling-piece, with a Guinea and half, and Half a Crown; the Money was paid in my Backside, - my Back-side in the Yard. While she was before the Justice we found 13 s. in her Pocket, and a Guinea in her Snuff-Box. She own'd she took the Money she is charg'd with out of his Pocket; and put the rest into it again.</p>
               <p>Robins. No; she did not take all, - for I had 14 l. in my Pocket. She took what she pleas'd, and left me the rest in the Wallet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you go to see what Money was lost?</p>
               <p>Robins. To my Inn. I could not tell my Money over in the Street, - in the Dark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you asleep in the House?</p>
               <p>Robins. Asleep, - no; nor I was not asleep.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Robins. Sober - why I was not very sober - nor I was not very fuddled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to the Constable. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Thompson. He was drunk. She own'd she took the Money (before the Justice) out of his Pocket, and said nothing in her Excuse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you give me the Purse to tell the Money over?</p>
               <p>Robins. No - no - no - I did not like you so well. I was only drinking there - that's all:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120018"/> she was greater with me than I desir'd. We had 3 Bottles of Ale, and I paid the Reckoning - 3 Shillings and 6 Pence</p>

               <p>Robins. How was it possible? Why how was it possible for you to take it out? We sat upon the Bed together; but I don't know any Business she had with my Fob.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You can't swear but your Money might drop out of your Fob.</p>

Then she told me, there was a lusty Woman at the Door, (who is the Evidence here) and I might see how I lik'd her. Upon this the Evidence came in, and the other (I believe the Prisoner is the Woman) jump'd out of the Door at once. The Prisoner having sat with her Leg in my Lap, I suspected she had robb'd me; and upon searching for my Purse, I found it was so. I immediately complain'd to Mrs. Arnold, that I was robb'd, and went to the Door, where the People in the Court told me, that 'twas

             that I had carry'd into the House, and they sent for a Constable. I stood a while at the Door; then Mrs. Arnold shut us out. Upon this we went to Mr. De Veil for a Warrant, and when we came back, we found Arnold and the Evidence in the House, with a Woman crowded all on a heap, with a Pipe in her Mouth. The next Morning I was inform'd, that the Woman thus disguised was the Person that robb'd me Upon this Information I took up the Evidence, who discover'd the Prisoner. I am sure I had the Money when I went into the Room; for I took it then out of my Breeches Pocket, and put it into my Waistcoat Pocket, as the safest Place. When I carry'd the Prisoner into the House, she was dress'd very gay, in a velvet Hood and Manteel; but when I came with the Warrant, she was wrapped up in Rags, and had a Pipe in her Mouth.</p>

             and I, agreed to walk together at Night. Between Fetter-lane and Middle Row, in Holborn, I stopp'd to speak to a Man, and while I was talking to him, she pick'd-up Mr. Pullen. I miss'd her, and judg'd she was gone to Mr.Arnold's with him, So I follow'd, and Mrs. Arnold told me, Lydia had carry'd a Cull up stairs. I went up to the Chamber Door, and Lydia cry'd, here's a fine large Woman, see &amp;c. &amp;c. - and immediately she jump'd up, and ran down Stairs. The Man complain'd at that Instant that she had robb'd him, and I bid him follow her. He went to the Door and we fastn'd it upon him. Upon that he made an Out-cry, and Mr. Oatley and Mr. Holley came to his Assistance, and demanded the Door to be open'd. We refus'd; and knew they had no authority to break it open; they knew the same, therefore they resolv'd to leave some body at the Door, while others went for a Warrant, because the Neighbours had declar'd, that the Prisoner was hid in the House. While they were gone for the Warrant, one Mrs. Dunckley who was then in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173804120020"/> the House, was frighted, and insisted upon being let out, before the Warrant came; so we open'd the Door, but the Persons who kept Guard on the outside, would neither let her go out, nor suffer us to shut the Door again. So when they return'd with the Warrant, they found the Door open. When the Prisoner jump'd out of the Room from the Prosecutor, she did not go out of the House, but ran into the Cellar, and when the Street Door was shut upon him, she came up with an old sort of a stuff Purse in her Hand, and 'twas spotted with black and yellow, had long Strings, with Tassels at the Bottom. The Prisoner told 35 Guineas out of it, into Arnold's Lap, and she put it into a Bag, and hid it over the Kitchen Door. I saw the Money, and remember a crooked Guinea in particular. Then they burnt the Purse, and the Prisoner undress'd herself, and put a double Clout about her Head, and ty'd an old Handkerchief and a colo r'd Apron about her, and sat down with a Pipe in her Mouth, that she might not be known. When the Prosecutor return'd with the Warrant, the House was search'd, but they did not find the Money, or know the Prisoner in her Disguise. When the Hurry was over, I went home to my Lodgings, and in about half an Hour, the Prisoner and one Mr. Clark (that she lives with) came to me, and said, they had got all the Blunt, meaning the whole 35 Guineas; and he told it over before me and her. They wanted to lye with me, but I refus'd it; so they talk'd of going to Lawyer Grimes's. When I was taken up, I insisted upon Mr. Clark's returning the Money, and it was return'd to Mr. Pullen - all - except a little that was allow'd for Favours; but 'twas upon Condition he should not Prosecute.</p>
               <p>Mr Chamberlain gave an Account, that Mr. Clerk return'd 30 Guineas of the Money, and that the Felony had been compounded, had not he prevented it, and caus'd the Money to be paid into the Constable's Hands.</p>
