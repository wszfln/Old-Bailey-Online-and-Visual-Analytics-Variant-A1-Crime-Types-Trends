Between eleven and twelve o'clock, hearing some men walking in my master's lime-yard; I went out; it was near the public street; it is now a private yard; it used to be a public road. I had been lying down on a sack, and I went into the yard, and saw five men there standing up. I asked them what they were doing there, and what was their business. I told them, there was no road there; and one of them said, d-n your eyes, where is your money; then he looked over his shoulder, and said to the others, I am not sure it is he. Then

            , another man, who were about a rod from me, said, it is he. I knew Warren and Dee; I had worked with them before, better than two years. It was not dark at this time; it was very light. I knew them both very well, both by tongue and person. Dee said, it is he, is it not; and Warren said he was certain sure of it. Warren told the man next to me to sieze me, and they would be after as soon as possible, and so they were. Then the fourth man said, I will soon let you know something about it, and then they seized hold of me; he took hold of my throat, and the others took me by the arms, and they shoved me in at the door; there were two fires; it was quite as light there as it is here; you might see to pick a pin up; it was fight from the fires that came from the kiln; the kiln door was open. They catched me up by the legs, and threw me down on the lime, and two of them were on my throat, and three across my legs and thighs. Then they cut my trowsers all off my back, and cut my pockets off where the money was in; they were nankeen breeches. They cut off the watch-pocket, where the watch was, and the breeches pockets. I saw them take a thirty-pound note, a twenty-pound note, and a one-pound note out of my tobacco box. They opened the notes and looked at them. These notes were in my tobacco box in my left hand breeches pocket. They cut off my right hand breeches pocket also; there were seven ten-pound notes, and a thirty-pound note there, in a protection box, which I bought five years ago at Greenwich, and gave three-pence for it, in my right hand breeches pocket. In my left hand waitcoat pocket there were two one-pound notes; the money was in three boxes in all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to carry so much money about you - A. I was never in constant work. I had been engaged for three months, and only worked one, and I thought I might as well go home. After that, I always kept it in my pocket, as I thought it safer than any where else.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come by all this money - A. I had worked nearly seventeen years day and night to get it up. They took my watch also; it was a silver watch; there was one seal with a dog on it; they continued on me about twenty minutes altogether. They beat my head into the lime before they started<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180004"/>to go off, and when they were going out of the door they turned back to kill me, and one of them said d-n his bloody eyes, let us kill him; pull out your knife, and cut his head clean off, and we will throw it away, and I looked every moment for it to have come off too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any knife taken out - A. No; I did not see any knife; but one held my head, and another my legs, while the others beat me, and kicked me; four of them came back, and the other staid at the door; Dee and Warren came back; Warren was for killing of me at the last moment. Warren said it would serve him right if we were to kill him, for what he did to me, and I never did any thing to him, any more than working with him; I am certain he said that. Then they tied me cross-legged tight over the tendon, with a handkerchief not my own, one of theirs; then they were standing altogether at the door, and Mr.

Then William Dee said to the others come let us go, and then they went off, and they answered to Mr. Cranch there is not much the matter, it is all right enough, and then I saw no more of them that night after that; it was the man that caught hold of me first that said that; and away they went over the wall. Wheh they had cut my pockets off, Warren, the prisoner, said, I told you where the money was, I had such a sight of the prisoner as to be sure he was one of the persons; I knew four of them by sight, and Dee and Warren by name; Dee and Warren had been in the yard that day.

               <p>Q. How soon after did you go in search of the men - A. I could not go; the runners went within an hour afterwards. The watchman came, and I informed him what had happened; there were two watchmen came; but I don't know that they are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any one here to whom you told what had happened to you - A. Yes; there is Mr. Cranch, I told him what was the matter; I was at the lime kiln door. This yard stand upon three quarters of an acre; there was a wall and pales all round; there is valuable property there. There are two gates; those gates open close upon the door. There is a little street which covers about two rods of ground, and which comes down by the gates.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this yard from the public-street - A.About an hundred yards from the common road, perhaps not so much; there is a kind of road which goes down to the yard, where the carts go round to carry potetoes. At the time I speak of, I don't know whether the gates were opened or locked. When the men had left me, Mr. Cranch let me out; I was nearly blind, and nearly dead. I believe Mr. Cranch unlocked the gate; I think it was unlocked, but I am not sure it was he unlocked it. I told Mr. Cranch I knew one of the man was

               <p>Q. Do you mean that you were so much in your right senses as to be sure of the prisoner - A. I can safely say he was one of those men; he had a blue jacket and trowsers on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Mr. Cranch that Warren did not commit any violence towards you - A. Yes; he did not beat me. When I was speaking to Mr. Cranch, I told him I knew Warren was laying across my legs. I have never got a farthing back. I have seen some of it at Shadwell; I don't know the numbers; I had no memorandum of the amount I had. I don't know when Warren was taken up; I was as blind as a bat. I did not see Warren for a week after he was taken. When I did see him, I saw him at the Justice's at Shadwell; there I recognized him. I did not say at Shadwell office, I could not swear to him, but I said I could, for I would a thousand times; I mean to say that is the man, and it is impossible I can be mistaken; I am sure of the man.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. I had changed a great many notes in the yard, five-pound notes and others, and the prisoner know I was possessed of a good deal of money. He came one night before, but I was prepared for him, and had a broom stick; I should have knocked him down. He got a ladder; he came about one o'clock in the morning; I should have given it to him too, if he had come on, about a foot farther, for I was guarded for him at that time. He crawled away through the kiln hole.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employment in July last, at Mr. Mason's, at Bow; I reside at New Cut Lane, on the same premises where this lime yard 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in the course of that night that disturbed you - A. Yes, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was disturbed by a noise, and I threw up the windows, and asked who was there, and what was the matter? and I received no answer, and I returned to my bed again. I was disturbed in about ten minutes after that, by the cry of murder. Upon being so disturbed, I got up, and I challenged three times who was there, and I received no answer, and I then said I would fire, if I did not receive an answer; I abstained from firing, and in the course of a few minutes the prosecutor answered it was me; I have been robbed. I then asked the prosecutor if they had abused him; I found him a good deal beat and cut about the head. I got the assistance of two watchmen prior to my going out into the yard; then, having the assistance of those two watchmen; I went down, and found the prosecutor in the yard; he had then untied his legs. He said the prisoner was one of the persons; and in consequence of that I got up early the next morning, and went in search of him; he said he thought the prisoner was one; he said there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180005"/>a person by the name of Dee, whom he knew to be one of the gang. I knew of the prosecutor having a considerable sum of money. I have frequently a changeed ten-pound twenty-pound and thirty-pound notes for him; both he and the prosecutor had worked for me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether the prisoner has ever been present at the time he has got change - A. It was chiefly of a Saturday night when the other men were collected to receive their money, in their presence I have done it. The prisoner was one of those men. Both prisoner and prosecutor worked for me. There are two notes that are traced after the prisoner; but there are no marks of mine on them that enable me to say I have seen them before. I apprehended the prisoner at Bow, on Wednesday morning, about eleven o'clock, the day after. The prisoner lived at Bow Common. It was just by Bow Fair Field where I found him. He had a bundle when I appreheaded him. I took him from Bow to Limehouse, and there. I delivered him into the hands of the night beadle and constable; Lisles, and a person named Jones. I gave the bundle to the officers, as well as the prisoner; I gave them the bundle. I delivered it on the premises where the robbery was committed; I was not present at the search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. This yard is about a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards from the highway; the back of the yard is near to the River, and the front is towards the highway. I do sometimes mark notes, but not constantly, I am not enabled to identify any note that I have seen that I passed to the prosecutors. It was between eleven and twelve when I heard this noise; the prosecutor was in the kiln-yard; he told me he had been robbed; he described to me who he thought it was; he was not so ill but he was well enough to describe the particulars of what had happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he did not know any of the persons by name - A. No; I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to describe the persons of any of them - A. I did. I was not present when the bundle was opened.</p>

            . I am night beadle of the parish of St. Ann Middlesex; that is where this lime-yard is In consequence of some information I received I saw the prosecutor Millard on the night of the 16th of July last, between twelve and one; he was in a room at Mr. Cranch's house; Mr. Cranch came into the room during the time. The prosecutor was lying with his face on the carpet, and there was some blood dropping from it; he seemed dreadfully hurt; he had several bruises about his face, one in particular under one of his ears, from which blood was coming. He said that Warren was one of the persons who robbed him; and in consequence of his telling me that, at four o'clock that morning I went to his house at Bow Common; he was not at home, and I searched the house for him deligently; not finding him, I gave up the search then. He was delivered to me afterwards by Mr. Cranch; Mr. Cranch pointed him out to me in the yard, and I took the prisoner; and Mr. Cranch gave me the bundle, and the prisoner said it was his own. I am sure that is the bundle, and it has been looked on up at the watchhouse ever since; I have kept the key of that place ever since; there is a pair of white silk stockings as one article, a black silk handkerchief, a sailor's relveteen jacket, a pair of velveteen small clothes, a red waistcoat, and a yellow handkerchief. I was present when the prisoner was searched. I have a memorandum mode at the time of the search; he had twentyone pounds five shillings and sixpence on him; a ten-pound note, one pound five shillings and sixpence in silver, ten one-pound notes, and seven-pence three farthings in copper. I also found on him a small bag, that the note was in. and a case knife; there was also a bill of parcels which Mr. Jones took; I saw these things taken.</p>
               <p>-JONES. I am a constable of Limehouse. I was called out of my bed on the 17th; at about twelve or one in the night, between the 16th and 17th; I was called. I got up, and went to the watchhouse, and when I came there I saw Millard in a terrible state with a bruised head; a medical man was sent for belonging to the parish, and he dressed the wounds, and after that, we took him to the workhouse, and after that, I thought it prisoner was one by what Millard told me; when we had done what we could for the safety of the man, we went immediately to a house in Ann-street; we knew where the prisoner lived, and we went to his house; that must be about three and four o'clock in the same morning. He was not there; we did not like to enter the house forcible, so I left some of the persons to take care of it, and then I and 
               <persName id="t18160918-2-person66">Brown</persName>
             the police officer went to Old Ford, and fetched the prisoner's son; and he shewed us the house, and the prisoner was not there. We found nothing in the house only about five or six club sticks under Warren's bed. I was one of the persons to whom the bundle was delivered. After that I came into the lime-house; we went to Cranch's yard, and the prisoner was delivered to us, and the bundle. On searching the prisoner, in his watch-fob I found twenty-one pounds in bank notes, and one pound five shillings and sixpence; the different sums mentioned by the last witness; here is a bill of parcels also that I found on the prisoner along with the notes; these were all the things beside a case knife and a bag. We went to Mr. Swift's, in Houndsditch, and got some information; I have kept the notes locked up ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Before the 17th of July, I did not know where the prisoner lived. I went to a house which somebody told me belonged to him. His son told me he slept there.</p>
               <p>(A bill of parcels was here put in, and read, and was for articles of wearing apparel bought of Mr. Swift, a slop-seller, on the 17th of July, amount three pounds four shillings.</p>

            . On the 17th of July last, I was in the employment of Mr. Smith; he is a woolen draper and clothier. I know the prisoner at the bar; I saw him on that day. I think nearer seven than eight in the mornings, it was at my master's shop I saw him; there was another young man with him, whom I should know if I were to see; they came there both together; I never saw them before.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180006"/>I was in the shop when the bill of parcels was made out. I did not hear the prisoner mention his name. I saw a note produced; I received a thirty pound note from Dalton; the first note I saw was a thirty-pound note that Dalton gave me; he is one of Mr. Swift's men; I don't know how Dalton came to have it; I did not see any one give that note to Dalton. I got change for it; I believe there were a ten-pound note, two five-pound notes, and the rest in one-pound notes; I brought the change back, and delivered it to Mr. Dalton; I did not see what he did with it; I was called into the wareroom sometime after, and there received a twenty-pound note from the other man that was with the prisoner; that was given me to get change of. I went to get change for that; I brought it back, and put it on the table, and the man took it himself; the man that gave it to me took it up; the change I got was all in Bank of England notes; I did not see Mr. Dalton pay the prisoner nor the other the change I got for the thirty-pound note, nor do I know what became of the change of the twenty-pound note after it was taken by the other man.</p>

I sent that note to the Bank; the banker's clerk has got it in court. I am positive sure that that is the note; it has Mr. Swift's name on it, I wrote Swift on it becaue Moore was in his employ. I never cashed any other note of thirty-pound for him but th1s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WHITETHORN. I live at the Angel, in Fenchurch-street. I gave change to Moore for a twenty-pound-note on the 17th of July last; I made a mark on it; I marked it "T. W. of Mr. Swift's man, Hounsditch, 17th of July." This is the note, I am positive sure of it from what I myself put on it; I wrote this on the same day I gave him change. I kept it in my possession, and the next day afterwards, Mr. Jones came with another officer. I am positive that is the note; then I took it to the police-office. I gave a ten-pound-note in-change. (The ten-pound-note found on the prisoner produced.) I look at that note; that is the note, I know it because there is the words "of Mr. Jones' man" on it, and I know it by that, because I gave change for it to one of Mr. Jones' men, of Aldgate.</p>

I had twenty-five sheep on the 25th of August; I saw them on Saturday morning, the 24th of August, they were in my field, at the bottom of Harrow Town. On the Sunday morning one was gone; it was a fat sheep; I had paid three pounds for it. From ten until one o'clock, I looked all about the fields, and at last I went into a little field adjoining that of mine, there I saw a hole in the hedge, where one had been driven there, and I saw the blood where one had been killed, and I traced the dropping of the blood across another field about and hundred yards; there I traced it up a lane about a quarter of a mile, by the blood into a field where it was stripped; then I traced it by the blood from stile to stile, where it had been rested, to within a hundred yards of the prisoner Martin's house. I went to his house, he was up stairs, I said, Martin come down, I went to speak to you; he did come down, and I asked him if he had any mutton in the house, and he said, no master, I have not, and then I told the beadle to come forward with his warrant, and search, and he looked into a cupboard, and brought out a pan of fat, Martin was then going to go away; but I told him to stay where he was. Then the constable proceeded with a search, and found the heart, the liver, and the lights, and then he went up stairs and brought down a hinder quarter of mutton, a shoulder, and a whole neck, and part of a breast. Then I said to Martin, well Daniel, have you not been robbing me now? he said, master, I did not know it was your sheep, if I did, I would not have touched it on any account; and I said, Daniel, you must have had some confederate with you beside yourself, or else you never could have done it? he said, he had none. The wife said, Daniel, if you won't split, I will; the wife said, Sears was his partner. Then she said, Daniel, when you come home with the mutton, I told you you would be found out, and she fell in a fit. Then Martin said, if you go to Sears's, you will find the remainder of your sheep there. Then

Then he said, master, this is a bad job, but I must go through it, now I am in it; and then he said, come along with me, and then I will give you the mutton; he took us up stairs, and took us into the bed-room; he unlocked a door on the left hand side of his bed-room, and Martin, the beadle, went into the room, and took out a leg, loin, breast, and shoulder of mutton; that is just half the sheep. I said, Daniel, how came you to do so. I then took that mutton to Martin's, the prisoner, and then I compared that found at Sears's to that at Martin's, and I found that they both belonged to the same carcase; it was slaughtered pretly fair. I examined the fat; the trotters were not left on the carcase. One man could not have caught that sheep, and so slanghtered, and carried it that distance; it was impossible, for I am sure it weighed better than twelve stone. These men lived within two hundred yards of each other.</p>

Draper put the notes into his pocket-book, it was a small red pocketbook; when he opened the pocket-book. I saw a large roll of notes, two or three fingers thick. He doubled these three up with the rest, and put them into his pocket-book, which he put into his breeches pocket, this was about four o'clock in the afternoon.

            . I am a hair-dresser. I was in Barnet on the 8th of August, I was in the White Bear; I had been in that house about a quarter of an house before Draper came; Draper was totally a stranger to me; I never saw him before. We drank together; I joined his company. I saw him take out a pocket-book; but I could not tell whether he had any money or not; I did not see him pay any thing. From that we went along together, and stopped at another public-house at the end of the Town; we had a pint of beer there. The deceased did not produce any money there; I paid for the beer. We then went towards Endfield, and stopped at the Bald Face Stag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk or how - A. He had a cart and horse, and we rode. The prisoner kept that house. We arrived there about eight o'clock, as near as I can appoint the time; I saw Mr. Tuck there when we arrived; Draper and I went into the parlour, and had two or three glasses of gin and water together while we were there; there were several other persons in the house; I don't know the exact number; but I suppose eight or ten in the same room; I did not know any of them before. The prisoner Tuck came in and out on business, I mean serving his customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the liquor that he and you had - A. I paid for two glasses I know; but I did not see him pay for any.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he hold any conversation with any one in that room - A. No one in particular. I did not see any thing in his conduct until he had drank, and it was about ten o'clock; he was then rather insulting to Robinson, the black, and wanted to be ten pounds or twenty pounds; he did not pull out any notes; but he presented his pocket-book; it was a small red pocket-book, wrapt round with a piece of string; it appeared nearly full. The black told him he should not strike him; but if he struck him, he should take the law of him. I saw the deceased put the pocketbook back into his breeches pocket, and that was the last I saw of it. I left the room a little after ten; I saw nothing more while I was there. I proceeded on my road towards. Hoddesdon. The horse and cart belonging to Tuck overtook me; there was nobody in it; I returned to Tuck's with the horse and cart. Draper lived in Enfield Town, and the cart was going towards Draper's proper home. When I came back to Tuck's, I saw Draper there; he was in the parlour, where I left him. When I returned it was in about half an hour; Robinson, the black, and two or three others were there that I did not know. I had no conversation with Draper in particular. I tried to persuade him to go home. I saw Mr. Tuck, the prisoner, also that second time; he was at his busines. Droper sat down, and said, he would go after another glass or two. He and I went out to look for his horse and cart; he was then quite drunk; he was stupidly drunk. When we went out together, he coliared the hostler, and asked him where his horse and cart were; the hostler said be did not know; they had a scuffle together, and he threw the hostler down once. Draper appeared to me to be a very powerful man; he was about fifty years of age. The hostler wrestled with him, but was in perfect good humour. Then a hay maker came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180008"/>up to the door, and the deceased insisted on wrestling with the haymaker; the haymaker said he did not want to have any thing to do with him. Then he collared the haymaker, and the haymaker threw him twice by tripping him up; no blows passed. Then he wanted to fight with the haymaker; but the haymaker pushed him off with his fist, merely, in his own defence. Mr. Tuck then came out,and took the deceased from the haymaker. Then I went on, on foot, and about a mile before I got to Enfield Town, I overtook the horse and cart; I got into it, and gave the horse his head, and he stopped at a house which I afterwards found out to be Draper's. I told the people of the house where I left him. The next day I saw him dead, about three o'clock; If examined his person; I looked at the body; Tuck was in the house when I saw the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. When he produced his pocket-book there were ten or twelve persons in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance is the well from the place where the deceased was wrestling - A. About twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was no distance for a drunken man to waddle - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Are there not six or seven feet of the circumference of the well without any fence - A. When I saw it the fence was broken down. The prosecutor was a stout man, and able to make a good deal of resistance. So much of the fence as remained was a filmsey thing, and good for nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. And Draper would take a good deal of beating before he could be forced into a well - A. He was very powerful indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe he had a good stout bull dog, which I believe if he had been attacked could have afforded a good deal of resistance - A. I understand that dog was found on the premises the next morning.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDERWS. Draper had lost his dog. I was never at Tuck's house before.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Bald Face Stag. I remember John Draper coming there the night before he was found drowned in the well; he came there a good bit before dark; he was in company with some delicate mechanical sort of man, like the witness James Smith; it was a beautiful night as ever I saw. Draper took me by the collar; in that scuffle he fell down poor man; I gave him no blow. I then went into the tap-room, and had my pint of beer. Afterwards my master said, go and look for that old man; he has lost his horse and cart, go and look in the field; I went and looked over all the field, and found nobody there only. the bitch in the yard; it was in the same close where the well was. I then went and laid on some straw over the barn. I can't tell what o'clock it was, as there was no clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Did he not seem anxious about the poor man, and did he not tell you to go in search of him - A. Yes. This well is a wonderful size it is about eight feet over; there was about three feet from pole to pole where there was no fence. The next morning the fence was in the same state that it was in before; it was not broken down until the people came pressing on it. I saw the dog afterwards; it was a little brindle crop, a little on the cross, not through bred; I should not think the dog could defend Mr. Draper; there were bushes over part of the well, and there were about four feet without any bushes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WEEB. I was at work for Mr. Paris, in August last, at making hay. I remember the night this misfortune befel. Draper; I was at the Bald Face Stag as near ten as I can say; I saw Draper there, and felt him; he was outside in the road in front of the house; I never saw him before. He caught me very fast by the collar, and said he would wrestle with me; I said, my friend, I am no wrestler. He then wrestled with me, and kicked me twice on the legs; I was hurt by him; I took it in good part; I did not strike him; I tried to keep myself on my feet. He could not have sustained any injury from what happened between me and him; he fell twice, and I with him; he fastened upon me, and would not release me, and so we fell together; the second time in our getting up he slipped his hold of my collar, and I got away from him. I saw him coming at me again; then I stept up to him, and pushed him down on his backside; I pushed him with my open hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Did any thing more pass between you and him - A. No. I saw him then get up, and go into the house. I did not see any more of him. I did not see the prisoner Tuck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I took him to be an elderly man.</p>
               <p>Q. But a good heavy man, so that if he fell he might get a bruise on his head - A. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You were hurt by the fall - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And he being more heavy than you, was more likely to be hurt.</p>

             was there; he was in the front parlour; there were other persons in that room. The deceased had a young dog there; I dare say it might be seven or eight months old, it was a little small bull dog, and he had it in a chain. I stand in that company, until I persuaded Draper to go home, that is until I persuaded him to go out for that purpose; he was a neighbour of mine, and lived close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he well acquainted with Tuck's premises - A. He knew the house very well; it is about three miles and a half, or three miles and a quarter from his own house. I left off telling him to go home at about half past nine or ten; I had tried to persuade him to go; at last he went away, leaving me in the room. The prisoner Tuck was in and out constantly in the course of his business. But I am going to tell you that the deceased got talking about fighting with the black; I believs the black was a fighting man; he began to play his tricks with the black, and the black said, friend I shan't hit you but if you strike me, I shall take the law of you.</p>
               <p>Q. While the deceased was in the room, did you see him pull out any pocket-book - A. Yes, a <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180009"/>middling sized red pocket-book; I did not see it opened; it was in his hand; he talked about laying a wager; I don't know whether it was full or empty; I did not see him pay for any liquor; I don't think he did. I don't know this well; I believe it was a sess-pool formerly. I had seen it, but not to take notice of it before this happened; it is upon a little descent. I don't recollect it before this happened. There seemed an old rotten rail round it; it was a little out of the foot-patch going to the brew-house, about forty yards one way, and six the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q.Was there any thing to prevent a man from stumbling into the well - A. I don't think there was a railing all the way round; I think there was a dippling place; it was not a very large hole; but I should think a man might fall into it. After Draper was gone out of the room, some of the company remained behind entertaining themselves, singing. I thought he had gone home. Robinson was there a good bit after Draper was gone.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. WALFORD. I think it was half an hour after the deceased was gone, that Robinson and they quitted the room.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham. I went to the Bald Face Stag on the 8th of August, I got there about eight o'clock in the evening; I saw Tuck there; he was in the bar. I remained there until nearly twelve at night; I knew Draper perfectly well; he was summonsing officer in the County Court; he was in the habit of collecting money, and of carrying a good deal about him at times. I have assisted him at times in executions. I saw him at Tuck's at a little after eight in the evening of the 8th of August; he was rather in liquor; a young man (who has been examined here to day,) was with him; he had a dog with him in a chain or string in the room; it was a small whitish dog; there were several persons in the room, and Draper was talking very loud to some of them. Tuck was in the room occasionally; but I did not hear any conversation from him to Draper, nor from Draper to him. I went into the bar to Mrs. Tuck to settle some business. Draper went out for some purpose or another. I can't tell in particular what passed on his returning. I did not see him produce any money or notes. He was very noisy and blunt, but I did not see him quarrel with any one. I was called out a second time by Mrs. Tuck, and the plaintiff and the defendant agreed to settle the warrant in the business I went there on.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe where Tuck was - A. I believe he went into the bar as I came out of it, and went into the room; he was about his business, serving his customers. I returned into the room where Draper was; he was drinking with his friend. I remained some time, and at last I told him I would ride home with him in his cart; it was agreed that I should go with him; he was very forward in liquor. I missed him out of the room a little before eleven, or about that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he went alone - A. No; about the same time I missed Crouch, Saunders, and Robinson, the pugilists, who were lodging at Tuck's house; they were in what is called training.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any one else at that time - A. I missed Mr. Tuck; I did not miss him at that time. When I missed Draper, I went outside the door to try if I could see him and his cart; I think at that time it was about eleven o'clock. The horse and cart were gone. I then came into the room again, and said to a man named Flowers, I believed that Draper had given me the double, for I meant to have gone home with him. I sat down, and had a glass of gin and water, and quitted the house about twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. After missing these three persons and Mr. Tuck, did you see them any more - A. I did not see either Crouch, Saunders, or Robinson; but I saw Tuck; I saw him in the parlour; it was getting about twelve when I saw him in his parlour; he was gone out of the parlour before I left the room; I believe he went about his business; the door is open to the bar. I could not see from the room where I was into the parlour behind the bar where he was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then where Tuck or the other three persons were, you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand he came into the room where you were, about half an hour before you went away - A. Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing in his appearance at that time - A. No, not in the least; he did not appear to be alarmed. My house is at Tottenham, and I went there that night. I knew Tuck's premises; but I have not seen the well above twice; I saw it when the Coroner was viewing it; I stood by his side; that was about three days after the man was found dead in the well.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get from the house to the well - A. I went through the field gate myself; I believe there is a door from the back of the house also into the skittle-ground; there is a small well just by that; but the other lies more on the left; there is a fence which separates the four corner ground from the field, or close where the well is; there are some boards to stop the ball in playing, over which a person might get. The top of the well was nearly covered over when I saw it; there was a dipping place left open about three feet over; there was a gradual ascent to the top of the well; it might be eight or nine inches rise, or probably a foot; the posts were broke off close to the ground, and the rail and all was down. Before the railing was down, I don't think any one could fall into the well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. From post to post, was it not at least six feet - A. Yes, it might be that. The well was covered with furzes, and such like; if a man walked upon that covering it would yield.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say Tuck was absent, you don't mean to say he was out of the house - A. No.</p>

             there; he was in the front parlour; I was in his company about an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180010"/>hour. The prisoner at the bar was going in and out about his business while I was there. The last I saw of the deceased was that he was going out of parlour to go home as I thought; he went out alone. The young man Smith who has been examined went out a few minutes before; there were other persons left the room about the same time; there were seven or eight, whose names I could mention. It was about ten I saw him go out; I did not see him pull any money out. I continued there about an hour after he was gone; I was not in the same room; but I was in the parlour behind the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. I had business by the house; Mrs. Tuck applied to me to borrow some money; she said, she wanted to make up a certain sum for her brewer; I supplied her with six pounds. I saw a packet of bank notes in her possession at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave her that money, did she signify that that would be sufficient to answer her purpose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased after that - A. Yes, for this took place about nine o'clock in the evening. Draper was there when I went; I saw Tuck about eleven; he asked his wife for the key of his bedroom, and he went off, as I supposed to bed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. WALFORD. I had received five of those six notes from Mr. Paris's housekeeper; there were five of them old notes; I can't tell where I got the other; I had had it some days.</p>

            . On the 8th of August last, I was in the house of the prisoner Mr. Tuck. I saw the deceased John Draper in the house; I saw him somewhere about half past ten; I am not positive for a few minutes; there was a person there named Church; he is not here; he has been arrested, and is in the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I was there a number of times; I was there on the morning of the 8th, I saw the deceased come up to the house that morning, he had a horse and cart, and said he was going to Barnet, The prisoner spoke to him kindly; he spoke of him before he came up to the house; we were at breakfast, and the window was open, and we saw the deceased coming up with the horse and cart; and the prisoner said, here is Mr. Draper coming, as good an old man as ever lived; he said he understood he had been a man of considerable property, but through some misconduct of his own or law affairs, his relations got it. They shook hands together through the window, when Draper came up; there seemed to be a condiality and friendship between them. I was there in the evening, Draper was there very drunk, and very much disposed to quarrel; he was forward in liqoor when he came. He wanted the dog to fight; he went out, and brought his dog in in his arms; there was a dog of Tuck's in the room; the deceased took the chain and collar off his dog, and threw it down, and wanted it to fight; Tuck would not permit them to fight, and secured his dog. Several persons strave to persuade the prisoner to go, as he was so drunk; Tuck repeatedly told him to go. When I went to bed I heard a man's foot on the stairs coming up. Tuck was the only man in the house that was going to sleep there, that was not in bed. Before we came up, he declared it his intention of going to lied. He went by our door. Draper had left the room in which we were all sitting, at about half past ten; I can't tell exactly to a moment as there was no clock.</p>

             had gone into the house before I came up; they were ahead of me, and went into the house. When I came up to the house I saw four men run out of it quite hasty out of the front door; I knew none of them but the landlord of the house, I mean the prisoner at the bar; he was the first, I knew him by his voice, and it being a moonlight night, I could see him. The landlord said, d-n his old eyes he is gone this way, I know he has gone round here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the others say any thing - A. Yes, another of them said we will give him a good hiding and we will kick his-. They went in a direction towards the well. I then went on about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Bricket and Austin - A.They were in the house before these men came out. I knew one of them to be 
               <persName id="t18160918-4-person105">Tuck</persName>
             the prisoner; I knew neither of the others. I had come near half a mile, and I heard Mr. Corvyn's clock strike twelve. It was after I heard this that it struck; I counted it. I worked late that night. I had been to town with a load of hay, and stood in the market until it was sold, I brought back a lord of ashes; and got to Mr. Tuck's at ten o'clock at night and left the load before his door; I left it opposite his house in the road. I took the horses out and left the waggon in the road. From that time until I returned past Tuck's house, I was employed in doing my horses. I put them up at Beech-Hill, where my master lives about a quarter of a mile from Tuck's house. I had three horses to do, and nobody to help me. Returning from Beech Hill, to my own lodgings, I pass Tuck's house. The next morning I mentioned some part of what I had seen, but not all. I mentioned it to

            , and Jem Seymour, and nobody else. I had not heard anything at that time, I told them there was a row at Tuck's house, I did not tell them that I heard the men swear; I said there was a row and they ran into the Field. I heard that morning that Master Draper had met his death.</p>
               <p>Q.After, the conversation with Harvey - A. No, before. The hostler came to Beech Hill to fetch some water, and told us there was an old man drown<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180011"/>ed in the well; and I told him that I heard a row there that night as I was coming by; that was all that passed between me and Harvey about it. I did not go to see the man after that. It had been a moonlight night, but not quite so clear as it sometimes is I was acquainted with the well, and saw it a good many times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I am a carter. I took up the load of ashes at six o'clock in the evening in London; It is about twelve miles from town, to Tuck's house. I mean positively to say it was ten o'clock. I know a Mr. Langdale, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have heard Mr. Langdale's name, I will ask you on your oath, was it ten o'clock when you placed your load of ashes opposite Tuck's house - A. Yes, I am sure it was as late. It would take me two hours nearly to take the horses from the cart to the stable, and to clean them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now upon the oath you have taken, was it nine or ten o'clock, when you first arived at Tuck's with your cart - A. Ten. I had something to drink in the Haymarket, before I quitted town. I had nothing more to drink until I came to Bowes Farm; I had nothing to drink from Mr. Laugdale.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you told all this story to the Justice - A. I told it to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. I asked you the Justice - A. Yes, on the Monday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the names of Bricket and Austin - A. No, all but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell that anybody was with you at the time you heard this at the door - A. No; because there was nobody with me when I saw these man come out of the house. They were forward, and gone into the house. I did not know the bruisers; I knew the boxing men were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Justice, that the men were going out to have a fight - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Justice asking you, why you did not stay to see the fight as it was light enough - A. Yes, and I told him, because I had been up two nights. I have always been very good friends with Tuck; I never took out a warrant against him, Groom did. One of the boxers gave me a blow once; that was on the Monday night, previous to the night in question; I went to the door, to ask for a pot of beer, the door was shut, but there were lights in the house; I believe it might be near twelve o'clock; I made a noise at the door, and Mrs. Tuck said, who is there, and I told my name, and said what I wanted, and she said, Johnson, you will get no beer here to night. I then said, bring me a pot of ale, and a prize fighter; and then one of them came out, and knocked me right off the three steps. When I got up, I made a start, and he came and kueched me down again. It was Groom that took the warrant out. When I passed Tuck's on the night in question, I went to Cock Forsters, I went by myself. These four men that came out of the house went to the left, and I went to the right; in point of fact, we went two different ways.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I have never had any ill-will in the least towards the prisoner; I was a little sancy, and it was Church that came out, and beat me.</p>
               <p>-LONGDALE. I am Squire Paris's buileft. I know Johnson, the last witness; he is my carter; I have also two carters named Bricket and Austin; Austin is a boy.</p>

               <p>Q.On the 8th of August, what time did Johnson come home from Town - A.About a quarter before nine, as near as I can tell. When he came home he had to do up his horses, and feed then; what would take him perhaps two hours; but he might have been an hour and a half that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any beer to Johnson that night - A. Yes, and there were several more of the men present; I think I gave about seven quarts strong and small that night, among them in Mr. Paris's stables. I am not positive that Johnson drank any of the beer; but he was in the stables at the time it was there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. This beer was given for all the persons in the stables; some of the hay-carters who had come up with the last load of hay were there. Johnson did not tell me the next morning that he had seen four persons rush out of Tuck's house. The last time I saw him that night was between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BRICKET. I am a carter in the employ of Mr. Paris. On the 8th of August, I was employed at hay-cart very late. Johnson went to London with the team; he had not come in with his horses when I came to the stables; he does not put his horses in the same stable where I put mine. I saw the beer served out; Johnson was not there then that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q.How soon did you see Johnson that night - A. About an hour before I came down to the Stag; he was in the stable then walking up and down; he had not done his horses. About twelve, Johnson, Austin, and I went from the stables; Johnson asked the watchman the time, and he said, he was going to cry twelve; this was a watchman of Mr. Paris's, his name is Thomas Hillyard. Austin and I were going to the Stag, and Johnson was going on to his lodgings at Cock Fosters. We all went on together to the stag; I was first; we were in discourse together with one another all the way. When we got to the Stag, Austin and I went into it; Johnson went on, and we saw no more of him that night. As I was going to London the next morning, I intended to have some beer and bread and cheese, at the Bald Face Stag; I asked Mrs. Tuck, who was in the bar for it. I did not see any one else, but what were in the tap-room; there was the servant boy and girl there, the old ostler, and three Irishmen who worked for my master. We did not get the bread and cheese at first; Mrs. Tuck said it was past hours. Then she hallooed out to the boy to go and ask his master, if she might let me have some bread and cheese; the boy went out, and coming in immediately said, she might do as she pleased. The boy had gone out at the back door; he returned in a very short time. The boy then brought the bread and cheesc into the tap-room; after I got the refreshment, we continued there twenty minutes at the farthest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time while you were in the house that night see Tuck - A.No. After that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180012"/>went to my home at Mr. Paris's, The back door goes into the Four corner ground, and to the stables.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I can be positive the watchman said twelve, and not eleven; it was in answer to a question of Johnsons that he said so. To the best of my knowledge Johnson had no share of the beer that was for the carters in the stables. I did not see Mr. Langdale come into the stables while we were having the beer. After the beer was drank, we waited nearly half an hour for Johnson. We went along talking together all the way, When we came to the corner, we bid Johnson good night; I did not look after him. When we crossed the bridge, we went to the left, into the public-house, and Johnson went to the right. We crossed the bridge together, Johnson was in discourse with me when we crossed the bridge. We went about a pole, before the road leans to go to Cock Fosters. I did not see four men rush out of the Stag. I did not hear any one make any exclamation or cry out. When we were going into the public-house, Johnson was walking steadily on towards Cock Fosters. If any men had rushed out as he passed I must have seen them, and if they said any thing I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is the road going to Cock Fosters, a straight road - A. Yes, and from it you can see the front of the Bald Faced Stag.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.But a man going towards Cock Fosters, would have his back towards the Bald Facedstag - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long after Johnson parted from you, was it before you went to the public-house - A.about two minutes. We went in at the front door, and neither saw nor heard any thing. I was at the stag on the Monday night previous, when Johnson got the licking, that was between eleven and twelve o'clock; the door was shut and fastened. On the night in question the boy was not gone long to ask his master; he was gone a very short time. I saw Johnson on Friday. He did not ask me any question about any one rushing out of the Bald Faced Stag. A young woman told me of the death of this poor man.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Johnson had not got such a way from the Bald Face Stag; when we went in; but he might have heard the voice of a person coming out.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Paris. I remember going along with the last witness to the Bald Face Stag, on the night of the 8th of August; Johnson set off with us from Mr. Paris's; the watchman at that time said, he was going to cry the hour of twelve. We all came down the hill together. We did not part at all until we came to the Inn. We went into the house, and Johnson went to Cock Forsters; we all kept close together until we came to the Inn. We had some beer and bread and cheese. When I came away, we left a girl, a boy, three Irishmen, and the hostler there. We had some difficulty at first in getting the refreshment we called for, but the mistress sent the boy out backward to his master, to ask him if she might serve it; when he returned which was in a very short time, he said that she might do as she pleased. The reason she refused it at first, was because it was after hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. I think it was darkish that night; but it was not moon-light. I had part of the beer that was given to the men in the stable; I can't say rightly whether Johnson was there, and had any of it or not. I saw Johnson's back turned towards us as I went into the stag. I did not see anybody come out as I went in.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARVEY. I am a carpenter, living at Cock Forsters. I was at the Bald Face Stag on the night of the 8th of August, between nine and ten o'clock; I saw a man there of the name of Draper, I saw him wresting with a haymaker; he did not receive any injury then that I know of. I saw Johnson there; I saw him leave a load of dung or ashes or something opposite the door of the Bald Face Stag. John on told me that he heard a noise the night before, when I saw him the next morning, he told me he heard there was a man drowned; these were the words he told me. I did not ask him who the men were that he said he saw come out, nor did he mention any particular expression they used. He said he heard a noise, and scuffle in the Bald Face Stag, and one of the men said he is gone round this way, we will follow him. Nothing passed more between us two.</p>
               <p>-HILLYARD. I was watchman to Squire Paris, in August last. I remember Bricks, Austin, and Johnson going away from Mr. Paris's the night before the man was drowned; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock; I had called eleven about half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by MR. DOWLING. I told them it was near twelve; I will swear positively it was half past eleven. Johnson lodged at my house at Cock Forsters; he did not say a word to me the next day about any thing he had heard or seen as he passed the Bald Face Stag; I went home between five and six the next morning to go to bed.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. WALFORD. I can't say I saw him the next day.</p>

            . I have been servant to Mr. Tuck between three and four months; I knew Mr. Draper; I remember seeing him at the Bald Faced Stag on the 8th of August, he had a glass of gin and water; I did not see my master wait upon him. I think I went to bed about half past ten or eleven, I am not sure, as there was no watch. I lit a candle for Mr. Church to go to bed, I think my master was in the room where the company sits when I went to bed. Draper was there; I did not hear him wrangling with any one. Sometimes we shut up at ten, and sometimes eleven. I think my master called me about a quarter before five; he called me twice, the second time was soon after the first. It was his custom to knock at the wall, or my door always. About seven o'clock, I went to the well to draw water; the well was in the same state as usual, only there was a piece of wood that went across, was broken in two or three pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear to have been broken since you had been at the well before - A. That which was broken was a fence that ran round the top of the well the dipping place where I dipped for water, was large enough for a man to tumble in. When I dipped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180013"/>for water was large enough for a man to tumble in. When I dipped the pail, I saw the deceased's hat and face. I went to get assistance directly; I said, good gracions master, there is a man in the well; my masters was letting the fowls out of the fowl-house at that time. He went and looked, and said, good gracious, I suppose it is the poor old hostler. He appeared very much frightened. The body was in an erect posture, just against the pipe of the well; the water was rather thick. My master came to Robinson, the black, who was cleaning his shoes, and he said, good gracious Robinson, there is the poor old hostler in the well. I saw the body after it was taken out of the well; it was in the brewhouse. I heard my master say that he, Robinson, Crouch, and Saunders had taken the deceased out of the well. Draper's brother came about breakfast time. My master could not eat any breakfast, it shocked him so. Mr. Draper's brother was sent for by my master. I am still in the service of the prisoner's family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Then your poor master was feeding the fowls when you gave him the alarm, and he was so shocked that he could eat no breakfast - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A drunken man going out into the yard, might easy find his way up to the well, and without much difficulty might tumble in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The railing was very rotten - A. Yes, I should think so. I think the railing would have broken if any one pushed against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a place of all others where the body of a murdered person would be sure to be found - A. Yes. My mistress chiefly manages the business; she pays and receives the money. I remember Bricket and Austin coming for the bread and cheese. I gave it them, and went to bed. I went to bed before my master.</p>

On that morning my master gave me a parcel; he told me I was to go with it, before the body was found; but he gave me the parcel to take after it was found. He told me the over night that I should have to go to Enfield; he told me so at seven o'clock the night previous. It was a very little time after the man was found in the morning that he gave me the parcel. He did not any particular what the parcel was, but he told me to take it to the brewer's, Mr. Etteridge; I gave that parcel to a little boy at the brewer's, in the same state as I received it.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Brailsford, the brewer, at Enfield. Tuck was a customer at our house. I remember the last witness coming to our house about half past seven in the morning of the 9th of August; he gave me a parcel; that parcel contained twenty pounds; eighteen one-pound notes, and two pounds in silver; I kept them about ten minutes, and then gave them to Etteridge, the clerk. I put Tuck's name on each of the notes before I handed them over to Etteridge; I also wrote on them the day of the month and the year, and C. Smith. I don't know that I ever before received any notes from Tuck myself. I should know any of those notes again.</p>

               <p>PHILIP ETTERIDGE. I am clerk to Mr. Brailsford, the brewer, at Enfield. On the morning of the 9th of August, I received eighteen one-pound notes and two pounds in silver from the last witness Smith. One of that parcel of notes was afterwards shewn to Mr. Reynolds. I delivered all them to Draper. I had calied on the morning previous at Tuck's for money; I called again at about four o'clock the same afternoon, I saw Mrs. Tuck; I told her I had a bill to make up, and she said, I should have the money the next morning at half past seven. They were pretty regular in their payments generally; we had no fault to find with them on that account.</p>
               <p>-DEAPER. I am the brother of the deceased. I did not see my brother when he went out in the morning. The deceased's son came to me about eight in the morning of the 9th; and about nine I went to Tuck's, and saw the body; it was in the brewhouse, with its clothes on; I saw Tuck there; he was the first person I saw; I believe I spoke to him first; I asked him if he had taken care of my brother's property, and he said what property he had about him, he had then, and he did not know he had any property. He said, I should see him, and what property he had about him, I might search him. I then proceeded to search the deceased, with the assistance of his son, and he took from him these two books; they had nothing but Court matters in them; also a small purse, with nine shillings in silver and a halfpenny; they were very wet when I got them, the water had penetrated through them. Tuck saw the body; he turned very sick, and was very much agitated, and turned away, and went out to the end of the brewhouse. He reached very much. I left his house almost immediately. He had told me how they found him. I was very frequently with my brother, he was in the habit of having money. I supposed he had some money on that day; but I did not know what he had. Mr. Tuck knew how he got his living. I should suppose he must have done business for him. I received eighteen one-pound notes from Mr. Etteridge on the 13th; I have sixteen of them in my pocket, and Read has the other two.</p>

I did not examine them until I got two or three hundred yards from the prisoner's house.

             there, I made a payment to him on the account of a client of mine named Chapel, I paid him three pounds. I look at one of the two one-pound notes produced, and know it to be one of these I paid to Draper on the 8th of August; I know it by"19l" put upon it, I put it on myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put that on it - A. Because on the 17th, I had taken a large sum of money in notes, and in counting them over, I put the ones altogether, and when they amounted to nineteen pounds, I put"19l" on the outside note. Draper was the only person I paid out of that money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I was examimined at Hatton Garden. I paid Draper from the outside of the roll of notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at Hattop Garden, say that you could not say whether you took them from the outside or the inside - A. I did not call it to mind at the moment. I don't recollect that I did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked to write the figures "19" - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Are these the figures you made, in compliance to that request; (putting a piece of paper with the figures "19" on it, into the hands of the witness.) - A. I really don't know; that is not the way I usually make "19"; I can't say whether it 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been wagering on this subject; have you not been wagering that that man will be convicted to day - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, have you not bet ten pounds, that that man will be convicted to day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know a person of the name of Dray - A. Yes. The fact was, I saw Mr. Dray at the office, and the wager was ten to one, that he would be committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only wager you have laid on this subject - A. Yes it 1s. I have offered no other. I don't know a Mr. Davison of Charing Cross. I don't know that I ever saw him to my knowledge. (Another paper put into the hands of witness, with the figures"19"on it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Now we come back to the "19" again; did you or did you not write that "19" A.- I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how can you swear to the "19" on the note - A. I can swear to it. I said when I wrote the nineteens at Hatton Garden, that I did not think they would be like that on the note, because I wrote them on the back of a book; and I wrote that on the note at my own office, and at my case on my desk.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I had no knowledge of Mr. Tuck, until I was called on upon this transaction. I look at this note again; I believe I might swear to it, by the name of the Bank clerk,"Barkwaite," as there was a person at Cheshunt of the same name. I had seen that note on the evening before.</p>

            , JUNIOR. I live at Cheshunt. I remember my father having a quantity of notes, to the amount of five hundred pounds on the evening of the 17th of 
               <persName id="t18160918-4-person117">August. He</persName>
             marked the roll of ones"19l," because there were nineteen notes. He marked them, that he might not have to count them over again. I look at this note; I know it; the "19l" is my father's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How came you to open that note, and look at the front of it before you answered - A. I think it is proper to look at a thing before I swear to it. I saw my father write the "19". I was at Hatton Garden office. I did not say then, that I saw my father write it. I told Mr. Harmer at the time, that I could swear to it; Mr. Harmer said, that he thought my father's evidence was not true, and then I said, I could prove it as well as he could.</p>
               <p>KESIAH STREITS. I knew Mr. Draper, the officer of the County Court. In July last, I had to pay him some money. I saw him on Wednesday, the 10th; I paid him one pound four and four pence; I paid him a one pound note, and four shillings in silver. I should know the note again if I saw it; it had two names on it and J M; they were on it when I gave it him. I had received it about a quarter of an hour before from a person of the name of Mrs. Naylor. I had no more notes in my possession when I paid that away. Draper wrote on it when I paid it to him; he wrote my name Strits, which was an improper way of spelling it; he put J B at the bottom for John Brown, at whose suit the debt was incurred. (Note put into the hand of the witness.) That is the note; I can positively swear to it; there is the mark J M on it, and Callaway, and Mr. Morevin, then Streits; he said, if this note should be lost, or if there should be a dispute about it, I should know it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was about a week after Draper's death that I saw this note again.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the front of that note, and you will see J. Rose 267, that is the 26th of the 7th month; was that on it when you parted with it to Draper - A. Yes, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as sure of that as every thing else - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Were these words Pocock 1st of the 8th - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.There is Neat 3rd of the 8th month; was that on it when you gave it to Draper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you are sure is as true as all the rest you have said - A. Yes. Mr. Draper pointed out the name of Rose to me. Mr. Draper's brother brought the note to me after the death of the deceased. I told him about the name of Callaway. I did not tell him about the name of Rose; I told him Neat was on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKE. I am a surgeon, residing at Enfield. I was called to examine the body of the deceased on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180015"/>Saturday, the 10th of 
               <persName id="t18160918-4-person118">August.</persName>
             I examined the head, and observed marks of bruises about the head, face, and side of the neck, both cheeks, and under the left ear; on the face were marks of violent bruises as if from a fist. At that time I did not make any particular examination. Tuck said he had been fighting with one of the persons. At that time, his being found in the well, I thought a sufficient cause for his death. By the desire of the Coroner on the 13th and 14th I made a more particular examination; Mr. Holt was then with me. The body was then brought to Enfield at the second examination. I think, from the result of that examination, that the blow on the neck, might have been sufficient to stun him, or render him insensible. I could not then discover any blow that could have occasioned his death. But if I had found the deceased on the ground dead, I should have attributed his death to that blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. At first I thought that his being in the well was quite a sufficient cause for his death. When I saw it the second time, the blow by the neck had become much more visible; the weather had been hot, and the body had been kept nearly a week.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I know Mr. Reynolds of Cheshunt. I was at Hatton Garden at the examination of the prisoner Tuck. I saw Mr. Reynolds there, and had a conversation with him about the event of the examination; the conversation was concerning the innocence or guilt of the prisoner. I knew Mr. Reynolds by doing agency for him as a Country attorney. I stated to him that it was my opinion that at that period there was no case against the prisoner to convict him, not commit; he differed from me in opinion by stating that he was sure to be hanged. I said it could not be. I said, I would lay him ten pounds to one that the evidence that had been adduced against the prisoner up to that period could not convict the prisoner. I shook him by the hand as a token that the bet was made. In about a minute he turned round, and said it was a mistake, and that he ment a commitment, and not a conviction. I turned upon my heel, and went off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Curiosity took me to Hatton Garden. I don't know that I have ceased to be Mr. Reynold's agent. I have never seen Mr. Tuck twice in my life, until he was apprehended on this, once at his house, and once in Smithfield market. I was subpoened here today.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING now called a very considerable number of witnesses, who gave the prisoner an excellent character for humanity, honesty, and integrity.</p>

As I was going along there, I was suddenly stopped by some men, and the two prisoners at the bar held me fast; they held my arms; I cannot tell whether each of them held an arm, as it was done instantaneously; I am sure they were about my person. There was nothing more particular happened to me, only I saw a lad run away, and I suppose he had got the watch; I know I had my watch when I first came into the street, about two minutes before. That lad ran away, I did not feel the watch go; I believe I had it in my possession immediately before the two men laid hold of me. As soon as I was liberated, I discovered that my watch was gone, and then I called stop thief. There was a gold chain and a gold seal to my watch; it was a watch that went upon a diamond, and it was silver; I have never seen it since. The two prisoners were stopt directly afterwards; they did not run, but they walked away very fast. They had not got an hundred yards, before they were stopped. I am quite sure they both assisted in holding of me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. That was within a few minutes of one, in a street which is rather short, and rather narrow. Mr. Elwes is the man sent for to take them into custody. They were walking away, they had no hand in robbing me, but they held me fast. I did not say to Mr. Elwes that I could not swear they held me. Mr. Elwes keeps an oil shop in White-chapel; he was sent for. His house and shop are not in a situation as to enable him to see what passed from them. I was alone in this street; there might be people in the street in which I was walking along. I first got Mr. Westcoat to assist me, and afterwards Elwes.</p>

I observed the old man shaking, and quaking, and I asked him what was the matter, and he said, those two men have robbed me of my watch; they had got better than an hundred yards off, and I went forward and seized them. I took them to a public-house, and Elwes searched them.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 15th of December, in the last year, did either of the prisoners come to your house - A. Yes, Mr. Vaughan, in company with Barrett; as near as I can recollect, it was about twenty minutes before five; it was darkish. I had left my work of cutting out, as I could not see to cut out, and I was drinking my tea, when they came in.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had you ceased to cut out, because it was not light enough - A. About ten minutes. Vaughan spoke to me before the other man, and said my name is Vaughan, and I am a Bow-street officer; and he gave me his card. He said, I know that your house is marked up to be robbed, and I am come to warn you, and if you will let me, we will take the men; this is Barrett my brother officer. Now they are very bad characters, and noted house-breakers, and if you do not let us take them, they will no doubt come when you are in bed and asleep, and most likely you or some of your family will get murdered. By these persuasions, I consented to Vaughan to protect my place, and then they both spoke to me. I consented to do as they should advise me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they then give you any advice - A. Yes, they told me to mark my cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner - A. The cloth in the long rolls, is all marked in a regular system, with a shop mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Vaughan propose any additional marks - A. Yes, he told me to mark some pieces that were on the counter and told me to lay them on the counter. I asked him how I should mark that which I was to lay on the counter, it being short cuts or lengths, and not marked as usual; they were cuts that lay about for present use. He took up my shears, and cut some bits of calico, little bits off; and then he nicked them, and they were pinned to the bits of cloth that lay on the counter; I don't know whether he pinned them, or shewed me how he pinned them on, but they were pinned on. There were cards on the regular rolls on the shelves; they did not want marking. I should think this was twenty-five minutes or half an hour before the thieves came. It was hardly a quarter of an hour before I went out with them. Just before we came away, the buy brought up a light and lit the lamp, and Vaughan ordered it to be put out, I can't say he gave any reason for desiring it to be put out. I don't know whether Vaughan or I put it out. He desired me to faston the door, not to lock it, but to latch it, but to be very particular about it, to take particular care that the latch caught, and was fastened, He, Barrett, and I quitted the shop together. Vaughan shewed, me how to fasten the latch, and said, now you do so; and be sure it is on the latch. Then we quitted the shop, and went over the way to Mr. Anderson's shop in front of mine, for the purpose of catching the thieves coming to plant them there. Vaughan asked me to get him into some neighbours house to watch. We went over to Mr. Andersons, and his eldest son gave leave for them to be there; that was Mr. Robert Embledon Anderson.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had stationed them there what did you do with yourself - A. Will you allow me to tell you, that young Anderson knew Vaughan, and he said, ah Vaughan, how are you. He more readily consented as he knew Vaughan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Vaughan and Barrett, what you had to do - A. Yes, I told them I had to go out and wait upon a gentleman, precisely at five o'clock. Before I left them, Vaughan and Barrett both spoke to me, telling me to mark any of the large rolls of cloth, beside what they had marked, and put them in the way. They told me I should loose nothing. I went across home, and told my wife I was satisfied that it was Vaughan the officer. I then took my candle and looked all round the shelves in my shop, and missed nothing. The lamps were not lighted, and I took the candle back into the parlour, leaving no light in the shop. I then told my wife to sit near the light if she thought proper. I then placed a boy on the stairs facing the passage door, I placed him to sit on the stairs; it was dark there, and if any thieves were to enter they could not see him there. They could well see my wife through the window, because my parlour has folding doors. Having made this preparation, I quitted the house to go to my customer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you quitted the house, how did you manage about the door - A. I latched it inside white I was inside, and went out by another door round by the passage. I ascertained that I had latched it, and that it was fast; I ascertained it both inside and out. I pursued Vaughan's directions and made every thing secure.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after Vaughan had quitted your house, was it before you quitted your house finally - A. About ten minutes or hardly so much; I know I was some few minutes beyond my time with the gentleman I was to have been with at five; he was Mr.

            , No. 8, Mecklenburgh Square. I think I might be about ten minutes running there, and back. It was about six or seven minutes after the time of my appointment that I set out to go. I had been detained about this business, and was gone I thought ten minutes; I don't think I could be more. This was the shortest day, and when I was setting out it was rather dark; the lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the face of a man - A. I have been reminded by Vaughan, that it must be the light of the oil shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell me of any light that you had from oil shops; from the light of Heaven, independent of of any artificial light, could you distinguish the features of a mans countenance - A. Yes, there was when I left my shop. I went to Mecklenburgh Square and was gone about ten minutes, As I was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180017"/>out of my shop, I met two men between me and the railings; they afterwards turned out to be Batts and Rawley, and were afterwards convicted here; they were about thirty yards from my shop; the street is but short.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as you were returning, did you see any one - A. Yes, I saw Rawley with a roll of cloth under his arm, and another person; it was superfine broad cloth; I let him pass me about ten or fifteen yards, and saw no one coming. Then I turned round to go after him; I did not cry stop thief for some time. He threw the cloth down under my feet; it stopped me, and I jumped over it, and followed him, and cried stop thief. I still pursued him; I caught him nearly opposite the Foundling Hospital, in Great Guildford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him - A. No. After I seized him, the officers came up immediately; I don't know where they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take the other person - A. They did; it turned out to be Farthing afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Farthing and Rawley taken to the watchhouse - A. I left them in custody, and returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got home, how much of your property did you find missing - A.Three pieces of superfine broad cloth. Vaughan told me he picked up the piece that Rawley threw down. Vaughan and Barrett came to my house again that night at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A.Vaughan was telling us a great deal about different robberies. I told him I had lost three rolls of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these - A. I believe I lost about thirty yards, worth about twenty-five shillings a yard. I told him I had lost three pieces, and he said he knew where to find them, and he knew where to find the other thieves; but I had, spiked the job by calling out stop thief; for he knew where to have gone and caught them together dividing the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get the other pieces again - A. I never did. Vaughan afterwards returned to me the piece he picked up; but not as it was before; it wanted about two yards and a quarter; the length of the piece had been seven yards and a quarter, and when he returned it to me it was about five yards. I appeared the next day at Bow-street against Rawley, and Farthing; and Batts had been taken then. Vaughan made application to me about the conducting the procecution. He asked me if I would employ a Counsel, and I told him I did not want to go to any expence, what I knew of myself was plain facts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Vaughan and you give evidence against Rawley, Batts, and Farthing on their trial here - A. Yes; but I did not swear to one because I did not know him; they were convicted.</p>
               <p>Q. After that verdict was found did Vaughan make any observation to you about your evidence - A. He did when we went out of the Court; he said I had leaned two much to the prisoners, by saying it was so light, he said by which you have deprived me of the three forty pounds, which you would have had part of for taking the one man.</p>

             ANDERSON. I live at No. 3, Everett-street; that is almost opposite Mr. Poole's house. On the 15th of December, in the last year, Mr. Poole came to my house, accompained at the time by Vaughan and Barrett; at the time they first came over it might be a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon; as near as I can recollect at the present moment.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they state for what purpose they came - A. Mr. Poole in the first instance stated for what they had come and I immediately recognized Vaughan as a police officer; I had seen him at the police office, and in other places. Vaughan then stated that Mr. Poole's house was that evening to be robbed by certain individuals, and requested that I would allow him to place himself in our house to watch the depredators; which I consented to; it was mentioned that there were to be four robbers; Vaughan mentioned that. The candles were not then lighted; but our lad was bringing them up stairs, when Vaughan requested that they might not be taken into the front shop; the reason he ascribed was that the robbers might not seen him, and his co-adjutor; that was Barrett. Barrett and he were in the private passage of the house. This application was made by Vaughan in Burretts hearing. I contiuned in the front shop from curiosity. I saw two three or four men; I can't say the number. I saw two individuals go into the shop of Mr. Poole; they went in at the front door; that was open; they went in at the passage door; in that passage there is a door that goes into the shop. I saw them go into the shop. One individual was a tall thin man, leaning over the rails as if in the act of watching any person who might come from the parlour into the shop. That man had on a dark brown great coat; he had on a pair of high shoes, what are generally termed high-low-shoes, which came up to his ancle; they were such as are laced up a short way in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the men come out of the shop-Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them any thing - A. Yes, one of them who was dressed like a sailor had a bundle of cloth under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them after that - A. The alarm was given, and the officers left the passage of the house, and as they left the street door open, I followed round to shut it after them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what became of the tall man who was looking over the railings - A. He went down the street the same way as the officers went, and at the crossing of the street the tall man ran immediatelybetwen the two officers, or nearly; he had crossed over to my side of the way, and in crossing to the other side he got between the two officers; there is a blank side of a house and a garden wall at the end of the street where they might have certainly taken him into custody; they were near enough to converse together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them converse together - A. I saw them stop a few seconds. Barrett then went one way and 
               <persName id="t18160918-6-person138">Vaughan</persName>
             another; and a hackney coach coming through the street, I lost sight of them, and saw no more of them for a considerable length of time; I lost sight of the two officers; but I saw the tall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180018"/>man; he took across from Everett-street towards Brunswick-square; I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come up with him - A.Yes, at the corner of a street paratlel with Everett-street; that was the corner of Barrard-street and Willnot-street; Everett-street is the street that is parallel. Then he stopped for a moment to pull up his stocking.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at that time an opportunity of observing him - A. During that time, I just walked round him, and as Vaughan had stated to me that he knew where to find the men; I did not stop him. I should be both to swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw Donnelly again, did his figure and gait correspond with the figure and gait of the man you had so seen - A. At the time the individual had a long dark brown grent coat. When I next saw Donnelly, his dress was different entirely, except that he had high shoes on similar to those the person were.</p>
               <p>Q.Am I right in understanding you that his figure and gait corresponded with those of the man whom you saw looking over the rails in Everett-street - A. Yes; but there are many circumstances that I would not speak so positively; because the hat he then wore was much shabbier and slouched, wore over his face and ears.</p>

             was at the Falcon public-house; that is in Portpool-lane, nearly opposite the place where I lived; he was in company with Batts, Rawley, and Farthing; I can't say whether they were drinking together; it was between three and five; I did not see them after five I am pretty sure; they left the house altogether. About nine o'clock the same evening, Donnelly came to the window of the same house; I went out to the door immediately; he had not made any signal. He asked me if Tuniker was there; Vaughan was Tuniker as I understood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard him called so among them - A. Yes, always almost; very seldom any thing else. I told him no. I asked him to come into the house, he said, he could not, for he was concerned in a robbery with Farthing and Rawley, and he mentioned that Farthing and Rawley were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing more - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever seen Donnelly and Vaughan in company together - A. Yes, at the Falson drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a house that Donnelly used - A. Not often; I have not seen him often there.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARRETT. I was a constable in December last. I have been acquainted with the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18160918-6-person141">Vaughan</persName>
             I suppose these three years; he was a patrole belonging to Bow street; I am also acquainted with the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did you know him by - A. Donnelly alias Jack-a-dandy. I know a house occupied by a person named Poole perfectly well. About the latter end of November last, I saw Donnelly in Holborn, in company with two other thieves; I only knew Donnelly before. Knowing him I watched them, they committed an offence there, and were apprehended, but no prosecutor appearing they were discharged. That adventure led to an intercourse between Donnelly, Vaughan, and me; I saw Vaughan, and he and I had some conversation concerning Donnelly giving information; he said he should I not wonder but what Jack would come it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the meaning of that - A. Giving information. It was agreed to ask him when we saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see him - A. In the course of a day or two afterwards; I was in company with Vaughan, and saw him in Gray's-inn-lane; we invited him to Mr. Perth's public-house in Holborn, fronting the end of Gray's-inn-lane. We asked him if he could give us any information; he said if he did, the thieves would kill him or murder him, or something to that effect; Vaughan replied, he would make that all right. He left us after having had some porter; we might have been together then about half or quarter of an hour. Being told that that would be made all right, he agreed to give information, We saw him again in a day or two afterwards. Vaughan told me that he had met Jack, and had made an appointment with him to meet him at the same place at two o'clock; that was the house in Holborn. We went, and met him. Donnelly stated that he was going out that night; that was in December; it might be ten days or a fortnight before the 15th. He told us he was going out that night with Batts and Rawley; they were going upon the sneak.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that, among thieves - A. It means going into a house slyly; and that is distingnished from breaking forcibly. If any thing was done, he expected to share part of the reward; that was so agreed on. I was to go along with Vaughan to assist in taking them into custody; and if that was accomplished, he was to have his share of the reward. This agreement being made, we seperated; and we were to meet in the evening part, early, between four and five. The party that were going upon the sneak were to go between four and five from the Falcon in Portpool-lane; that is in the neighbourhood of Gray's-inn-lane; and we were to go and watch them out. We went to a public-house fronting the Falcon that same evening, between four and five. This was not the transaction of the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. Now then come to the 15th - A. On the 15th we met at Perth's, Donnelly, Vaughan, and I; it was in the forenoon. Donnelly, said d-n me! how did you lose us last night? Vaughan replied, we lost you in a minute; which way did you go? Donnelly, described the way, and Vaughan knew it better than I did. They were alluding to a transaction<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180019"/>the night of the 14th. Donnelly said, they went to the Draper's and went in on the screw and sneaker out a piece of broady.</p>
               <p>Q.What does the scraw mean - A.Turning round the latch of a door; broady, means broad cloth. I asked Donnelly what had become of it, and he stated that Long Tom's wife had pledged it. I asked him where, and whether he could get the duplicate; Vaughan was present all this time. Donnelly said he could not, nor did he know where it was pawned. Long Tom was a man who was convicted here, named Batts. I know a woman named Embling perfectly well; she lived with

            . I asked Donnelly where the cloth was, and told him that if that cloth could be procured, and the prosecutor could swear to it, that would be sufficient in convict them; if he could get either the duplicate or the cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the mentioned as being concerned in that - A. Robert Rawley and

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and Vanghan, in point of fact, watched them, and lost them - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. How near had you seen them to Mr. Poole's house - A. About half a mile from it. I then saw Batts, Rawley, and Donnelly together, and missed them suddenly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now go on with the conversation you were relating - A. He said he could not get the duplicate, but they were going again to the same house that night, and they were to start from the same public-house about the same time; and he proposed that I and Vanghan should watch them from the house. Vaughan objected to that, he did not like following them from the house, and said that he would go to the prosecutor, and give him information of his house being about to be robbed. Vanghan stated that two heads were better than one, and he would have his own way in planning it; I had also suggested a doubt of the propriety of following them from the house. We then left the public-house in Holborn, and I think it was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon. Donnelly said, mind and be there in time; mind how you act so as you don't throw any suspicion on me; because if you do, they will chiv me; that means stabbing him; putting a knife into him. Vanghan said; no, no, we will take care and make all that right. Soon after we seperated, and went to the Falcon, in Portpool-lane, and had some beef-steaks in the parlour. At the Falcon I saw, Donnelly, Rawley, Batts, and several other thieves; I think I saw Farthing, but I won't be certain as they were not in the room we had the steaks in. They were in the tap-room, and we were in the parlour. At the time that Vanghan and I were eating the steakes, Donnelly came into the parlour, and said mind be in time, don't be too late; we said we will take care and be in time. After we had eaten the steakes it got near the time, and Vanghan and I went to Vanghan's mother-in-law, and there we got two aprons, they were to be put on to disguise us. That was that we night pass for tradesman. Then we proceeded to Mr. Poole's house, and I saw Mr. Poole, Mrs. Poole, and a boy servant. There Vanghan related the circumstances to Mr. Poole of a plan laid to rob his house; he told Mr. Poole that his house was to be robbed and he was to mark some cloths Poole and Vanghan marked them; Mr. Poole seemed rather frightened. Vaughan marked one or two; I think two; I observed they were marked by pieces of calico pinned to them, and they were placed on the counter. Vaughan then told him to put his lamps out which was lit, to the best of my recollection that was done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason - A. Yes. That the thieves should not see any person who was in the house. Then Vaughan asked Mr. Poole if he could go over the way; that we might conceal ourselves there; Vaughan shewed him how to fasten the door so as to be sure it was latched. Then we went over to Mr. Andersons, and he gave us leave to be there. After having been there some time, about five or ten minutes; Mr. Anderson gave us leave to go into his passage. We had been in his passage about a quarter of an hour when Mr. Anderson brought a chair, and Vaughan sat down; we had the passage door open, and presently we saw Batts, Rawley, and Donnelly pass Poole's door once or twice. Then there was a man looking over the rails; I don't believe it was any of the three that I have named, but I am not certain. Donnelly then passed again; then he stopped at the window. The first time of passing, a man at present unknown, was looking over the rails; whoever it was the first time, I am not enabled positively to say, but the second time, I saw him distinctly look over the rails into Mr. Poole's shop. Batts then went into the passage of Mr. Poole's house, and came out again. I believe he went in again. Then Rawley went in, and when he came out, he had a piece of cloth with him under his arm. I told Vaughan they had got it and said come along; Vaughan said they had not; I said they had, and said let us come along; I ran out. When I got to the end of the street, I saw Rawley give the cloth to Batts. I ran after them; they had got some distance. Vanghan objected to my going When I got to the bottom end of the street, Rawley gave the cloth to Batts. He went towards Bruntwick-square with it. Rawley and Donnelly returned to go to Poole's house again. Vaughan then came up to me, and they passed me on the way. I had left Vaughan in the passage, and in the moment that Rawley and Donnelly turned to come back, Vaughan came up to me; he came on the other side of the way. Whilst we had been watching them from the passage, Mr. Poole was obliged to leave his house, and when Rawley was running away, he was met by Mr. Poole, who was coming back. Then I and Vaughan joined each other and followed them. Rawley had gone into Mr. Poole's shop a second time, and whilst he went in Donnelly crossed over toward Andersons. Rawley brought out a piece of cloth again; Rawley made off with the second piece of cloth, and it was then that Mr. Poole met him. Vaughan and I pursued after him, and as we were crossing after the prisoner Rawley, Donnelly also crossed, and ran nearly against us, and said George, Bob is gone that way, and Tom is gone that way. Then Donnelly made off, I did not see any more of him. We precerded after Rawley, and when we were following Rawley, we heard a cry of stop thief. We then hastened our pace, and ran after Rawley as hard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180020"/>as we could, and when he had crossed the road, we saw him stop by a gentleman; but we did not know who it was until we got up, and found it was Mr. Poole, Farthing ran across the road, as if he was coming to Rawley, and was stopt. Vaughan picked up the cloth that was thrown away; that was the second piece. We took Farthing and Rawley into custody and took them to St. Giles's watchhouse. Then Vaughan and I took the cloth to his house. We then went to Batts's house, but seeing no light we came away. Vaughan and I met very early the next morning, and went to Batts's house, as early as four o'clock, and apprehended him. Donnelly was not taken, he was to escape. If it had not been settled, there was no difficulty in taking him. These persons were tired here, and capitally convicted.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of the prisoners again - A. In a day or two after, the commitment I saw Donnelly. In a day or two after, I don't know where, but I think in Cloth Fair, I and Vaughan were together, Donnelly said, you have get Jack, meaning Farthing. Farthing had at that time been committed for trial. Donnelly said that Jack was not there just at that time, meaning at Mr. Pooles. He went out with them, Donnelly said to go, but he stopped somewhere on the road, close by Mr. Pooles, but he was not there, at the time the robbery was committed. Vaughan said he had sworn to Farthing, and he was an old thief, and went out for the purpose of committing the robbery, and it could not be helped, and he should let it remain where it was. We agreed to meet at the Cloth Fair public-house, and we did according to the appointment. The chief of the conversation was about the three persons then in custody. I asked Donnelly what had become of the first piece of cloth that was taken on the 15th, that I had seen Rawley,give to Batts. He said, that when Rawley and Farthing were taken, Long Tom, meaning

            , threw the cloth over Brunswick-square, ran back into Holborn to the watering house there, and fetched a rattler, meaning a hackney coach, whipped back to Brunswick-square, took the piece of cloth, and fenced it at old mother Jenning's, in Redlion Market. Before we left the Gost in Cloth Fair, Donnelly said he should go and live over the water, until it was all settled; for he was suspected of giving information against the persons, and he had heard it from several he knew. Before he left the house, he asked Vaughan for some money. Vaughan gave him ten shillings, and we then agreed to meet again in the course of a week which we did, according to appointment at the same place. This was not the only money that passed, Vaughan gave him shillings, or something on former occasions, at Perth's in Holborn, before the robbery was committed. Before we separated at the Goat, an appointment was made for us to meet again; that was for him to give Vaughan and me fresh information. We did meet again, and we used frequently to see Donnelly, but I don't remember anything that passed upon the particular occasions. I believe Vaughan altogether let him have between fifty and sixty shillings, and he had eight shillings of me.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember any occasion in which Vaughan and Donnelly had any conversation in Portpool-lane - A. Yes, that was after I had apprehended Donnelly for stealing the gloves, and after he was discharged. After that I saw them again in company conversing together in the lane, and I could hear Donnelly mention his brother's name whom Vaughan had in custody for picking pockets. We frequently met afterwards. I heard that the officers were after me, and I suriendered myself to Mr. Harmer, and told him all I knew upon this subject, and another I was concerned in.</p>
               <p>Q. We have found that these persons were not convicted of the burglary, but merely of thes tealing. Had you any conversation with either of the prisoners on the aubject of that verdict - A. On the day, or the day after the coviction, I saw Donnelly in Cloth Fair, and he said that the persons were convicted, but nothing allowed. That Vaughan had spoiled it, and he would be damned if he would give any more information. After the conviction some time, I had some conversation with Vaughan, and he several times asked me over the water, and at last I did go, and we went to where Donnelly lodged. I knew the woman that kept the house, and Vaughan staid along with Donnelly and his woman. I stepped down below with the woman of the house. After tea we came out of the house all three together. They two came down from above, and joined me. I had told Vaughan of the expression that Donnelly had made use of to me, saying that Vaughan had spoiled it, and he would be damed if he would give any more information. Vaughan asked Donnelly if he would give any more information, he promised he would, but he never did.</p>

I know Vaughan and Barrett, they have been in the habits of frequently frequenting my house in the months of November, and December last; I can't say that I ever saw them together; I have seen Donnelly there also.

I have not known Donnelly above a twelvemonth. About a week or ten days before the robbery, I saw Mr. Vanghan and John Donnelly at the corner of Wyatt's brewhouse-yard, in Portpool-lane.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. I apprehended the prisoners Vaughan and Donnelly, with the assistance of others. I apprehended Vaughan first; I had been searching for him very near a week before I found him; at last I found him at No. 3, New-street, Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel. I knew where he used to reside, it was in Gray's-inn-lane; I found him at his aunt's; I told him I wanted him, and that I had a warrant against him; he asked me to let him look at it, and I shewed it him. Read came in, and we searched him; we took this pistol from him, and some papers, He declared himself innocent I apprehended Donnelly on the 29th of July, in Beech-street, Barbican; he had on a kind of short coat, as he has now, and shoes up to the ancle, laced in front.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any conversation with him at the time you apprehended him-A. Coming along in the coach, he made use of an expression, d-n his eyes, he never knew a bigger rogue in his life than Vaughan was; he did not say any thing about himself.</p>

             was dead. I then said, is it the man that there is a piece of work about so often; she said, yes. I said it can't be; for I saw him but a while back, which I did. I asked her when he died? and she said, at three o'clock. I asked how? and she said when they came to move him for dinner they found him dead. I told her I was certain he did not die at that time, for I saw him at six o'clock. I asked her if she was sure he was dead, for very likely he was only in a fit; I then asked her who was with him when he did die, and she said, nobody but Hannah; Hannah meant Mrs. Mahoney. I told her to send for a doctor, and by no means to let the body be touched, for there must be an inquest held upon it. She went with her hands together, and begged for God's sake that I would not say the man was dead. She then asked me to let my servant fetch her some wood, as she was so frightened she could not fetch it herself. I then served her with half a pint of gin that she wanted.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect how much she had in the whole day-A. About a pint and half a quarter. I did not see her again in the course of that night. I had not seen Mahoney that afternoon. My house is so situated, that I can hear every noise in the house in which Mahoney lives. After this conversation I shut up my house immediately and went to bed. I had been to bed some time, and I believe it was between eleven and twelve when I was awakened by a tremendous crush, and in fact I thought it was my own street door that was broken open. I got up, and threw up the sash, as I slept in the front room, and I saw a short woman rush out of Mrs. Mahoney's house, and run into the street, saying, Mary, you have murdered him.</p>
               <p>Q.Was that said to any one - A. I don't know. She turned round as she was coming out, and she came out as if she was pushed out. She said that, I thought to someone in the house. I knew that woman; I knew her very well; her name is Doe. I watched her into the next turning, and watched a considerable time to see if she would return; but: she did not return; I did not see or hear any thing more that night. I could not tell what part of their house that tremendous crash came from; but I know by the sound that it came from No.3.</p>

The window shutters were shut; the curtains were down, and Mahoney was there when I came in; I spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell us, as near as you can recollect, every thing that was said - A.When I went into the room and found the corpse in the situation I have described, I asked Mrs. Mahoney how she came to remove the body? I said, I supposed she was aware that if that man died suddenly, there must be a Coroner's Inquest held on the body? she said, she was aware of that. I told her it ought to have remained in the clothes the man had on when he died? she said, as to that, it was her country fashion to lay them out as soon as they were dead. As I said before, I told her it was extremely wrong? and she said, she knew nothing about that. She said, that she hoped, or wished, or words to that effect, that the Coroner's Inquest might be delayed as long as possible. I told her that rested with the Coroner, and not with me. After that, I looked at the body; I saw some marks on the face; and seeing them, it struck me very forcibly, that the man had not died a natural death. I thought there appeared to be a blow on the left jaw, two scratches on the right jaw, and a scratch on the nose. I left the room immediately, and went to the Coroner for his warrant. That was all that passed on the Tuesday. Afterwards I saw the body more particularly; I saw it with Mr. Burges; about one o'clock. I went to Mr. Burgess after I had obtained the warrant from the Coroner. Mrs. Mahoney and three or four more were present when Mr. Burgess was there; I firmly believe that Mrs. Killivar and Mrs. Doe were there. The second time there were five or six candles. I assisted in examining the body more minutely the second time. I then saw the marks I had observed the first time, and also observed a mark round the neck, as if a small cord had been tied round very tight, and under the jaw on the right side there was a black mark as if the skin had been drawn up, or twisted up.</p>
               <p>Q.Did Mahoney say anything - A. I forget. She said the first time, that he had died with the cramp in his stomack. I don't recollect that she said anything the second time. She attended before the Coroner's Jury, and so did Killivar. I had no conversation with Kilivar until I took her on Friday night; she told me she knew nothing about it; she stated to me as I was taking her in a coach to Marlborough-street, I am very sorry, but I did not speak the truth before the Coroner and the Jury. The answer I made was, you acknowledge not to have spoken the truth before the Coroner; she replied, that every word she spoke before the Coroner and Jury was false; she told me so herself, without asking any questions. She said, she was under great obligations to a certain person, who induced her to swear by the Holy Cross of Christ not tell the secret. She then informed me that after she was so sworn, she was shewn the dead body of Walsh; she said the body was lying on the bed, and the bed was very wet, as if water had been poured over it, and the body was nearly cold. She said, when the oath was sworn, a certain person said, she would shew her something, and then that certain person said, Maurice Walsh is dead, and then shewed the body; Killivar expressed something, that it was a shocking thing; and I told her it is not too late to tell the truth now, if you spoke falsely before; speaking of the nature of the crime she had committed. I told her, I was sorry at a married woman's swearing falsely; and she said, oh! we don't care for your oath. She did not speak to me any farther on the subject. Then we got up to the office. The day that the Coroner's Jury sat was the 7th of

            . I live at 31, Little Portland, street, in the parish of St. James's. I remember Mrs. Mohoney calling me up on Tuesday morning, the 6th of August; it was the mother of the prisoner Mahoney; her mother said, she wished me and my wife to go to Mrs. Mahoney; accordingly I went; I got to her place between three and four o'clock; I saw a man laying dead on a bed there in the back parlour; he had part of his clothes on. I saw the prisoner Mrs. Mahoney there, her mother, and my wife, and several more who came backwards and forwards during the time; I knew Johannah Doe was one. The prisoner Killivar came in a short time afterwards; Mother Mahoney, the mother, asked me to lend a hand to undress the man, and I did; I took off a blue jacket, and stripped the body. The prisoner Mahoney assisted me; we striped the body entirely. I observed no marks of violence whatever. All the mark I could see was a small speck on the point of his nose; there was on neckcloth about his neck; I did not observe any mark on the neck I asked Mrs. Mahoney how he died? and she said, she did not know. Killivar did not say any thing that I know of. I was in the room nearly the whole day; I put the neckcloth on the dead man; it is customary. I don't know whose neckcloth it was; Mrs. Mahoney, the mother of the prisoner, gave it me. I held the candle when Mr. Burgess examined the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any marks that you had not seen before - A. Mr. Burgess pointed out a small crease, he thought about the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe it was so - A. I could not discern any more than the regular and natural wrinkle round his neck.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you leave the appartment of the prisoner Mahoney - A. I was there backwards and forwards until the man was buried. I knew that Killivar lived in the same house. I asked Mahoney how the man came by his death? and she said, she did not know. I did not ask Killivar that question. The body was not shaved when I first saw it; I shaved it; Mrs. Mahoney requested me; she borrowed a razor for me to do it; I had never shaved a dead man before; I did it as a good natured act for a man whom I knew. I did not go to bed after three o'clock that morning.</p>

            . I lived at this house, No. 5, I know the prisoners at the bar; I knew the deceased also; the deceased had lodged in the second floor, but he had removed. He was at that house on the Monday, in Mrs. Mahoney's room; I did not see them together there, I only heard them. I had such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180023"/>a knowledge of their voices that I was enabled to say with certainty that it was they.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour in the evening was your attention drawn towards them - A. I believe at six or seven o'clock, but I can't say exactly to half an hour. I heard a fighting and quarrelling for an hour or two, and I heard the deceased call out, Oh my God! my God! my Christ! my Christ! That was between six and seven o'clock. or it might be later; the fighting and quarrelling was before this; the quarrelling was all in two voices, which I could distinguish; I could hear Mahoney's voice, she was calling him a bitch's son, and all such low language as that. Their room window was open, for I heard it shut; it was shut immediately after the cries I have described. I went out at half past nine o'clock; up to that time I observed nothing farther than what I have observed already. At the time I was going, which was at about half after nine, I saw persons in the passage, and heard them talking in the back parlour, and I saw the woman from the Black Horse with a can of beer; they were talking in the back parlour as I went by; the door was shut. I returned at half past twelve; there was a woman sitting on the stairs I took no notice of that. At eleven o'clock the next morning I heard of this business.</p>
               <p>ANN MITCHELL. On the 5th of August, I lived in Mrs. Mahoney's house. I went out on the night of that day, about half past nine; I came home about half past twelve. Mrs. Killivar let me in; the house was all quiet when I came home. About five o'clock in the morning Mrs. Maboney came up to my room, to fetch my table. She knocked at the door, I said who is there, she said Mahoney; and I asked her what she wanted, and she said she wanted to borrow my table; she asked me if I did not think it strange she should fetch the table, and I said yes, meaning so early in the morning; I asked her what she was going to do with it, and she said she was going to lay out a man on it; I asked her what man, and she said Walsh; I asked her how he came to die? and she said ask me no questions. With that she takes the table down stairs; I asked her if I should assist her, and she said no, she could carry it herself. At nine o'clock in the morning I went down and found Walsh laid out. This was a long deal table with four legs. When I was going down in the morning for wood to light my fire, I saw the body laid out, and Smith the beadle was coming in at the door. I heard no noise. I saw the body of Walsh, but did not go close enough to it to see any marks.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, George-street St. Giles's, next door but one to where Mrs. Mahoney lived. I saw a woman come out of her house between eleven and twelve on the night in question; she came out and slammed the door after her, and said, the man is murdered, he is murdered. I heard nothing more that night.</p>
               <p>ROBERT M'CLELLAN. I am an upholsterer, I live in Russell-street. I was passing through George-street on the night of the 5th of August at about a quarter before ten. At the house where the body was afterwards found dead. I heard a noise in the back parlour, like some people fighting; I heard them wrestling and fighting, and I heard them come against the wainstcoat and door three or four times. I did not hear any voices at that time. Immediately after that I heard something heavy fall on the ground as if one or two people had fallen down together. I then walked away, and had not gone above four or five paces, when I heard a person make a loud scream; it was very piercing, and seemed to come from a person convulsed, and in great agitation of mind. I then returned to the door, and heard a noise in the farther end of the passage, of people coming out. Instantly two men and a woman came out. There are two steps at the door, and they did not come down step by step, but they came all out in a lump down both, and ran down the street as fast as possible; they came out as if there had been a person behind them with a drawn sword; if there had been, they could not have come out with more hury. When they were gone, I looked in at the door to try if I could see any person, or if I could hear any noise; but I could neither.</p>
               <p>MARY KILLIVAR. I am the child of one of the prisoners at the bar. On the 5th of August last, when Walsh died, my mother lived down in the cellar at Mrs. Mahoney's house. About six o'clock in the evening I came home, I did not hear any noise then. It was Sunday Mrs. Mahoney, and Mr. Walsh made the noise; they were fighting; it was about my father. Mrs. Mahoney and my father had a dispute, and Mr. Walsh interfered; one struck the other and so it began; they were fighting all night; she called him a b-y bitches son; and a b-y whore's son, and he called her a whore. I was on my mothers back stairs whilst this was going on. When I came home on the Monday evening, all was quiet, only Mrs. Mahoney cried on the bed. She was in the back room at the time, sitting on the bed crying. I went into the room, Mrs. Mahoney asked me to light the fire, and to get her a drop of water to get a cup of tea for us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do as she desired you - A. Yes; I struck a light with a tinder box in Mrs. Mahoney's room; there was a little water in the kettle; my mother was in the same room with Mrs. Mahoney talking. Walsh was on the bed, where Mrs. Mahoney was sitting; she had been crying for a long time. Mrs. Doe was not in the room at that time. Mrs. Mahoney sent for her about three o'clock in the morning? She told my mother to go for a quartern<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180024"/>of gin and bitters; she went, and came back; my mother had one glass, and Mrs. Mahoney had another. I don't know what they talked about. The tears were coming out of my mothers eyes; my mother asked Mrs. Mahoney what was the matter with her; and Mrs. Mahoney would not tell her.</p>
               <p>Q.What made your mother cry then - A. Mrs. Mahoney would not tell her what was the matter. I saw the old man in bed, he was stretched out, and his hands were laying down. Only part of the clothes was over him, I think a blanket, a sheet, and a quilt; he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that - A.Because when I was putting the tea-things on the table, Mrs. Mahoney said she would not have any tea; at this time my mother was gone down to wash her hands and face. There were no clothes on Mr. Walshs's face, so I went over to the side of the bed, and saw he was dead; I was not alarmed, but when I found it, I set the tea-things on the table, and went down to my mother; my mother knew he was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How-A. Because Mrs. Mahoney told her, and made her swear by the ten crosses of Christ, not to tell any one that Mr. Walsh was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How is that done - A. She told my mother to put two fingers of one hand, across the fingers of the other; my mother was not to tell that old Mr. Walsh was dead. Mrs. Mahoney said no more at that time. My mother asked Mrs. Mahoney to lend her a bonet, and then she went to Marlborough-street, because there was a man had stuck my uncle. Mrs. Mahoney did not say anything to me after my mother was gone away. When I saw Mr. Walsh in the bed, he had no clothes on; he had his neck-cloth about his neck, and he had a shirt on, but no waistcoat; it was a white handkerchief. I looked at his face, it was all black and blue. I did not observe anything else. My mother came back from Marlborough-street about half past nine; she went into Mrs. Maboney's room. I went to bed, and told my father Mr. Walsh was dead. I heard

             crying up stairs at the door, and I went up to her; she was in the parlour, in which the man was lying, she was at the bed along with Mrs. Mahoney, crying. I was going into bed, but I heard such a noise up stairs that I would go up. I went up to the door of Mrs. Mahoney's room, and my mother opened it for me; then I went down stairs again, and went to bed. There is a hole in Mrs. Mahoney's door for the key; a person can see through that hole; if you look through, you can see the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see anything through that hole after the door was shut - A.That night.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes - A. No I did not look through the hole that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen anything through the keyhole before - A. Yes, I could see Mrs. Mahoney go into bed with Mr. Walsh. In the day time of that day I saw Mrs. Maboney at the bed through the key hole, that was when it was day light. My mother was not in the room at that time; I found the door locked, and I looked through the key hole, and saw her on the bed; he was inside the bed, and she was laying outside, I could see his hands; his hands were outside the bed clothes; one of Mrs. Mahoney's hands were under her own head, and the other was on her body; she appeared to me to be asleep. I heard the people say the next morning, that the work-house doctor was there. My mother did not come in the morning until three o'clock. I do not remember carrying any water to Mrs. Mahoneys, nor seeing any water made use of until I was there. I did not see any scattered about the room or bed. I did not, while I was looking through the key-hole see anything done to the body. My uncle's name is Desmond. I have been staying with him since my mother has been in prison. When my mother came down at three o'clock in the morning, she spoke to my father but it was in Irish, and I do not understand that. My father asked her what made her so late, and she said she had been up with Mrs. Mahoney. On the Sunday when Mrs. Mahoney, and Mr. Walsh were fighting, Mrs. Mahoney beat him with the poker and shovel about the head and shoulders. Walsh knocked her down with his hands. When she beat him, he had been at the step of the door speaking to my father.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning had he any marks - A. Yes, he had a bite on his nose. Walsh aad Mahoney had dined together.</p>

            . I am apothecary to the parish. On the morning of the 6th of August, I was sent for to this house, in George street. I found a dead body there; I was shewn into the back parlour, by Smith, the beadle. I saw Mrs. Mahoney there, Smith, and others, whose names I don't know. The body was laid out in the usual manner for an Irish Wake; it was stript of its clothes, but had a sheet about it; it had a neck cloth about its neck. Mrs. Mahoney knew me perfectly well. I examined the body externally; I observed no kind of mark about it; whatever, by which I could account for its death; my attention was then directed to the head and neck, and I took the neck cloth off; I observed a very extensive bruize on the left jaw under the ear, and several scratches on the face; this was in the presence of several persons. I think I observed it in the hearing of those who were present; I am not positive, I also found a very plain and decided mark extending all round the neck. I concluded in my own mind that the mark about his neck was the cause of his death. I asked Mrs. Mahoney wether she had sent for any medical man, and why not for me, as she knew me? her reply was, that she was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180025"/>agitated that she did not know what she did; she did not say any thing more to me. I did not examine his hands the first day. I concluded that the mark round the neck must have been produced by a rope or some such thing tight about the neck. I concluded it must have been produced by a rope; but I can't take upon myself to say it was; it night have been produced by a tight-bandage, a silk handkerchief twisted tight would have produced it; it was such a mark as satisfied me that it must be produced by something small, it was regular all round. On the day the Coroner's Inquest took place, I examined it in the presence of the Coroner and of the Jurors I pointed out the same marks upon the neck as I had observed before, although they were not quite so very evident. I then examined the arms; I found them very much discoloured the lower arms; they looked as if some ligature had contained then so as to impede circulation. I think the mark round the neck would produce stragulation and death. I should think the bruize on the lower jaw would not produce death it was not in a part where a bruize would be fatal</p>

Then a man came up, and clapped his hand upon my mouth, and stopped me from taking my breath. Then they held me in that way; I could not call out; the holding my mouth stopped my breath entirely. I was then held so until they drew the purse out of my pocket. The biggest of the prisoners, Sibley, drew the purse out of my pocket, with two one pound Bank of England notes in it, a duplicate of a watch, and about ten or eleven shillings in silver; there was a key also, in the breeches pocket were the purse was. It was very dark where they stood I know they and the same women by their talking to me and my answering them in the Highway. There was a lamp at the end of the passage, and in the Highstreet also. They then ran away, and when I recovered myself, I called stop thief, The man that had held my mouth bolted out of the passage. When I called out stop thief the watchman sprang his rattle, and the man and one of the prisoners were apprehended before I got out of the passage; that prisoner was Sibley. The other women was just by me when I went out, and I gave charge of them all; they were close together and was in the watchhouse when they were searched but I did not see my property.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Whitechapel, my stand is opposite Castle Alley. On the 31st of July at about half past eleven, I was at the corner of Reddich street, standing with my back against a door with my coat over my light, and I saw two women and a man ran over from the opposite side from Castle Alley; they ran accross the way in a very great hury; I heard the cry of stop thief, and I followed this party about twenty yards. The whole three name close out together, and the man attempted to cross the road again; with that I sprang my rattle; the man crossed the road, and the woman going straight on. By the assistance of an extra watchman that was going along, we took the whole three into custody. When I came close to them, the man attempted to cross the road, but we secured them. I pursued the man; the other watchman stopped the women. It was not three, minutes from the time step thief was called until they were all taken into custody; they were never out of my sight I had sight of the whole three until they were apprehended; I was present when they were searched and none of these things were found on them.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOUTLE. I am headborough of the parish of Whitechapel. I remember when the two prisoners were brought with the man to the watchhouse. The prosecutor charged them with this robbery. I snached them all three; I found nothing at all on these women nor did I find any thing on the man that relates so this charge, I found on him a watch-chain, a guinea in gold a three-shilling bank token one shilling and two sixpences.</p>

               <p> SARAH BATTOMLEY. On the 16th of August I was in the front parlour, from one to two o'clock. Then I tied my weeks linen up, belonging to the whole family in a bundle, I placed that bundle in an arm chair, at the further end of the room from the door. I went away exactly as the clock struck two. I shut the front parlour door. I have the whole house; the outer door of the parlour in which these things where was shut; then I went to attend my school room, which is close to my parlour; there is not a great distance from the two doors. At half past four I had occasion to go into the room, and I missed my things. I made an alarm, and a neighbour of mine gave me some information; her name is 
               <persName id="t18160918-9-person179">

            . There were in the bundle, the things mentioned in the indictment, and other things. The most valuable of them have not been found. All the things might be worth thirty shillings; I saw part of them at Lambeth-street, and knew them again.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON BATTOMLEY. At the time I found the prisoner in the act of pledging part of the property a shirt, and a waistcoat, in one of my own pocket-handkerchiefs. The shirt and waistcoat were not my property. The bundle was in her right hand, And the instant I went into the shop, I said that was my handkerchief, and the pawnbroker told me to be very circumspect, as there were many handkerchiefs alike, it was my handkerchief. She said she had bought it fifteen months before in Bethnal Green Road. She was going with me to shew me where she bought it, and about for or five steps from the door, two of Mr. Richardson's young man came after me with the bundle, and asked me if it was mine; and I made answer that the hankerchief was, as well as the property that was inside of it. I had not the bundle there. I observed that the handkerchief was mine. When I took the prisoner back to the pawnbrokers, I specified what things were my property. I opened the bundle, there I discovered the childrens frocks in the bundle, and I knew the things all to be mine except a waistcoat and shirt; that was the same bundle I had seen in the pawnbrokers shop with the prisoner, The prisoner then said that it was her sister at Bethnal Green sent her to pawn them and it was a cruel thing. Then I took her down to Lambeth-street office immediately; going along, a great many people tried to rescue her. When I delivered her in charge to the officer, he searched her, and she made an answer and said, that all the things in the bundle were not mine; she said just the same before the Magistrate.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming to Mr. Richardson's shop on the 16th of August; he brought with her a shirt, waistcoat and an old handkerchief; I did not see anything else with her then. She proposed to pawn them. I afterwards saw a bundle in the shop which she had dropped. The prisoner, when she dropped the bundle, pulled the woman that was next her over it; that was to hide the bundle from Mr. Battomley's seeing it, and when they were gone, the woman pulled it out; I know that woman did not bring that bundle in. Mr. Richardson and I then went, and that handkerchief matched the other which Mr. Bottomley had.</p>

            . I live right facing of Mrs. Battomley's house. On the 16th of August, I saw some one go into Mr. Battomley's house, I don't know the time, as I have no clock. I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Battomley's house; I am positive of it; she went in at the street door, I saw her come out again; she remained in a very few minutes; she had nothing with her when she went in, but when she came out, she had a bundle with a silk handkerchief carefully thrown over it; she turned to the left, I can't tell rightly what the hour was: it was after my dinner. I work at a mangle, I was terribly busy, This was on a Friday, which is a very busy day with me.</p>

            . I live at No. 16, Frederick place, Hampstead Road. I know the prosecutor, who has been examined here. I know his handwriting and I have seen him write. I look at the signature to this promissory note, and say I believe it not to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDEREWS. I am a cabinet-maker; I have been living two years opposite to St. James's Chapel; I don't keep a shop there; I am a journeyman, living in a private house; not a house of my own; I am a lodger; I work for Mr. Osborne, in Tottenham-court-road; he does not keep a broker's shop; he keeps an upholsterer's; there are very few old goods; he sometimes has old goods; he does not often buy goods at sales. I have worked for him a year and a quarter; I will not swear that he does not sometimes deal both in new and old goods; I work as a cabinet-maker for my bread; that is all. I have known Mr. Crisp fifteen or sixteen years; he has generally resided at Yarmouth. I once lived at Yarmouth, I corresponded with him; I can't tell how often; oftener perhaps than once a year; perhaps oftener than twice a year, I can't speak exactly. I have not got all the letters, nor any of them. I kept them a certain time; I did not look to see if I had any of them before I came out. I lived at Yarmouth until the last two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How often within these fifteen years have you corresponded with him - A. By letter, note, and doing business with him always.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times may he have written to you A. I can't say how often; more than three or four times; I have bad at least as many letters of his as that; perhaps not more. I can't say exactly within what time last past, but within the last two years, I may have received three; one of which have I preserved. I can't say exactly where Crisp first told make should want me as a witness to disprove this hand-writing. Upon my word, I don't know when he first came to me. That is the best account I can give of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Within how many months or weeks last past did he come to you to tell you he should want you as a witness - A. I think it was about last Christmas time; it is so long back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take you any where along with him - A.Not the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you what he wanted with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And upon your oath, did you not tell him, it is no use calling upon me Mr. Crisp, I do not know your hand-writing - A. I never told him such a thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you meet him - A. I met him at the Prince of Wales.</p>
               <p>Q.By accident - A. Yes, by accident. </p>
               <p>Q. How near is that to your house - A. I lodge at the Prince of Wales.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not tell us that you lodged at a private house - A. Why, it is not a shop.</p>
               <p>Q.But in as much as you said it was a private house, and you now say it is a public-house; reconcile those two accounts if you can? - </p>
               <p>Q.Then you cannot give us any other account of it - A. No; it is a public-house, the landlord's name is Bees; I believe he is a married man; I am not sure of that; there is a person there who officiates as his wife. This application was made about Christmas. The next time when I saw Crisp again, was when he came up to Town about this business again; I don't know when it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not bring papers and specimens of writing to you - A. Yes, he brought banker's checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not produce specimens of his handwriting at your request, because you could not undertake to prove his hand-writing - A. No; he did not. These checks were signed by the name of Crisp: I believe this was better than six months ago; he did not produce them upon my expressing a desire for his doing so; nor upon my telling him that I could not swear to his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did he produce them, for what reason - A. I don't know; he gave no particular reason.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. ALLEY. I do not derive my information of this being or not being his hand-writing from those checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say it is not his, handwriting from any other circumstance - A. Oh dear yes; I had a sufficient knowledge of his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. If you knew his hand-writing, for what possible use could he have produced those checks to you - A.He did not produce them to me in particular; but to several other persons.</p>
               <p>Q. But what did he say - A.He shewed them I believe to shew that the writing corresponded, and I was to see it amongst the rest. I don't know that he put it down by me in particular; I can't recollect at the present time what was said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he should want you as a witness - A. He asked me if I was sufficiently acquainted with his hand-writing to swear to it; and I told him, I was, and he afterwards shewed me these checks. I can't recollect the names of all the persons who were present when these checks were produced, but I believe Mr. Smallman and Mr. Loddy; I don't recollect any body else.</p>
               <p>ANTHONY BLACKHURNE. I live at Yarmouth. I am acquainted with the prosecutor, Mr. Crisp; I have known him seven years; I have had frequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill, and tell me if you believe it to be his hand writing - A. On my oath I believe it is not; I think there is no similarity; I have seen him write repeatedly.</p>

            . I live at No. 46, Wardour-street; I know Mr. Crisp about seven years; I have frequently seen him write, and have had opportunities<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180028"/>of knowing his hand writing. I look at this bill, it has not the slightest likeness to his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. I was never at the Prince of Wales public-house. He first came to tell me I would be of use in January; he did not show me anything; I am positive of that; I think Capt. Shepperd was present. He came to my house, and he asked me if I should know his hand writing, I said I should; he asked me if I had any bills of his, and I replied I believed I had. I had seen some of them frequently, and I have looked at them and my receipts since that.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you would not swear that you believed this was not his hand writing, unless you looked at the bills and receipts by yours - A. Yes I would.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how came you to look at them - A.Merely for the satisfaction of the thing, knowing I had them by me.</p>

In July last, I apprehended the prisoner in Guildhall; Read my brother officer searched him after he was in, custody; in my presence this pocket-book was found on him; there is a copy of a letter there and a slip of paper; the signature is torn off the bottom of the letter, and it is on the slip of paper; there is also the copy of the bill in question.</p>
               <p>(The documents were put in and read; the letter purported to be a copy of a letter sent by Mr. Crisp to the prisoner, relative to family affairs; and the slip of paper fitted the copy, and contained the signature.)</p>

            . I was the attorney for the prisoner at the bar. In the action which he brought against Mr. Crisp, he delivered to me the bill upon which I brought that action; he delivered to me that bill at Chancery Chambers; they are in the County of Middlesex. (The forged bill put into the hands of the witness) I cannot say anything to this bill. The action I brought was upon a bill for a similar amount; this looks like it but I will not swear positively to it. I don't know it because there is same writing on it since I had it. I will not positively swear at this is the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you still upon the rolls - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you doubt that too - A. No, but the bill upon which I brought the action had no such writing as there appears upon th1s.</p>
               <p>Q.It does not purport to have had that writing on before the action was brought but that hand writing appears to be the writing of Mr. Smith the officer of my Lord Ellenborough - A. And that makes the doubt.</p>
               <p>Q.That writing must have been put on subsequent to the bringing of the action. Suppose it was not on, is that the bill you brought the action on; and if it be, when and from whom did you receive it - A. I believe it to be the bill, and I received it in November last from Townsend or another person who came with him;

I dressed myself, and I went down stairs, and found that the shop shutters had been forced one over the other they were perfectly secured up the night before. The fastenings were then the same as they had been the night before, only the bar was sprung and one of the shutters was forced over the other. The glass was broken, and ten razors taken out, and a pair of snuffers, and a coral necklace. These things had been within reach of the broken pane.

I proceeded after them, and when I came to Ropemakes's Fields, I called out stop thief, as loud, as I could call twice.

I ran through an Alley, and caught the prisoner just close<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180029"/>to the watchhouse door; I lost sight of him while I turned one corner, but not for a minute. The patrole was close to him when I caught him. I went round another way, I gave the prisoner into the custody of Mr. Lines. I searched the prisoner; but found nothing on him. I then called Mr. Marshall up. I found the necklace and a razor under the window, and have them here now; I have had them locked up ever since.

I got up early in the morning, and as I was going past this shop window, I saw the shutter had been removed, and I stopped a little, about half a minute, and on turning my head, I saw a man with a white apron, and I said, I should alarm the watchman, and he made answer follow me, and I thought he was going to alarm the watchman, and I followed him, and presently I heard a voice say stop, and I turned up the street where this depredation had been committed, which I should not have done if I had been concerned in it; I know I am very innocent.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness. On the 22nd of July last, I quitted my father's house; my mother was gone out before me. I was the only person left at home. A little boy brought a message to me that I was to go and meet my mother at Shoreditch Church at three o'clock; I did not know the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went did you fasten the doors and windows - A. Yes; I locked the door, and I am sure that the doors and windows were fast when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. On looking about you before you went out, was all your father's furniture and all your mother's wearing apparel safe in the house - A. Yes. I met my mother in the Kingsland-road; she had been to Town; she came by Shoreditch; she came home with me; she is very ill. I returned with her about seven o'clock. I went out before three; I left nobody in the house. On my return, I found one of the panes of glass cut out; that was where the latch opens. Any person who put his hand in through that part might open the hasp.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that the window was entire as to all its parts before you went away - A. There was one of the bottoms out before I went away; but nobody however, by putting their hands through that, could open the window; I am sure none was out near the hasp. I took notice of the things before I went out, and when I returned. I missed two bed-furnitures, three gowns, four shirts, two frocks, a coral necklace, and other things mentioned in the indictment, together with a purse and three half-crowns, and a few two-penny and three-penny silver pieces; no other money that I am aware of. I saw some of these things on the following Saturday week; I saw them at the magistrates. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am a police officer of Whitechapel. I know Shorthand; I never knew him until I apprehended him; I went to a place that I understood was his lodging, on the 23rd of July last; it was at 28, Harbour-street; Griffths and Cpombs were with me, they are two officers. When we went to the house Griffths and I went up; I had received information about half an hour before that, that such things were deposited in the prisoners apartment, and supposed to be stolen. I went into that apartment; I did not see the prisoners at first. While we were searching the room, the female prisoner came home; as soon as she saw us, she ran down stairs directly; I hallooed out to Coombs to stop her, and I ran down, and brought her up again where Griffiths was. I searched her, and down her bosom I found these beads. I got some information from her. In consequence of that, I went into the Minories, and there I found Shortland smoaking a pipe. I asked him what his name was; and he said, Smith. I asked him where he lived; he said, he lived in Fashion-street, Spittalfields. I told him he must go along with me, and he came with me, and when I got him to No. 28, in this street, I said. I think you live here instead of Fashion-street; I took him in to the lower room. I searched him, and look the watch out of his pocket; I have had that watch over since.</p>

            . I was in this lodging. I know no more than receiving the information from the woman. I don't remember the man saying that he had only lodged there one night; Hill said that she had lodged there more nights than one. As soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180030"/>we went up stairs, I found this property tied up under the bedstead. While I was there looking round the room, the female prisoner came on the stairs, but not quite into the room. When she saw me, she ran down immediately; we called out to stop her below, she was stopt by Coombs; she was searched by Dalton, and that necklace was taken from her bossom. While I was searching her box, she flew down stairs the second time; Dalton went down stairs after her, and brought her back up stairs, and I searched her box, and in different parts of the room I found all the property which is here.</p>

I keep the house in which this property was found; I look at the prisoner Hill; she took the room on the Thursday; she said, she should not sleep there that night and on the Friday Shortland and she came together, and they brought a box; they did not sleep there that night, nor on the Saturday night. The young woman slept there on the Saturday night, and on the Sunday night; Shortland came about eleven. Shortland went out about five o'clock in the morning, and came home to breakfast, and after that they both went out together within a minute or two. In the evening Hill brought in the two bundles just in the dark, and she said, she was tired, and I helped her up.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Bluck. On the 15th of August last, I went to bed that night about ten; I locked the door and fastenings; I also looked at the articles the over night, and did not miss any thing. I gave orders to the prisoner to go to bed; that was before I went to bed myself, and then he appeared to be going towards the stairs, as if he were going to bed himself. We three were the only persons in the house. There had been a sale by auction the day before in the house. The several articles were in different sets in the sale-room. I went into the sale-room before I went into bed; I observed none of the articles missing. In the morning it was Mr. Sitgraves pointed out the loss to us; we did not perceive any thing missing until he pointed them out to us. I got up in the morning about eight o'clock. I believe the prisoner was up stairs about half an hour after I got up; I had not any conversation with him in particular.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer's porter. I attended the sale on the 12th, 13th, and 14th. I have a catalogue of the goods; they were chiefly household goods. The things that were sold on the 13th remained on the premises; I saw them as late as seven o'clock, and I left the premises as late as half past seven, first looking round the house, as I generally do, to see that no person was secreted. I attended the next morning at half past nine; then I missed the things in the indictment, which had been safe the over night. I missed them by looking over my catalogue. I was the first person that discovered they were missing. Neither Miss Bluck nor the maid bad taken any alarm, that I had heard of, the next morning.</p>
               <p>(Witness here recites from his catalogue the several articles that were missing, which are the same as mentioned in the indictment.) I saw almost the whole of the things again about three weeks after they were stolen. I had a suspicion who stole them; I took steps for the detection of the thief. I went immediately to my master's son, who is an attorney in the neighhourhood; I told him we had been robbed; I communicated my suspicion to my master's son soon after ten that morning. I taxed the prisoner myself; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180031"/>did not tell him it would be better for him to acknowledge it; I did not threaten him. I taxed him strongly; he said he was in bed soon after eight at night, and slept until half past eight the next morning soundly, and he heard nothing in the house to disturb him whatever. I told him he must sleep very soundly indeed. He said what was it to him if they were lost; he had no charge of them whatever. Going round the place to see if I could make any discovery, he pointed out a ladder to me against a pent-house, and said here is where they got in I suppose. This ladder had been taken from an out-house in the garden; and I said that was rather impossible, for there were four feet from the ladder to the top; and then there was a thin leaden flushing which I said if a child had stepped on it, it would have left a mark. He said he did not know any thing about it, and he got out of my sight as fast as he could always. I observed that he had hurt his leg, which was one occasion for my suspicion; it was his foot; he had his shoe cut considerably, and there had been no appearance of lanen as about him the day before; he appeared very different from what he did the day before; he looked jaded. and as if he had been drinking. The moment he let me in. in the morning, I asked him what he had been doing with himself all night, (that was before I knew any thing was lost;) for his appearance was so changed? he said he was lame of a rorn, and he went away immediately out of my sight.</p>

            . We taxed the prisoner with the robbery; he utterly denied it. I asked him what time he went to bed on the preceeding night. I did not hold out any expection of mercy to him. He said it was half past eight when he went to bed, and he never came down stairs till half past eight the next morning. We proceeded to search him; in his pocket was found a written paper, being a list of all the articles that were missing; I did not know whose hand-writing it was, and I found the ticket of a turnpike gate No. 70, on him; it was Cannon-street - road gate. I was present when all the papers were taken from him, also three pieces of matches such as you light the candles with, together with a key which opens the gate into Mr. Bluck's Yard; it goes from there into the school-room, and so into the house; it is a gate which fronts into the street, it is a side door that goes into a little yard, and thence into the house. I asked him how he came possessed of those matches, he said that Maria, the servant maid, had said that she had got no matches in the house, and that she would thank him to go out and get some. I then asked him when that was, and he said between six and seven 0'clock the evening before. That was all that passed.</p>

(Witness here produces that newspaper, and reads the advertisement of which he speaks.) In consequence of that, I went to No. 10, Gulfsone-street, Whitechapel; Mrs. Thompson keeps that house.

               <p>COURT. There must be no favour, nor significant looks at the prisoner; did you know him before this time - A. I never saw him but twice before he left the things. He brought them on the Wednesday morning about half past seven; he left them at my lodging; I do not happen to know the day of the month; it was in August; he brought two pictures and some books; he brought the pairs of plated candlesticks, in short he brought all the things which Mr. Thompson gave up to the officers; there was no one with him. Mr. Thompson met the young man on the stairs; I mean by the young man the prisoner. Mr. Thompson asked him what he had brought up stairs, and he said a picture and some books; then Mr. Thompson asked him whether I was any relation to him, and he said I was his cousin; I was not so; nothing else passed. The things were taken into my lodging-room; they remained there about a fortnight. I had an advertisement put into the paper; In consequence of that, the officers came; I was not at home, but I was sent for; I was only present when part of the things were delivered to the officers. I am in an unfortunate situation of life.</p>

I had one of those tickets from Mr. Peart, one from Mr. Perkins, and one from Mr. Flemming; I had them for things which I pawned, which things were part of the things which I received from the prisoner, he told me I might pawn some of them, and in consequence of that I did.</p>

I knew the prisoner's person for a little time; I turned up the Old Change, and then turned towards Friday-street. I then went into Mr. Butterworth's warehouse, and sent for Mr. Evans, in Cheapside; he came. Then he went out again. I stationed myself over the private door. When you get into the house, there is the street door on the left hand, and a warehouse door in front. I stationed myself at the fanlight over the private door; I looked through the fanlight; I saw Atkins come in first; that was the man I saw in company with the prisoner, and who was convicted, and then Morgan came in; I am quite sure he is the person. This was about twenty minutes past eight when they came in, in the morning. Atkins undid the latch of the warehouse door; he turned it round; there is a bell to the warehouse door, and they got the door open, about an inch, or three quarters of an inch, before it rang the bell. Then Atkins put this stick in to shove the bell back; this stick was longer, but I will tell you how I broke it; Atkins shoved the bell back, so as to prevent its ringing upon his opening the door. The reason this stick was broke, Atkins, when I seized him, flung scotch snuff in my eyes, and I broke it across his legs. Morgan brought this bag in with him; it was empty when he brought it. This bag he held open in this manner, just by the warehouse door; then Atkins chucked in four pieces of cotton, and then I had to pull the door towards me, and I had then to open the door and directly that the prisoner at the bar found that, he rushed out, and dropped the bag. Then I catched Atkins in the warehouse. I produced those pieces in evidence on the former trial. Mr. Evans saw those pieces in Court here. I look at the prisoner again, and have no doubt at all that he is the young man; I had not seen him from the time of the robbery, untill I saw him at Clerkenwell prison; I never had any doubt about him. I indicted him by the name of William Morgan; he was known by the name of Long Bill, and I afterwards knew him by another name. It was last Saturday I saw him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SMITH. I am a porter, and live in this street. I am the man whom the last witness helped to sweep the door; I worked then at No.11, Walling-street. I saw the two men walking to and fro before the prosecutor's door. I believe the prisoner to be one of the two men.</p>

Then he struck me violently on the stomach, which took away my breath, and broke the busk of my stays and he took from me my shawl and handkerchief; he struck me very hard; he struck me twice on my side, once in my stomach, and several times over my head, when I fell to the ground. I can't say how many blows. I had received when I fell; the blow that broke my busk knocked me down, and I could not speak any more; I fell to the ground before he got the shawl; he had not got it, before I got the blow that knocked me down. I am sure he continued striking me after I was down; and as I rose up and ran after him, I saw him throw something away: I had not lost sight of him; I was more enraged with the bows to be after him: and I am sure I did not lose sight of him; and I am sure the person whom I saw run away, was the person who knocked me down, and took my shawl away; I heard a rustling before, as if somebody was going to stop him. I hallooed out stop thief, stop thief, and the watchman replied, I have stopt him.</p>

Yes; at about half past twelve I was on my watch; I was about to leave my box when I heard the cries of this girl; I immediately repaired to the spot that the sound came from, and I had got one third of the distance up one side of Montague-square, when I met the prisoner running at full speed towards me; I bid him stand, or I would knock him down; he did so, and I collared him immediately; I immediately sprang my rattle for assistance; I gave him in charge of a watchman until I returned from fastening my box, which I had left open. The woman came up immediately after I had taken him; she said, have you got him, or you have got him, and I said, yes, is this the man? and she said, he was. Then I went down to the watchhouse with the prisoner; I did not see any shawl or handkerchief produced; I don't recollect a shawl being brought back.

The prisoner was in the room at the time. I told her it was impossible for her to lose it, and she had better look again. She said I am confident I have lost it. Then I challenged the prisoner with it, and she denied it for five or ten minutes. Then I came down stairs, and told my son not to let her go out until I fetched an officer, I fetched an officer, and gave charge of her. In bringing her down stairs, she informed the officer that the pocket-book was in the house. I asked her where it was, and she said, down in the cellar, where the five chaldrons of coals were shot, on the cill of the window. The officer looked for it, and could not find it. I said to the prisoner, shew the officer where it is; she put her hand up over the cill of the window, and bringing out the pocket-book delivered it to the officer. I asked her whether there was any property in it, and she said, yes, that there was part of it. The officer examined the pocket-book, and found a five shilling and sixpenny dollar, a three shilling piece, a duplicate for two gold coins, a bill of exchange, and a promissory note; the bill of exchange was for ten pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence; the promissory note was for seven pounds. I asked her how she had got to the property, and she said she had got a key to the drawer, and I asked her what she had done with it, and she said, she had thrown it down the privy.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARKER. I am an officer. Mr. Hewes came to me on Sunday, the 22nd of September, and said he suspected that the servant had robbed him of these things. I went with him, and took charge of her; she then began to be rather alarmed. I asked her where was the money, and she said, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180034"/>was in the cellar. I went into the cellar, and could not find it, and she came down, and took it off a beam in the cieling off of the little I opened the pocket-book, and found in it a five shilling and sixpenny dollar, a three shilling piece, a duplicate for two gold coins, ten shillings and sixpence, and a seven shilling piece. I then asked her what she had done with the other money; she said, she had laid it out, and had pawned the guinea at Mr. Pearl's for eighteen shillings, and she said she had found the key in the garret. Mr. Hewes suspected that she had taken notes out of another drawer; but she said, she-had not, for the key was too large, and she could not unlock it.</p>

I met the prisoner in Sr. James's-street, a short time after I had returned from Canada, where I had been on service; he was looking in at a shop window, and seemed, as I thought, in very great distress; he addressed me, and told me that he was in very great distress, and had been out of employ for six months, and had been obliged to pawn all his clothes from poverty; from a feeling of charity, I took him into my service.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after this was it that you missed any dollars - A. I don't know exactly how many days it was; but it was between the 5th and the 8th that I missed them, I only missed a portion, about five hundred and fifty-five, within one or two. After the prisoner came to live with me, I believe the next morning, or the day after, he appeared in a new coat, in an extremely nice new coat, and his appearance was changed very much indeed for the better. I had left my lodging for one night to go to Richmend, and foolishly left my keys behind me; one of those keys would open the box in which the dollars were deposited. The prisoner was my only servant. In consiquence of my suspicion, I went to Bow-street. I was present when the Bow-street officer apprehended the prisoner; he was not living in the same home with me; he slept in one of those old houses in Bolsever-street. At the time he was apprehended I told him what I apprehended him for; I told him I missed a quantity of dollars, and I conceived it impossible for any one else to rob me. He then became rather abusive, and he said, he was extremely sorry that he ever came into my service, on account of his character, and he never had taken any money of mine. On taxing him with the alteration for the better in his appearance; he said, he bought the new coat from a jew in the street. I went with the Bow-street officers to his lodging in Bolsover-street I took the prisoner with me. I saw the officers examine his lodging, and we found a parcel of women's new shoes, a quantity of trinkets, and silk handkerchiefs quite new. We did not find any dollars.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARRIS. I am shopman to Messrs. Rochforts, in Jermyin-street, they are pawnbrokers. I know the prisoner at the bar; he purchased a watch at our shop, I think on the 9th or 10th of July; a silver watch; he paid me in Spanish dollars, fifteen in number; the amount was three pounds two shillings and sixpence.

The prisoner bought something of me, about two or three days before he was taken up; he bought a coat; I asked him two guiness for it, and he gave seven Spanish dollars; I allowed him four shillings and four pence a piece for the dollars; so then he paid me in all dollars. I am sure he is the man; he used to pass my door almost every day.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wilkinson, the jeweller, in Piccadilly. I know the person of the prisoner at the bar; he came one morning; I think Thursday the 11th of July; we asked him four pounds for a gold seal; be bought it. I agreed for three pounds ten shillings at last. He paid me eighteen dollars, and I gave him two shillings change out; they were old Spanish dollars; at that time he had a number of dollars in his possession. He asked if we could not give more than four shillings a piece for them; and we told him no. He brought sixty four other dollars in his possession; he said he could get four shillings and sixpence and five shillings a piece for them in Swallow street; but the person to whom he applied had gone out for change of a fifty pound note, to make a purchase of them. We purchased the sixty four dollars. I saw him in custody with in three or four days after this, I knew his person.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of him - A. About six o'clock in the evening of the 6th of August, I went out to exercise one of my horses, and when I came back, my young mistress was waiting to go out riding with the poney. I went into the stable and took off my coat, and took it into the harness room; the harness room is part of the stable, and the stable joins the rest of the house; kitchen, stable, and all join together. I went into the harness room, and brought out a coat like this. As I was coming out of the harness room, there was a man behind the door; he came from behind the door, and said I thought it was your master, and I said my man what do you do here; it was the prisoner. I asked him his business, and he said he had no business; and I said why do you come here? this was about six o'clock in the evening; and I turned him out; then he said that the footman wanted to buy a ferret, and I said I was sure the footman wanted no ferret. At last I turned him out; I left my great coat in the harness room, and locked the harness room door, and put the key in my pocket; the stable door was left open the first time he came. I went out the last time, I shut the stable door, but did not lock it. Then I went out with my young mistress as far as Tottenham High Cross; my master's house is at Edmonton; I was out about half an hour altogether. When I was coming back with my young mistress, I saw the prisoner at the bar about a quarter of a mile from my master's house; I saw him with a long coat on, drawing on the ground; I thought it was mine. When he saw me he turned up a lane, and when I got up opposite the lane, I got off my horse, and went an I examined the coat. I laid hold of him, and the great coat, and knew it to be mine; it was the same I hung up in the harness room. I said my man, you have got my coat, he said he had not; I examined him and said, you have not got mine only, but you have got two of my fellow servants also. He had got three coats over his own. I asked him how he came by them, and he said the footman gave them to him. I took him by the collar, and led him to my master's house; there was one coat a livery, it was a coat belonging to a former footman: I called the great coat mine; my master gave it me two years ago, so it was my property. We took the prisoner to Mr. Roberts the justice at Tottenham; there the coats were delivered to the constable, his name is Grinley.</p>

On the 18th of July this happened, at about a quarter before twelve at night; I had been to Perceval-street, Clerkewell; I had been with friends, but had not been drinking, I was perfectly sober.

I recovered myself, and caught the cuff of one, which came off in my hand. The two ran away, and I immediately seized this man, and called watch; the other two did not run until I called the watchmen. When I called the watchmen, I gave this man in charge; my hat and cane were taken from me. At the time I received the blow, they took my hat off my head; one of the three, I dont know which. My cane was taken from my hand, but it was so suddenly done, that I hardly knew myself. The prisoner did not get out of my sight before I took him close by me. The blow was given, and the property was gone just at one, and the same time. The cane was brought back to the watchhouse, but the hat was completely gone.</p>
               <p>JAMES BILLET, I am a watchman. When I came up, I asked what was the matter. and this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180036"/>gentleman said that some one or two more had robbed him of his hat and cane, and had nearly knocked him down. The prisoner said he was going home to Whitecross-street, and he said he was out of place, that is all. After I got the charge of the prisoner, Mr. Minster looked about, and found an old hat, but he said that was not his; the cane was brought back to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's. Defence. I had been at my uncles, at Mile-end, and coming home by the church, I heard a cry of watch; the gentleman seized me, and said. I was one of the three that robbed him, and he called the watchman, and I was taken into custody, which I am very innocent of the crime.</p>

When I was going to step across John street, the prisoner Hedges drove against me with his shoulder, and drove me back, and immediately snatched my watch, and took it out, and I felt it. I felt it moving out of my pocket. I immediately when it was gone, I turned myself round, an the turned towards Gray's inn-lane, and I called out stop thief; it was about four or five minutes between my being robbed and his being taking.</p>

I found a window open, the kitchen window where the basket of clothes had stood facing; that kitchen looks into the garden; the basket of linen was in that kitchen the night before, and that linen which I found in the garden, had been with the rest. The basket was half out of the window, and part of the linen was in the garden<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180037"/>Some of the linen was in the garden, and the remainder was in the basket. I went to bed the night before at half past ten; I left that window fastened with a screw then. The window was open, and the screw appeared to have been broken; the window was thrown up, and it appeared to me to have been broken by violence; it had been wrenched with something; the basket stood near to the window the night before, on a dresser facing the window; it could be reached by an arm. Nobody could get to that window without getting over the garden pales. The whole basket was removed from the spot where it was the night before; that was my dwelling-house, and the linen was my property. I did not see the prisoner in my garden; I saw him when he was taken. I did not see him until I took him; we took him in the next garden to my own; I found him in the privy, and we took him to Worship-street. I asked him what business he had there, and he said, he got over to ease himself. I told him there was no necessity for that as there was a large field at the back of the garden. I did not find any linen no any thing about him.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am a neighbour of Mr. Griffin's. I very well remember looking out of my window on the morning in question, it was the 26th of July, the morning that the last witness has been speaking of, it was about a quarter before four, or somewhere there about; I had occasion to get up, and I was standing against my window, and I saw the prisoner plainly; I saw him jump over Mr. Griffin's pales. When I saw him first, he jumped into Mr. Griffin's garden; then I ran down stairs as quick as I could. He had then got the window open. All I can say is it was open when I got there; my house does not adjoin Griffin's; there is a little road between; this was my back window that I was looking out of; my back window looks into his garden; I ran down by his garden pales; the prisoner was in Griffin garden when I got down. He was standing by the window getting the basket out; he was standing still when I came, and was looking about him; he had got the basket half way out of the window; I saw him at the window with the basket half way out; that was after I returned from calling Griffin; I am sure he had hold of the basket; he got out of that garden and went into the next garden; I saw him go over the paces; those were the pales of the garden in which the privy was that he was taken in. I assisted in taking him; Griffin and I were together when he was taken. The basket was left there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see or hear any thing that drew your attention - A. I saw the prisoner step from the pavement on to the shop-board; I had left nobody in the shop; we have no window to our shop; but there is a board fenced in by an iron-railing raised three feet eleven inches. He had one of his legs extended, and was laying over the rail, assisting as I supposed, in taking this out of the shop. I immediately proceeded up stairs, and saw him and another take the piece of oil-cloth which is now in Court; they had got it outside the shop, and it was upon the shoulder of one of them; it was on the shoulder of the prisoner's companion. I immediately called stop thief, and they dropped it. I pursued after the prisoner, and lost sight of him myself. Then I pursued the other, and left the people to pursue the prisoner. I lost the other; but the prisoner was apprehended by the people; it was not five minutes before he was brought back to my shop. I am positive the prisoner is one of the persons, for I had an opportunity of observing him for two or three minutes; I am certain of his person. The oil-cloth was recovered; I under value it at five-pound; it is here; it cost me five pounds to manufacture it.</p>

I then saw the prisoner running away, and ten or a dozen people running after him; he turned off into Church-street; I followed him, and laid hold of him. At that time I did not know what was the charge against him. The prosecutor came up soon after, and said, he had been robbed of a piece of floor-cloth, and the prisoner said he was going by, and helped a man up with it on his shoulder; it was at the watchhouse he said that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up this street, and there was a young man standing by the prosecutor's door, and he asked me to be so good as to lift this up upon his shoulder, and I did so. I ran on about my business directly, and I was stopped, and brought back to the house.</p>

I met three men; I don't know whether the prisoner was one of them; one took the bundle from my arm; he went a few steps, and it fell; I went and tried to pick it up, and got my hand upon it, and one of them gave me a push, and I fell down. He got it up again, and ran away. I ran after him a little way; I did-not overtake him. One of the others asked me what I wanted, and I told him I wanted my bundle, and be made no answer. He did not binder me from running. Then the two other men ran after Copsey. I then went on towards Newington; they went Islington way. I next saw two of the men at about twenty minutes before two; they were then taken into custody; the prisoner was not either of those, they were tried and convicted here. When I got across the fields almost to Newington, I met a young man; he asked me if I was frightened at the cows, and I told him I was not; I told him I had been pushed down by three men, and he went after them. The things mentioned in the indictment were in the bundle; they belonged to Miss Parker; I was to take them to Dr. Gascoigne's; Miss Parker was going there on a visit; she is eight years old.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN CLARK. I am a cow-keeper. I saw the prosecutrix in our field on the day in the indictment; I was milking a cow at the time. She looked frightened, and I asked her if she was frightened at the cows, and she said she was not; but had been knocked down, and robbed of her bundle. I saw the prisoner pass me along with two more before; he was a stranger; I did not know his name; but I had seen his person before; I can speak with certainty as to him; I had seen him about ten minutes before; in that very field where the girl said she had been knocked down; I had seen him numbers of times before about London streets when I go with my milk. I am certain of his person. When she complained to me, this man and the other two were out of my sight. Shortly before she complained, they passed me, going in a direction, in which she soon afterwards came. I saw no other party of three go that way, about that time. I raised an alarm, after the men. There were other persons milking in our field. I, at last, got sight of them; when I saw the prisoner again, the two others were in company with him. I had got about a mile and a half from this field; I got sight of them up in lslington fields; I saw them under a tree, and they were tying the bundle up in an apron; they were standing; then they went on again, and we ran after them; I had got another young man with me; they walked on; they did not see us. When we came up near them, we hallooed out stop thief; they looked round then, and ran a little way, and then threw the bundle down; all three looked round; I stooped to pick the bundle up; but the other young man picked it up first. I pursued after the men; I then missed the prisoner; he got away for the time, and I did not see him again that day. I next saw him in two or three days after about Shoreditch; I did not cause him to be apprehended; I saw him several times after; I took no steps to cause him to be apprehended. I saw him in custody about eight weeks after. I gave information to Mr. Yardley, that I knew the man; he belongs to Worship-street, and I saw the prisoner in custody in about two months. I knew him then to be one of the men that I saw in the field where this girl was robbed. When the bundle was picked up, it had an apron round it then. I did not particularly notice that the prisoner or his companions had an apron with them when they first passed me. The person who picked up the bundle is not here.</p>

As soon as I put the goods in, I locked it down, which was with a good deal of exertion as it was quite full, and took three or four to held it, while I locked it; I put the key in my pocket, and the trunk maker was in waiting, and he immediately put the mat on and nailed it, and corded it, and the trunk remained in my possession until the 19th of July, on which day it was called for, and I myself dragged it to the loop-hole of my room, to put it into the cart; this is the top of all the warehouse, and I lowered it down to what we call the lobby, where they are delivered, they are then weighed; an officer weighs them. This was on the 19th of July. During the time it was packed up, it was as far from the loop hole, as I am from you; in a public room where there are servants of the company and merchants continually backwards and forwards. At the time I so lowered it to where it was weighed, it was in the same state to all appearance, as when the packer left it. I look at that trunk, and swear it is the trunk; I swear to the mark and number, because I marked it myself, a thing I don't often do; but I did this. I have since seen the goods that were found, they are similar romalls.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HIGHBY. I am a looker to the Customs, on duty at the East India Company's warehouses. I saw the packing in a trunk of some India silk romalls on the 28th of June last; I counted out fifty pieces of romalls pullicatis; they were to be packed in a trunk, marked O with an X run through it, and numbered 301; it was packed for Messrs. Brown, Rogers and Brown. I saw Mr. Pryor the last witness pack these pieces; there were five other trunks of nearly the same size. The trunk produced has every appearance of being the trunk alluded to; I believe it to be the same, and have no doubt about it. After it was packed, on the 19th of July I received my orders for the delivery of it, from the customers, and I delivered it into a cart from the loop hole of the West area, on a lower tier than that on whcih it had been packed; I saw it put into the cart myself.</p>

            . On the 19th of July, I received from Mr. Goble six trunks; this paper, is a cart note, called a shipping note, without which I could not receive them; I received it from Messrs Brown and Co; I saw these things in the cart and took them out of the cart; I did not tick them off. I remember that there were six trunks, I know that particularly, because it was a wet day, and we were obliged to cover them occasionally with a tarpaulin. These were three bales besides the trunks; they were all for Brown and Co; they were all for the same proprietor, and were to be shipped on board the same lighter, and were so. I will not swear whether I saw any of the prisoners in the lighter;

             I might have seen, but the other was not there. When I saw them in the craft, I did not make any particular remark; but they were stowing them away. The lighter lay at the further end of the Custom House Quay, right under the crane, No. 4; all the cranes are numbered.</p>

On the 19th of July, I put some goods, on board a lighter of ours, she was lying under No.4 crane; the goods consisted of trunks and bales, I think there were six trunks. I look at the trunk produced, it has the same mark and number. Rawlinson, Bonner, and Leanord were stowing away. I gave directions how they were to pack the trunks, I told them not to put the bales at the bottom, and Leonard said what odds, and the other men could hear him. They were not stowed, as I ordered them to be, they put the trunks on the bales instead of the bales on them. After all the things were on board, I took up the tarpaulin, let down the hatches, and put over the hatch bars; I did not lock them; the trunks were below. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 19th.</p>

            . I look at that trunk, I saw that and five more on board a lighter of Mr. Olivers, lying near the crane, No. 4, Custom House Quay; they were stowed, I did not see them stow them on board; I did not observe the stowage at that time; I had given orders for the trunks to be put below the bales. On the next morning I found that they were not so, but that they were at top, contrary to the orders I had given; I saw them on board the lighter between twelve and one on the 19th. I had one key of the batch bars; they were not locked, until they were locked in my presence, about seven, or between six and seven; there are two keys, and I had both after they were locked down; and I made the man that locked them, shake the locks to see if they were safe. The lighter was then put out of the birth where she lay, and another lighter estern of her, was put into her place, and this was put more forward in the river, a lighter's length further out.

             was employed in that, the other prisoner was not in that lighter at all. About nine, I gave orders that he and Rawlinson should be out for the night, to take charge of that lighter; I told them that I should be over in the morning between four and five, and that I should appoint another man, so that we might put her down against tide, in the tier below the Tender; I mean by against tide, in expectation of tide. The ship Scicily, lay just below the Tender. I gave the prisoners no more orders about what they were to do than I have described. I appointed the two of them to be with it, knowing it to be of great value. Peg was to be a watchman, and was to be with it all night. I had not mentioned that they were of great value to either of the prisoners; not having the keys, they could not get below, as I imagined I had the key of the scuttle, and the keys of the bars, and I thought they could not get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180040"/>down below. I saw the lighter again at eleven at night. Having loaded a craft, I went down to see if all was safe at eleven o'clock at night again. When I got-down by the water side, I heard two men, Rawlinson and Peg, talking to a man named Bonner; on hearing their voices, I told them that was not their charge, and told them to go to their charge. Bonaer was on board a barge alongside, and these two men were talking with him; I don't know whether they were with Bonner in his barge, but I know they were off their own lighter that they had charge of; they were either in Bonner's barge, or in a lighter lying by. I told them that was not their place, and they ought to go on board their own lighter. They went on board in consequence of what I said to them. Consistently with their duty, they could not be away from their charge. I next went to the lighter at about a quarter before five in the morning; the prisoners were neither of them there. I unlocked the stern scuttle, and went down below; I saw the six trunks all lying at the top of the bales; that was the first time I knew that my orders had not been attended to in that respect, I saw every thing right as I thought. I made some inquiries. I saw the prisoners at a quarter after five or half after; I was in the lighter when they came; I sent after them, they were both together, I believe I accused them of being absent from their charge. I then gave Rawlinson the keys of the lighter and the shipping note to deliver the goods. I employed Peg in other business; he went down with the lighter with Rawlinson and two more men. The lighter had got to go the distance from about this to St. Sephulchre's church to the Scicily. I went to the searchers office about twelve; I met Mr. Oliver, and Mr. Wolfe coming down the gateway; Mr. Wolfe is the searcher of the Custom House. I then received some information; I then learned that the property had been taken from the lighter. Maize the watchman was there. He stated some circumstances that occured to his observation; he spoke of some persons that he had seen, and his description of those persons corresponded with the two prisoners at the bar, Neither of them was present, or in sight.</p>
               <p>SIMON MAIZE. I am a watchman of Portsoken Ward; my station is at the corner of Swan-street, facing John-street in the Minories. On the morning of the 20th of July, I observed three men coming towards me at aboat a quarter before four, they came up John-street towards the Minories; at that time in the morning, it was broad daylight; John-street is the direct road from the Custom House Quay, and a person coming from the Custom House would and must come up that way. Two out of these three men had bundles, the third had nothing that I could perceive in his hand; he was in company with them. They came to the corner of America-square; and then the third man came into the Minories, towards Tower Hill; then they made for Redlion Court that is rather higher up in the Minories; the other without the bundle, came up the Minories towards my box; he passed me, and addressed me; he said it is almost four o'clock watchman is it not; I said yes, it is very near. He then went down the Minories as if he was going towards Tower Hill; the course that the took was apparently towards Redlion Court. I know the man by his features, and I know that he was very much dishaped by his walk, very lame, and very much knock kneed; Peg is that man I have no doubt at all that he is the man. After he passed me, I went down Goodman's yard; thinking I should see those two with the bundles go by again. When I got down to the bottom of the yard I did not see anything of them not just then; I then went into Redlion Court and there was Rawlinson with one of the bundles; there were Rawlinson, Peg and another man with the bundles; the other man had the other bundle. With that I went up to Rawlinson with the bundle, as he stood right facing me; he had the bundle in his hand, I asked him what he had there, and he said nothing of any consequence; with that he threw the bundle down, and made his escape; the others threw their bundle down, and all three made their escape just at that time. They ran away as fast as they could; the court is not very long. I took up the two bundles, and threw them into my box. Just as I got to my box, one of the patroles came up, his name is Hargraves; he asked me what I had got, I told him I did not know, but I gave them to Hargraves, and after that returned to my daty. In consequence of information, which I had, I went to the Custom House and described to Waller the men whom I had seen. in consequence of further information, I went down to the London Docks, and in the London Dock No.2, I found one of the prisoner's lying on his back; he did not appear to me to be asleep; it was peg. The officer roused him; I told him he was one; I saw as soon as he got up on his backside, that he was one of the men. He had the same features to me, and stood on the same legs. I afterwards saw him on his legs, and was then more sure of him. When all three had thrown down the bundles, and ran away; they all ran the same way. We took Peg into custody, and went to his lodging; we afterwards took a boat at St. Catherine's stairs, and went to the Scicily; she was lying just below the tier. When I got to the Scicily, I was told to look round, and I saw Robinson in the craft eating a bit of biscuit. I pointed him out to Forrester, and he was secured. I am sure he is one of the men; I saw him in America-square. I described them before I saw them.</p>

            . I belong to the Ward of Portsoken. I received the property from the last witness; and in consequence of information, I went to the house of Mrs. Jacobs; I obtained admittance. We found nothing there relating to this charge. When I returned to the watchhouse, the two bundles were there. I examined them, and discovered their contents; Maize described the persons of the prisoners at the bar, which description they answered when they were taken. In the bundles I found twenty-two pieces of silk handkerchiefs. I was in company with Maize when the prisoner Peg was in his sight afterwards, and at the time he saw Rawlinson I was ordered to have a strict guard over him, that he might not make a bolt; I had not laid hands on him nor taken him into custody; Maize said that he was confident they were the men that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180041"/>had seen in the early part of the morning. When first Maize came on board, Flam on was eating a bit of biscuit with a piece of boiled meat, beef, I believe; and was sitting down, and he knew him almost immediately.</p>
               <p>ROBERT OLIVER. I am a lighter-man. On hearing what had happened, I went on board the Scicily; I saw Rawlinson there; I asked him if he was not a pretty rascal, to rob his own charge; he said, that the goods were all right, and that he had never left her; I believe this was about twelve o'clock, or a little after; it was before he was apprehended. I went on conversing about the circumstances of the transaction; while I was so conversing, the trunks were brought in for examination. Rawlinson then said that he had left the craft for a little while, and had been on shore; I think he said, to Dark-house-lane; that is near Billingsgate. I did not pay much attention to him. After that, I saw the trunks examined; the one in question appeared to have been opened; by looking at it, I could tell that; the matting seemed all torn, and the nails were only here and there placed in the iron hoops. I have no doubt of its having been opened; I was perfectly satisfied of that. When we took the matting off. we observed that the lock was broken off; I looked into this trunk, and there were only eleven pieces; there ought to have been fifty; thirty-nine were missing; their place was supplied with old rope and old tarpaulin.</p>

               <p>MR. JOSEPH EDLMANN. I am agent of the house of Reyer and Schlik. I know the gentleman at the bar. I first became acquainted with him on the 1st or 2nd of July; he came to me, and represented himself to be a countryman of mine, and to have served in the Army, and to have got into some embarrassment on the Continent, and for that reason quitted the Continent; he came to England to look for employment, and was actually in great distress; I relieved him. He was in the habit of coming to my house every day twice or three times. I found him serviceable in his own language. On the 18th of August, which was Sunday, he came to breakfast. After breakfast, he went away; he had not taken leave of me to go any where in particular at that time. He went out. In about half an hour after, I went into the Country. I returned about ten or eleven in the evening. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I missed the bills in question; they had been in an iron safe in the counting-house; the key of that safe was generally in a wooden case by the side of it. The prisoner at the bar knew where the key was kept; he was frequently in the counting-house, and I have used the key while he has been there sometimes. I had seen the bills on the Saturday during the day; the three amounted altogether to nine hundred and twenty pounds. In consequence of missing them, I called my servant maid; I made some enquiries in my house, which led me to go to Bow-street; ultimately I and Bishop went in a post chaise to Caterbury; we got to Canterbury between two and four in the morning. I first saw him in the room in the Inn at Caterbury, when he was brought in by Bishop. I first identified him, and then Bishop seized him; the bills were found on him; I saw Bishop find them in one of his pockets; those bills Mr. Bishop has.</p>

            . I went with Mr. Edlmann to Canterbury. I overtook the coach at Canterbury; I found the prisoner just going from the Dover coach into the Guildhall tavern; he was alighting from it where they change horses. I secured him from behind for fear of accidents; he had this loaded pistol in one hand, and a dagger in the other. I found another loaded pistol in the pocket of the stage coach. On searching him, I found the three bills in question on him, and a quantity of powder and twelve bal1s.</p>

               <p>Mr. Edlmann. Those are my bills.</p>

            . I live servant with Mr. Edlmann. On Saturday, the 18th of August, I remember the prisoner at the bar breakfasting with my master; he went away about half an hour before my master in the morning. After my master had gone out about an hour or better, the prisoner returned, and said, he wanted a book out of the counting-house; he went into the counting-house, and I went about my domestic concerns; he was in the counting-house in which my master's iron safe was. He was about twenty or twenty-five minutes there. I was up stairs on the first floor, and I heard the door open, and I looked out of the window, and saw him go out with a book in his hand. He was gone about an hour; when he came back, he said, he wished to write a note to Mr. Edlmann, to say, he should not breakfast with him the next morning; but he should see him the next day. When he got a bit of paper and began to write, I of course left the counting-house, and when I came to the door in four or five minutes, he came out, and said, I have finished the note Mrs. Totter, give it to your master with my compliments; then he went away.</p>

            . I live at No. 22, St. Martin's-le-grand, and am a corn-dealer. The prisoner lodged in my house. On Sunday, the 18th of August, he said he should go and fetch a book, and I believe he brought one in; it was similar to that. He said, he had lost the key of it some days, and I was laying on the sofa, and I got up to see if I had a key that would open it, I had not. He said, he should get the key of it the next day. He got up about nine o'clock the next morning, and I believe he was gone before ten; I believe he owed nearly a pound for lodging; he had his trunk away, and he asked my man to get a porter to carry his trunk; he took no final leave.</p>

He came to me on the 7th of the present month, at about half past one; I set him to work down in the lower warehouse; he was very much intoxicated.

I followed him into Leaden-hall-street, and laid hold of the horse's head; I asked him what he had in the cart; he said, two dozen skins. I asked him who they were for, and he said for Mr. Wood, of Fishmonger alley, in the Borough. I told him Mr. Wood had not made any purchase that day. Then he said he had made a mistake, and I might take the skins back again; upon which, he jumped off the shafis of the curt, and ran away; I and Mr. Fenner's man ran after him, and caught him.</p>

About twelve o'clock on the night of Saturday, the 20th of July, the prisoner was very much intoxicated, and we put her to bed. She had lived with me since April. In the morning I got up about eight o'clock, with intent to send her away, and when I came down, she was in liquor again. I suspected all was not right, and I set my daughter to watch her, and she called me down, and I sent for a constable, and we found a key on her which opened the wine-cellar door. In her pocket we found several duplicates, one leading to a shift of my wife's, and between the bed and the mattrass I found the other things named in the indictment.</p>

We went up to Marybone; we were fetched away from Marybone at half past five by Bray, who informed me that my house was robbed; it had been robbed of the things in the indictment, they were in a drawer, part of a chest of drawers which was in the one pair of stairs front room; they had been locked, and had been opened by a chissel, or something of that kind; the room door had been locked, that was opened too; I did not find that it had been opened by violence. When I came home, I saw Mr. Johnson; the moment I saw him, I was so aggravated, that I said something to Mr. Johnson, I very much offendad him; somebody had told me something. I said Mr. Johnson, how could you be so bad a man, as to let the poor young fellow go up again; then he said that he came down empty, and his coming down empty was to no purpose to me, and he said when he came down with a load, I soon took him. I said no more to Johnson. The young man was taken to the office, and committed, and tried here; this property was afterwards produced by Johnson, as taken from Baxter.</p>

             the prisoner; I saw him in the course of that day, it was the afternoon of the 31st of July, 1814; I saw him in Gray's-inn-lane, opposite to the house that was being robbed. I have known him this twenty years. I did not know him to be an officer of the City at that time. As I was passing along, he called to me, I was walking on Snowsill's side, and he called to me before I observed him; he said Tom, stop here, they are cracking a crib on the opposite side; I did not at that time understand what that was, but I now understand it to be breaking a house open. I asked him his meaning; he said the curtain is down, pointing to the curtain of the house; go and take your station at the end of the lane, and if I give you a signal, you come up to me; he did not add anything more. I went down, and stood at the end of the lane, that gave me a command of that side of the lane where he was standing; I could see Snowsill's door, and Johnson who stood opposite to it. In a few minutes, about five or six, a man came out of Snowsill's house; he crossed over towards Johnson, and spoke to him; they conversed together and walked down Gray's-inn-lane; they were the space of five or six minutes talking at the end of Charlotte Buildings; then they parted, and the man went back again into Mr. Snowsill's house, and Johnson took his station as before; I still remained in my station for seven or eight minutes after that. After he had gone in the second time, I saw the man come out of the house, I did not observe any difference in his appearance as to bulk; I was not near enough for that, and I had no idea that he was the person whom Johnson was watching. Johnson made me a signal, a beckon, and then I got up to them both, close to a public-house, called the

             of Warwick, by then I got up, Johnson asked him if he would have anything to drink; the man said yes, but we will go farther down; Johnson sain no, come in here. We went in, and Johnson asked him what he would have to drink, and he said a pint of porter; Johnson said, sit down, sit down; the man sit down and Johnson put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and said, now I am an officer, and if you make any resistance, I will blow your brains out; he took the handcuffs out of his pocket, when he put his hand in, and handcuffed the man. He then proceeded to search him. He asked me to go to Snowsill's, to see that nobody went in, I did so. I was absent about seven or eight minutes; then Johnson came and beckoned me back again; I went back and helped Johnson to count out the money that was taken from the man, and it amounted to sixteen pounds, sixteen shillings in silver, and some trifle in gold; I took an invertory of the silver myself, in Johnson's pocket-book; there was a bill of exchange and a promisory note. Johnson asked me to sit down by the prisoner while he went over to inform them that they were robbed; he went out accordingly to do so; he was gone for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then returned with a man of the name of Bray; it turned out to be another officer, as I understood since. Both Johnson and Bray took the man to Eagle-street watchhouse. I since know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180046"/>that it was William Baxter who was then taken into custody, and to him all my evidence relates when I have been speaking of this man. I was not present when he was tried. Johnson, Bray and I went over to Mr. Snowsill's and he had not come from chapel. When he had come home Johnson told him the house had been broken open, and it was agreed that Bray should go to the other end of the town to fetch Mrs. Snowsill.</p>

               <p>RICHARD HATTON. I am a watchhouse-keeper in St. Andrew's parish, and was so in July, 1814; that watchhouse is in Eagle-street. I remember on Sunday, the 31st of July, 1814, the prisoner Johnson and another man brought Baxter to the watchhouse, near about three o'clock in the afternoon; Johnson desired me to take care of the prisoner he brought. I asked him for what? he told me for house-breaking in our parish. I asked him where? and he told me at the patten-maker's, in Gray's-inn-lane. I asked him if he had known any thing of the prisoner? he told me when I put him back in the lock-up room, that he would tell me all about it. Accordingly he went with me and this other man that was with him to see the prisoner locked up. That being done, he came back to the watchhouse alongwith me. I asked him what officers they were? and he said, they belonged to the City Police. I asked him if he knew any thing of the prisoner before? his answer was that he was introduced to him as a cracksman, and he had been with him all that morning. He himself had been introduced, and he, Baxter, did not know but he, Johnson, was one of the same sort. That he was in some where about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and Baxter was coming out at the door to come for the street again, and Johnson said he saw he had got nothing about him then. Johnson asked Baxter if all was right? and he said, no. Johnson said, damme, go back again, and do it, for all is right here. He went back again, and was in about ten minutes; Baxter then came out again; Johnson said he saw all was right then by the bulk of his pocket. He asked him if he would have any thing to drink; and he said yes, and he took him over the way.</p>
               <p>JOHN BAXTER. I live at No. 10, Russel-place, Little Coram-street. I am the father of the young man who was convicted of a robbery in Gray's-inn-lane. When my son was apprehended. I went to see him; I went on the morning following, between five and six o'clock; on my going to the watchhouse, I saw the present prisoner Johnson soon after; he asked me my name; I told him. To that he said, are you the father of the prisoner, and I said, I was. I told him I could see very plainly that it was a planned thing to trap him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Johnson say to that - A. He said if he were to give a pistol into his hand to shoot another, is that enough that he should do the action. I asked him what office he meant to take him to, and he said to Marlborough-street. I said the proper office was Hatton Garden. I said he had no right to take him there; he said he should take him to no place but Marlborough-street. Johnson was then securing my son, and band-cuffing him; my son said Johnson, what you are now doing to me, will be done to you very soon.</p>

Accordingly I went to see this man of the name of Golding. According to appointment, I met him at the top of Brooks-street, Holborn, and went into a public-house, and had a pint of half and half. Then it was about the time that I was to be at the top of Gray's-inn-lane; but when the man that is convicted,(Golding) was paying for the half and half we met with this Baxter, and then Golding spoke to him, and I supposed by the description that he was the man who was to commit the burglary; they said, they would go back, and have half a quartern of gin; whilst the two were drinking, Baxter then pulled out a key, signifying that all was right; according to my information it then was done, and my plan was totally defeated; and on coming to the door, Baxter saw what he had done, and what he was going to do. Under these circumstances, being in company with him, I found I could not being him to a Public Court of Justice, and I found it was then two late, and he was then to meet Golding again in the afternoon; but I was not to be there, because the person suspected I was not one; little did he think I was an officer. In the afternoon, they met again in Gray's-inn-lane, and Baxter touched me on the shoulder; he said, Golding was drunk. I did not know what to do; when I met with a man of the name of Bray; I acquainted him with it, and the young man Bingley; I never knew a more false evidence; he stated, that I kept him. He saw every transaction; so did Bray. But the young man says, he saw the young man let down the curtain, and that is a total falsehood.</p>
               <p>THE COURT, here interrupted the prisoner, to correct this misunderstanding of h1s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, in Continuance. - He came out, and was not in one minute; I was then momentarily going to take him, and he said, d-n my eyes, my hand itches for it, here goes, and he went in, and I do not know what he did. But when he came out the second time, I acquainted Bray with it. I was then going to take him into custody; on account of his being such a notorious character, and his having committed such a number of robberies. I let him go in again, and he had said, the first officer that offered to take him, he would put a knife into his liver, and no doubt if I am found guilty I shall suffer. Moreover after that, I took him to the watchhouse, and took him in company with Bray; Bray was present, and that young man. Bingley has sworn entirely false, Directly as I got him into the house, and as he began to count the money. I took Baxter off to the watchhouse. There was a man at the watchhouse, and he said, that the watchhouse-keeper was up stairs a-bed, and he called him down, and when he came, I told him I had a man for burglary; I told him where it was. I left him there, and that is all I spoke to him, so help me God. At<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180047"/>the time that man, Hatton, was an evidence on the trial of Baxter, he was going to be indicted for perjury, and he was ordered out of Court by the counsel; there was not a word mentioned of what has been said to day; it is made up altogether; if it was not made up, why did they not come forward to save the young man's life on the trial, and why did not Mrs. Snowsill state what she said to day as she should do. I am here to be tried for my life, and I must leave it totally to your Lordship and the Jury. It is hard that all these things should be brought up against me now, and I hope God will save her soul, if he don't save mine. As for the father he is as bad as Baxter was; he was turned away from Messrs. Cannon and Cole's, in Thames-street, for a robbery.</p>
               <p>-BRAY. I was a City officer; I am not so now. I went to fetch the mother and daughter; I did fetch them. Johnson did not say any thing to them to my knowledge about his sending the young man into the house the second time. If he had said it in the coach coming, I should have heard it. I only came home with Mrs. and Miss Snowsill in a hackney coach, and there I left them. Whether Johnson was with them or not, I don't know. I went into the one pair of stairs, and I believe Mrs. Snowsill sent something up there to drink. Neither in the coach nor in the house, did I hear Johnson say any thing to her about sending the man in a second time. She was looking over the things in the house, and I naturally looked with her to see if they were safe. I was at the watchhouse; I did not hear Johnson say that he had been with Baxter, Mr. Hatton when he came down opened a door, and went in with Johnson. I staid outside, and Johnson gave his own charge. I had not the least to do with the charge. The only communication I heard was that Mr. Hatton asked me to go backwards to assist in locking the prisoner up, and Johnson said, let him have some beer and bread and cheese to the amount of two or three shillings, That was going up to the lock up place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I do not mean it to be understood that no other conversation could have taken place. There might be a great deal that I did not hear, because I did not go into the little place. I naturally staid out because I had nothing to do with the charge. I was here on the trial of Baxter; I can't recollect whether I was or was not examined; it is two years ago; I don't think I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined after Mr. Hatton was examined, as to the fact of whether Johnson said to him what he had said, he did say on his examination - A. I heard after the trial was over.</p>
               <p>Q. But before the Judge summed up, were you or were you not examined as to the fact of the conversation I have spoken of - A. That question was put to me by Mr. Adolphus whether those things were said by Johnson in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been examined, and told your whole story - A. I never was examined at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined as a witness to confirm the testimony of Johnson - A.Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the question was put to you by these things, now what things - A. It was about some things that Johnson was named to have said at the watchhouse. I say now that certainly much might pass which I did not her. On the Sunday in question I might be in company with Johnson three or four hours; it might be about twenty minutes before three when I first came into his company; we did not then keep together. Johnson desired me to go into a public-house, and wait there until he beckoned to me; that was a little before three; I was not in company with him alone. That was a little before three, he met with Lee, the street-keeper of Holborn; we were going to the park-fair. The public-house commanded a view of Mr. Snowsill's house. I saw the man that Johnson shewed me, go in; he shewed me him through the window; that man at that time was on the opposite side of the way. He came out, and Johnson ran out of the wine-vaults, and ran down Gray's-inn-lane, and he was gone for about five minutes, and just as he got in, he shewed me a bit of a a sign that the man was coming up; he said, that is the thief, and he went on, and was in about ten minutes. Johnson was in and out with me four or five times. The man was in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and when he came out Johnson directly caught hold of him, and he waved his finger for me to get up; I had not lost sight of him at all until he had laid hold of the man; I ran very quickly. Johnson did not say any thing to me. We went into the public-house with the man. I recollect being examined on the 21st of July, 1814.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say had passed between Johnson and the prisoner Baxter on his apprehending him - A.I can hardly answer that question; it is such a question as I am sure I do not understand.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is whether Johnson said any thing to you as to what passed in his attempt to secure the prisoner Baxter - A. I could not answer the question.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand it - A. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I will make you. Did Mr. Johnson tell you that any thing had passed between him and the prisoner Baxter when he attempted to secure him?</p>
               <p>Q.When you came up to Baxter, did Johnson tell you of any thing that had happened in taking him into custody, any thing that he had done to Baxter - A. I don't recollect any thing that he did to him.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not my question; this is what I want to come at; have you not represented that Johnson said he had a struggle with Baxter, and was obliged to knock him down - A. The question I said was, that Johnson said that Baxter was a resolute fellow, and that he was obligated to knock him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Johnson tell you so - A. I believe he did. I stated it to Mr. Nares there might have been a strong tustle in the passage; Johnson told me so in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will ask you sir, one question, and then I have done with you; what share of the reward did you receive for the conviction of Baxter-A. The Recorder gave me ten pounds; I have received it, and part of my ten pounds was given to Johnson to pay for the counsel and lawyer, for carrying on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180048"/>prosecution. After all the expences were paid, I believe I had no more than four or five shillings in my pocket.</p>

I directly said to the gatesman, bring him through, what is the matter. Monk instantly complained of having lost his watch, and the gatesman brought the prisoner between gates to me.

I had a constable, and took him into custody.</p>

Mr. Tiffin had gone round the premises as usual with his lanthorn and a pistol, to see that nobody was lurking about the premises. When I saw Mr. Tiffin immediately afterwards, he told me he had gone down to his cart shed as usual, and as he was going down, his little dog began to bark, upon which he looked over the light of his lanthorn, and saw a man on the premises near the wall; when he saw the man, he told him he should go out, or if he did not, he would shoot him; instead of going out when he told the man, the man ran upon him, and as he was coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180049"/>up, he told him to keep off; but the man kept running on. Then he retreated a few paces back, and the man followed him up within a few paces. He then fired, and the man fell. He said, he did not know whether he was dead or wounded; by his desire I went for a watchman, and we found the man lying on his back quite dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. These premises were completely enclosed; our manufactory had been robbed a very short time previous, and the counting-house had been broken open. The prisoner said, he fired in his own defence, and if he could have avoided it he would not have done it.</p>

I remember passing through the turnpike at Hyde Park corner at about ten minutes or a quarter past nine in the evening; we passed through the left hand gaite; I observed a carriage pass through before us, which had lights; we might then be ten or a dozen yards from it; we were going quicker than in general; it was a very dark night. We gained upon the coach that was before up, and got nearly opposite to it, bearing away on the right. In a moment I heard the coach run against something; I can't say whether it was on the left or right side of our coach, because I was in conversation with my wife; but the shock seemed to be on the left of our coach; the shock was very great; the other coach appeared to go straight forward. The prisoner appeared to me to be perfectly sober. I did not hear any one call out to make way. The prisoner did not stop at all after this to make any enquiry what had happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. The coach in front of us had lights, I could not see any thing before us for the glare of those lamps.</p>

It was rather a dark night; I was standing on the Hospital side, that is the left side going from Town; I could see the carriages that passed and repassed most distinctly; I was looking in the road for a dog I had lost. I could see by the glare of these coach lamps; I think there was an advantage for a foot-passenger's seeing. I heard a voice proceeding from the opposite side of the road, and my attention was then directed that way. I observed the carriages two or three seconds before I heard the voice; what the voice uttered, I don't know. In about the space after that a horse could strike three or four strokes with his feet, I heard a crash; then I heard screaming; I principally heard a man's voice. I went across to the assistance of the people; but I found I could afford them no assistance. At the time I heard the voice, I saw the carriages going. The one that appeared to have done the mischief, appeared to be going fast. There is a little difficulty coming through the gate. The carriage with lights was on its proper side of the road; it a little preceded the coach the prisoner drove; but I think they were running in almost parallel lines; I think the prisoner's coach was more on the right than was necessary, supposing he was endeavouring to pass the other. I found the gig thrown over, and one shaft broken; I found the woman and the child thrown out by the shock; they were immediately taken to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I believe there was room for the gig to have passed between the two carriages.</p>
               <p>GEORGE KIRBY. I was driving this gig on the 25th of August, in which were my wife, and child. About a hundred yards from the gate, I was on the left hand side of the road, and saw this coach a few yards before me, coming directly on me; I called out for God's sake stop, and drew up the horse; my wife screamed out; but it was so momentary a thing that he was upon us. With the force of his near horse coming against my near sharft, broke it; and my wife and the baby fell out on the near side of the chaise, and I and a son of mine about ten years old fell behind the horses hee1s. Then when the shafts were broken, the horse turned a little to the left, and the coach passed us on the left. My little boy and I got up from behind the horses heels, and my wife and the baby were taken to the Hospital. The coach that did the mischief was coming with a fast trot down a descent; I could not get out of the way, it was so momentary a thing. My wife and the baby were killed. I was driving very slow.</p>

               <p>MR. KERMION. I am house-sergeon at St. George's Hospital. I remember the unfortunate persons being brought into the Hospital; the child had a fracture on the left thigh, and I observed something farther wrong about the child, and I did not ascertain what that was until he was dead; he lived until five o'clock the next morning, and then died. I afterwards opened it, and found that two of the bones of the back were separated from each other, and the liver was ruptered, from which profuse bleeding had taken place.</p>

She came on the 31st of July, and she was frequently intoxicated, and on one or two occasions she was so much so, as not to be able to do her work. After this, I was about to discharge her, and a variety of things was missing. She denied all knowledge of them. I was at length obliged to send for an officer, and when we were searching her some duplicates dropped from her person. At last she produced a small box, which the officer opened. We then went and searched her lodging in Peter's-lane, St. John-street. There we found forty-one duplicates, seven of which related to the property in question.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Mulcaster, pawnbroker, in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square. I look at the prisoner at the bar, and know his person. He offered to pawn a silver watch with me between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment. I had information from Mr. Edwards, and I asked him where he had got it, and he said, he had stolen it. He appeared perfectly sober to me. I left him in the shop, and took the watch to Mr. Edwards' house; Mr. Edwards was not at home; but his wife thought it was his watch. I returned back, and got a constable, and had the prisoner taken into custody.</p>

He wanted to borrow eighteen pence of me. We went to a public-house together, and there I saw him with the watch. I saw him before the Justice the next day, or the day after.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer by trade. I had the care of Mrs. Illingsworth's house, and locked it up safe on the night of Saturday the 20th of July; I saw it again on the Monday morning the 22nd; my son was to repair it, and I was to help him. When we went to the door at about a quarter past five, my son had got a load on his shoulders, and he said there is somebody in the house. As we opened the door, the prisoner came out, and my son told him to stop, but he an off, and immediately another man ran out. I thought it was better to secure one, than lose them both; I caught him, and as I was taking him down Frith-street, I said, where are your implements that you got in with; he said what is that to you, your master must ask that; and he said you have let the best man go; I said never mind I have got you. When I go him down to the watchhouse, Mr. Craig asked him where the jemmy was, and he pulled it out, and put it down on the table; it was about twenty inches long, and it was done up quite snug in a little green baize bag. These blinds were all cut down; and then we found some skeleton keys also on him; we found eight blinds had been taken down, and five had been left in the house; three had been taken away, as I expect by the man who ran away; they had been fixed to the front windows of the house; they were bundled up in the passage, the value might be eighteen shillings.</p>

On the 14th of September, at about ten o'clock at night the two female prisoners came to my shop, and asked for a save-all, they stood in a direction between me and the door so that I could not see the door. While they were in the shop, the prisoner Colbin was laid hold of and brought into the shop with the saucepans in question.</p>
               <p>DAVID WILLIAMSON. I was going by Mr. Griffith's shop, and I saw the prisoner Colbin lying on the steps of the door with a saucepan in his right hand and another in his left; I did not at that time see the two women, but when I did see them they were in the shop, and by the direction in which they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180052"/>stood, it was impossible for a person in the shop to see what was doing at the door. Colbin handed one of the saucepans to the other man prisoner, and dropped the other. I secured Colbin and both the saucepans were secured; Bowl walked away I believe. I am sure he is the man to whom Colbin was handing one of the saucepans; Colbin said he was shewing the saucepan to Bowl, and he said he was wagering five shillings, that one was a three pint saucepan; Bowl however did not stay to see that wager decided; Colbin too wished to walk off with himself, and as I was stopping him, he made a blow at me; I immediately collared him, and seized him by the throat; then the two females were stopped.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHESTERMAN. Colbin was brought to the watchhouse first; Wood followed him, and when she came to the watchhouse, she was taken into custody.</p>

I went out of the kitchen for a minute between ten and eleven, and on my return I saw the boy whose name I believe to be Bloxam stepping out of the kitchen; I missed the spoons after that.</p>

            . I was in Southampton Row, between eleven and twelve on the morning of the day in the indictment; I saw Bloxam shewing a spoon to a person who is not here; that other person might be about twenty one, a great deal taller than either of the prisoners. That circumstance induced me to watch them; Davis was not by at this time. I laid hold of him, and asked him where he had got that spoon from; he pretended to be perfectly ignorant of what I was asking him about, and contrived to hide it the moment I laid hold of him. I searched him, and found the property in question on him; also a latch key. I saw Davis about Southampton Row, and endeavoured to secure him. Upon my saying I had seen him with Bloxam, he ran away; he was stopped by a man.</p>

            , in Finsburysquare. We had some conversation together. After that I did not meet them again until they came to my own house; it might be a fortnight before both came together. Power asked me if I would go and have a walk with him; I told them I could not go that afternoon, and the next day, being Sunday, Pelham came, without Power; he knocked at my door, and my wife opened it; on seeing me, he asked me if Power had been then, and I told him he had not. He asked me to come, and have some beer; I told him I had no money, and he told me not to mind that. Then we went to the top of Bunhill-row, and he gave me three pots of beer, and a quartern of gin; we both drank. He asked me if I knew any houses where thieves resorted. He told me he could put me into a good thing, as well as he did Michael Power, and he had put Michael Power into a good way of living without work. He then asked me if I could get a man or two who could break a pane of glass or two in a shop-keeper's window; if I could, he would have two police officers standing on the other side of the way, who should run over and take him directly, and I need fear nothing; and if I could not get any one to do it, to do it myself, and never fear, but I might walk on, and he would take the first man that came up, and that there would be a good reward for that, and that I would have my part; that I refused. Then he asked me if I could get a man or two, who could pass bad three-shilling pieces; that he would fix a day, and he would give me three bad three-shilling pieces, and one good one; that I should walk with him, and should pick up a man, and get into conversation with him. He then asked me if I could get a man or two who would go and make shillings; he told me he had put Michael Power into a good way of living without work, and that Michael Power could make stuff that would colour a quart pot if that was all; I told him if he wanted a man, he should go to market for him; that is at Cheapside where the Irish labourers resort to early in the morning to get work; it is at the corner of King-street; the usual time is between five and six. After that we separated; a few days afterwards I met him and Power in Barbican; Pelham asked me in Power's hearing if I had made up my mind in respect to what he had been talking to me about; Michael Power said did you tell Barry anything; I did said Pelham; did you swear him first said Power; he would not swear for me said Pelham. He had asked me to swear on a newspaper, at the first public-house, at the time he first proposed about breaking the panes of glass, and I refused to swear; it was that I should keep secret whatever he told me, for

Then Power said to Pelham, you did ill; well says Pelham he does not believe what I say to be true; if you told him any thing said Power, I dare say it is all right enough. Well said Pelham, if you don't believe me, come with me to the Solicitor for the Bank, and I will make you know, that I am well known there. I went with him to the Solicitor for the Bank; we went up through Colman-street; Pelham told me it was the Solicitor to the Bank; I saw Mr. Westwood. About four or five days after that, Pelham came up to my house, and told me he wanted me to go along with

             to market to get two men; I said, I would, and we agreed to go the next morning, and we were to meet at the post of Cripplegate-buildings, at seven o'clock. The next morning Pelham came and called me; when I went down stairs, Brock and Power were waiting, and we went and had some gin together, all four. Then I wanted to go home for something I forgot, and I told them I would be back at the post, and so I was. Then it was agreed for Pelham, Power, and me to go to market; then we went to the corner of King-street, Cheapside; we were to go for two men. Then we went to King-street; Brock did not go. As we were going along, Pelham said, now Mike it won't do for me to be seen by these men at market, for I must assist the officers in taking them up. Upon that, I and Power went to market, leaving Pelham behind. Then Power said, now Barry, you speak to the men; that was when I went up to the men. When I got to the market, I saw Quin and Rourden; I fell into talk with them; it was about a quarter past seven. I asked them how work went on, and how work was; and they said, that no men had been taken off the market that day. Quin put his hod on his shoulder, and the other took up his shovel, and they said they would go home. Power desired me to walk on with the men; which I did, and he remained a little behind. I went on talking with the men, in Irish; when we got to the end of the street, Power called out Barry, I dare say these two men want a job; I dare say they do, said I; and yes, said Quin, we do indeed, we want a job very bad. We said, we should see our master, and ask him if he wanted any one; they asked us where our master lived; and I told them at the Cat at the corner of Whitecross-street; and I asked them if they knew it, and they did. We told them to come at nine o'clock. Power called after me to tell them to leave their hods behind, as they would not be wanted; and I did so, Then when the men were gone, Pelham came running up, and said, well, is all right; he was following us all the time Power said, all was right enough, and the men were to meet him at nine o'clock. Then I must go back to Brock and get some money, said Pelham, and let you go and have something to drink; where shall we go and have drink without money; said Michael Power but I know a public-house where we can have a pot of beer, and shall not be asked for the money until we have drank it, and we will sit over it. Then we went to the Cat, and met the men, and took them to the French Horn when I got there, there were

            , I, Quin, and Rourden; a pot of beer was called for, and had not been on the table ten minutes when Pelham came in, and looked at the men, and then went out, and was followed by Power; we were to take no notice of Pelham. Power came in again with his pipe alight. He said now, Barry, you know our master won't take any man into his employ unless they take an oath that they won't tell any body what they do. Then Quin turned about, and he began to tell it in Irish to Rourden; I knew Irish very well. I told Quin if that young man could not speak English, to tell him it in Irish. It appeared to me that Quin communicated it to Rourden. Upon this, they swore. Power took a bit of paper off the floor, and he crossed himself, and kissed it, and said he would tell it to no one but them who would be at work along with him; then he pushed the paper to me; I am not a Papist; Quin and Rourden I believe were; that is a kind of solemnity, the crossing, that is used as a species of oath. Power crossed himself and then laid the paper on the table, and so desired me to do the same, which I did, and pushed it to Quin and Rourden, who did the same as Power, only Rourden took it in Irish. After this, we drank the pot of beer, and agreed to meet again at one o'clock, at the bottom of whitecross-street, near Cripplegate church. We did meet there; I, Power, Quin, and Rourden. Power said, we must have some beer, and I have got a shilling, or else he said, there was a shilling coming; we will go into the Mariners, and have a pot of beer; we four went into the Mariners, and called for a pot of beer, and we were drinking it when my son came in; he had not been in either of the parties before. Pelham came in, and gave a look at the men, and beckoned my son, who followed him into the parlour. There was nobody in the tap-room but ourselves. My son, I, and Brock had been in company together before, about the setting of a copper; Brock, Pelham, and Power were together when we saw them; this was before this business of Rourden's, and before we went to Cheapside some days. Now I come back to this public-house again; my son came out of the parlour soon after, and two more pots of beer came. Some one said, nobody had got any money to pay for this beer; and the landlord said that the gentlemen in the parlour had paid for it. I had seen Brock and Pelham in the parlour, and they went out, and Power went after them. When he returned, he told my son that his master wanted him; my son went out and I asked Power what they wanted with him; he said, they only wanted him to take a room for them. After some time, my son came back and brought word that a room was taken in Cow Cross; that he told me and Power, and the two men were present. We then made an appointment with the en for them to meet us the next morning at the Red Cow in Louglane, at six o'clock. Power and the two men were to come to that appointment, and from the Red Cow we were to go to the room in Cow Cross; they said the room had been hired in Jacob's-court, Cow Cross. The next morning we met, Power, I, Quin, and Rourden were together. My son passed us as we were standing in Cloth Fair. We did not then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180054"/>exactly know whether we were to go to the house. In a little time Pelham came down from towards Barbican, and beckoned Power to him; he went over, and beckoned me, and we left the men just in the street. Pelham told us that he had done a very bad thing on the evening before; he said, I took a room in Jacob's-court, Cow Cross, and it is the worst thing I could do, for I must be with the officers when they take the men, and the landlord will see me, and know me that I took the room; so he said he must he at the less of the earnest, and he said he must be at the loss of what I spent, for it does not please Brock, because it is not in the City; Brock had said that he was a City officer. While we were talking together, Brock came up from towards Smithfield with a switch in his hand; I met him in Aldersgate-street, and I asked him for something to drink, and he said he had left a shilling with the men, and he told me to go and get my part, and to tell Power to be sure to get a room in the City. Then I went back to Quin and Rourden, and we made an appointment to meet them in Moorefields at one o'clock. We met at one o'clock. Pelham, I, my son, and Power went to Augel-alley to take a room; I don't know how much was to be paid a week, but my son can tell you. We then came on with the men; we met them, and took them on to the room which had been taken; I, Power, Quin, and Rourden went into the room. We did not do any business that day; we had no files. Power went out, and left me and the men in the room, and a little while after my son came in with a white basin and brown paper; then in the course of two or three hours after, he brought in two or three pots of beer, and we sat down on the boards, and drank them. Then we went to a public-house, the George, in Beech-lane, and had two more pots of beer. The Irishmen then just drank a little of it, and then went out. Then Pelham came in, and Power asked him for a pot of beer, and he said no, I can't give you one, for I have got to go for the tools; but if you will meet me to-morrow morning at nine o'clock at the Cooper's Arms, I will. We met at nine o'clock the next morning. When Pelham came in at nine o'clock at the Cooper's Arms, he brought in a hammer and two files, and laid them on the table. Power took hold of one of the files, and said, that is a bad tool to work with; Pelham said it would do well enough. He called for a pot of beer, and we drank it, and then we agreed to meet at the corner of Golden-lene the next morning at seven o'clock. Pelham took the tools, and we met the next morning; I met Brock; Brock, Power, and Pelham were coming towards us. Pelham then called Power over to him, and took from out of his bosom the hammer and the files, and gave them to Power, and here is a pair of scissors said he, I have borrowed them from my landlady, and I suppose she will never see them again. Power and I then went off, and met the two Irishmen, and took them to the room in Angel-alley; we found them in Moorfields quarters. I don't know where Brock, Pelham, and my son went. When Power, Quin, Rourden, and I first went into the room we had nothing to do. Then Power went out, and in some time, he and my son came in, and brought a bottle with some stuff in it, a paper with like flower in it, another paper with a lump of hard stuff in it, some salt, a ball of whiting, some matches, and a candle. Then Power asked my son where was the brass; my son went and gave it him out of the cupboard, or out of his pocket, I don't know from which. Power then took the brass, and laid the broad file to it, and laid a shilling upon it, and marked it; then he cut it in straight strips, he cut out some pieces, and the Irishmen and I cut out some as well as him; then he cut them into shillings afterwards; he cut them into round things in the shape of shillings; they were square at first, and he rounded them afterwards. Power rounded them with the scissors, and then gave them to us to file, to me, Quin, and Rourden. After they were filed, then the scouring paper was used. We all of us worked with them. Then when they were all done, he looked at them all one by one, and there was some finer scouring paper; we rubbed them all over with it. I believe there was about thirty of them. After that was done, he went down to get a light for his pipe. He came up in about twenty minutes with his pipe alight in his mouth, and then he took a match, and lit the candle, and stuck it in the ashes, and then took the basin, and spilled what was in the bottle into the basin, and took a silver shilling out of his pocket, and put it into that; then he took a handkerchief and spread it over the top of the basin, and held the basin over the candle; so close as to heat the bason; the flame touched the bottom of the bason, and he held it until such time as a blue flame and smoke came up through the handkerchief; then he took the handkerchief off, and took the basin down, and stirred it up then with a bit of stick; then he put in the whole of that like flower out of the paper, and he put in some of the hard lump, which he scraped very small with a knife; then he put in some salt; then he put in some w g, and put the basin into the cupboard; while he was doing all these things, he was looking at a written direction now and then, which he had pulled out of his pocket. Then he looked at the shillings again, and sat down, and told me I don't think these will do, for they are not round enough, and it is not long since there was a good job lost by their not being even like.</p>
               <p>Q. Not being made well enough, in short - A. Yes. He said the Solicitor was very particular, and hard to please. Then my son came in, with some bread and cheese and beer for breakfast. While we were having it, he went away. Power desired us all to wash our hands, and we did. He took one of the shillings, and began to rub it with the stuff in the basin, and he told us to rub them well, and mind and rub the edges well, and we all began to do so; and then he directed us to wash them in the water that was is the brown pan; then he got a towel, and dried them; then there were two sheets of fine brown paper, and he rolled every shilling up separately by itself in the paper. Then the basin was put into the cupboard again, and we were to pass our time there until six o'clock, and not to go out. Then my son brought in word that we might go out to the George in Beech-lane, and have a pot or two of beer, and his master had told him to tell us so; and Power said he would take the shillings out in his pocket, and ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180055"/>Brock and Pelham their opinion whether they would do. When we had the beer, we parted, and we were to meet the next morning at seven o'clock. I overslept myself, and Power came and called me, and when I came to the room about eight o'clock, I found Rourden and Quin there. Power told me that the shillings would not do at all, and they did not approve of them, and that they were to have some other brass from Bruck to make some good ones that would pass. Rourden said that there was another man at their lodgings, and wanted to bring him; I said we must ask the master first; but however Power said, he might bring him, but be sure to swear him, said Power, before you bring him here. First he hesitated at having the other man brought; but at last he agreed to it. Rourden went away, and was not gone long before he brought in Connell; when he came in, Power said, ask Rourden if the man was sworn; Rourden said, yes, that he 1s. Then he was desired to come and sit down among us; but there was nothing to do then. My son came in, and brought a shilling, and gave it to Power, and told him to make every thing according to that, and to be sure and not make an East Smithfield job of it; East Smithfield was the place where the good job was lost as they said. He said, you are to return that shilling again, for my master wants it for something else. Then Power and I desired the boy to go out, and get some breakfast, and he went away, and staid away a very long time; so Mike Power went out, and come in again with a pickling jar full of coffee. After breakfast the brass was cut out, but he was more particular; it was done in the same way; he did it with his own hands. I think my son brought the brass, or

            , I don't know which, Whoever brought it, Power ruled it, and cut it out. We then went and filed as we did before, and gave him the shillings to finish, and he laid them by that shilling that my son had brought to see if they were alike. Then all the process was gone through that was gone through the day before, only that the shillings were brought to the similitude of that which was brought by my son. Then in the evening Power went out.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you remember Connell saying any thing while you were at work - A.While we were about it, Connell said, now Barry. we are at a job which will hang us all, and I said are we, and he said yes; and I said if so, I won't do another days work at it; the men had been promised some bacon and cabbage for dinner. At this time I said I would go and see about it, and I took up one of the shillings, and said I would go and get some beer. That was only an excuse to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. You yourself knew you were perfectly safe - A. Yes; Brook and Pelham told me I should be. I made an excuse, and when I got out, I went into Fore-street, Cripplegate, and I met Brock, Pelham, Power, and my son; I went to Brock, and said Mr. Brock, what a pretty predicament you left me in, leaving me by myself, if any strange officers had come they would have taken me. Brock said, oh Barry, go back to the men, Taylor has gone to get the warrant signed; go back you Power and Barry, and stay with the men, and all shall be ready in an hour: by that he meant, that an officer should come and take the men, as soon as Mr. Taylor had got the warrant signed. I and Power then went back to the men; he went one way, and I another, and then we set the men about colouring the old ones again, to keep them employed. Then Power laid the shillings that he made last and finished, and scattered all the bits of brass, and put the parings of brass he had cut off, and some of the brass that was left, near them. All things at hand for the officers to find, some finished, and some unfinished. Rourden was there, and saw all this; but did not know what it was for. After the preparation was done, my son came in, called me out, and said my master wants you and Power to bring some dinner on table, he did not mention any name, when he said my master. Brock and Pelham having given a caution, not to name a name, but only to say master, and then we went down as for dinner, leaving Quin, Rourden, and Connell in the room colouring. When we went out of Angel-alley, I saw Brock and Taylor, facing Moor-lane on the other side, I was going to speak, but Brock lifted up his foot, as a signal for me to pass by, and I did so, and looked round and saw them go up Moor-lane. They went to take up the Irishmen; I went towards Whitecross-street. At night I met my own son and

            ; we had some victuals, and heard that the men were apprehended and the whole discovered; I believe at this time the sessions were sitting; the men were not brought to trial before another sessions. When they were tried, I came down with Power, I saw Brock and Pelham in the Old Bailey yard; Power took me and my son, and gave us a room and victuals that same evening that the men were taken up, and then we went to the George in Beech-lane as usual. We sent for Brock, and after some time, he, Pelham and another man came to us; I believe Brock's landlord; I have heard so since; the other man was Collins. Brock came over and asked Power how much beer he had, and he told him; and he put a three-shilling piece into his hand, and ordered two more pots. Then Power asked what did Taylor say to the job; and he said Taylor said it was a very good job indeed, and then Brock desired us to be seen as little together as possible, least any one should take notice, and not to go near his place. I attended at the time these men were tried. I saw all the prisoners in the yard; that was before the trial came on.</p>

               <p>DANIEL BARRY, JUNIOR. I know Michael Power; I recollect seeing him in May last; he came up to my father's one morning, when I was there, and asked my father if he had anything to do, and my father said no; he turned round to me, and asked me if I had anything to do; I told him if I had, I should not be sitting there, and he said if we came along with him towards Cheapside, he thought he could get us some work. We went with him; my father, he and I, walked until we came to the corner of Fell-street, in Wood-street; he told us to stop, for he was going up to a friends and would not be above ten minutes. In the course of ten minutes, Brock and Pelham came down, and

They bid us good morning, and said they wanted my father about setting a copper and white-washing a room or two, and that he must go the market and get a man or two. We came on until we came to the corner of Addle-street; that was near Silver-street, and Brock said, let us have a drop of gin, and he went into a shop in Silver-street, and as we came out we met

            , and he said, am I not to have any, and Brock gave him two-pence to go in, and get a glass. We then went towards the market, Brock, Pelham, I and my father went to the market; we came to the corner of King-street; this was about half past six in the morning, or a quarter before seven; Brock and my father went up to the market to see if there were any men there, and returned in a short time saying they were all gone away; and then Brock pointed out a door, and we all went together to the Mariners in Colman-street. We all agreed to meet again at the corner of Beech-lane, and he said, he would bring a man of the name of Jefferson, who had the job to do; the copper to set, and the rooms to white-wash; at that time that was the only job mentioned to me, but the prisoner Power and my father continued to talk in Irish which I did not understand. They said they must meet on the following morning. We then went into another public-house; all five agreed to meet at Cripplegate the next morning. We went to my father's house the next morning about six; we met Brock and Pelham standing in the court waiting for him as I suppose I did not lodge with my father. Then we all came together, and Brock said, let us have a drop of gin; Brock said take care and pick out a strong one, and Power answered leave me alone for that. I then went away about my business, but the shop not being open to which I was going in Black friars road, I came back. I met Quin, my father and Power together; Pelham and Brock were behind, and beckoned me in this manner to come to them; I went up to them, and Pelham said are they going to fetch another man; at this time I did not see Rourden; Brock said to me, here is a shilling, take it to the Mariners.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told at any time by Brock to get a lodging-A. Yes; he told me to look out for a light room for him, and to have it in the City; that was the day the men were hired. I told him I could not tell what sort of room he wanted, and why could not his wife go; and he said she was at her sisters and Pelham said d-n me I will go with him, what harm is there in taking a room; Brock said very well, but let it be in the City; and Pelham went to look for a room, but could not find one in any part of the City that he took me round, and then we went along until we came to Jacob's-court, Cow Cross, and there I saw a bill up, and we went in. We saw the woman, and Pelham took the lodging; he said he was a coach painter, and lived in Holborn, and paid one shilling and sixpence earnest; in fact he lived at Mrs. Fields, in Golden-lane, he did not live in Holborn. Brock afterwards asked me if I understood making of clasps, I thought he meant lady's clasps; I told him I did not He said he would be obliged to me to go to Barratt's the brass founders, and get seven penny worth of hand sheet brass, and to mind it was nice and clear. I went and brought it to him, he looked at it and said it was too thick, and he wanted me to change it, and I told him I did not like; why did he not go himself, and then Pelham said he thought it would do, and then Power took a pair of scisors, and went into the closet of Bruck's and cut it a little way, and came out and said it would do nicely. I told Brock of having taking the room, and he said he did not think it would do as it was not in the City. I gave him the key of the lodging that was taken last; the last was in the City; I never went to the room in Cow Cross afterwards. He told me to meet him at the end of Cloth Fair about six o'clock that night or a little after; and Brock said, here is a shilling, go and you will find your father with

             and two men underneath a gateway, just by the Red Cow, in Cow Lane, and give them some gin; I went there and found all except my father, and we went then to the corner of Charter House Lane, and had some gin. I saw

             that morning, and Pelham was there, I saw them very often together; Pelham was always eating and drinking with Brock. At last a room in Angel-alley was taken; Brock gave me three-pence to give the woman; I, Power, and my father took it, and gave it to her; I took possession. In the afternoon they sent me with a brown pan, a basin, and a bunch of matches; then I saw Quin, Rourden, my father, and Michael there; they were all up in the corner just by the fire place; I gave the things I took, to

            ; nothing particular passed then; Power said go back to Brock, and ask him if I am to have any tobacco, and I went back and Brock gave me a shilling, and I took some, and some beer. I then saw the men, they were up in the corner. The next day Brock gave me a shilling, and told me to take it to the men and get some victuals for them, and I did so. The next day I saw Quin, Rourden, Michael and my father at the room; I did not see Counell till the last day; Brock sent me to buy a quartern loaf and take it there, and then I saw Counell in the room; that was the first time I saw him; and then I saw them all making the shillings, and saw my father, Quin, Rourden, and Connell all colouring of them; and

             was cutting them out and filing them; and I said, if I had known this game what you had been up to, I would not have had anything to do with you; and Quin said what matter if we could get a little victuals, and something to drink. I went to Brock, and I told him, if I had known that, I would not have had anything to do with it, for they were making shillings; Pelham was with him at the time, and Brock was at home at his own place. Brock said hold your tongue you fool, there is plenty of money to be made at it, and I said what do you want with them, and he said if I had a hundred dozen of them finished, I could find a customer ready to take them from me directly; this was in Pelham's hearing. I forgot to tell your Lordship about the aqua-fortis, and that I was sent for some. After I got the beer, Brock took a little bottle out of his closet, and it had some stale aqua-fortis in it; as he shewed it to Pelham and said he did not think it was strong enough. Then Brock poured it into the fire place and washed the bottle out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180057"/>and he said he wanted me to go of an errand or two. Then we went out, and came nearly facing of Grubb-street, in Fore-street, and Brock said, go in here and get three penny-worth of aquafortis; I did so, and he put it into a side pocket of his; He kept it, and then said, I want you to go over the way and get two penny-worth of salammoriac; that is hard white stuff; I went and brought it back to him; and then we went into the Mariners again, and had some beer. Now said Brock, go up to the place where you got me the aquafortis, and get me three penny-worth of cream of tarter; I did so. I afterwards took these things to the room. I don't know whether they were in brown paper. I saw things of that description in the room. The cream of tarter is just like flower. While this was going on between Brock and me, Pelham was writing a note, and he had a shilling just by, and he wrapped the shilling up in the note, and Brock told me to take it to Power, and he told me to say that they were not to make an East Smithfield job of it. but to make them like that. He did not say what this East Smithfield job was. He told me to take it; I did object. He said poh nonsense, there is no harm in that. I did not know that they were going to take the men, or I would not have had any thing to do with it at all. I afterwards found the men were taken up. In a day or two afterwards, when I heard the men were taken up, I went to Brock's; Pelham was there reading a book. I told them both if I had known what it was going to be, I would have had nothing to do with it. Pelham got into a wrangle about it, and he said, by the Cross of Christ if you say one word more about it; I will have you and your father hanged as high as ever Hammond was hanged. Brock said; he wished he could get Connell, the man that Rourden brought to turn King's Evidence, and then the others would be sure to swing, or else go fishing for life.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Ward of Aldersgate. I know the two prisoners Brock and Pelham. On the 30th of May last, Brock came to me, he said Mr. Taylor, I want you, and he said, I want you to go along with me. I said for what; and he said, I have got an information of some coiners at work; and I said where, and he said in Angel-alley, Moore-lane. I said how do you know it, and he said, I have it from very good authority. Then said I, as an officer, I am in duty bound to go with you. Then I said, stop Brock, before we go, we will have a search warrant from the Alderman. With that we went to the Alderman's, who was not within. Then Brock said, it is all in good time, what time do you dine; I said about one. Going down the Brittain. Pelham was leaning on a post. That was the first time I ever saw him to my knowledge. Brock was with me, and he said, well Pelham; how are they getting on; and he said, I believe it is all right. I told Brock what time I dined, and we agreed to meet in half an hour. After dinner, I was in the Britain, and saw the Alderman, and got the warrant. Brock went and made an affidavit.</p>
               <p>"The affidavit was here put in and read, and was a common information lodged with the magistrate, complaining that certain persons were coining at such a place and so forth."</p>
               <p>Witness, in Continuence. - The search warrant was signed in Brock's presence, upon his making that affidavit. We then proceeded down the Britain, down by Cripplegate Church and saw Pelham leaning on the post there. I was going along with Brock. Brock asked him how they were getting on, and he said, that there was one out. Upon his saying that, Brock said Pelham, then Taylor and I will go to the Crow, and when you see all is right. give a signal. The Crow in Moor-lane would command a view of Pelham where he then stood. With that we were passing the end of Angel-alley, and Pelham said, here is one now going in; and then we followed, and went into the house, and into the first pair room, and it happened not to be the room; there was a woman tying up radishes there. With that, a little aftercation aruse, and I told them they had better not talk there, and we went out below, and presently Pelham beckoned again, and we went into the same house again, and went up two pairs of stairs. With that we made a pause at the door, and Brock tried to look in through the key-hole, and said, he believed there was something hung over it, for he could not see through. Then we immediately entered, all three of us together, and we found Rourden, Quin, and Connell, the men that were conviced sitting on the floor; they were rubbing with white stuff, what I call colouring, pieces of metal resembling shillings; there was no furniture in the room, neither chair, nor table, nor any thing else; on seeing them, I hand-cuffed the two tall ones myself, and Brock and Pelham hand-cuffed Quin, who jumped about the room a good deal. In Connell's pocket I found a three-shilling piece, which appeared good, and I returned it. I then searched Rourden, and on him I found eight shillings lapped up, with the paper doubled over each, so that they could not rub together; they were in a waistcoat pocket which was open, and the waistcoat had not above one or two buttons, just about the centre of his body. I looked at the others that were found; they were blanks without colouring. They seemed very much alarmed, and very much agitated, and one or two spoke in English, if we could wait there was a man gone out for their dinners who had set them to work; and I said very well, and we waited a little time, and I thought it was not right to wait long, as it was a low neighbourhood where the house was. The woman of the house we saw, and she said to the men if I had known you were characters of this kind you should not have had my room. I found in the room also, a hammer, two files, a pair of scissors, a basin, Brock produced a phial of aquafortis as if he found it, and I found two bottles, in one of which there had been some I am sure. Brock had the scissors and files, and I had the basin and the hammer, and I produced them in Court before. I also produced the white stuff which was in the basin, and by the order of Mr. Powell, I destroyed it in the presence of White, the officer. The other things were kept, and Harrison has them. There are twenty seven piece of counterfeit money.</p>

               <p>ANTHONY HARRISON. I produce these things. Mr. Brock gave them to me on the 20th of July, just after the trial of the men. There are two files, a pair of scissors, a board, some emery paper, five bad shillings, and a sixpence. I received these at Mr. Brock's lodging, in Fell-street, Cripplegate.</p>
               <p>William Taylor. Re-called. I look at those things, I believe them to be found in the room either by myself or Brock. This board is for rubbing up the edges of bad money. I can speak to having seen them in the room.</p>

            . I am assistant to the Solicitor for the Mint. I have here the bad money produced on the trial of the three men alluded to. I produce five, which I believe to be five of the eight taken from Connell's pocket. During the course of the former trial, I selected three upon which I supported the indictment. I know these five because I have marked them with a cross, I marked them on the day I took them, in the prosence of Brock and Pelham.</p>

            . I live at 66, Golden Lane, in the parish of St. Lukes. I look at this hammer and these files that are produced, I have a perfect knowledge of them. I sold them all in one bargain to two persons, to Brock and Pelham. I sold the two files, first, and the hammer to the same person in about five minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to tell when it was you sold them - A. I think it was about two months before the time I was first called upon; I was first called before the Lord Mayor on the 5th of August; I did not know these two persons before; but I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>-BRADFIELD. I am landlord of the Three Mariners, in Fore-street, Cripplegate. I remember the three Irishmen being tried here for colouring money.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the bar, and tell me if ever you have seen either of the persons there, at your house - A. I have seen those two on the left, (Brock and Pelham,) and the tallest, (Rourden,) and shortest, (Quin,) of the Irishmen were at my house. I don't exactly remember the day of the month; it was about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; there had been four or five pots of beer, and Mr. Brock came forward out of the parlour at different times. He asked for an inkstand in the bar, and did not make any use or it. He paid for two pots of beer that the Irishmen had, and then he went into the back kitchen, and had a pint of beer there; I did not like his conduct about my wife, and I wanted to get rid of him, and I told him we charged three pence a pint for beer in there; but he paid it. Then he stepped through, and had some conversation with young Barry, who I am sure was there, and after he drank the beer, he went away, and five or ten minutes after, the Irishmen went. From these circumstances, and from his conduct, I have no doubt of his person. Pelham was backwards and forwards in the parlour, and I have no doubt of his person, though I would not swear positively.</p>
               <p>-MACDONALD. I am an Irish labourer, and I go to what we call the market to be hired of a morning; I know Rourden and Quin; Rourden came with me from Ireland, but I did not know Quin until I came to this place. I remember I used to come to the market every morning at six o'clock to look for work, and I used to meet Rourden there every morning; and I saw two men coming up to them one morning and they spoke to Rourden and Quin, and asked them if they wanted a job; they said they did, and they went away with them. Then when I heard they were in prison, I went to the house where they lodged; I did not hear they were in prison until on the morning that I missed them. When I heard they were in goal; I came here when they were to be tried, with one Griffiths with whom they had lodged, and I went into the public-house over the way with Mr. Burgess the counsellor. I afterwards saw Brock and Pelham talking with therw men that took them away from the market, at our talking together. Then I went into the public-house, and I told the counseller and Griffiths, I told him I had seen those persons talking together. Then I went out again with Griffiths to look among the people, but they could not be seen. (The witness here points out the prisoners, Power and the elier Barry, as the persons to whom be aliuded.) I then went and told Mr. Burgess that they were not there, and he told us to go and look again, and if I knew them that they would be in it. I went out about twelve o'clock, and went up the stairs of the Court house, and looking down into the yard, I saw the two men that took them away from the market talking to the other two, Brock and Pelham; they were at that time conversing together. Then I called Griffiths, in order that he might see them, and I might shew them to him, but he could not see them. I then went down, and I got very near them, and when I got within one or two yards of them, I was talking to Griffiths, and I think they heard me, for they ran out of the gate. I saw Barry and Power go one way, and I followed them as far as the end of Newgate street; I stopped there, and in a minute or two I saw Griffiths; they appear-to be watching us. Then I went after them again, and met them again in Newgate-street, and I took one this way, and the other that way; (Here the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180059"/>witness uses a getare, conveying an idea, that he seized one with one hand, and the other with the other.) I said now I have you, you are the two fellows that took the two Irishmen from Cheapside market; then they said they were not, and I said they were. Then that man, Power, gave me a blow, and knocked me down, and they ran away, and I cried stop coiners; and I followed them again. The people did not know what I meant, or what I was saying. I followed, and a man that was crossing over the other side of the street stopped Barry. Then when I took him, another man came up to me and asked what call I had to that man; then I said he was one of the men that took the two Irishmen from Cheapside market, and that were tried that day at the Old Bailey, and Barry said he was not. I asked the stranger to take care of Barry, while I went to get an officer, and he said he would not, and he let him go out. Well, I took him again, and some other man came up to me, and a man asked me in Irish what was the matter; then he said tell me in Irish, and I will tell the people in English; and I told him how it was, and he told it to the man that came up, (the first stranger.) Then he took hold of him; I told them to bring him to the place where the three Irishmen were, which were here, and I said it they would not know him, then I would take his place. He was brought here into a matter room that is outside there, and the moment they saw him they said he was the man, and they thought he was come to swear against them and they would be hanged. and they began to cry.</p>

            . I live in Jacob's-court, Cow Cross. I look at the prisoner Pelham, I remember seeing him in the month of May last; him and young Barry. I keep a house there. They came and asked me if I had a room to let, I told him I had, and they asked me at how much a week, and I asked them two shillings and six pence a week, and Pelham said he would only give two shillings, and he took it and gave me sixpence earnest; then I went and drank with him. Nobody afterwards came to take possession of the room. I ssa him no more, until I saw him at the Lord Mayor's.</p>

            , Re-called. These are counterfeited to resemble the current coin of this realm called shillings, in their present state. These are implements and materials such as would be used by coiners. I look at the five pieces; they have become tarnished, so as to be less fit for circulation then when produced on the former trial. I have been long used to business of this kind.</p>

When I came home from my work, he said Collens will you go along with me and take part of a pot of beer; I said I had rather not; he persuaded me, and said it should not cost me anything, and I went with him to the George, in Beech-street; he then joined company with four others that were in the room; they were

            . I am an Irish labourer; and came from Ireland; I believe I have been here about fourteen months. I used like other Irishmen, to go to Cheapside market to be hired of a morning. I was coming home one morning, and I met with a man in my way; he asked me, did I want a job; I and Rourden were together; we told him we did; it was Barry the elder; he said to me alluding to Rourden, this young man is not long from Ireland, I said no; he said my master wants one or two men, I said very well; and he told us to go home, and leave our hods and shovels, and to meet at the Cat; we went there; we were afterwards brought in the evening to see the room where we were to work the next day. I remember Taylor coming into the room when we were taken; we were rubbing the pieces with rough paper. I look at the prisoners at the bar; I know Power; he was along with me in that room, he and two more, Barry and his son; Power was colouring those pieces and rubbing them. Barry's son brought up the copper, and Power pulled out the scissors.</p>

Then he wanted me to apprehend the men about one o'clock; I told him I could not, and I went to Mr. Taylor, and we went to Alderman Cox, and he came in and took the evidence, and asked me if I thought it was a just thing, and I told him it was, and he gave us a warrant, and we went down, and when we went into Fore-street, we met with Pelham; he took us into the house up one pair of stairs; he said he thought that was the room, and on going into it, we found a woman tying radishes; then we went down again, and presently he came and beckoned us, and we went up into the two pair of stairs front room, and we opened the door, and there they were sitting; and we apprehended them. This is all I have to say, to assett my innocance; a great part of the evidence is perjored.</p>
               <p>Pelham's Defence. I have something of the same sort of defence to make. I watched them at different places, and Brock told me to watch them; and I saw them and watched them down in Moor Fields, and from that into Angel-alley. I wanted them to take them into custody, and he said they must get farther asistance to take them into custody. We went, and I did not know rightly where the room was; and we opened the door of the room on the first floor; at last we found the room. The evidence has proved false, that swears about the files; and the Barry's are perjured As for the publican, I never saw him; that is the time fact before God and man. I really believe Brock had some information about these people and sent me to look after them.</p>
               <p>Power's Defence. That Quin never saw my face, until he saw me in King-street; and I was employed in the same business that he was.</p>

I was going my rounds on the morning of the 24th of August, at about half past one, and heard a rattling behind the buildings, where these tools were deposited. I met the prisoner coming out with the two baskets of tools, which he immediately dropped. I told him he had been robbing the buildings; and he said, he had not, that he had only been doing his occasion; and as soon as he had buttoned his flap, he up with his fist and shoved me down almost. As soon as I had recovered myself, I fetched him one, and knocked him down. I called the watchman to my assistance, and we took him and the tools to the watchhouse.</p>

            . On the day in the indictment, in consequence of information, I missed the property in question from the door, and I pursued after the person I understood had taken it; I pursued up Well-street. where I got farther information, and went up Berner-street; I saw a man running, and I hallooed stop thief, and he dropped, the property in question. That man when stopped, was the prisoner at the bar; it was he who dropped the bundle. He gave the young man that stopped him a most dreadful kick in the bowels. We took him to Marlborough-street, where, after I had gave my depositions against him, he gave me a terrible thump on the face.</p>

I had a twenty pound note and a five pound note in the pocket of my trowsers; I put my trowsers underneath my head, and about two o'clock in the morning; I missed her, and the note.

He ran through the room where all the money for the payment of the men, was lying on the table to the amount of about three hundred pounds, and my wife said the money is all on the table; we immediately returned, and missed three three-shilling pieces of the change. We stopped the prisoner, and he said he had no money but two-pence, which he then threw upon the table; yet in his shoe he had three three-shilling back tokens, and two shillings.</p>

               <p>MICHAEL M' CANNY. I lost my watch on the 13th of July last; it was a silver watch. It was taken from my house in <placeName id="t18160918-89-crimeloc472">Bath-place, New-road</placeName>

               <p>MRS. M'CANNY. I had seen the watch before I went out with the prisoner, on the 13th. I was in care of the house. It was on the dresser shelf. I saw it about eight in the evening of the 13th of July. The prisoner was in the house during the greater part of the day; she called on a visit, and I gave her leave to do her work in the house. She came about ten or eleven in the morning, and she nursed my child during that day. She left the house with me about eight in the evening. As she went out with me, I saw the watch. I went into Brook-street, which is in the New-road; I was gone about twenty minutes. I pa ted with the prisoner soon after I went out, and after my return, I missed my watch about ten o'clock</p>
               <p>THOMAS DOBBINS. I am a labouring-man; I lodged in this house. I know the prisoner. I recollect Mrs. M'Canny going out to get change for a note; I saw both her and the prisoner go out together. In about ten minutes the prisoner came back, and knocked at the door, and said she had forgotten a key, and wanted to go down stairs; she went down, but was not down above a minute or two. When she came up, I did not perceive that she had any thing about her. I stopped until she came back again, and then she went away. That is all I know. She bid me good night at the door, and went away. Nobody else came into the house after the prosecutrix went out but the prisoner.</p>

            . I-had known the prisoner about a fortnight when she called at my lodgings, and gave me the duplicate of a watch; it was about the middle of July, and it was a watch pawned at Cameron's. She stated to me that she had bought it of a woman, and had given ten shillings for it; I redeemed the watch, and paid fifteen shillings for it. I pawned it at Mr. Dry's, in Blandford-street, and I lost the duplicate, and when we went to his house for it, it had been redeemed.</p>

            . On the Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner about a quarter or twenty minutes past six; I saw him come out of the house that is being repaired at the top of Sydmouth-place. I saw a sack at the top of the area, where they were getting it up. I saw the prisoner lift that sack on the other man's back; they looked back several times, and in cousequence of that, I thought it was lead that came off the house. I went through a different way through Sidmouth-mews, and I saw the prisoner following a cart, in which was the other young man and a woman. The moment I stopped the cart, the two men took to their heels, and ran as fast as they could. I pursued after them; I followed the prisoner close into a field, and he was stopped before I lost sight of him. The springs were afterwards taken out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went behind some bricks, and saw the man with this sack, and I helped him up with it on his shoulder by his request, and then I ran down the field, and the witness laid hold of me, and said what, have you been robbing my master's house, and I said, no, I was not, and I said I was very willing to go with him whereever he liked.</p>

I had joined in this theft, and they promised me one of the rabbits. I told the officer where to find them, and he found them by my direction.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JEFFERSON. I heard of the loss of these rabbits. I found them by the direction of Cooper, at No.9, in this Court; I found eleven of them in the back cellar. I found Tuffnell in the passage of that house to which the cellar belonged; I told him I had come to search for the rabbits; he said he would shew us all he had; he took me down into the cellar along with the prosecutor. He shewed me several rabbits in the front cellar; but none of them belonged to Mr. Froutt; and I looked through into the back cellar, and he said it was dangerous to go in; and I saw the soil had broke through. I then fetched Cooper; he said he would shew me where the rabbits were, and I found the rabbits in the back cellar.</p>

The prisoner was in my house on the 3rd, as late as we kept the house open, as late as eleven. He came again on Sunday the 4th, and called for a pint of porter in a spouted pot; after he was gone, the pot was missing. He returned again in about three quarters of an hour, and I then watched him. I told my people to go, and have an officer at hand. I suspected he had something about him, and I collared him, and took him and found this property on him.</p>

            . On the 5th of August, I left the Bull in Bishopsgate-street at about seven o'clock in the evening of the day in the indictment, I had been drinking there but had my property safe when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180067"/>I quitted it; I was intoxicated. When I came from the Bull in Bishopsgate-street, I found I ought to have gone to the Bull in Aldgate; and I went on for that purpose. I missed my way, and fell asleep, and when I was awakened, I was told I was in the <placeName id="t18160918-98-crimeloc514">Islington Road</placeName>

I know I had my notes in my pocket book when I left the Bull; there were the notes stated in the indictment in it, and several papers and memorandums; I am quite sure they were safe. When I was awakened I missed my property. When I arrived at the Bull in Aldgate I had a two-penny flash note, which I had had for five or six years.</p>

             consequence of information I received, I wished to know how he came possessed of the property; he said his brother had given them to him, and his brother had found them. We insisted on knowing how he came possessed of the property, to discover if we had been robbed of goods or anything of that kind; then he acknowledged that he had met with a sailor at the Ball in Bishopsgate-street, and led him as far as Crown-street, Finsbury Square, and had taken his pocketbook, containing about thirty pounds; he afterwards met with Wiggins and divided the property. According to his account, Wiggins was not present at the robbery; I know nothing of Wiggins. The prisoner Gray had none of the property about him.</p>

            . I am in the employ of the last witness. On the 6th of August about ten in the morning, I understood that the prisoner Gray had found seventeen pounds; I saw the book and the notes; there was a ten-pound note, a five-pound note and two ones, I asked him where he found them, and he said opposite Shoreditch church. There was no leaf, memorandum, nor anything of that kind in the book; every thing was torn clean away. I informed the last witness. The constable took three pounds and a silver watch out of Wiggins's pocket; he said that watch he had bought.</p>
               <p>HENRY MACKRILL. I am a constable. Wiggins admitted that Gray gave him the property that was found on him, but he said he did not know Gray had stole them. I found a ten-pound note in the Kingsland Road, and the two-penny flash note, I got from Gray's mother.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COOPER. I am a weaver. I live at the prisoner Gray's masters; Gray came to me on the 8th of August, and told me he had found some money, and he gave me a ten-pound note, to ask me to take care of it for him; and I put it into my aunts lean is for safety; that was afterwards given up to the last witness.</p>

               <p>PHINEAS MURPHY. In consequence of information, about four o'clock in the afternoon of the day in the indictment, I went out and saw the prisoner in my area; he appeared to me to be endeavouring to hide the butter-boat which was within two or three inches of his hand, among some broken bricks which were in the area; he must have got over the area rails, for the gate was locked; I had the key of the area, and on going into it, I found the spoon among the bricks. I took the prisoner, and went down to Bow-street, and brought the officers up.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH AUSTEN. I saw the prisoner get over Mr. Murphy's rails and go down to his area; on my passing by, I looked down the area and saw some plate at the window. On coming back in about ten minutes, I perceived some of the plate gone out of the window; presently I saw the prisoner trying to get up the wall; I asked him what he wanted down the area, and he said he had dropt his handkerchief. He then stepped down again, and took the plate from under his coat, while I was knocking at the door, and concealed it among some bricks; and three persons who were standing by, and whom I suspected to be his confederates ran away.</p>

Upon that I went into the shop, and Mrs. Pyall told me to stop him, which I did; then Mr. Sellers was sent for, and he asked Mrs. Pyall if she could swear to the money; Mrs. Pyall made answer and said, if it was her money that was found upon the prisoner, she could swear to some of it. He then took it out of his pocket, and threw it on the counter, and Mrs. Pyall spoke to several shillings which she knew to be hers; and among the rest, there was a six pence which I knew to be one that I had paid to Mrs. Pyall a fortnight before.

We took the goose and the bag in, and in about ten minutes afterwards, the prisoner returned knocked at the door, and demanded the goose as his property; I told him he should have it by and by. He went away swearing that he would storm the house and have my life.</p>

A young man who was a stranger said to me immediately, young man you are done; surely said I, the man will never act that way, and I sat about half an hour. I got up, and left the prisoner

               <p>LLEWELLIN HUGHES. On the day in the indictment, the male prisoner came to my house, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; he had something to drink and paid sixpence for it; I immediately put it into the till, but did not observe it at the time; and as soon as the prisoner turned his back the officer came in. I then took particular notice of the stamp on the sixpence; I put it in a piece of paper and have kept it ever since; I had no other sixpence.</p>

            . I look at the male prisoner; he came into my house on the day in the indictment and had a pint of porter; he gave me a sixpence, and I gave him the change; I did not part with the sixpence until the officer came in. The officer brought the woman in; she had some colouring in her hand, which she squeezed all to pieces in opening her hand.</p>

            . I was in Chancery-lane with Wainright on the day in the indictment a little after two; I saw the two prisoners coming from the corner of Cursitor-street; I then saw the man prisoner go into the Five Bells, the woman went about fifteen yards from it and stopped. He came out again, and when he came out, they spoke together. They went together lower down, to the chandler's shop, and several other places; they had half an ounce of tobacco there. I used to see some halfpence pass from him to her, when ever he came out. I saw the sixpences produced by the two last witnesses as uttered to them by the male prisoner, and they are both bad. When I apprehended the female prisoner I saw her grapple her hand together and I was obliged to use force to take her into Mr. Dennis's house; Wainright and Sullivan was then together. I forced the female prisoner's hand open, and found a bit of paper containing some colouring, and a bad sixpence in it; she tore the paper all to pieces, and it fell, but I picked up a little or the colouring, and it produced the colour of silver on base metal; I tried that,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180071"/>I then searched her, and found on her these boxes, one contains twenty-eight sixpences, and the other four, shey are all bad ones; she had likewise four shillings in copper, and a large pair of clippers, which I think had the appearance of having been used. On the male prisoner I found threepence three farthings, which would be the change out of sixpence, after paying for the pint of beer; the pint of beer being two pence farthing.</p>

I told him she was, and he asked me to lend him eleven shillings for Mr. Backler, to pay the carriage of goods, lying at Wood-street, which had come from the Duke of Norfolk's. I lent him eleven shillings upon that. Mrs. Backler was a customer of ours, and we knew her. He came again on Thursday the 25th of July, bringing with him a paper, apparently a bill for the carriage of goods. The amount was one pound nine shillings and a penny, and underneath was written in pencil, "received one pound," and he asked me to lend him nine shillings and a penny, to pay for the carriage of goods lying at Wood-street, and I did so; fearing that it might not have been right, I wrote to Mrs. Backler, and she sent a verbal message. On Monday the 29th, the prisoner came to the house again, and asked for a one pound note for Mr. Backler, who, he said, was waiting in Gracechurch-street for it. I did not let him have it, but I gave an alarm, and he was laid hold of immediately.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BACKLER. The prisoner was formerly in my employment. I had no goods come to London from the Duke of Norfolk. I expected no such goods. I never authorised the prisoner to get this money.</p>

She told me of my fortune, and she told me of my loss; she told me I had lost something of value, and that it was plate. I told her that she had told me pretty true, and she described the person who had stolen it, which description answered Charlotte Anthony. I told her that she Garva had received it. Upon which, she swore bitterly that she knew nothing of the property. I told her I was certain she had it, and had disposed of it in some sort of a way; and all I wanted was the duplicate, or a direction to the place where she had sold it. She then declared that she had not a duplicate in the house but what belonged to herself. She then went out of the room, and locked me in for a few minutes. I then told her all I wanted was the duplicates. I then told her that if I did not obtain them, I should take other means; and she let me out of the room, and I left her. In about half an hour afterwards, she came to my house with the duplicates. I don't know how she came to know where to find me. I perceived that they were dated on the day she brought them, quite fresh; it was the 17th of October. When she produced them, she said, there are the duplicates, and she said that Charlotte had brought them to her, meaning my niece. She said that Charlotte brought her the spoons. I did not go to the pawnbroker's until I had taken her into custody. I have seen that table-spoon and the desert-spoon again; I saw them at the pawnbroker's, and afterwards at Worship-street.</p>

               <p>CHARLOTTE ANTHONY. I am the niece of Elizabeth Sunshine; latterly I have been at the Refuge for the Destitute; I know the prisoner at the bar. I bought a bonnet of her during the last very hard frost. In October in the last year, I called at her house about a bonnet; she then asked me to have my fortune told; she took me into a dark room. I was at that time keeping company with a young man, and she said if he was not married, she should bring him to me in the dark room. I remained about twenty minutes; whilst I was in the dark she brought something to me of the appearance of a man;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180072"/>I immediately fainted away, and I was taken to a surgeon's and bled. After this passed, she said something to me; she said she knew where I lived for she had followed me home; she asked me sixpence for telling my fortune, and asked if I could afford any more; I said no, and she then asked me if I could get any thing to make money of; I told her no; and she followed me home. When I got towards home, she followed me to the door, and said she would part. She asked me to bring something to make money of, and said it would never be found out. After I had my fortune told, she wanted me to take on oath that I would never discover it; I would not take any oath; she repeated words for me to say; but I would not say them. She wanted me to say, so help me God, I won't disclose it; but I did not; and she wanted me to come and live with her. In consequence of her telling me to get something to make money of, I took a desert-spoon and a table-spoon, and gave them to her right opposite the place, she stood opposite the house for them. After I got her the spoons, I went home with her, she took me to the Royalty Theatre. I afterwards went away from her; I saw I had done wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had been taken to the Royalty Theatre, did she propose any thing else - A. Yes, she wanted me to go in the streets. In consequence of that proposal, I went to a friend of my grandfather's and communicated what I have stated to day, and that friend went to my grandfather, and afterwards got me home. Then I went to the Assylum for the Destitute, and continued there until last June; I had then an ill state of health, and was obliged to come out for my health sake; I soon after met her on London Bridge, and she asked me if I had been at home all that time; and I said, yes. Then she said she had a little house in Cooper's-gardens, and wanted me to go with her but I would not. I told what had happened to the people of the Assylum, and she was taken up.</p>

            . I remember the night of the 10th of August last; I lived at No.8, Eden-street, Hampstead Road in the parlour; Charlotte Green lived with me. I was walking with her when this gentleman came up. We went home, and I left Charlotte Green in the room with Mr. Newbolt. She came to me in about ten minutes, and then she and I ran down Tottenham Court Road; she never stopped until she came to Frances-street. When she stopped there, she shewed me a pocket-book, and a watch; the watch had no chain or seal; she also shewed me something like a bank-note, but I can't read. She emptied all the papers out of the pocket-book into her lap, and chucked the pocket-book away. Then we went on to St. Giles's church; there she met with a man, and had some conversation with him. Then she said come along, now I know where to take it. We then went to Mr. Myers's; it was almost twelve; we found him up one pair of stairs in Compton-street, near St. Giles's church; she shewed him the note; he said it was a twenty-pound note, and then she shewed him the watch, and he said do you know what I will give you for this, meaning the note; she wanted eighteen pounds for it, but he would only give her seventeen. Then he gave her fourteen shillings in silver besides, that was for the watch. He then asked her whether she would have anything to drink, she said yes, and then his wife went out for something to drink. After that he desired us to lay hold of his arms, saying, that would prevent all suspicion. As we went along he said, will you give me something to drink, and then we went into a public-house, kept by Mr. Holmes, and Mr. Myers asked for a glass of wine. The publican said he did not sell wine, and then he and a man who had come in with us, had a glass of shrub each. The female prisoner told him she had taken it from a man, and said we shall be all taken up; it was after she told him that, that he told us to lay hold of his arms, saying that would avoid all suspicions.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoners, and the girl Jones. I took the girl Charlotte Green to Myers's house first; Jones said to Myers, I am come here for those papers that Charlotte Green and myself left here last week; he asked what papers; she said you know what papers I mean, why the papers we left. He then said, so help his God, he never saw the girls before, and did not know what they meant; Mrs. Myers then flew in a passion at the girls, and wanted to turn them out. I told her however to stop, for he was a prisoner, and I was an officer, and I said I wanted the papers, for the gentleman only wanted to have his papers. I then apprehended Myers; he went very quietly with me, and was admitted to bail.</p>

The prisoner said, d-n me if I han't got a one pound note of Bates. I said how did you come by it Thomas; he said, never you mind, you eat your supper, and don't say a word about it. I asked him to give me something to drink; he said, it won't do to night, stop until Sunday, and then I will give you a prime dinner, and plenty to drink. free of expense. The landlord went up stairs, and he followed him up directly. He returned in about eight or ten minutes, and sat himself down along side of me, and said, I have got that in my possession which will fetch us nine or ten pounds, and if you like to go in partnership or be in co, you shall have half. I made answer that I did not understand what he meant. He said never mind, only keep secret and never divulge a word. Then the bell rang up stairs, and the landlady went up stairs. Now, he says, is your time or never, go into the bar he says, and have something out of the bar, the landlord is tipsey and the landlady is gone up stairs, and I shall watch for you; then I left the house.</p>

They entered on the lodging on the 26th of August, and were to pay five shillings a week; they continued in the lodging until the 12th of September, and paid no rent. In consequence of hearing that the prisoner had borrowed a flat iron, I suspected that all was not right, because she had a flat iron as part of the furniture, When they came home, we got an officer, and went up stairs, and missed the things in the indictment. The prisoner gave up three duplicates to the officer; they were duplicates of our things.</p>

I went into a house with him, and we had some more beer, and I threw down five shillings for some beef steaks. I fell asleep, and he took the watch out of my pocket, I felt him, and rose up immediately. I asked him what he was about, and he said he was only taking the watch out of my pocket to give it to the landlord for security; I told him he had broken the chain. He said he would mend that easily. I however caught hold of him, and had an officer sent for. He knocked me down; but I caught hold of him until the officer came. I gave charge of him; I never saw the watch from that time to this. When I first awoke, the watch and chain were both in his hand.</p>

We had some rum and beer on the road, and came on; the other went a head of us, and Willoughby and I walked together; and it being very warm, we went into a green field and sat down. Being tired with walking. I fell fast asleep. When I wakened, I found he had robbed my bundle of the property named in the indictment, of my discharge and my pension ticket, and all my certificates of prize-money. I went in pursuit of him, and found him in a cross country road, about three miles off. I got a constable and took him into custody, and found the pocket book with the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 3rd of August last, a woman came to my shop, and affored some pieces of ivory for sale; I bought them of her for three shillings. Before she went away, I asked her for her name and address, which she gave me, and I afterwards found she was the prisoner's wife. I went afterwards to the Swan public-house in the Strand, where she really did live. We took the prisoner into custody. Some duplicates were found on her.</p>

            . The two prisoners came into the shop both together, on the 12th of September, at eleven o'clock; Robinson asked for a pair of shoes; he was very troublesome in fitting, and I saw Allen cramming something into his bosom. I looked in his bosom, and saw a pair of shoes with the heels upwards. I took them from him, and called my husband, as I thought he had more in his bosom. Before my husband could come, he ran away; Robinson sat quietly in the chair.</p>
               <p>ABRAMAM JOEL. I went after him, and brought him back; and he threw the shoes away; I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I live with my uncle, a bricklayer. On the day in the indictment, between ten and eleven, I was coming through Hanover-square, and saw the prisoner Lyons, stoop down, and put something into a hole under a stone. I went over, and stooped down, and took it up; it was the spoon, and seeing this gentleman go up to the boys, I went up to him, and gave him the spoon.</p>

On the morning of the day in the indictment, I saw him come about seven o'clock; Lawes was a <rs id="t18160918-160-deflabel840" type="occupation">warehouseman</rs>

Hepworth had a bag with him when he went into the warehouse, and when he came out, that bag had something in it; it was quite bulky; I don't know where Lawes was that morning, but it was his duty to be in the warehouse at that time. I communicated this circumstance to the foreman, Cowley, and we followed Hepworth to Battle Bridge, We then went up to him, the bundle was on his shoulder; it did not appear to be very weighty. I asked him what he had got there, and he said cotton, from Mr. Duck, in Golden-lane; he said that there was some more ordered, but he had not the bill with him. We then told him we would go to Mr. Ducks with him, but he refused to carry the bundle, and he threw it off his shoulder. We then went to Mr. Ducks, and he said he knew nothing of the cotton nor the prisoner. The prisoner then said we might have the cotton.</p>

I felt something at my pocket, and on feeling, I immediately missed my snuff-box; it was a tortoiseshell one gold mounted, for which I paid sixty-five guineas. As soon as I perceived it was gone, I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner trying to get off, just by the horses; he was making from me, and before I laid hold of him, there was another put before, who asked me what I wanted; he pushed himself before me, and said, what do you want, what do you want; I said you are not the man; I want that rascal just before you. I then sprang forward and collared the prisoner. I told him you have my snuff box; he denied it, and tried to get away; but I would not let him go; I held him fast. I brought him to an ale house just opposite, and delivered him to a watchman. As soon as ever I collared him, the other man set off running. There was no person near me when I turned round and missed my box but the prisoner. My snuff box has been recovered.</p>

Then he went and tied the tobacco in question up, and let down his breeches and put the tobacco in; then he went on working until I came out of the place where I was concealed; and whon he was going away, I stopped him, and charged him with having stolen this tobacco, but he denied it. I told him it was no use to deny it, for I had been in such a place and had watched him, and then he took it out and acknowledged it.</p>

            , On the night of the 10th of August, before I went to bed. I put my brooch and breast pin in a cushion on my dressing table. They were both gold. About ten o'clock, Mr. Armstrong told me a person wanted to see me on very particular business. In consequence of that, I ordered that the person might he shewn up stairs, It was the prisoner. He begged my pardon for disturbing me; but said he was going out of town, and had not sufcient money to pay for his stage. He said he had not any one to resort to but me, and in consequence of that, I lent him one pound. He then went away. When I got up the next morning I missed the property in question. It was then about eight o'clock, and there had been nobody in the room all night but the prisoner. I communicated what bad happened to Mr. Tuck, and about a week after I had the prisoner apprehended.</p>

            . I keep the cock in the Haymarket, In consequence of something Mr. Ward communicated to me, I apprehended the prisoner at the Feathers public-house; I thought the prisoner was charged with a capital felony, for obtaining money under a threat of an unnatural offence. The prisoner said I was no officer, and I said, I was not; but I considered that I had a right to take him on such a charge. I understood that charge to be from Mr. Ward, that the prisoner had insinuated to him a charge of a certain nature, and thereby induced him to give him money. We sent for an officer. The prosecuter never mentioned any thing about the pin or brooch then. He afterwards did in the afternoon. The prisoner struggled to get away. I said he should not go; and I said I would put him into a hackney coach, and take him to Bow-street. While the coach was gone for, he broadly charged Mr. Ward with the grossest of offences, and said that this money was the wages of it. Mr. Ward did not then say any thing about the pin or brooch. Afterwards when the coach came, the prisoner begged Mr. Ward's pardon, and stated that all he had urged was false; there were a number of persons of the Prince's household in my house at the time and they all concided in my idea that the prisoner ought to go to Bow-street. The charge was positively that of extorting money, and that was the only charge which was then made against the prisoner. We then took him to Bow-street, and there the brooch came out. On relating the time to the magistrate about the money being procured, he considered from what the prosecutor said, that it was lent, and the magistrate considered that the capital charge would fail.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH ARMSTRONG. I am landlord of the house in which the prosecutor lodged. I recollect the prisoner coming to my house on the night of the day in the indictment, at about ten o'clock; he said he wanted to see the prosecutor on very urgent business, and wished to see him; I told him the prosecutor was in bed. He then said, be must see him if possible. I went up, and told Mr. Ward that Mr. Bold wanted him; at first Mr. Ward did not seem to know him; but at last he said, if he wanted any thing in particular, he must come up he supposed. I shewed him up accordingly; I went away immediately, leaving him in Ward's bed-room; it might be three quarters of an hour that he was there. He did not go until I called out that I wanted to go to bed, and I wished the gentleman to go. Mr. Ward then answered and said he is going immediately; and immediately after that he did go. Mr. Ward went out of Town the next morning after breakfast. The prisoner called twice after that; he called on the Tuesday; and on the Sunday; when he called on the Sunday he was extremely insolent, and insisted upon seeing Mr. Ward, through I told him he was not at home; he insisted that he was at home; in point of fact he was not. At last, I sent for a constable, and then the prisoner left. Before Mr. Ward went out of Town in the morning, he did not say any thing about having lost a brooch or a pin. I told him on his return, how insolently the prisoner had behaved on the Sunday. Mr. Ward did not then say that he had lost any brooch or pin. He seemed very much agitated, and said he would have him taken up.</p>
               <p>MARY BYRNE. The prisoner lodged in my house for three weeks. He brought me a pin and a ring and said they had been made a present to him by a gentleman; he said he did not want such things, and I might have them for a pound; I told him I had a friend who might like to buy them; I would shew them to her, and if she did not like them, I would return them to him. I afterwards delivered the property to Mr. Smith, at the police office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Re-examined. Q. Upon your oath, did the prisoner take it without your knowledge - A.Upon my oath he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you not to mention it - A. I did not mention it.</p>
               <p>Q. And how came you to tell us that which is totally inconsistent that you lent this man twenty shillings - A. I did lend him twenty shillings, with a promise that he would pay me again.</p>

After the clock struck four, I went down the court where the prosecutor's premises were; the prisoner was talking to one of the prosecutors men. There was only one door in the court, and that was the prosecutors'. I watched, and in the course of about two minutes, the prisoner came up the court again with a bundle under his arm. Upon that he crossed the road instantly, and looked round to see if I was watching him; that gave me a suspicion that all was not quite right; accordingly I apprehended him, and found the beef in question on him.</p>

I had left my breeches under my pillow with this money in my pocket. I was up at work, and the prisoner was still in bed. He got up about a quarter past six, and left the house; and after he was gone, I felt in my pockets, and my money was gone, I went after the prisoner, and I found him about two hundred yards from my house; I charged him with having taken my money, and he denied it. I said I would send for an officer, and while the officer was gone for, he delivered the money up.</p>

The prisoner came into our shop on the day in the indictment and wished to see some shawls; she pointed out one which lay behind me; I turned round, but I saw her twisting the shawl in question; she said she had come to buy a shawl for a young woman. The prisoner had bought one, and had paid a pound for it. At last she said never mind, she would not take the shawl she had been looking at, but said the young woman should come herself. She was going, but as I had seen her take the shawl in question, I told her to come back, for she had stolen a shawl; and she then denied it. I told her it was useless for her to deny it, for I had actually seen her take it. I brought her back, and look it from her, and gave her in charge to an officer.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JOHNWIN. I am a mariner. I saw the four prisoners at two o'clock on the day in the indictment taking part of the cable from the Dover Castle. A boy waited on the bank on the South side of the City Canal, and assisted the four prisoners; I followed them into the rope ground near Mr. Pritchard's yard at Blackwall, and when I got in I found part of the cable was on the scale being weighed. This cable had been between decks in the Dover Castle. I sent for an officer, and had the prisoner Barlow taken into custody; I asked him how he came to take the cable away, and he said he had deposited some money in a gentleman's hands, and that gentleman had absconded with his money, and he took the cable to make amends. I saw Hurley, cut it up into lengths of five fathems each. The prisoner Barlow was the ship keeper on board the Dover Castle. I don't know what the other three men were; they had no business in the ship at all; they all carried it into the rope round.</p>

The moument she went from me, I missed my money. I pursned her to the corner of George-street, where she made a stop; I don't think that she suspected I was following her; but she turned her head, and saw me close behind her; and speaking rather sharp, said, are you going home; I told her I was, but that she was not. I immediatley called a watchman, and the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse; they there asked me what I had lost, and I told them, a half crown, and six or seven shillings besides. She was searched, and that money was found rolled up in the corner of her shawl, which she held in her hand.</p>

I was in the parlour when it was taken. I heard the cry of stop thief, and when I got to the door, some man flung a piece of print into my arms. I recollect that that piece of print had been upon the counter at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SHEARMAN. I am an officer. I keep a green grocers shop opposite Mr. Smith's, about a quarter past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner walk into the prosecutor's shop about three or four feet, and take the piece of print in question, and put it under his coat. I immediately ran towards him, and he dropped it. Some person picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Smith. I pursued the prisoner, and took him.</p>

I told him he must come back, and shew me the ship; he took me from ship to ship for about half a mile, and then I found he was wrong; then I told him to deliver himself to me as a prisoner; when I said that word, he made a blow at my head with the saucepan, and hit me in the mouth with my carbine, and then he ran away.

I had very good clothes on me, I wanted no old jacket like this, and is it likely I should thieve such a thing as a saucepan; no to be sure not, for it was no use to me; besides, I am a very good character, and have always bore a good reputation, never was accused of being a thief before in my life.</p>

               <p>ALICE FORCE. I am house-keeper to Sir James Graham. The prisoner slipped down our kitchen stairs, and complained that she had hurt her back; she had come to bring some work home. I left her to go into my room for a milk-pot, and when I came back, I found her with the glass-clothes in her hand.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180085"/>I immediately suspected she had been to my drawers, and accused her of it. I detained her while I sent for her master, and then we sent for a constable, and found this property on her.</p>

The prisoner said he would not go up stairs, but he would lie down there for the night. He asked me to get him a drink of water, and when I opened the door to chuck some dirty water out, I saw the other man still at the door. I shut the door, and went into the kitchen, and then went up stairs to bed again. Every thing was fastened when I went to bed, and it was impossible the door could be opened from the outside. In the morning the doors were unbolted, and this property was gone. Nobody could have opened the door but the prisoner.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner for some time; he was a school-fellow of mine. I met him in September, in the last year. I asked him a question about his having left his employment so early; and he said, he was in the employ of the Excise, in Fenchurch-street, and that his business was done for the day. I expressed myself that it would be a good thing for a young man to get into such an employment. He asked me if I knew any person who was acquainted with the Commissioners of Excise; I told him no. He said he knew a person of the name of Longmore who had a considerable interest with the commissioners of Excise, but he was a very mercenary man. I inquired what that person would require as a renumeration for exerting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180086"/>his interest to obtain a similar situation; he said he did not know; but he would make inquiries, and we pacted for that time. Next time I saw him he shewed me a note; I think that note was signed "B.R.L." and the substance of that note was "he would get the situation for two guineas. I expressed my surprize, that only so small a sum should be required, and Thompson explained it that he was personally intimate with this "B.R.L." and that be had induced him to take that small sum, as a favour to him, the prisoner. I wrote to the Commissioners, and this business was discovered.</p>

               <p>ROBERT SNELLIN. On the evening in question, I had been to the Elephant and Castle, and I saw a crowd in Holborn, and followed it to the watchhouse.

I took out my handkerchief, and put it on my knee, and she put it into her pocket, before my face; I asked her for it immediately, and she told me to hold my tongue; and after that, we came out; we then walked down Southampton-buildings; there I insisted upon having my handkerchief; she said she had not got it, and she supposed it was at Cribb's wine-vaults. I went back to see if it was, and it was not. I returned, and told her so; she had then got as far as Chancery-lane, where she turned down. I kept talking to her, and asking her for my handkerchief, and at last she put her hand into my left hand breeches pocket, and took out a one-pound note and several shillings. I called the watch, who took her into custody.</p>

I gave information to the officer, and he apprehended the girls in about two days.</p>

I went into the house with the prisoner Morgan, and the man brought the other prisoner in with him. I fell into a doze; I was very drunk; and when I avoke, I found the prisoner Morgan with her hand under my hat. I had put my watch there. Recollecting it in a minute, I lifted the hat up, and it was gone. I then accused them of taking it, and the man went away. I called the watchman, and gave the prisoners in charge; my watch has never been recovered.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EAGLES. On the morning in question, I was on duty at the watch-house, and heard the prosecutor cry to the watchman for assistance, and I went up at the same time. We took the prisoners to the watch-house, and afterwards I went with the prisoner Morgan back by her request, and she put her hand upon the wall up five or six feet high, and took the watch down and gave it to me.</p>

I had then in my possession two ten-pound notes. I awoke at about twenty minutes after four, and the prisoner then was on board the barge. I missed one of the notes; the prisoner was then with me; I told him I had missed it, and he said, that be damned, for there was nobody there but himself and me, and it could not be done. The Lord Mayor Shewed me the note again, and I knew it by its being the following number to the one I had in my possession.</p>
               <p>LEWIS LIVICK. I took a ten-pound note from the prisoner, on the 18th of July; be bought two pairs of speckled cotton stockings from me; he paid me with a ten-pound note.</p>

            . In the evening of the 17th of August last, I happened to be walking with a young lady in <placeName id="t18160918-218-crimeloc1120">Finsbury-square</placeName>

I immediately missed my watch from my fob, and I directly pursued the prisoner. I called watch, and collared him just as be turned the corner; and never lost sight of him. A struggle took place, and I pulled him to the ground. Then he threw the watch away, and a young man brought the watch; and two or three gentlemen came to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>HENRY THORNGATE. The prosecntor said to the prisoner, you have got my watch; I saw them fall together, and I saw the prisoner try to stop the prosecutor calling, by putting his hand upon his mouth; and I saw the prisoner throw the watch away with his right hand.</p>

               <p>DAVID STEPHENSON. I was coming home at night, about one o'clock, and the prisoner came after me, and asked me if I would let him sleep in the house for the night; I let him come in, but told him we had no bed to spare; he asked me to let him sleep with me, but I said no; then he said never mind that, for he could sleep in the kitchen until morning. I left my shoes underneath the kitchen table and went to bed, leaving him in the kitchen. We did not hear any alarm until between four and five o'clock in the morning; when I got up, I missed my shoes.</p>
               <p>PETER COLUMBIA. I looged in this house, an sat up for Stephenson; I saw the prisoner come id with him. I fastened the door, and went to bed; and in the morning I missed my property. On the Saturday following I saw the shirt on the prisoner's back at the police office.</p>

I then wrote my address on several slips of paper, and went round to several pawnbrokers; and in about an hour afterwards, I was sent for to Marlborough-street, where I found my tea chest and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>HENRY THOMSON. On the 16th of July, the prisoner came and offered the tea chest in question to me to pawn; I told him it would not suit me to give him above one pound ten shillings for it; upon which the prisoner went away. He had not been gone long, before a person came in with the prosecutor's address. I communicated what had passed. In a short time the prisoner came back again. I sent for an officer and took him into custody.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HOPKINS. At about a quarter past twelve at night of the 9th of August, I saw two men in Windmill-street; I watched them up John-street, and along Colville-street, and I lost them. When I came back, I saw a third person at the area; when he saw me coming along on the other side of the way, he walked off from there and went into Tottenham Court Road. When I came back again to the corner of John-street; the prisoner and another one came by again along <placeName id="t18160918-231-crimeloc1176">Windmill-street</placeName>

Soon after the prisoner came to the prosecutor's area, and put his hand through the grating, pushed the upper sash of the window down; and in a few minutes with this stick he began to pull some of the things out. In five of six minutes, I saw that I could catch him, and I was within five or six feet of him but my foot slipped, and he turned round and looked at the full in-the fae, and then ran; but I pursued him, and caught him. The rattle sprund, and I secured him in Suffolk Mews. I can swear to the man, for I have known him these two years.</p>

            . The prisoner went into the parlour on the day in the indictment, and called for a pint of beer; this glass was all in the parlour. In consequence of some information which my servant gave me, I determined to give an eye to the prisoner and the other person who was with him, when they went out. I immediately went into the parlour, and missed he glass in question. I then went out, and overtook the prisoner and brought him back; and he pulled the cruets out of his small clothes, and I took a coffee cup from his coat pocket. I never recovered more of my property. He offered to pay for the glass, but I told him I was determined to check depredations of this kind, and I should pursue the law accordingly.</p>

            . I am a sweep. I recollect the morning of the day in the indictment; I saw Snell coming up Crawford-street with a load of dust. I waited until be got up to me, and walked along with him. Then I saw Armfield come running up Crawford-street as hard as he could run, till he got up to Snell; then he pulled a watch out of his pocket and shewed it to Snell. I afterwards discovered that a robbery had been committed. I happened to mention it to a person, and I was called upon to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Examined by the COURT. I knew Snell before. I have been tried here before.</p>

By the direction of Thompson, I watched them up Fleet-street. The prisoner was placed next the gentleman whilst the other two strove to hide him from the passingers. I observed the prisoner turn round with a pocket-book in his hand, which he immediately put in his bosom; he then walked a few paces towards Temple Bar, and I apprehended him.</p>

It was on the 1st or 2nd of September; I asked him how he came by it. He said he received it from a woman in Ballard's-lane, who had a basket on her arm, and who appeared as a reader. He was counting his silver as it was pay day, and she asked him for change, and he gave it her to get rid of his silver. He gave it her, eighteen shillings in silver, and two shillings in copper. He asked her her name, and she gave the name of Hoby, Wheatstone.</p>

When I was at the top of the stairs, I heard the street door open, and the parlour door open. I came down, and saw the prisoners in the shop; Price had a bun in his hand; I asked them what they wanted, and they both said at once, we want a bun, and one of them threw down a shilling; I suspected it to be bad; I told them so, and they said, let us go and get change; one of them took up the shilling, and they went out; I did not expect they would come back again, and I shut the door. My husband came in almost directly, and then I missed the watch from over the mantlepiece.</p>

            . On the 20th of July, I saw Jones with three other boys on the day in the indictment; I saw the prisoner Lemmon come up the area with one of the bundles of things; at last they went on into the square to Mr. Woodmass's house. The prisoner Jones was there, and I walked backwards and forwards, and then I saw two boys come up the prosecutor's area; I followed Jones, as I could not take the four myself, and he turned up Spanish-place, and when I was close to him, he threw the bundle of clothes away; I followed him up, and seized him.</p>
