                  </hi>. I am master of Kensington Workhouse; I reside there—on 4th March I was aroused about 4 a.m. by a man calling out "Fire" above me—I went up to where the fire was in a water-closet which was used as a store-room for counterpanes, &amp;c.; about 12 or 13 counterpanes were there—the damage was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the woodwork was much burnt, and the fire had got a good firm hold—the prisoner has been an occasional inmate 13 or 14 years; he would be away for five or six months, and then turn up again—he is quite right in his mind so far as I can judge—the counterpanes were all ablaze when I got there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know that the prisoner had been an inmate of the lunatic ward; I know it now but was astonished when I heard it—I reported the fire next morning to the Guardians in writing; I have not got it; in substance it was, "At 4.30 a.m. I was called up by a cry of Fire,' and found a man without shoes or stockings on vigorously applying the fire hose, and that we had had a narrow escape, for in 10 minutes the house would have been in a blaze"—I reported that it was accidental, as I could not come to any other conclusion—I have no other reason now for supposing it was not accidental except that the prisoner told me he did it—he took his discharge on Friday, 24th April, and gave himself up on the 26th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I first heard he was in the lunatic ward a few days ago.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman A</hi> 473). I was on duty in Kensington Gardens on the afternoon of 26th April—the prisoner came to me and said, "I wish to give myself up, for I set fire to the Kensington Work<lb/>house seven weeks ago, and I have had no sleep"—I said, "How did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188505180004"/>
               <p>you do that?"—he said, "I got out of bed at 9 o clock in the evening, went up in the back room, and set fire to a counterpane"—I said, "Why did you do that?"—he replied, "I have been treated badly, and called by the inmates a German pauper, and told to go back to my own country, and I thought I would burn them"—I took him to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said if I inquired I should find it was right—he did not seem excited, just the same as he is now, I thick he is worse now if any different—it was about 5 o'clock when he came to me—it was not singular, we see plenty in Hyde Park who have had no sleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am labour master at Kensington Union—on 6th March I cautioned the prisoner for being in a place where he ought not, and I ordered him away—he said, "There has been one little fire, two little fires, but the next one will be a big one"—I reported that to the master at 9 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known the prisoner about 12 months—I was not aware that he had been in the lunatic ward; he was handed over to the infirmary as a patient—I did not know of his trying to cut his throat—I have not heard paupers talk about or threaten fires; that was the only one, and as a matter of duty I reported it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent of the infirmary and medical officer of the workhouse—I have been there four years; during that time the prisoner has been under my care, I cannot say how often—it was for weakness and debility on one or two occasions—on Wednesday, 22nd December last, he was brought over to me from the workhouse in an excited condition—he had several delusions; he fancied the nurses were in love with him, or that he was in love with them; he never came across them—he refused his food whilst in the infirmary, saying it was poisoned; that is evidence of acute insanity—the attack in December lasted two or three days—he left the infirmary on 9th January—he is a peculiar kind of man, and from a medical point of view not right in his appearance; he is erratic—he is not always insane—his mind is somewhat disordered; he is an eccentric man, and liable to attacks from time to time—he was very sleepless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His delusions lasted while he was in the infirmary—we put him in the lunatic ward—he had no delusion when he went out; he was a fairly responsible person when he went out, and would know what he was about, and whether he was doing right or wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He was not bad enough to be sent to the county asylum—at the workhouse he would be taken care of before any accident happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the lunatic attendant at the Kensington Infirmary—the prisoner has been more than once under my care—I remember the attack spoken of; he had one before that—I have been at the infirmary about 18 months—the prisoner has had attacks within 12 months—he was under the delusion that his food was poisoned—the attacks would last four or five hours at a time, then he would cool down, and it would come on again twice in the day for a few days, and then go off all right again; the attacks were intermittent—I have had a number of insane patients—he could not sleep well, and was rather restless at night—I understood he was suicidal and had made an attempt; he was not committed to my charge as suicidal, but as necessary to be under</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188505180005"/>
               <p>observation—I regarded him as a man who might do something very dangerous if not watched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was dangerous when he had his attacks—at one time I considered him dangerous enough to be sent to an asylum, but it wore off—that is the case sometimes—when discharged, to all appearance he was in his proper mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Young—on 29th April I was attending at the Spread Eagle, Broad Street, and served a man with two half-pints of ale; he called in the prisoner, who was standing at the door, they drank the ale, and the first man paid with a shilling—he asked me to but two dozen quart bottles—I put it in the till, where there was only one other shilling, a very plain one, which I had just taken—the prisoner then called for two half-pints, and paid with a shilling—I said "Are you aware this is bad?"—he said "No"—I looked in the till and found that the other was bad—I sent for a policeman, and said to the prisoner "Have you any more?"—he said "What the b—h—do you mean?"—I said "I mean that if you have any more like this you have come to the wrong house"—the other man went out and did not return—I jumped over the counter, closed the door, and put my back against it for 10 minutes, till a policeman came—I gave the two bad coins to him—I bent this one with my teeth.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). About 12.30 on the morning of the 26th April I went to Mr. Wilson's surgery and there found Adams dead—I saw a wound on his right side, between the second and third ribs—from what I heard I went to 5, Cuba Street and saw the prisoner there in the front room with some of her neighbours—her head was bandaged, and her face was very much disfigured with bruises—the little girl Edith was in bed—I have a memorandum of what passed, which I made the same day—I was in plain clothes; I had a constable in uniform with me—I told her who I was—she told me she was Mrs. Adams—I asked her if she could throw any light on the affair—she said no—I said, "Tell me what you do know"—she then said, "I went out to do some shopping, and at about 20 minutes to 11 o'clock, on coming out of Mr. Lyons the corn dealer's shop, where I had called for my husband's collars that I had left on the counter, I saw my husband coming from the direc<lb/>tion of the Torrington Arms—he came up to me and commenced to swear at me, but as I did not want to cause a commotion in the street I walked on first; on getting indoors he said, 'Where the b—h—have you been to?' I said, 'Only to get some steak for your supper.' He said, 'It's a b—lie,' and knocked me down in the room and kicked me, saying, 'Lie there, you b—s—.' He then went out, and I did not move for a moment or so, fearing he might come back, but I afterwards went into the street, where I saw Mrs. Gurney and Mrs. Willatts, and said to them, 'Look what he has done to me.' Some time after that some one came and told me that my husband had broken a blood-vessel, and was at Dr. Wilson's. I went round to see him, but could not get in, but I went round again and saw him." The child was awake at that time, and I asked her if she saw her father knock her mother down—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Did he do anything else?"—she said, "He kicked her, and then went out of the room"—I said, "Did you see your mother strike your father at all?"—she said, "No"—I asked the prisoner whether there was any one else in the house at the time she was assaulted other than herself, her husband and child—she said, "No"—I then searched the premises—I found blood on the oil-cloth and carpet in the same room, and two or three spots in the passage leading to the front door—the blood in each case had the appearance of having dropped from some one's face or nose; it was not in a pool—in a table-drawer in the adjoining kitchen I found a knife and two forks; the knife had an old smear of blood on the handle—I also found a larger knife on the dresser without blood; I produce them both—I found two collars on the table in the front room—I found a trace of blood from the street door to Mr. Wilson's surgery, a distance of 350 yards—I went back and took the prisoner to the station—I told her she would be charged on suspicion of causing the death of her husband, William Adams, by stabbing him in the chest—she made no reply—she was wearing an ulster, on the right breast of which I saw some blood; she said it had come from her nose—she had a cut on the temple, and her nose had bled—I did not see her for two or three hours after the occurrence—she said the blood in the house also came from her nose.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, and have a surgery at 44, Westferry Road, Mill wall—on Saturday night, 25th April, William Adams was brought there in a state of collapse; he could not speak—he was wounded on the right side of the chest between the second and third ribs; it was a stab going through his waistcoat and</p>

               <p>two shirts; frothy blood was oozing out of the wound—he died within about 25 minutes—I made a post-mortem examination—the wound was a punctured one, penetrating the lungs for an inch and a quarter—there was a quantity of blood, it had flowed into the windpipe—he died from suffocation and fainting, from the effects of the stab—in my judgment the knife found on the dresser could not have produced the injury, it is broader than the length of the wound—the knife taken from the drawer would be more likely to produce it; on measurement it corresponded with the wound in the waistcoat and also with the wound in the chest; in my judgment that knife could have caused it—I think great violence must have been used in inflicting the blow—I examined the man's clothes, they were soaked in blood—I did not examine the pockets to see whether he had a knife—from the position of the wound I could not say whether it was self-inflicted or not—it is possible that he might have done it himself—if he was a left-handed man the blow could be struck with greater violence—I saw the prisoner; I did not dress her wounds; I saw that she was considerably bruised.</p>

I have been a guard on the North-Western about 32 years, and worked the 6.30 train out from Euston to Holy head on 21st December, 1883—before the train went out one of the clerks brought me an insured parcel addressed to Webb, Dublin—I signed for it and put it on the seat in the van, and when the train left put it in my locker and locked it up—the train stopped at Chester, and the parcel was safe locked up there when we left—as we were running into Holy head I unlocked the locker and took out the parcel, which was the only one I had for Dublin—I got out when the train stopped at 3 a.m. (the train was an hour late) with the parcel in my hand, and went towards the gangway of the steamer—in consequence of the crowd I came back to the van with the parcel, and put it on the seat—I got on the platform; a man spoke to me about a dog—I went a few yards from my van, got the dog out, then a lady spoke to me, and I was absent from my van from the time I put the parcel on the seat to the time I got back again, about two minutes—I saw the book with which I had covered the parcel, and thought the parcel was right—I went to the other end of the van, and assisted in getting one or two boxes out—soon after I looked for the parcel, it was gone—I communi<lb/>cated at once with the station-master and other officials there—we looked everywhere unsuccessfully for it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness before the Magistrate had said "It could not be reached from it, you could see it from the platform.</hi>") My impression is I said they could not see it; the book covered it up—I should say over 300 passengers got out of the train, and there would be sailors and men to carry the luggage on board—I</p>

When the train runs in, people make for the gangway to get on board directly, and they clear off the platform directly—servants and others come to and fro to take the luggage off—the principal part of the passengers were walking towards the gangway when I went towards it—I carried the parcel in my hand, so that it could be seen by everybody—I stood a minute or two at the gangway to see if I could get on board; I could not, and when I came back very near all the passengers were at the gangway which leads off from the middle of the platform—I put the parcel underneath my book—it is correct what I said before the Magistrate that I never saw either of the prisoners in my life before to my knowledge.</p>

I heard of the loss of this parcel on 22nd December, 1883, and received instructions to investigate the matter, and I had three inter<lb/>views with Hill on 27th and 29th December and 1st January—on the 27th December he was brought into my office at Euston—I said "You are Mr. Hill, I believe"—he said "Yes"—I said "You sent a parcel to Webb of Dublin on the 21st of this month insured for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Yes"—I said "This is the 27th, and we have had no complaint from you"—he said "I found a letter at Wood's Hotel stating it had not been delivered"—I said "Who is Mr. Webb?"—he said "He resides at 134, Lower Gloucester Street, Dublin; I have known him some time; we have carried on business in the jewellery and hardware"—I said "Where are you living?"—he said "No. 12, St. Ann's Place, Brixton Road"—I said "I find you stayed at Wood's Hotel on the night of the 20th"—he said "Yes"—I said "It is strange that you should have stayed there, seeing that you have a wife in lodgings at Brixton"—he said "I don't know how that happened"—I said "This is a very impor<lb/>tant matter, and I want you to give me all the assistance you can; I presume you have a statement of the contents of the parcel?"—he said "No, I have not; I don't keep any books, but I dare say I can get you a statement"—he left my office—about 10 or 15 minutes afterwards I saw him come out of Wood's Hotel—he was called up into Inspector Pearson's office, which is immediately opposite Wood's Hotel—he there handed me</p>

               <p>this list—the ink was quite wet at the time. (<hi rend="italic">This included rings and various articles of jewellery to the amount of 561l.</hi>) I said "This is not what I really require; I want a thorough description of the whole contents, in order that it may be properly circulated among the pawnbrokers"—he said "I will endeavour to get you some further information, and will see you again"—he came on the 29th, and brought with him this list. (<hi rend="italic">This was a list of rings with their descriptions.</hi>) I said "This is all very well so far as it goes, but it does not give the information that I require; I have received instructions from the Company to have bills printed offering a reward, and I shall require the private marks on the inside of the rings"—he said "There are no private marks"—Mr. Pearson made some observation as to the rings, and I said "Here are some rings of very great value, and they would certainly bear the private marks of the makers"—he said "I had them specially made without marks"—Mr. Pearson said "Oh, it is nonsense; rings of that sort would have the private marks of the maker"—I asked him two or three times over, but could get no further particulars from him—I said "Have you the invoices with you?"—he said "No; but I dare say I can produce them at the proper time"—I said "Well, you will know where you got the goods from?"—he said "Well, some are what I have had by me for some time, but the bulk of it is new; it is made in Birmingham and Clerkenwell"—I said "Will you give me the names of the manufacturers of it?"—he said "No, I don't see why I should"—I said "What were you going to do with the goods, as Dublin is the last place in the world to dispose of such goods as these?"—he said "Webb was going to put them up at auction sales, then we get a respectable man in the trade to bid for them; the public are thus led to believe they are very valuable, and we get more than they are worth, but the game has been played out there now, and I have returned to England"—he had said that he had lived at 3, Hanken Street, Dublin, prior to removing to St. Ann's Place—I said "It is very important you should tell me whether any one was present when you packed the jewellery that you were sending off, as thieves may have followed and stolen it in transit"—he said "That can<lb/>not be, as no one knew I had the goods; my wife may have been about the room at the time I packed them, but she did not see me do it; I don't leave my goods about;" and he opened his waistcoat and pointed to a small pocket inside and said "That is where I keep them"—he said they were in a cigar box when he sent them from Euston—I saw him again on 1st June, but we could elicit nothing further—after that I received instructions to watch Hill, and gave my sub<lb/>ordinates, Pearson and others, instructions to do so, and I also gave instructions for Webb to be seen in Dublin—I was present in the High Court on 25th and 26th February, 1885, when the case of Hill <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> the London and North-Western Railway Company was in the list—I saw nothing of Hill on either day, and they searched all the neighbourhood and in the courts and could not find any traces of him on either day—I know Tatley by name only—I have been to the address given on the list, 42, Coborn Road, Bow, since the action was commenced—I have not seen Hill there—I have not been able to find Mr. Tapley there or any trace of him, though I made every possible search and inquiry at his address and other places for him—the last trace we could find was the day after warrants were applied for for the prisoners' appre<lb/>hension—when the action was called on judgment was taken for the</p>

I said "You mean Tapley; no, at this moment he is not in custody; I saw Webb the other day"—he said "Where?"—I said "We brought him up as a witness the other day in your case against the Company"—he said "He cannot say anything about it; he can only say he did not receive the parcel; you admit you had it and lost it"—I said "Yes, and you had it twice"—he made no answer—I said "Webb was also staying at the hotel about the time this parcel was sent off"—he said "I think it was a little before that"—I said "He also used to stay at Euston Grove?"—he said "Yes, sometimes"—that is close to Drummond Street—I think that is all the conversation—that is all I remember of it.</p>

On 19th December, 1883, I saw the two prisoners together at Wood's Hotel, which my office at Euston overlooks; they came out together—I had seen them before together at the same place going in and out—I knew Webb's name, but Hill I did not know—on 23rd December I received informa<lb/>tion as to the loss, and instructions from Coppin to make inquiries—on 27th and 29th December, and 1st January, I was present at the inter<lb/>views between Hill and Coppin; afterwards I heard of the action brought by Hill against the Company, and received instructions, and watched 12, St. Ann's Place, Brixton, the address Hill had given to Coppin—I saw Hill leave that house—I took a note of the different days I watched there—I saw him leave there altogether, with a woman, and I saw the landlady, and inspected the house—it was a respectable double-house, kept by Mrs. Plush—I have followed Hill—he would take the omnibus or tram and alight at the Elephant and Castle, and various times I have seen him going into Richardson's, a draper's shop—from there I have traced him to Bishopsgate Street, and from there to Bow, 42. Coborn Road, Tapley's address given on the invoices—I have seen him come out of there with Tapley and go into a public-house, and then Tapley returned to his house, and Hill went to the Coborn Road Station and came to London—I only saw that once; I have seen him go to Liverpool Street Station several times—I have watched him for a long time—I watched 15, Graveney Terrace, Graveney Road, Lower Tooting where I saw Hill and the same woman—I saw him doing no business at either of those places—the house at Lower Tooting was a very small one—I last saw Hill on 14th November, 1884—after that I was looking for him till the time of his apprehension—I could not see or hear of him—I was at the Royal Courts on 25th and 26th February—I went to Hackney Police<lb/>station on 12th March.</p>

I have not received a parcel, I cannot tell you anything about it. I have been laid about a fort<lb/>night, I can scarcely walk now"—in consequence of what he told me I made inquiries in Dublin about Mr. Dillon, and went to Mr. Perceval—on ✗th January, 1884, I again saw Webb in Dublin as I was leaving the auction rooms—I said, "Mr. Webb, I find you received an insured parcel from London on 8th December; it was insured for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., can you tell me what that parcel contained?"—he said, "No, I shall not answer any more questions; Mr. Hill is the man you should question, I have nothing to do with insured parcels or the Company"—I told him I had been in Dillon's and Perceval's rooms, but he would not listen and walked away, and would not give any more information—I went to 3, Hanken Road, Dublin; it is a common lodging-house—I made inquiries at every auction room I could find in Dublin with reference to Hill and Webb—I saw Webb in Liverpool on 26th July, 1884, in Kirk<lb/>dale Prison—I saw him at the station on 24th July, I did not speak to him; I spoke to him on 26th July.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 37, Stanmore Street, Caledonian Road, and am 19 years old next August—I became acquainted with Hoare three years or a little more ago, and have been living with him lately—I first met the prisoner one evening about three months ago at the back of King's Cross Station—I had before that seen him now and again in a shop in Bingfield Street, Caledonian Road, where I dealt on and off—when I met him that evening he asked me to have a glass of ale—I said I did not mind, and I had a glass with him in the Globe public-house—After that we went to a greengrocer's shop in the King's Cross Road and into a room there together by ourselves—we remained there for some time—when he left he gave me a postal order for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and said he had not any money, but I could get the money just the same if I took it to the post office, they would change it for me—I said to him "It is all right, isn't it?"—he said "Oh, yes my girl, you have got nothing to fear, I should not give it you if it was not all right," and he said all I had to do was to write my name on the top, "You can sign any name and they will give you the money "—when we first went into the room the prisoner said "Don't you know me?"—I said "I know you now you have taken your hat off, I did not know you before, you are the gentleman that keeps the provision shop"—he said "That is right"—that was the shop in Bingfield Street—the night after I saw him again—he said he might see me next night and might give me something—the following night I saw him at King's Cross Station and he gave me some orders of the same kind—he said "I can be a very good friend to you, but at the same time I cannot afford to give you all the money, you must return me half"—he gave me other orders at other times, altogether he gave me about 30—he gave mo this Warwick order—I wrote "Hart" in the body of it; it is Hoare's signature at the bottom, I gave it to him—I gave these other two Warwick orders to Hoare, it is not my writing on either of them—I got some of the money from time to time, and I always gave the prisoner back half, sometimes in the street, some<lb/>times in his shop—I got this Greenock order from him the night before I charged him (I think it is the one Hoare was stopped with), on the Thursday night—I forget if he gave it me in the shop or street—when he gave me the order in the shop it was in a little piece of newspaper, sometimes rolled up—the "Smith" in the body is mine—the signature "Henry Smith" at the bottom is Hoare's—when the prisoner gave me this on 23rd April I bought some provisions in his shop; two duck's eggs, and a bundle of wood, and a tin of salmon—it was late in the evening—I had to meet him on Friday evening at 6 o'clock at King's Cross Station, where I nearly always met him—the next day I was out with Hoare and he went to change the order at the chemist's shop in Caledonian Road—I waited outside, I could not see into the shop—as he did not come out I went in to get a pennyworth of glycerine and rose-water, and saw him</p>

Hoare said "Yes"—I took that down—I asked Powell his name and age and so on, and said "You know who I am?"—he said "Yes"—I said "A large number of letters addressed to the firm of Wilkinson and Company, Regent Street, have been stolen in transit through the post, and the orders which were enclosed in them have been fraudulently negotiated; this afternoon this young man," pointing to Hoare, "whose name is Hoare, presented one numbered 878515 for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for payment at Caledonian Road receiving house; he was stopped, and on being</p>

               <p>questioned about it states that he received it from Mrs. Harris through you"—the prisoner replied "I deny it, it is a falsehood"—Harris then came into the room, and Powell was placed where he could not be seen by her, but could hear what was going on—she made a statement, which Powell heard—I said to her "Do you know why you have been brought here?"—she replied "That young man," pointing to Hoare, "I gave him an order to charge this afternoon, and I was waiting outside for him and saw the policeman go in, and I went in for a pennyworth of glycerine and rose-water; I saw the policeman and the young man sitting by his side; I did not know whether to say anything; I went out and walked down as far as King's Cross Station, and was there about half an hour, when I saw this gentleman "(he was a third person who had come down with Harris)" and I asked him what I should do, as I thought Harry was locked up, and he said I had better go to the station and tell the truth how I got the order, and I told the gentleman that; and with that the gentelman brought me down here"—I produced the order and said to Harris "Where did you get this order?"—she said "A man gave it to me"—I said "Do you know him?"—she said "I do not know more of him; he met me one evening at King's Cross Station and gave me the order; I said 'Is it all right?' he said 'Quite right, you have nothing to do; it was before Easter he had to do with me; each time he asked me to give him half of the orders he gave me; I did; this is the order he gave me last night over the counter of his shop, and at the same time I bought two three-halfpenny duck's eggs, a bundle of wood, and a tin of salmon; he said I was to meet him to-night at 6 o'clock, at King's Cross Station, where I nearly always meet him; I did not meet him, because I went to the other place"—I asked her to look round the room and see if she could identify the person who gave her the order; she looked at Powell and said "That is the man"—I said to Powell "You have heard what Mrs. Harris has said, what have you to say about it?"—he said "I deny it, I never gave her any orders, I never saw her before"—I asked him where he lived, he said 42, Bing<lb/>field Street, Caledonian Road—I said "Have you anything belonging to the Post-office?"—he said "No, only a few cases I take home to do"—I searched his house, and found two Bank of Ireland notes; I asked him to whom they belonged, he said "To me"—me said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "I took them over my counter as cash"—I said "Who from?"—he said "Customers I don't know; they were for goods a week ago"—I then produced 30 postal orders which I told him had been stolen from post-letters and fraudulently negotiated, and the matter would be laid before the secretary—he made no reply.</p>

I am a carman—on April 4th, about 6.30, I was driving in a cart over the bridge from Cambridge Heath towards the Triangle, three Hansom's cabs passed me going 16 or 17 miles an hour—the prisoner was driving one of them; but they kept passing each other, one with a black horse got ahead and then stopped for the others after they had passed me; they were close behind one another; the horses' heads were right at the backs of the other cabs—after they passed me I saw a man standing on the step of one cab, hitting the horse with a whip to make him go faster; the driver was on the box; that was the last cab; they then passed out of my sight—I continued on to where the accident had happened and found the boy lying in the road—I got down, and saw the prisoner standing by his cab, which was outside Fortescue Avenue.</p>

She came in at 11.20, I said "Where have you been?" she said "That is my business," and went on swearing and saying she would do this and that; and she said, "You will find I have got it up hot for you." I had used the knife to cut some tobacco. She took up a knife and said she would stab me. The boy had said previous to going to bed, "You are always talking about stabbing father." When I came in the little boy said "Mother has been out all the afternoon." I waited about and she came home about a quarter to 1 o'clock. I asked where she had been, she said she had been charing. She fell down intoxicated, and nearly gouged my eye out with a key. She has got hold of some bad com<lb/>panious, and has misconducted herself. When she was in service she wrote me a letter asking me to take her back again, and I did so. About three months previously she flung a butter-dish at me.

As it is to speculate I should like it done unknown to my brokers. It will require a power of A. to do this, so please send me application for one, as I am down with gout. W. Forbes Capel." It would be answered by one of my clerks—this is a copy of the answer, dated January 22nd, 1885—there is also a telegram marked "F"—in answer to the letter and telegram I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Marked "G," signed "W. Forbes Capel," instructing witness to sell and to keep the transaction from his brothers, who were stockbrokers</hi>)—that would be answered—I did not keep a copy, but this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a summary of what I said—there was not copy kept, because I knew there was something wrong, and I sent down a special messenger, sending the summary by hand, to the address given, "Studland Street, Hammersmith."

Forbes Capel might be taken in for you as you did not wish them to go to your lodging, and that you have called almost daily, and that no other person but you has been seen"—at that time we had got out of the shop—I then said to him "Where is Mr. Capel?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "Where does he live?"—he said "I don't know"—I said "What is you name, and where do you live?"—he said "I decline to answer; I don't see what it has got to do with you"—I said "Then you still refuse to give any account of yourself?"—he said "Yes"—at that time Abbott, another officer, in plain clothes, came up—I then said to Owen "We are two police officers; your answers are not at all satisfactory; you will have to go with us to the City; give me the telegram," which he did, un<lb/>opened—it is from Mr. Shaw to Mr. Capel: "Power of attorney will be forwarded to-night"—I took Owen to the police-station in the Old Jewry, and Sergeant Child, who had charge of the case, saw him and spoke to him.</p>

At a quarter to 1 o'clock on the morning of 7th May I was in Ampthill Road and came to the corner of the Medway Road—I heard some scratching, could not make out what it was, and when I turned round, saw the two prisoners come out of the window of 2, Medway Road and go down Stringfield Road and down a little turning—I went to the house and found the window open and the inmates up in the passage—while talking to them the prisoners passed the bottom of the street about 40 yards from me—I said "Don't go to bed, here they are," and went directly after the prisoners—I saw Tarney throw away this knife—I blew my whistle, they started running—I called out "You had better stop," at which they both stopped directly—I got hold of Tarney and said "Come along with me," the other was about a yard ahead of me—he said "What do you want with me?"—I said "I will tell you"—I took them back to the house (the inhabitants were up)—I put them in the front parlour and said "You will have to go to the station, you have been trying to break into this house"—Tarney said "Oh, what about that?"—Cooper said nothing, but sat and kept himself very quiet—I took them to the station with the assistance of another constable—I examined the window and found they had tried to cut a pane of glass out—it was not cut out, but cut down about the length of a knife on one side; the putty had been taken away, and underneath the catch were marks of a knife where the catch had been forced back—the window was open about 18 inches—the marks on the window corresponded with the knife.</p>

I am Thomas Hill's wife and live at 2, Medway Road—the night before the morning of 7th May I looked round the house before going to bed—I noticed that the window was perfectly safe, closed, and the catch fastened—on the morning of the 7th I heard the noise of a catch of a window going back about 1 o'clock ✗.—I got up and saw the last witness outside—the prisoners were afterwards brought to the house—when I came down I found the window open and the catch moved back.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This form of agreement stated that the terms were one pound a week and a commission of 7 1/2 per cent. on goods supplied; that he was to work solely for them; and it was to he terminable by a month's notice on either side</hi>. ) Travellers were supposed to collect accounts, and to pay them in the same or following day, returning a sheet of moneys received, which I signed for—no travellers in our employment had any right to retain possession of our moneys for two months together without giving any account of their receipt—the prisoner made no return on the 6th, 7th, or 8th of December—no moneys were paid in on those days—there is no entry in the books of any sum received on the 6th by the prisoner, nor on the 15th, nor of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 31st—I have had other sums paid in after that time, but I had no report at all of receipts from the 15th to the 31st—it was his duty to write up every day a list of the persons from whom he received money—the particular sums men<lb/>tioned are left out from the reports sent up between the 5th and 31st—those sums were not included in reports sent in after the 31st—inquiries were made, and he received notice to quit on the 14th of February—he was written to on ✗th March, and the first answer we received was a letter from Mr. S. B. Abrahams, a solicitor, on the 12th March. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been consulted by the prisoner, and requested to furnish a balance sheet, showing a balance in favour of the prisoner, and asked that a cheque might be sent.

                  </hi>. I live at High Street, Ely—about March, 1884,1 saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> similar to this. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that a Mr. James Hall Cooper Clark, who died in South America in March last, had left 3,000l. each to the first 35 persons who could prove by parish certificates that their ancestors for seven generations had held that name, and inviting applications</hi>). I wrote this answer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and then received this letter of June 11th from D.D. Grigsby and Co. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that as the bequests were intended for the benefit of persons of limited means, it would be necessary to send particulars of his circumstances</hi>). I sent this answer dated 12th June, 1884. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he kept a small drapery business, and had nothing but what he worked for, and that the bequest would be a great help to him</hi>). I received an answer to that, and then wrote "Your letter to hand; I will make inquiries and see if I can trace back my seven generations"—I then received this lithograph letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated August 27th, 1884, and headed Clark or Clarke 105,000l.; it repeated the terms of the advertisement, and offered to send a copy of the bequest portion of the will, for 50s. or offering to make the search for him</hi>). (<hi rend="italic">Another letter stated:</hi> "If you are prompt in providing proofs, you are nearly certain of obtaining the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bequest, &amp;c. Our clients will require a letter from you authorising us to deduot 10 per cent, from the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for commission, such being sanctioned by the trustees in view of legacy duty, &amp;c., searching the register, and obtaining the necessary proof and forms. Our total costs out of pocket will probably range from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. according to distance and time, &amp;c. Fees can stand over till the bequest is obtained. Only one person having proved up to the present time, and as you state you think the necessary certificates for the seven generations may be easily found, we think you have a very good chance of success.") Then there is a letter from me of September 10th. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed postal order for 50s., and requested a copy of the extract from the will</hi>). I then received this extract, and afterwards sent a copy of my pedigree for seven generations; I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 18th September, from D. D. Grigsby and Co., solicitors, stating that their costs out of pocket would be probably from 20l. to 60l., and offering to take up the case on receipt of 12l. towards expenses, and that the legal charges could stand over to be paid from the bequest</hi>). I then received this letter from Grigsby and Co., 30, Theobald's Road, late 55 and 56, Chancery Lane. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that as solicitors for the trustees they were prohibited from taking up any case on speculation, and that if they took up the witness's case they should make no charge if they failed</hi>). I then wrote and enclosed certificates showing my pedigree for seven generations, and then received' this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was a copy of the former one of September 18th</hi>). I then wrote this letter of October 18th, forwarding the proper certificates, and received on 21st October another letter asking me for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then sent this letter (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing cheque for 5l., stating that he was too pressed to send more just now, but</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">requesting them to write for the certificates</hi>). Hearing nothing from them for two months, I wrote this letter: "December 17th. I shall be glad to hear from you regarding Clark's bequest. I hope you have got certificates, and that you are doing the best you can for me." I received this reply: "December 18th. In reply to yours, we are waiting for all the certificates you can possibly obtain; then when you have done your best, we will, if, you so wish, take up the search and endeavour to complete it; but you must press on without loss of time." On 20th September I wrote again. (<hi rend="italic">This letter enclosed extracts from the Edinburgh General Registry Office</hi>). I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Apologising for the delay in consequence of their immense correspondence</hi>). On 6th January I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed names for five generations back, and stated that one was missing</hi>). I then received this acknowledgment, and then sent this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing birth and marriage certificates</hi>). I then received this letter of 30th January. (<hi rend="italic">Requesting certificates of death or burial, and offering to put the matter into the hands of a gentleman who had come to terms with several friends to make their searches</hi>). I was not introduced to the gentleman—on 2nd February I wrote saying: "As you have had all the trouble of my case, and feeling you have given it your best attention so far, I would rather give you extra fees when the case is complete if you have the time to devote to it, and help you all I can; at the same time, if you would rather I was put in communication with the gentleman you mention, and will kindly send address, I will do so at once." On 4th February I had a letter saying that it entirely rested with me whether the gentleman took up the matter—that was the last letter; they obtained no certificates for me—the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for them to get the certificates– believed the statements written to me before I got the will, and believed the extract from the will—I have not had the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. yet.</p>

I am a clerk, of 88, Isley Street, Kentish Town—in January, 1885, I advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Law Times</hi> for a situation as shorthand clerk—I had a reply from Grigsby's, of Theo<lb/>bald's Road, went there and saw Howard, who engaged me—I think I commenced on February 2nd—I saw Howard there that day; he got there before me—he came into the office where I was; that was called the Clark office, to distinguish it from the Cooper-room, which was on the upper floor—Howard shook hands with me and told me he was a friend of Grigsby, who was a good fellow, and he was assisting him in his work—Howard was always called the captain—he did not tell me what he was captain in, but I found out by perusing a document in the Clark room; I saw a document which Howard wrote, and which described him so, and what purported to be his signature—Grigsby said that Howard was a retired captain in the Army, and had some pro<lb/>perty in Italy, and by some means or other had lost it—Grigsby gave me a lithographed copy of the Clark will to read; it was signed Captain John Scott—I told him I had heard somebody I know mention the name of Scott, and that he knew a Captain Scott, and I wan curious to know if it was the same person; he was in my father's old regiment, the Scob Greys—Grigsby said he would mention it to Howard, and afterwards told me that Howard said that Captain Scott belonged to the Bill Brigade—Grigsby showed me a letter signed J. Scott, and asked me if I knew Jack Scott, of the Scots Greys', signature—I said that I could not say—Howard was there nearly every day; he opened the letters and marked them with Greek letters—I received my instructions from him—I remember Grigsby being away three or four days to go to Leicester, and during that time Howard had the control of the office; he paid my salary once, and Grigsby on the other occasions—Grigsby had a banking account, but I can't say where—I have seen his cheque-book; I remem<lb/>ber his closing his account—he drew out 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I remember right, on the Monday alter the first remand—the daily correspondence was very large; they sent out sometimes 60, sometimes 100, and sometimes 150 letters a day—I can't say what letters came in—Howard and Grigsby sat in the same office—Howard used to bring a bag with him in the morn<lb/>ing; I can't say whether it was empty—books were kept in the office but there was no cash-book, call-book, day-book, or journal—post-office orders for 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. used to come; they were paid in to Grigsby's account—letters still came after they were arrested—I was paid off on the follow<lb/>ing Monday—I was there about three weeks—Howard said that he had been in the Diplomatic service; I think he said at Rome.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Turner's Court, St. Martin's Lane, and am a waterman—on 10th May, between 2 and 3 o'clock, my wife awoke me by saying "Bill, Bill, there is a woman in the room"—I found the prisoner in the room coming towards the door—I saw a bundle on the chair between which and the door she was; it contained my trousers, three pillow-cases, a sheet, chemise, and apron, a child's cap, and two frocks, and all wrapped up in this apron—these things belong to me—I lost two shillings out of my trousers pocket—these things had been on the line across the room drying——when we went to bed the window was shut down tight, but not secured in any way, it was open when I found the woman there—the room was on the ground floor—I detained the prisoner and called for a constable—she had my wife's shawl on when I caught her, and my wife's plaid crossover—when I heard the constable coming I said "You have got my wife's crossover on" she tore it of her shoulders and threw it on the ground—I had never seen her in our neighbourhood before—our room is in the front, a dead wall runs in front of us up the court; there is no area.</p>

The charge preferred against the defendant before the Magistrate had been under the Larceny Act (24 and 25 Vie. c. 96, sec. 88) for obtaining money by false pretences; this charge was dismissed, but the prosecutor was bound over to prosecute under the Vexatious Indictments Act.

                  </hi>. I hold a master's certificate, and have been engaged in the mercantile marine for 20 years—I have been a master for four years—in July, 1884, I had some money standing in my own name and that of my wife at the Richard Green Building Society, 56, Fenchurch Street—I replied to this advertisement. (<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that a captain was wanted immediately for a sailing vessel, but that he need not apply unless able to deposit 500l.</hi>) I got a reply, and went to Wallace's office, 15, Great St. Helens, where I saw the defendant—when I had introduced myself to him he said he was about to buy three ships, the Lady Louisa, the Cabana, and the Daylight, and asked me to go and look at them; they were lying off the jetty buoys off the London Docks—I went down the same day, and looked at the three ships all over—I came back on the same afternoon—on the next day, it would be the 10th or 11th, I told him I preferred the Lady Louisa—he said the thought the Daylight was preferable—I said "No, I prefer the Lady Louisa, the Daylight is an old ship"—an arrangement was made that I was to go and look at the inventory, which had been made out of how the ship was fitted; there were a lot of inventories on board—I took one, and went over the things, and found they were correct, and I reported that to Mr. Wallace—after that he asked me if I could not get the money—I said I could not get it for a day or two on account of the making up of the half-yearly interest, and he asked me where it was, and I told him the Richard Green Building Society—one morning I took him down there to show him where the place was—he asked me if I could not get it out—the manager and clerks there told him they were making up the half-yearly interest of the accounts—he then took me to Mr. Cummings, without saying why, to his office in Gracechurch Street—the name over the door was Barter and Co.—the prisoner told Mr. Cummings I had got money in the Richard Green Building Society, and was not able-to get it out—I believe I showed my Richard Green book, showing that 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been deposited a few years before in January or February, 1884, in the name of myself and wife—Mr. Wallace suggested I should give an order on the Richard Green, and I think he wrote this order, and I signed it: "London, 18th July, 1884. To the manager of the Richard Green Building Society. Please pay to Messrs. W. Barter and Co., or to bearer, the sum of 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with interest, the money deposited with you by Jane and J. Sinclair. J. Sinclair."

(<hi rend="italic">By this agreement J. J. Wallace and G. Hedley engaged John Sinclair to command the Lady Louisa at 16l. per months the owners paying all expenses, his wife being allowed to draw 9l. per month on account, while Sinclair was to advance 500l. by way of loan to Wallace and Hedley at 6 per cent, interest. Each party could, terminate the agreement by a month's notice in writing, when the money was to be returned to Sinclair, who had a lien on the freight as security for the 500l.</hi>) I believed when I gave Wallace the cheque that he was co owner with Hedley—I worked on board the ship previous to</p>

Lewis and Lewis, my solicitors—I saw the prisoner two days after my arrival in his office—I had received this letter from him dated 15th January at East London before I left the ship. (<hi rend="italic">This announced that he and Hedley had failed; that the Merchant Banking Company had told the ship to Mr. Thomas Rees, who had offered to give him the command of another barque, and that directly the affairs were settled he would let him take the ship back again at the price he had paid for it, when he (Sinclair) would return to his original position</hi>). The other captain held a power of attorney from the Merchant Banking Company—I have seen Rees—when I saw Wallace two days after my arrival I bade him good morning—he told me it was a bad job; I told him it was—he said he was very sorry he was not in a position to return my money then, but he would do so—I did not ask him to name a time—he asked me alter his son, and I gave him all the information I could about his son—I did not say anything about money matters because my wife had been there repeatedly for money and could not get a penny; she had drawn none of her 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I was paid my 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month in East London by the people who put in the new captain before they could discharge me—I did not see the prisoner again—I went to my solicitors and left it in their hands—I have had no 6 per cent, interest—I said nothing to Wallace about the freights being liable for my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my agents out there drew 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the freight money, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lien on the freight, and 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my wages, half-pay—I did not get my 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month besides the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the freight was inter<lb/>dicted—I first knew of Hodley being in difficulties when the letter roached me in February—I have got back no part of my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the lien on the freight and my wife's half-pay balanced one another.</p>

Barter and Co., pay to the Merchant Banking Company;" they were the mortgagees—I saw Mr. Rees; I was not introduced to him, he spoke to me the morning I saw the prisoner after I arrived—I believe he is the present owner of the Lady Louisa—the prisoner was away when Rees spoke to me—Rees said he would have another ship ready in five or six weeks, but that his class of ship would not suit me—he did not say he would try and get me command of a ship, but since then he has offered me a barquentine in Marseilles to take to the Colonies on certain condi<lb/>tions—I have never spoken since to Mr. Hodley about this matter—I have taken no proceedings against the mortgagees for my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Dealy, one of the managers of the Merchant Bank, told me he ignored the name of Wallace—I have heard it read out that Wallace's trustee in bankruptcy is claiming on behalf of the creditors that the prisoner is part owner of the Lady Louisa—according to the contract he was not—if he had shares in the other two ships he must have had of the Cubana, because one ship would not be sold without the other—I don't say Mr. Wallace ever said he was the sole owner; I knew he was not sole owner from the beginning—he said he owned half the ship, and he had put it down as halt—I knew the trustee was claiming for that amount.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-manager of the Merchant Bank<lb/>ing Company, 112, Cannon Street—we were first mortgagees of the Lady Louisa on 20th May, 1881—money was advanced from time to time on the security, and on 19th July, 1884, J. Wilson was still the mortgagor and we the mortgagees—7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due on this and other ships, including the Daylight and Cabana—we have given credit for the amount of sale of the Cubana to Wilson—she sold for 2,350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the Daylight for 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Lady Louisa for 2,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in July I sought to realise the security, and they were advertised for sale—the sale was effected on I9th July to John H. Hedley; this is a copy of the contract—he paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit on the three ships—the balance of the Daylight and Lady Louisa was paid on 30th August, 1884, and he gave a bill of sale securing the balance, and we got a mortgage from him the same day. (<hi rend="italic">The bill of sale was registered at</hi> 11.45, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 25 <hi rend="italic">minutes afterwards it appeared that the mortgage was registered.</hi>) There was not a second of time when Hedley could sell—are got a notice of Helley's bankruptcy in November or December—the first part of the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit our brokers, Bulby and Ridley, brought on signing the contract—we received it on account of Hedley—the prisoner proposed to be the purchaser before 19th July through Cummings—we declined to accept him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This cheque was drawn by Cummings—the Lady Louisa was one of the three ships—I have never seen the agreement between Hedley and Wallace regarding the purchase of these three ships—we always register the mortgage and bill of sale at the same time, there is nothing unusual in it—the Merchant Banking Company has consider<lb/>able transactions of this description—we lend money on ships to persons of the highest class—there was nothing out of the ordinary course in what we did with Hedley—at one time Hedley was the owner of the whole of the ship until she was sold again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The effect of registering the mortgage at the same time as the bill of sale would be to prevent any mortgage being put in before yours and becoming the first—the Lady Louisa was never free from our charges—we sold her to Hedley for 2,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and have got the ship as our security for his unpaid bills—we sold her to Rees for about as much as Hedley owed us—we had power to sell the ship for our money—Hedley continued as owner on 13th August, 1885, for five or six minutes, subject to the mortgage—the prisoner was never the owner to my knowledge.</p>

I received the 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque myself—the prisoner never got a penny piece out of it—it was given to us on account of the three ships, of which the Lady Louisa was one—the Merchant Banking Company are Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Brown.</hi> I gave the pieces to you back that you might take them to where you got it and get it changed—a dozen people in the bar saw me break it—a policeman came to know if any bad money had been passed, and then said that I should be wanted to identify the person if I could; he did not describe you to me—I take particular notice of any one who gives me bad money—I picked you out from seven or eight men after a week's absence; they were all strangers to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Pilgrim—I came into my bar about 11 o'clock and saw the two prisoners in conversation with my wife about this half-crown—I asked Dixon to let me see it—he was standing there drinking and did so—I said "A child could have detected that was bad; where did you get it from?"—he said him and his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> had been down Lambeth Walk purchasing some articles, and he had evidently got it there—a young man beckoned me from the outside, and made a com<lb/>munication to me—a constable came in, and the prisoners were taken.</p>

About 10.30 I was on duty in Upper Kennington Lane—a man spoke to me, in consequence of which I went in search of the prisoners—I saw them in the Pilgrim, the female sitting and the man standing—I sent a man to tell the landlord I wished to speak to him—the landlord came out—I went into the Pilgrim with the landlord and asked him in the presence of the prisoners to point out the man that passed the bad coin—the landlord pointed out Dixon—he pointed out Longman afterwards—I told Dixon I should search him, and started doing so with policeman 240—he resisted—I found on him this bad half-crown, and at the station I found sixpence and three halfpence in good money—the other constable took the female—we took them to the station—as soon as I got to the door of the Pilgrim he made a rush to get away—I had hard work to hold him—as soon as we got outside he struggled very violently—I had to force him into the public house again and send for assistance—at the station when charged he made no answer—the female</p>
