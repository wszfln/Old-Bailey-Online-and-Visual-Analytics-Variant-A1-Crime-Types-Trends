                  </hi>. I live at the Cock Tavern, Shaftesbury Avenue I am an actor, and my professional name is Edgar—I have known the prisoner for some months—I also knew another customer named Romer—I knew the prisoner as Captain Stewart, and Romer as Baron Romer—on May 20th the prisoner and Romer came to my house, and the prisoner produced this cheque for £5—it was already written, and signed "C. Romer"—the prisoner asked me to cash it for his friend the Baron—I said, "I don't do these things"—he said, "My dear boy, I would not ask you to cash anything that is not all right"—I said, "Well, if you assure me this cheque is all right, I will do it for you, Captain Stewart"—I banded him the money, he handed it all to the Baron, and. subsequently borrowed a sovereign—he asked me to have a drink—I said, "I will not have one now, I am going to have supper with my friends upstairs, and some cards"—he said, "Can't we join you?"—I said, "I don't know"—he said, "I should like to come up"—I said, "All right, come up"—we went upstairs—we had some supper, and then had some cards, in which Captain Stewart and the Baron joined—the Baron, who was winning, wanted to go, and one of my friends called him a few names, and the Baron left the room—I think it was about 2.30 a.m.—I saw the prisoner next day, and he asked me not to pay in the cheque, as the Baron was going to dishonour it—the Baron was not present then—I paid the cheque into my bank about May 24th—it was returned marked "Refer to drawer"—it was paid in again on June 12th and it was returned again</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189811210004"/>
               <p>on June 14th—my bank is the London and County Bank, Covent Garden Branch—I subsequently obtained a warrant—I have met the Baron once since with the prisoner; he made excuses—I saw the prisoner on May 26th at the Edinburgh public-house, he was then owing me the £5—he brought me another cheque for £3—signed Ball, Wild and Co.—he asked me to cash it for him to enable him to get some money released in the City which would-enable him to "square up" with me the following day—I said, "Is this cheque all right?"—he said, "I assure you it is all right"—he said he was purchasing some rifles for sale abroad, also that he was corresponding with Imre Kiralfy of the Earl's Court Exhibition—I paid that cheque into my bank at the same time as I paid in the former cheque the second time, on June 12th—it was returned in the same way—I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Saying that there was no better "brick" than himself</hi> (<hi rend="italic">witness</hi>); <hi rend="italic">that the Cock Tavern was "barred" to him on account of some exaggerated lies, and that he would bring the gold for cheque to-morrow. Asking the witness to wait till to-morrow for the</hi> £3 <hi rend="italic">cheque as he would break faith with a useful friend if his half-sheet should you in</hi>)—I received that letter a day or two after I cashed the second cheque. I also received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Saying that there was not an office open on Saturday, that he looked for great things to-morrow, and asking him not to send in the half-sheet for</hi> £3)—I then got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Saying that he (the prisoner) was a villain, and everything else but he was in the hands of others; that he had his return ticket to Brussels to bring back wealth or</hi>—)—on the back of the letter was: "Tell and assure Edgar as an old pal that his money is safe, and that if I turn out a thief you will put him right for me"—I received all those letters subsequent to May 20th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first met the prisoner about February last—between February and May 20th he came in during the evening—we were on good terms—I applied for a warrant in July or August—when they came to my house a message was not sent up to me—I was not upstairs—I was coming out of the bar and I saw the prisoner—if I had been coming downstairs I should have come out of the compartment in which I was; there is a staircase leading from it to an upper room—I was not asked to join Stewart and Romer in a drink—I did not suggest that they should join us in a game of cards—we went upstairs and had a game—Stewart did not say he had only got £2, and Romer only a few shillings; they had got my £5—Romer did not suggest I should cash the cheque—neither of these men had played cards with me before and never again—I would never trust them again—I knew Romer as well as Stewart, but Stewart was the more loquacious—Homer left the room after the row—he had not been swindled—he had all the money; Stewart had lost—from that time there was sup<lb/>posed to be a coolness between Stewart and Romer—I did not say before the magistrate that I had observed a coolness between them—the £3 cheque was presented about a week afterwards—he represented that he was engaged in an extensive deal in rifles—I know that clerks were called from the banks, but I do not know that they said both Romer and Stewart had accounts—I understood that they were both gentlemen—I had never doubted Stewart—he may have been arrested on September 16th—I did not take steps till then, because I trusted them both—</p>

               <p>Stewart showed in a foreign cable, which I believed to be genuine—I did not leave a message for him to follow me to the concert—my barmen would have said that I had gone there—I was reciting there—I do not know anything about Ball—Stewart said he would bring the money—I did not know that he was away until the. day before the warrant was issued—he was seen by my marker in Leicester Square in June.</p>

                  </hi> (323 T) I was called to Chiswick Police-station to interpret the charge against a man and woman as I speak French; they were charged with having in their possession a machine for making counterfeit coin; I interpreted the charge to them and made this note: the prisoner said, "Delbeck came to me with a solicitor and told me it was not a felony to make coin if it was made of the same quality of silver as the coins of the realm; it was only as we say in French contraband. Delbeck had some of the coins from me; I have not seen him for three weeks, he went away owing money to everybody and was heavily in my debt, about £65. I only used the coins to buy enough to live upon"—on the following day there had been a communication made to the Swiss Legation, and he said, "I came to England in April, 1897, and worked at Steven's, engineers, at Wool<lb/>wich, where I lived. On the arrival of my wife I went to Jive at 116, Arlington Road; I met Delbeck at a French restaurant, he told me I could make plenty of money in England, with the invention I had for making jewellery, Delbeck found the money for all; he changed for me, as I cannot speak English. The frame was made by Goutan, of Clerkenwell, I do not know the street. The hydraulic press was bought on the other side of the Thames, and they were brought to 2, Wellock Road, and Delbeck helped me wich the frame; he went and saw the agent, and went with four or five men to get into the house. I intended it for old French jewellery. I only used the coins to buy enough to live upon; they are 109 parts silver and 11 parts copper. Delbeck lived at 28 and 56, High Street, and did business as a maker of furniture, and told me he had been in business many yearn. I have not seen him for three weeks. He owed me £65 and 10 per cent, on our agreement"—on October 26th he said at the Police-court, "I heard statements that articles mentioned were made for the purpose of making half-crowns. I want to make a clean breast of it. I first made the plate for the purpose of making half-crowns; Delbeck on seeing it said that it would require heavy machinery to make half-crowns; I then made shillings. Delbeck said that he had a friend who knew of a metal to make sovereigns from, who persisted in making the same. I did not make any sovereigns—that statement was made voluntarily—I made a note of each at the time.</p>

I am a Doctor of Science of the University of London, and Assayer to the Royal Mint—on October 13th all these articles were shown to me—I have also seen the large jack and the casting; one plant consists of this cutting machine, which is used for cutting plates about the size of a shilling, out of silver strips similar to these cut bars if power was furnished to it by this jack—it would cut out blocks similar to these, using the press to do it—the machine is complete for stamping coin; these are the two dies—they closely resemble genuine dies—counterfeit coin is not usually made by stamps, but by casting.</p>

No heating is required by this process, they are simply stamped, but between the two cuttings they are heated to a red heat that they may take the impression of the stamp better—these tongs hold a little box in which they are heated, but they would be allowed to cool before</p>

               <p>being stamped—here are some coins which I can see were stamped from these two dies—they are made very well indeed, and ace completely finished: the material is 88 1/2 parts silver and the rest copper—the correct quantity should be 92 1/2; they contain 885 parts of silver per 1,000—there are a num<lb/>ber of blanks there which correspond with the cuttings from the small bars—these acids might be used for cleaning, and the powders for polishing—here is a crucible; there was some metal in it—all these implements consti<lb/>tute the stock in trade of a highly skilled coiner—the slot in the gauge is about the thickness of the slot from which a genuine shilling would be made—these shillings were not made at the Mint nor were the dies—there are punches and other machinery, showing that the dies were probably made on the spot—this engraving might be used for making a die, it is a head of the Queen—there are two lines on a pivot, so that the large head of the Queen may be reduced to a small one.</p>

               <p>had a man in my employ named Bronstein to attend to customers—the prisoner has been a customer for a considerable time—he came pretty well every day for tobacco which Bronstein supplied to him, and made him out invoices—there was a weekly settlement every Sunday—Bronstein made it out and Grosse came, and paid it—I have been there sometimes, and sometime my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> Zand Bronstein would open the ledger and show him that he was to pay so much—I took what Bronstein said, to be true—he kept the ledger; this is the day-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have entries here of goods sold to Grosse by Bronstein from which I have made this list; they come to £5 3s. 8d. on February 20th, and on that day there was a receipt cor<lb/>responding with them in date, but the goods do not correspond to the entries in the day-book; it is £3 11s, 5d. there, making a difference of £1 12s. 3d. between the price and the amount actually paid by Grosse—four boxes of cigarettes are entered, and only three are in the day-book—some of these are entered in the day-book, and some not at all—this is a copy of my invoice book of February 20th—these items were taken from the day-book—I cannot find the smaller one in the day-book, but the other is—I find in the invoice book a carbon duplicate invoice of goods sold on July 27th, 1898, amounting to £4 0s. 5 1/2d. in Bronstein's writing, and this is a duplicate of it—there is no receipt but the entry in the ledger of July 27th is £2 0s. 5 1/2d., as paid by Grosse on August 16th—here is a carbon duplicate, goods £3 15s. 4d. supplied to Grosse on August 15th, and the ledger entry is £2 15s. 4d. in Bronstein's writing—on August 26th the duplicate invoice is £4 12s. 11 1/2d., and the ledger entry is £3 12s. 8d, paid by Grosse—on August 29th the invoice is £3 14s. 11d., and the ledger entry £2 0s. 7d.—on August 30th the invoice entry is £3 12s. 3d., and the ledger entry £2 7s. 9d.—on Septem<lb/>ber 22nd the invoice entry is £4 17s. 11d., and the ledger entry £2 17s. 11d.—on this invoice on the depositions there is an addition of 1,000 L. S. cigarettes, which does not appear on the original—I am short, between June and September, of £20 7s. 3d.—I have not seen Bronstein since the issue of the warrant—I gave receipts to Grosse when he came on Sundays when I was there, and my mistress when, I was not there.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner sworn</hi>.) I am a tobacconist, of 195, Shaftesbury Avenue—I was a Russian subject; I came to England in 1894, and was first employed as a waiter at a restaurant in Church Lane four months—I afterwards travelled in the perfumery and tobacco line, and two years ago I was appointed hon-secretary of the Master Hair<lb/>dressers Association—I have had my present business since May—up to Easter I paid the prosecutor cash on delivery, but after I went into my new premises I paid him a weekly account on Sundays—I did not always receive an invoice with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189811210016"/>
               <p>goods when I got them, and when I did not I made a note on a sheet of paper—when I paid on Sundays the statement which I have produced to-day was shown to me, sometimes by the prosecutor and some<lb/>times by Bronstein—when I got the statement I took out my sheet of paper and compared it to see whether it was right or not, and sometimes he had forgotten something—if it was correct I paid it, and if it was incorrect I corrected it and paid the amount, always to the prosecutor or his wife—he entered it in the book—I did not get a receipt for all; there was not always time—these are two of the receipts; and here are some others which I received in the same way—he wrote something in the ledger when he was there, and when he was not Bronstein wrote it—I did not always compare the goods I received with the invoice, and sometimes I got goods without getting an invoice at all, and it was not delivered the next day when I went—every invoice I have given to the police was not given to me with the goods; sometimes they were given me when I came the next time, either to me or to my messenger, and in that case I compared them with the goods—on one occasion, on a Friday, I called the prisoner's attention to some Woodbines and Cinderellas, he produced the amount £3 12s. less and I told him of it; that was the largest amount, and there were other occasions, over a dozen—they would amount to over £30—on October 2nd I had an invoice and asked him the amount, he said £17 odd; I took out my book and it was £18 odd, I told him, and he went to the book and found that it was so and I paid him—the prisoner said that it was quite right at 18 and not 17, and he got pen and ink and aloe red it himself—I am clear that some of the sums entered when Bronstein was not there were entered by the prosecutor himself—I never got money or goods through Bronstein fraudulently—I knew him as the prosecutor's servant—he visited my shop when I was married on September 14th, but on no other occasion—he said on that occasion, "They have taken out a warrant against you for attempting to defraud the prosecutor"—I said, "How do you know?" he said that Mr. Frank the brother-in-law of the prosecutor's wife had been to his place and told him as a friend that my brother-in-law had taken out a warrant against him and me, and it was all through the spite of my mother-in-law and the mother of my wretched sister-in-law—I did not believe that a warrant was out—he went away, and did not tell me where he was going or where he intended to go—that was about nine o'clock—after that I had a visit from Mr. Grovich, and a form came about ten minutes afterwards—I was in the shop, attending to my business; I keep it open on Saturdays—my relations with Mrs. Goldstein are not friendly—before I married my wife she was earning wages and keeping her mother, Mrs. Goldstein—I got a present from her on my wedding; it was a piece of string, to hang myself; a piece of soap, to prepare me for burial, and a piece of black cloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Bronstein about three years since I went to the prosecutor's shop—I have been there almost daily from May 31st, except on Saturdays, and saw him on almost every occasion, but never away from the shop, except when he was a guest at my marriage, or when I accidentally met him in the street in the daytime, never at night; we spoke on those occasions—I was not more</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189811210017"/>
               <p>friendly with him than with others—he came to me about 9.30 on October 8th to tell me about this change—that was the first I heard of it—when the officer came Bronstein had been there between 9 and 9.30 that very morning; when the officer asked me if Bronstein was in the house I said, "No, he has not been here; I have not seen him"—he had not said that he was an officer—I afterwards said that Bronstein had been there about 9.30—I did not say, "This is what your mother-in-law does for you," I said that I had heard about it through Bronsttin, and it was all through my mother-in-law—I said, "I have heard all about it, I expected this"—I did not say, "I have good Counsel"—Bronstein is the only person who told me that my mother-in-law had been making an accusation against him and me; she told me that morning—I did not believe that any charge was made—I do not know what has become of Bronstein; he did not say what he was going to do—I never asked him whether he was going back to his service—I did not ask him if he had done anything wrong—I said that I could not make it out—this document had been in a trunk—the officer asked me if I had any documents, and I took out the black bag, and took out all my invoices—this in the only one of the prosecutor's invoices taken out of the bag—I held it in my hand, and said that it was the prosecutor's invoice—I was not about to put it away—I did not say, "That is nothing"—I deny what the officer has stated—before I took possession of the shop I lived in a private lodging, and all my documents had been kept in that black bag, and all my private letters have been kept separate—it does not belong to the shop which I opened on May 31st—I recognise it as a receipt signed-by Bronstein for £3 11s. 9d.—the account is in his writing, but not the word "Paid"—it is the fact that under the date of February 20th I had been supplied with a quantity of goods from the prosecutor's shop—the total amount of goods supplied to me did not amount to £5 3s. 8d—the sum I paid was £3 11s. 5d.—on July 27th, 1898, the sum I paid the prosecutor for goods supplied was £2 0s. 5 1/2d; that is quite clear—the invoice I myself supplied shows a delivery on that day of goods, value £4 0s, 5 1/2d.—I kept the invoice and handed it to the officer—I have not handed the receipt to the officer—I have not paid the difference of £2 between those two docu<lb/>ments—Bronstein was generally present on Sunday when I went to pay, but not always—he would show me the amounts—I have got no document showing that any goods were returned—I always had the invoice of the goods of August 26th in my possession till I delivered it to the officer—be<lb/>tween September 29th and October 2nd I saw Bronstein at the prosecu<lb/>tor's shop, but nowhere else; I did not hear between those dates what my mother-in-law charged me with—it was not after my mother-in-law had told Mrs. Grovich that I went to the prosecutor's shop for the first time and told him that I was £1 short—I made the payment three days after the conversation—when I said, "I heard of it, I expected this," that had no reference to my mother-in-law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prosecutor was also a guest at my wedding—Bronstein came into my shop when I opened it, but not into the private house—there are six items in this statement, and the invoice produced to me only relates to one of them—I am asked to point out from that invoice the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the housekeeper for Mr. Lawrence, pawn<lb/>broker, 386, Hornsey Road—about 3 a.m. on October 31st I was woke up by a slight noise at my bedroom window, which I had fastened before going to bed, and which looks on to waste ground at the back—I lay a minute or two and watched the blind, which moved—I heard again a noise at the window—I got out of bed and palled up the blind—then I saw my window was open at the bottom—I looked out and saw a ladder that did not belong to us at the end of the yard—I locked my bedroom door and went downstairs to the front door and spoke to a man who was passing—the police came—I went to the police-station at 6 a.m.</p>

About 3 a.m. on October 31st I was on duty in the Hornsey Road in plain clothes—I watched the prisoners who were loitering—I knew Long kept a shop in the Hornsey Road, and I have seen Marlow there—I saw them enter a gateway adjoining 384, Hornsey Road—I was on the opposite side about forty feet away—the pawnbroker's shop is 386—I kept observation at the rear of the premises in Pine Grove—I saw them leave the rear of 384 and hurriedly walk away—I was standing at the bottom of Gladstone Street and Pine Grove in the middle of the road—they came over the wall of the old brewery of Lovibond's, which is now untenanted—I followed them across Tollington Park to Burnham Road, a continuation of Pine Grove—I ran to catch them—they turned and saw me and commenced to run—I gave chase and blew my whistle—I followed through Moray Road into Durham Road where they separated, Marlow ran through Bedford Terrace and Long through Hatley Road—I followed Long who was stopped by P.C.

He states you were with him last night"—he said. "I can prove you saw me in bed"—he was taken to the station and identified by the prosecutor—Jacobs was brought from the cell and said in Nathan's presence "Abraham Nathan was in the house with me when I was caught at Fasham Street, and another man who is not here, named like"—Nathan turned to me and said, "You saw me in bed"—the distance between the two places is about two miles.</p>

I met a man I knew. He was better dressed than usual and wearing a mackintosh. I said, 'Halloa, you look all right this morning, what is up?' He said, 'I have sold some goods in Mansell Street, I am going to get £6 for them'—I went to 96, Mansell Street and saw they were Jankowitz's goods. I said to Cohen and Arbied, though he did not men<lb/>tion the names, 'These goods are stolen.' I left a friend to watch the house—afterwards he gave a description of the man he met in Aldgate and I asked about the friend he left to watch—he said he did not know they had gone away—I then went with Jankowitz and Barrowitz to 96, Mansell Street, which is a very large house let out to different families—the prisoner Cohen occupies two rooms on the ground floor—the front room is used by him, apparently as a jobbing shoemaker, and as a. living room, as there was food on the table, and the back room as a bed-room—I saw Arbied in the bed-room and Cohen came in—I saw on the bed eighteen ladies' capes, of which some are here, and twelve suits of men's clothes, all apparently new, some with labels on—Arbied handed me this receipt and said, "My father bought the goods of a man this morning, whom I know by sight, but I do not know where he lives, but I should know him again"—Arbied occupies a room with his wife on the second floor—Cohen said, "Yes; the man said he wanted some money, and I bought the goods. He brought them this morning in a large canvas<lb/>bag on a barrow"—from something said to me by another officer, I went to 95, Mansell Street, where Mrs. Lyons handed me three suits of clothes, which were lying on her counter and which she said had been left for her husband—her son Henry crossed the road with me—I placed them with other goods, and they were identified by Mr. Jankowitz as a portion of his property—Mrs. Lyon's son pointed out Arbied as the man who had left them at the shop for his father's purchase—Arbied said, "Quite</p>

As I could not give him the £2 he said he would put us away"—Barrowitz said, "You are a b—liar," and was about to strike Arbied, but I interfered—Cohen and Arbied were taken to Bishopsgate Street Police-station—Barrowitz came on and they were charged—in answer to the charge Cohen said, "I paid a man £15 in gold this morning for the goods"—Arbied said, "That big chap wanted £6 for his share," meaning Barrowitz who was in the charge room—at the house after they were arrested Arbied first mentioned £6—Cohen said, "He has got a receipt for £6 (I take it he meant Barrowitz, and that he had to call for £6 on an I.O.U), is not that good enough for him?"—Barrowitz made no reply—when he spoke it was in English—Cohen was excited and kept on talking—the next morning, at the Guildhall Police-court, from what had transpired between Walker and me, and from in<lb/>quiries, I arrested Barrowitz—I took him to Bishopsgate Street Police-station—he was charged with being concerned with others in breaking and entering these premises—he said, "I have been mistaken for a man named Peter"—Walker was present, and was certain he had made no mis<lb/>take, and said, "I saw you with the barrow; you very nearly," or "You ran up against me and I spoke to you. The man with you dropped a cigarette case, and I spoke to him, and again I saw you in Stoney Lane by the entrance to the yard that runs between the model dwellings," and that is the way to Mansell Street—I detained him at the station and gave him an opportunity to tell the detectives where to find Peter—he gave two addresses, but we failed to find such a man—(<hi rend="italic">a brown jacket was now produced at Barrowitz's request</hi>)—this brown jacket was brought to the station after Barrowitz's arrest by an officer from 5, Albert Street,—no importance was attached to it, and it is too small for Barrowitz who did not ask for it—Barrowitz when I first saw him had the coat on he has now—he gave me a description of Peter, who he said was exactly like him and might easily be mistaken; that he was a big fellow like him, but pale, and more dark round the eyes; but from the woman I inquired of, the supposed Peter is very different to Barrowitz—I took possession of the goods and some are produced here—four capes are missing from the things stolen; eighteen were found at Cohen's address.</p>

I go to work at 5 o'clock, but this morning I was to go to 83, Bishopsgate Street, and waited to be called a little after 10, but the detectives came and I told them, "I have not much time as I have to do a job to-day"—that was before 12—I gave Peter back the pawn ticket the same Wednesday evening—Peter led me into all this trouble—I did not know then he was concerned—when I knew he was the man, I sent the detectives to get him—I tried to find him many a time—at that time Peter was living in my house—the detectives found Peter's coat in my room—the three lived in that room one night—I was charged with stealing on Tuesday afternoon—I went out on bail on Saturday—I did not know where Peter went to—I went to many places to look for him—the detectives did not do what I told them, and Peter was down below—I heard he went away without a jacket—Lima told me the goods were stolen from Joseph and Jankowitz—he lives at a restaurant in Whitechapel—I have not seen him since this charge was made—I have tried to find him, and I offered 10s. to find him—I did not ask for £6; I came in with the other fellow—Cohen said, "I gave £6, if he gives me another pound he can have the goods back.</p>

This lady has lost a purse; she was sitting next to her"—the prisoner mumbled something, I cannot say what—the policeman asked if the pro<lb/>secutrix would charge her—she replied "I am only the wife of a working man, I shall have to leave and I cannot charge her"—I said, "Come along if you cannot.

               <p>whether anyone was required—that was the day I arrived—I first saw the prisoner about 7 the same evening, when these men conducted me to an office where the prisoner was writing—a third man dictated to the prisoner an agreement with me for a situation—I then handed over to the chief of this office the certificate of the Russian railway shares, value 2,000 marks of 2,500 francs, as security for moneys I might have to collect in this situation of steward, which I was to have on a steamer—I was to superintend everything and to have the key of cellar—then the head clerk sent the prisoner to ask the master whether that would be sufficient security—the prisoner went out and after a short while returned and said it was not sufficient—I then handed him four 100-franc banknotes—then he sent the prisoner again to inquire whether that would be enough—he came back and said, "Yes"—then I signed an agreement—there was an agreement first made out, but they asked me to sign another—then the three Frenchmen, the accused, and I went to supper the prisoner slept in the same bed that night in a room the two Frenchmen I had first met had taken for me—the next morning the head clerk handed us each 5s. for the expenses of the day—the next few days the prisoner and I walked about London—the head clerk had given the prisoner a slip of paper, upon which I supposed he had some com<lb/>mission—I remained in the same room four days, but the accused re<lb/>mained on after I had left—then the men took another room for me at another house—the first house was 65, Cumberland Street, and the second at 8, Colchester Street—the prisoner had seen the information about me in the office, and I had shown his what money I had still left—I had the receipts from the bank with me, of the money I deposited at the bank at Thionville, which is thirty kilometers from Metz—the prisoner told me have my money sent over here—he said I could be in a position to buy tobacco in Belgium and to resell it here much dearer, as he, the prisoner, had already in this way gained 7,000 francs—I said, "No," I would not have my money come very here, and I would not meddle with smuggling—the next Sunday the manager of the office, in the prisoner's presence, said to me in German that as I knew German as well I should have a better situation, where I could earn more, but that I should have to give double security, not less than 6,000 francs, as purser on the steamship "Aurania," of the Conrad Line—I agreed to the suggestion—then the manager told me I must let my money come over here, and instructed the prisoner and another man to go with me to find out how the money could be remitted—the next day the prisoner, I, and another man went at the Credit Lyonnais where one of the employes said, in the prisoner's presence, he was not sure whether the money could he had over here—the prisoner suggested that a telegram should be sent, and ultimately 2,290 marks were remitted, which allowing for the difference in exchange, is about £108—it was in two receipts—I signed this paper—(<hi rend="italic">An authority to Henry Glenard to cash the remainder of the wilness's deposit at Thionville</hi>)—we sent a telegram, and a reply came that I should have to write first—then the prisoner dictated a letter which I wrote at once—after getting the money I went back to my room and the manager, the prisoner, and another man attended—we entered into this</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Credit Lyonnais, Lombard Street—the first interview with the prosecutor and the prisoner was on September 26th—another man showed me two deposit receipts at the bank at Chauvin, and asked me whether we would collect them—they were for 1,000 and 1,290 marks respectively—I was not sure, as they were not then due, but they said they would send a telegram to the banker at Chauvin to know whether he would pay them at once, so I drew up a wire, and they said they would send it—in the evening or early the next day they came back with a wire from the bank at Chauvin to say they would consent to those deposits being paid—I identified Mathieu as the lawful holder of the receipts and was satisfied, and claimed one sovereign for expenses, and we sent the receipts to Chauvin—on October 8th we had a wire from our correspondent abroad that they had been paid—the prisoner came with Mathieu, and I think another one, but as we had no final statement and there was interest, I only paid 2,200 marks, that is, in English,£107 8s. 4d., to Mathieu, who came nearly every day and enquired—Mathieu said he would not be able to call for the balance and that the prisoner would call, so I drew up this procreation for Mathieu to sign, authorising the prisoner to call for the balance—on Wednesday, October 13th, Mathieu came before business hours, about 9.45 a.m.—a conversation took place, and I paid him the balance,£5 18s. 6d.—an hour afterwards the prisoner came and claimed the balance—I recognised him, and told him to wait, as we were looking after his affair, and tried to telephone to Scotland Yard, but could get no communication—after half an hour, as we could not keep him waiting longer without reason, I told the prisoner that the affair was not quite settled yet and that he should call in the afternoon—as soon as he was gone I went with one of the assistant-managers to the Old Jewry and communicated the circumstances, with the result that two detectives watched our place—the prisoner did not come till Saturday, when the detectives were drawn off-when he came I sent to the Old Jewry, and on instructions from the officers, let the prisoner go, and he went out—I told him that Mathieu had been in, and he could not believe it—I showed him the receipt Mathieu had given—I heard afterwards the prisoner had been arrested in the street.</p>

I live at 200, Barking Road and am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on October 27th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the body of this child—I was helped in it by my assistant—the child was eight months old—there was no sign of disease on it apart from what it died of—it was not a robust child, but it ap<lb/>peared healthy—the normal weight of a child of this age is about 16 lbs.—this child weighed a little over 7 lbs.—the death was caused by inflam<lb/>mation of the lungs—there were signs of chronic inflammation of the intestines—it would possibly be brought on by diarrhoea neglected—if a child was suffering from diarrhoea on September 20th, and still had it three weeks later, it would cause it to be very weak: it would tend to produce pneumonia—most forms of diarrhoea yield to treatment—arrow<lb/>root and barley are good as far as they go, but it was not sufficient—if I had been called in on September 20th I think very probably the child would not have had pneumonia, and its life might have been prolonged—to the best of my belief, if it had not had pneumonia it would not have died—the contents of the stomach showed that it had not been able to digest the food it had had—diarrhoea yields to treatment—if I had been called in early in September pneumonia might have been prevented—there are certain regular modes of treatment which might have prolonged life.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">could be no doubt that what the prisoner did in withholding medical aid and medicine was deliberately, and, therefore, wilfully done. It was for them to say whether such conduct, though done from a motive which is not impugned, amounted to neglect of the child so as seriously to injure its health. Neglect, he said, is not a word of art. It is an ordinary word of the English language, and he could give them no further direction as to what its mean<lb/>ing is in the statute. In order to come to the conclusion that there had been neglect they must be of opinion that medical aid and medicine were reasonably necessary for the child's preservation, and within the prisoner's means.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of Hampton Wick—on October 22nd, between 1 and 2 a.m., I was in Deptford Broadway—I stopped at a coffee stall—I saw five men there—the three prisoners were among them—I called for a cup of coffee and one of the men said to me, "We are hard up and on the road; would you kindly give us something to eat?"—I did so—it amounted to 5d. I gave the old coffee-stall keeper 6d. and he gave me 1d. back—Keefe then said to me, "There is a nice little girl across the other side of the street"—I said, "No, I don't want anything"—he said, "Come along"—I said, "All right," and I went across the street—Keefe said, "Come along this way"—we went about fifty yards when the other two prisoners came up and said, "What about the girl"—I said, "What girl? I know nothing about a girl"—Keefe said "These are two unfortunate fellows from America; they are very hard up, if you give them a dollar I will too"—I said, "No, I will not," upon which one of them struck me on my eye—it completely blocked my eye up—they all struck me, one of them hitting me on the cheekbone</p>

               <p>which I can feel now—I fell to the ground, and was covered with mud—they went through my pockets, stealing about 15s. and a key—they then kicked me and ran away—I got up and shouted for the police—a police<lb/>man came up and I went with him to the station—on the way I saw Keefe and gave him in charge—I had no difficulty in recognizing him—I was afterwards called to the station and identified Cain from among several other men—afterwards I identified Sheehan.</p>

Granger to Virginia Water Station the same evening, about 8—I saw the prisoner on the platform with Mr. Smith, the station-master—I identified him as the man who assaulted me in the train, and the constable asked me if I would charge him, which I did—I said, "That is the man"—the prisoner laughed and said he never saw me before—I said, "You are the man that tried to strangle me in the train"—I said his was a similar ticket to that I bought—this is the handker<lb/>chief</p>

Mile End Road—the deceased John Paterson was my brother, he was my partner in two rifle ranges, one in Newington Butts and the other in Mile End Road—my brother chiefly attended to the one in Newington Butts—for about two years and a half the prisoner was an attendant at both ranges—rifles were kept in each range for use and some for sale—Mr. Kaminski, one of my tenants, had a room over the shop in Mile End Road as a bootmaker—about August 13th he complained about missing some boots from his premises, and a man named Ellis was taken into custody and charged with stealing them—about the 16th, in consequence of information I spoke to the prisoner and charged him with being concerned with Ellis in the robbery—he was taken to Bow Street and let out on his own recognisance—a day or two after that he came to see me at Mile End and wanted to know what I was going to do in the matter—after a lot of talking he said, "I will have you all shot if you don't put an end to this matter," or words to that effect—after that, I think on August 31st, both the prisoner and Ellis were at the Police-court and were discharged; after that the boots were brought back—a day or so after his discharge the prisoner came to us again at Mile End and wished to be taken on again—I said I could not do it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a keeper to Mr. Longman of Fair Lawn, Wood<lb/>minster—on November 2nd, about quarter to three in the morning, I was on Mr. Woods' ground, he is a farmer and has part of Mr. Longman's shooting—Mr. Hill, an independent gentleman, was with me—he is not connected with the estate, he came here for the purpose of catching moths—while we were there I heard some shots fired in the direction of Mr. and Lady Lambert's Wood—on coming to Croydon Lane Mr. Hill went up the lane and I went on the left side of the wood—the wood is surrounded by a fence, I noticed that some of the barbed wire was broken down at the corner—after speaking to Mr. Hill we went down to the back of the wood, I looked over the fence and saw Shepherd and another man—It was a bright moonlight night—I did not at first see that it was Shepherd, I saw there were two men standing there—after a while Shepherd put his gun to his shoulder and shot a hen pheasant in a tree, the bird fell and the other man went and picked it up—I then made a noise by scuffling in the hedge with my feet—I had seen a third man in the wood—after the noise I made with my feet Shepherd walked towards me—he came within a few yards of me and I called out to Mr. Hill, "Look out, it's Bill Shepherd"—I called that out very loudly—Shepherd must hive heard me, he then ran away—I jumped over the fence and ran after him for about twenty yards in the wood—he then deliberately turned round and fired at me—he was fine between thirty and forty yards from me—I saw him turn round for the purpose—I dropped on my knee—one of the shots went through the point of my collar, some went in the upper part of my face, and some in different parts of my body—thin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the collar I was wearing—the shots in my face were on the left side of my cheek—the marks are gone now—I put my hand up to my face, and found there was blood on my face—some of the shots struck me along the arm and in the face—there had been no blood on my face before—I had not scratched myself in the wood—I did not see anymore of the prisoner, he got away—I did not see where the others went—I went on to the coachman's place—he and I searched the wood, but did not find anyone—I afterwards went to my brother's, and then to Banstead Station, where I saw the prisoner and identified him—I have no doubt he is the man that fired at me—I could see him quite plainly—I had known him for sixteen years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am twenty-four years old—I met Mr. Hill on this night about 10 or 10.30—we were out in the woods together—we heard shots before three, but not on our ground—it was just alter three when I heard shots on our ground—I did not see the reports in the papers of the examination before the Magistrate—I could not say how the third man was dressed—I could not say what the second man did with the pheasant when he picked it up—I recognised the prisoner when he came towards me and was within ten yards of me—that was before he tired at me—I made the noise with my feet to draw the attention of the men, not to frighten them away—I and Mr. Hill were to other searching for the poachers—I said to Mr. Hill, "It is Bill Shepherd"—Mr. Hill knew him by sight—he had not so good an opportunity of seeing him as</p>

               <p>I had—lie was between 20 and 30 yards from me when he tamed and tired at me—I had to jump a fence and he went on, leaving me behind—I heard three shots: one at the pheasant, one at me, and one on the right-hand side of me when I was running after Shepherd—I don't think I men<lb/>tioned that third shot before the Magistrate, for this reason: I did not know where that was fired from and I did not see who fired it—I heard Mr. Hill examined before the Magistrate—he said he heard the shot whistle over his head—that was the shot that was fired at me—I could not say which of the men Mr. Hill chased—he was over the fence; I was insider—two of the men ran in the same direction—I could not say where they went—I had several marks on my face when I was before the Magistrate—they were not caused by the boughs of the trees—I did not know there was blood at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. At the time the shot was fired at me Mr. Hill was behind me and on lower ground—some of the shots might have gone over his head—I next day examined the trees close by where the shot was fired at me—my brother and a mate, Willis, were with me—I found some of the ivy out through and marks of shot on the trees about five feet from the ground—there had not been a lot of poaching going on there—there were some feathers lying about—there had been no shooting in the wood that night before this—no reward had been offered for catching the poachers—I had no quarrel with the prisoner, except for an assault about a year and ten months ago—I don't know that he had a license for carrying a gun; I believe he had—he had no right of shooting, nor had his father, not within a mile and a half of our woods—I have had no quarrel with him about shooting over his own ground—I have no spite against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an independent gentle<lb/>man, and live at Myrtle Yale, Carshalton—I am a collector of moths, and for that purpose I go out early in the morning—on the morning in question I went out with the last witness—while talking to him I heard the report of a gun, about Banutead way—in consequence of that we proceeded together in that direction—I came up to where the barbed wire was broken—I walked with Gross to about the centre of the wood, and there he called out—there is a fence round the wood—I was close to the outside—I was a very short distance from Cross when he called out—there are two fences round the wood, a hazel fence and a wooden one—I was outside the hazel fence that separated us two—I was not more than two yards from Gross, only a few feet, and we were nearly on the same level—just before he called out I saw a man, but was not able to recognise him—Cross then went through the fence, and then I saw a second man—I was not able to recognise him—he was between 20 and 30 yards from me I should think—it was then that Gross called out, "It is Shepherd"—I think he said, "Bill Shepherd"—he called it out in a loud voice—Cross then got over the rail and the man he said was Shepherd ran up the drive in the wood—I saw the second man go through the wood—I heard a shot fired; I heard it as I ran along to the bottom of the wood—the shot was fired by the second man; the one that ran up the driver—he was directly opposite to me—that was the man that Gross was pursuing—the shot passed through the bushes directly over my head—I ran after the second man, but did not catch him—I slipped and fell—as I was</p>

               <p>running I heard a second shot—I went to the other side of the wood, and there met Cross—he spoke to me, and we went to call up Mr. Lambert's man, and searched the wood—we found no one—later on we went to Ban<lb/>stead Police-station—I then noticed Cross's face—it was bleeding at the side—I am not quite sure as to what time that was, I think it was about six—it was a beautiful moonlight night—I should think the moon was just past the full—the wood is not a very thick one—it is nearly all fir<lb/>trees—any one standing outside the fence could see into the interior of the wood.</p>
