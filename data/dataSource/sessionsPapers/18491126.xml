On 12th June last I went to Mortlake with Mr. Jones's clerk, and the messenger of bankruptcy, to see Bishop—at that time Hopkins had made some statement to the assignees—we told Bishop that we had received information that Park-farm was bought with Swan the bankrupt's money, and requested him to give possession of it to the messenger, who was there with his warrant of seizure—he made no reply—I put the question again, he still continued silent—I handed him the warrant, and told him that the assignees having received that information, it was their duty to come and take possession of the property, and he had better give it up quietly—he made no reply—I said, "You had better look at the warrant of seizure, and see the nature of it"—he took it, and read it through very slowly—he was long enough to read it twice through—I put my hand on it, and said, "You have seen enough of it now," and handed it to the messenger—he said, "I have no property belonging to Swan; this is all my property here, and I defy Swan or anybody else to take it away from me"—I again requested him to deliver it up, and told him if he would act honestly, the assignees would remunerate him, and he should have the benefit of the poundage which would be allowed, if he would do his best to assist the assignees—the messenger repeated the same thing, in other words—I said, "But has not the bankrupt advanced you the money to buy it?"—he said, "Whatever has passed between the bankrupt and me has nothing to do with the property here."</p>

On Saturday, 22d Sept., I went to Jones's lodgings—I found a waistcoat with marks of white lead on it; I found marks of white lead on the street-door and on the banisters, they appeared to have been made by the hand in running up and down stairs—I went to his house between ten and eleven o'clock; he was not at home—I apprehended him about six that evening, in Aldgate—when he saw me he ran away—when I told him what he was charged with, he made no reply—I went the same evening to Vandenberg's shop, in Rosemary-lane—he was in the shop—he asked me what I wanted—I said, "I want you for one thing, and I want that white lead beside, that has been brought in here"—he said, "What white lead do you mean?"—I said, "You know all about it: I mean that white lead brought here this morning or last night, one of the two"—he said, "O! here it is," taking a piece of wood off the top of it—it was standing behind the weighing-machine in the shop—it was in this cask—you could not see where it was without its being pointed out—there was some old bag<lb/>ging or matting placed up in front of it—Vandenberg said he had been looking after Sergeant Kelly—he said he had been to the station-house for him, and been inquiring in the neighbourhood for him—he said he had been all day looking for the police—I know the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane; there are policemen on the beat there—I saw one or two policemen in the course of the day—Vandenberg asked if I was going to take him as a witness; and he said, two or three times, "Can't you take me as a witness?"—I said, "No, I take you as a receiver"—I took him to Leman-street station—there was a large piece of wood on the cask when he showed it to me—this head of the cask came from the painter's shop at the prosecutors—when Vandenberg was at the station he said he gave a man (6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, but he did not mean to buy it—I left him in the station, and I went back to his house with Foay and made a further search—we found three or four putty-knives, some bell-pulls, and new brass articles; and thirteen screws were found by Foay, under the counter—a party named Lloyd owned some of the articles.</p>

On Friday evening, 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Oct., I was out with a van, delivering parcels—I stopped at Silsey's, in Watling-street, to deliver a bale of goods, and left a lad in the van to mind it—the horse's head was turned towards St. Paul's-churchyard, and we were on the opposite side of the road to Silsey's—I returned in about two minutes, and missed the box—I then drove the van on to the first cab-stand in St. Paul's-church-yard, and saw two persons, the prisoner and another, in the act of getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with the box in their possession—I jumped down off the box of the van, and said, "That is my box," and with that both the persons ran away—I pursued the prisoner, and gave him into custody—at the time I claimed the box they were both in the act of getting into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the box was in the prisoner's hand.</p>

               <hi rend="smallCaps">PATTESON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">The indictment charged that the Corporation of the Trinity House were in the habit of examining persons, voluntarily submitting to such examination touching their nautical skill, and granting them certificates to act as masters; and then proceeded to charge, that in order to enable persons to be examined and procure such certificates, it was necessary to produce to the examiners' certificates of service, sobriety, and good conduct at sea, for not less than six years; and then the charge against the defendant was, that he, not regarding his duty, had forged certificates of this description for the purpose of inducing the examiners to pass him, and that the Trinity House might suppose he was a qualified person from his nautical skill and fitness, and from his general character, to act as a master. It is a very important duty which the Trinity House have to discharge; important to owners of property of this description, and important to the lives of those entrusted to their care; and if insufficient seamen, or</hi>

The importance therefore of examining masters of ships, to see that they are fit persons to do their duty, must be important to every one. The defendant was charged in the 7th and 9th Counts, to which alone the attention of the Judges on the reserved case-seems to have been peculiarly directed, with a forgery at common law, in forging the certificates which induced the Trinity House to grant him their fiat for acting as a master. My brother</hi> 
               <hi rend="smallCaps">PATTESON</hi>, <hi rend="italic">when the party pleaded guilty, entertained some doubt whether this amounted to the misdemeanour of a forgery at common law, and reserved the matter for the opinion of the Judges, The question was discussed before the tribunal now constituted for the purpose; they took the case into their consideration, and they are of opinion, and they instruct me to say so, that the 7th and 9th Counts of this indictment are quite sufficient to found a judgment upon, and that it does amount to a forgery at common law. Indeed, it does amount to a very serious offence, if persons do forge certificates of this sort, and are found to utter them for the purpose of deceiving the Trinity House; and I hope the Trinity House in future will act upon this judgment, and will in the exercise of their duty see and punish with great severity those persons who shall be guilty of so serious an offence. I am quite sure that it is for the interest of the public that they should exercise a very rigid superintendence of this kind. Upon the 7th and 9th Counts therefore, when the party who is at present out, is taken, judgment will be pronounced, meanwhile the judgment may be entered on these two Counts,"</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Messrs. Currie's bank<lb/>ing-house, 29, Cornhill, in the parish of St. Michael. Mr. Isaac George Currie is one partner, and there are others—the prisoner has been in their employment upwards of eight years—in Oct. last, he was one of the cashiers, and it was his duty to receive and pay money at the counter—it would be his duty to enter in this receive cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) any cash he received from the customers on account of the banking-house—there is this entry on 17th Oct. in the prisoner's writing, purporting to be an entry of a payment into the bank on account of Mr. Daniel Elley: "1341<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. drafts;" "110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Bank," which means Bank of England; "462<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Maidlow,"that indicates Maidlow's draft on Currie's; "75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. S.N.," which means small notes;" 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Brown, G.L.;" "G.L." means General List, and "Brown" means an article put on that list in that name; it amounts to 2060<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that amount would be posted to the credit of Mr. Elley—supposing the prisoner to have received 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes on that day as part of that payment, he would have to take either the numbers down separately, or make a parcel, the same as he has done with the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. small notes; small notes mean of any value under 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—each note under 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the clerk enters as a small note—it is not necessary to enter the numbers or dates of them—it would be the clerk's duty to fold them up, and write on the outer one the name of the party from whom he received them, and put them into a box for another clerk to enter the whole—these notes amount to 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—there is "75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Elley" endorsed on this note, No. 07428, in the prisoner's writing—that indicates that all the notes were received from Elley, and it agrees with the 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. small notes in the prisoner's receive cash-book—"Brown, G.L.," means a security on a person of the name of Brown, which is to go to the general list of unpaid bills to be sent into the country—supposing the prisoner to have received it as he states, it would be his duty to take it to a clerk in the country office, to send it into the country, and he ought also to make a memorandum of the security, and place it in a drawer for that purpose—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in the prisoner's writing—I cannot speak to the date; that varies from his general writing, but the other part is his (<hi rend="italic">read, Oct.</hi> 18th, 1849<hi rend="italic">, Brown, Leeds</hi>, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—I am quite sure the "Brown,</p>

                  </hi>: "I <hi rend="italic">think we ought to reserve it, because it is an im<lb/>portant point. My own impression undoubtedly at present is, that the statement is receivable; because I cannot hip thinking that the meaning of the Act of Parliament is, that the Magistrate shall, after the examination of all the wit<lb/>nesses for the prosecution, and having it read over in due course to the prisoner, then call on him to make such statement as he may be advised, giving him, as I should say, the two cautions which are contained in the</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th section. If a Magistrate acts so, then he gets rid of all the difficulty which may arise out of any previous threat or promise by any other person, however much authorised that person may be to make such a threat or promise. If a prosecutor has promised a man that if he would confess, he should be let off scot-free, still, if a Magistrate, when the prisoner is brought before him, and after the exami<lb/>nation</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">of the witnesses against him has been taken, tells him that he is not bound to make any statement, hut that what he says will he taken down, and received in evidence against him, and that he has nothing to hope from any promise of favour, and nothing to fear from any threat held out to him before, to induce him to make the confession; after the Magistrate has done all that, he has removed the effect of any previous promise or threat, and the man is then to be taken in point of law to be a free man, not bound to say more than he pleases; but whatever he does say, notwithstanding any previous threat or promise, may be received against him. That was not the case formerly, because where a promise or threat was previously made by a person authorised to make it, then the statement before the Magistrate was not received, but it is now. And further, after caution given and statement made, it is receivable, and receivable without any further proof than the mere transmission of it by the Magis<lb/>trate, without any proof being given that it was said by the prisoner, but only that the Magistrate says it was said by the prisoner the Act of Parlia<lb/>ment then says it shall be receivable in evidence, and have its effect. But I think it meant no more; and it left full liberty to parties to prove in a lawful way, as they might have proved before, any statement or confession made by the prisoner at any time; before the Magistrate, or at any other time—here they propose to prove it in a regular way, by a gentleman who heard what he said at the time, and took it down in writing, and who tells us that no promise or threat was made. I am therefore of opinion, under these circumstances, that the statement is receivable."</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi>: "<hi rend="italic">I concur in thinking it receivable. At the same time I can see it is open to doubt, which I think ought to be considered by the Judges. In the first place, a man making a statement under this Act of Parlia<lb/>ment, has the security provided by the Act, that it is to be recorded by the Ma<lb/>gistrate, and that that record will be the only evidence, and that nothing will be proved that is not in that record. It is obvious if this statement is to be received, although it was written down by the clerk, the Court would not be bound to re<lb/>ceive that writing, if it is to be proved by ordinary statement; it does not pre<lb/>clude</hi> B <hi rend="italic">from proving by parol, because</hi> A <hi rend="italic">took a note of it, unless that note was taken officially, and made the proper evidence of it. Therefore, a prisoner may be exposed to have a different version given by some bystander of what he said, instead of that recorded by the Magistrate, which would preclude all evidence of anything beyond that. The matter seems to me not without some difficulty attending it, but I think it is admissible."</hi>

                  </hi>. I am the acting-warder of the Millbank-prison—I knew Thomas Hall—he was a warder there in Nov., the prisoner was a convict, confined there at the commencement of this month—I do not recollect when he was brought there—I was not there when he was received in—I had been there a fortnight before this occurred—he was there all that time, but I do not know how long before that—the prisoner was confined in D ward, and No. 19 cell—on Wednesday afternoon, 7th Nov., Hall was the warder in charge of that ward—I was on duty in toe adjoining ward, letter C—about half-past three that afternoon my attention was called by several persons shouting as if for assistance, I supposed it eame from D ward; I immediately went there—to pass from C ward into D, I had to unlock two gates—when I entered D ward, I saw the prisoner in the passage in D ward, which runs right in front of the cells—the ward was all locked up at the time—I had keys, so that I could go from ward to ward—there was no one but the prisoner in the passage (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>), this is a correct plan of the place—the prisoner's cell, No. 19, is put down there correctly, the next cell is Crawley's, the next to that is the store cell, and next to that the warder's room—in front of the warder's-room is the water-closet, and then, at an angle, the other cells go off the other way—where I saw the prisoner standing was nearly opposite No. 18 cell—that was next to his own—warder Sage entered into D ward almost immediately after me—he did not come the same way that I did, but the opposite end—I came in at the 19 end, and he came in at the opposite angle—Sage immediately seized the prisoner—the gates between the different wards were locked—I cannot tell whether Sage's gates were locked, I unlocked the gates from C to D—I tried every gate of the cells, and found them all locked—the prisoner's cell was locked also—it is the practice when a prisoner is taken out of his cell to lock the gate till he is brought back—I went into the officers' room, and there saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood—he laid on his left side, and the blood was all round his head—the door of that room was standing open when I came up to him—at the time I went into the Horn with Sage, there was no one in the ward but the prisoner and our two selves—no one could have got to that room, except the prisoner and the deceased—Sage had got the prisoner, we took him to the refractory cell after I had bolted all the doors of the other cells—I searched him and found on him a pair of scissors—I produce them—they were separated as they are now when I found them—they are unriveted, and in two pieces—they are the sort of scissors that are used in the gaol—the points are sharpened up in a manner not at all customary, both back and front—when I had locked up the prisoner, I returned to the officers' room where I had seen the deceased—Dr. Bailey, the surgeon to the Penitentiary, arrived in six or</p>

               <p>seven minutes—Hall was not dead at that time—in the passage near the officers' room I saw the prisoner's pot which he used in his room—it was standing within about two and a half yards of the officers' door—it is an earthenware pot, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was blood on the bottom and up the side—the lid of it was lying in the water-closet—it was then broken as it is now—we could not find the other part of the lid, we searched for it—the water-closet where they empty the pans has water which works on it when used—there is a pipe to it; I do not know the size of it, some very small things would go down it—if the piece of broken lid was broken in two or three pieces it might go down, it would not go down in one piece—while the prisoner was in the passage near the door of 18 cell, the witness Crawley said to me, "Seize the scoundrel, for he has murdered warder Hall I believe, for 1 heard him groan"—the prisoner made no reply.</p>

               <p>allowed to com<lb/>municate by word of mouth with the warders who take in their meals, except in the execution of duty—they have no right to address the warders except the warders address them, or they wish to ask for anything they want—if they ask for that which is necessary, it is considered to be a proper use of their voice; otherwise they are not to hold any communication—they are not allowed to speak unless they are spoken to, or want something necessary—if they do want anything necessary, such as going to the water-closet, there is a signal in each cell for that purpose, without using their voice—I have only been a short time at the Penitentiary this time—I was there two years before—the pool of blood was near the deceased's head; he laid with his feet towards the room-door; his head was inside, close by the side of his bed—he slept in the ward—the door of the warder's room is exactly opposite the door of the water-closet—Dr. Bailey and Mr. Rendel are the doctors of the prison.</p>

               <p>that to four I was locked up in my own cell—warder Hall locked me up-after he had locked me up, I saw him go to the centre of the ward where his room is—he went to the centre to lock another prisoner up in No. 1 cell—I saw that prisoner waiting to be locked up when he locked me up—while Hall was gone away to lock him up, I heard Francis calling out for Mr. Hall—I told him it was no use for him to call out; I was sure Mr. Hall could not hear him, that he was gone down the other side to lock up a prisoner in No. 1.—he still kept on calling out for Mr. Hall—I saw Mr. Hall come round to the prisoner's cell soon afterwards—he asked Francis what he was calling for—he said, "I want to empty my pot"—Mr. Hall asked him if he had not a signal stick in his cell—he said, "You are not allowed to call out of your cell after me; you have been here long enough to know better—if the gover<lb/>nor should have been coming by at the time, you would have been sure to have got punished for it; mind you don't do so <hi rend="italic">no</hi> more"—Francis said he would not, or, "No, Sir, I won't"—Mr. Hall then let Francis out of his cell to empty his pot—to go from his cell to the water-closet he must pass my cell-door—from my cell-door I could see the entrance into the water-closet—I did not see Francis go into the water-closet—I saw him come out—I saw him pass with the pot in his hand—I got up to my gate as the prisoner passed, to ask Mr. Hall for some thread—he kept the thread in his room-before Francis came out of the water-closet, I saw Hall come across as if he had come from his room, and lean on the troughs by the water-closet door—I then saw Francis come out with his pot in one hand, and the lid in the other—Mr. Hall then turned round as if he was coming towards the cell to let the prisoner in—he went before the prisoner, and the prisoner was follow<lb/>ing him—he had the pot in his left hand—while they were walking in that way, I saw Francis strike Hall on the head with the lid of the pot; he screamed and fell—I could not say whether he had his cap on or not—I saw his cap on the ground at the time he fell; he had it as if he had had it in his hand—I never saw him walk the ward without his cap; it was a cloth cap, with an oil skin over it—Francis then rushed on him, and kicked him when he was on the ground—I said, "For God's sake, Francis, don't kill the poor old man"—he did not speak to me—he got up off Mr. Hall, and stood for a minute, and Mr. Hall then crawled away towards his own room—Francis then went towards Mr. Hall's room, and I could hear two blows—I then called out for help, for an officer, Mr. Murray—Francis then came running out from Mr. Hall's room, and stood by the check-gate, in the centre—he had then the pot in his right hand—there is a check-gate on each side the centre—they are the gates belonging to the passage—it is a tall gate that fastens up the centre that locks the passage—that is not a gate that a person would have to go through in going from ward D to C—it is a gate you would have to go through from my cell to the centre, where Hall's room is—those gates, when they are shut, prevent anybody from going into the side part of the ward where I was, and the other gate at the other side—when those gates are shut, there is no communication from Mr. Hall's room to the water-closet—Francis stood by the check-gate on my side; the check-gate was opened at that time—he then had the pot in his hand, not the lid, and there was blood on the outside of it—I said to him, "Francis, don't strike the officer any more, I am sure you will kill him"—he did not make any answer, but ran across the centre to the other side—I then saw him return again, and go in the direction of Mr. Hall's room again, and I then heard two more blows—I called out again for the officer—I kept calling all the time; some of the other prisoners called</p>

               <p>also—Mr. Murray, the warder, came to the cnaek-gate, in the general centre, and asked what was the matter—I told him that I thought Francis had killed Mr. Hall, for I had not heard him since he knocked him down senseless, and groaned—Francis stood opposite my cell at that time—I saw him taken into custody by Sage—I saw the first blow that was struck with the lid of the pot—the lid was whole at that time—I cannot say whether it was whole when Francis came out of he water-closet, with the pot in one hand, and the lid in the other—it was whole when I gave the water into the cell at half-past two, I saw it then—I heard the lid fall and break when he struck Mr. Hall on the head—the day before this occurred, I had a conversation with Francis concerning Dr. Bailey; we were in our cells at the time—he said he wanted to see Dr. Bailey—I asked why he did not see him—he said that he bad asked to see him, and they had told him they had put his name down in the books, but he did not believe it—he said, when he was in the other part of the prison, be only applied to see Dr. Bailey over night, and he saw him next morning—Mr. Hall came down the ward soon after, and I heard the prisoner ask him when he should see Dr. Bailey—Mr. Hall said that his name was down on the books to see Dr. Bailey, but Dr. Bailey was not supposed to see him at a minute's notice, as there were other prisoners who wanted to see him as well as him—he said, "You have seen the other doctor, and what more do you want; but I have no doubt you will see Dr. Bailey to-morrow"—when Mr. Hall asked him what he wanted to see the doctor for, the prisoner said-something about the diet, that he had had more diet when he was at the hulks, and he wanted to get the same diet again—Mr. Hall asked him how long he had been there (at Millbank), he said about eight weeks—Mr. Hall then asked him why he did not apply for it before, he thought he would have something to do now to get it—the prisoner then asked him for a sheet of paper to write to his priest, as he could not see him unless he wrote to him—I heard Mr. Hall afterwards go and ask him of what religion he was, and I believe he said he was a Jew—Hall asked him if his time was up to write—we are only allowed to write once in three months—the prisoner said it was not—Mr. Hall said then he could not give him a sheet of paper, but he would put his name down to see the governor, that was all he could do for him, that was to get a special permission—I heard nothing more pass at that time—when Mr. Hall came up from having his dinner, he told the prisoner that he must see the chaplain, as well as the governor, and that he should set the governor to-morrow morning—the prisoner said, "Very well."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there at any time any communication between you and the prisoner from your cells by means of a slate being passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was—that was on the Monday, I believe, or the Tuesday, I would not be certain which, before this happened—the prisoner wrote on the slate, desiring me to ask Mr. Hall whether he thought they were going to send him to the New Model Prison or no, as there were six of them, as he heard, picked out of the worst characters to be sent to the New Model Prison, and he wished to know if he was one of them—I told him I would do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident-surgeon, at Millbank Prison. On 7th Nov. I was called to see Hall—he was insensible—he had a large wound on the right side of his head, above the right ear, bleeding very much—there was an extensive fracture extending to the base of the skull, commencing on the right side, and going over to the opposite side—it was sufficient to cause death—he died at eleven or twelve o'clock next evening—many blows must have been given to produce what I saw—I should think the fracture of the skull must have been produced by the larger part of this vessel—I first saw the prisoner on the day of his admission, and many times since—he was removed in the early part of this year, and I believe he had been back eight or nine weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> You are the under-surgeon of the gaol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is no other—Dr. Bailey attends as the physician—I knew nothing of the prisoner before he came there—when I saw him the first time, I asked him if he was the man who made an attack on Mr. Dabbs—I do not recollect whe<lb/>ther he said anything—I did not say I would have him flogged—I told him it was a thing he ought not to have done, but nothing more—I did not say I had just come from Woolwich, and would have him flogged, if I had my will—I have not been to Woolwich at all-r-1 do not believe I ever said to him I would have him flogged if I had my will—I will not swear it, but am sure I did not say it—I have heard no complaint of my using that expression—he said something about my not attending to him, as he could get no treatment, and he should see one of the Inspectors—I wished him to see the Inspector—he had a prolapsus of the rectum, which is painful when the bowels act, but not otherwise, when it is returned—it is not a particularly irritating disease—there was nothing for me to do but to return it when it came down—he has not had inflammation of the bowels in the Penitentiary—I had not heard that he had been confined as a lunatic—if a person had been in a state of lunacy, in all probability he would not have been put in separate confine<lb/>ment—not if it had been only two or three months before—it would depend a great deal on the nature of the insanity—if it had been a few years before, the ordinary rule of the prison would be followed—if he was placed in soli<lb/>tary confinement, it would be likely to make him mad again—when I place prisoners under treatment, I always inquire, as far as I am able, into the state of their previous health—I had not heard that he had been treated as a lunatic—the lunacy would be more likely to return if it was an hereditary taint.</p>

               <p>there—it is separate confinement, which is very different—in solitary confinement, the prisoner sees no one, I believe, but his officer during the day—in separate confinement persons are continually passing and repassing, and they have the opportunity of speaking to prisoners and to their officer, and are provided with work—the work and imprisonment in Millbank would certainly not be likely to make lunacy return, in a case like this, unless it had been two or three months previously; it would not then be justifiable—if he had been well two years I should treat him in this way—it would certainly have no effect then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am visiting physician to Millbank Penitentiary—I believe the prisoner came there in Aug. last—I saw him about a fortnight afterwards, when the question was submitted to me, whether he was able to do the ordinary work of the prison, which is tailoring, picking oakum, shoemaking, and hard labour at the pumps—I said he was able to work at a trade, but not at the pumps, and I believe he was so employed—he was not a strong muscular man, and had a disease of the rectum—he had the ordi<lb/>nary diet of the prison—I saw him on three occasions, the one I have referred to, and a second time, in making a general inspection of the male convicts, when nothing particular passed, and a third time, when I inspected him and other men, to ascertain whether he was fit to be transported to Norfolk Island, in Oct., or the beginning of November, last year—he then complained of symptoms of <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi>, of pain in the chest, and <hi rend="italic">of prolapsus ani</hi>—he told me he had passed blood that day through bis bowels, and I went with him to his cell to examine his utensil—I do not recollect whether I saw any blood, but the result was that I certified that he was not fit to be transported—that was about a week before 7th Nov.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You mean a variety of things by <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia? A</hi> I mean indigestion, I thought he was suffering slightly from indigestion—lunatic people do not generally suffer from giddiness, only from headache—in persons predisposed to affections of the brain, dyspepsia might induce an attack—I do not think dyspepsia would have a tendency to produce apoplexy, it would produce some kinds of disorder of the brain—I must have seen the prisoner in Feb., 1846—I have no memorandum of the observations I made then—the system at Millbank is not strictly solitary, it is a modified separate system—when I examined him in Feb. he was well in body and mind—on 5th March I was sent specially to the <hi rend="italic">Palmyra</hi>, convict-ship, to ascertain his state of mind—I believed him to be insane, and ordered him on board the hospital-ship, as an insane patient—I do not know how long be remained there—he was under Mr. Blyth's care—I believe his insanity arose from the prospect of transportation acting on his mind—that has acted on a sane mind—I have been several times sent for to Woolwich, to examine prisoners insane from a similar cause, and I know they were sane when sent on board the convict-ship—it is difficult to get satisfactory evidence of the state of the parents—if a person from birth was predisposed to insanity, he would be more likely to be affected in that way, by fear—as far as I recollect the pri<lb/>soner's state, he was of an average habit, rather weak than strong—his mad<lb/>ness was a sort of timidity and terror—he seemed afraid that individuals would do him an injury—as far as I recollect I made a report, but I have not seen it since, and I do not recollect it—I do not recollect that he broke out into any acts of violence—I should have considered it safe to have left him with other persons—his state would not lead to immediate acts of violence.</p>

               <p>will do him violence, is it not likely that he will act as if the violence is about to he committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In any case of acute insanity there would be such a risk—I am now speaking of 1846—I had seen him in perfect health within a week or ten days before I declared him insane—it was immediately the terror began to operate upon him, on 5th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>during her illness—hysterical mania is very common among females—it was necessary to confine her on the bed, and have persons to hold her—I think, for a short time, she was sent to the workhouse, and came back from there—she never was well, but there were periods at which she was much worse than at other times—she was a person of weakly constitution—these hysterical attacks would last four or five months together; in fact, she never was well, never in a sane mind; but at certain periods she was more violent, and required coercion—I only speak for the last three years of her life; I knew her before—I knew her mother from her earliest days, from her marriage, but I only saw them professionally; I did not associate with them—I believe no complaint was made of any disease of the sister until the time I speak of—she died eventually of that disease—I think she died in King-street, Commercial-road—if I remember right I was attending her at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a resident medical-officer, on board the <hi rend="italic">Unit'e</hi> hospital ship, lying off Woolwich, The prisoner was transferred from the <hi rend="italic">Lady Palmyra</hi> convict hulk, on 5th March, 1846—I attended him; Mr. Bossy, the superintendent, also saw him, and we were both of opinion that he was insane at that time—he was labouring under the delusion that some one intended to do him some personal injury—he showed evident signs of fear in his manner, and he was shouting out of the port of the ship all night the first night he came; he was shouting to the sentinels on the wharf opposite, and calling for assistance; that some one was murdering him; and he also spoke to any one that was passing, or any of the watermen, to the same effect, shouting out that he was being murdered—he was shouting in that manner all that night—he remained under my care several weeks at that time—he remained insane during the whole of that period—he gradually recovered, but he was more or less insane for several weeks—he had the ordinary diet at first—he has been frequently in the hospital, but not for insanity—he laboured under dyspepsia, and on one occasion he bad rather a sharp attack of fever—that did not produce delirium, or affect his brain—he also had an ulcerated sore throat once or twice—he was continually com<lb/>plaining of that ailment already mentioned, the <hi rend="italic">prolapsus anit</hi>—I ascertained that that was perfectly true—it is the bowel coming out at the time the <hi rend="italic">faces</hi> are discharged—I never saw him after he left the hulk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any time that he threw himself overboard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no distinct recollection of that circumstance, and I can find no note of it; it has been mentioned to me—I was not aware of any predisposing cause to insanity—I made no inquiry about his family, and knew nothing about them, and there are no remarks in our books—a person who inherited a disease of this kind would be less likely to be cured than one to whom it came incidentally—hereditary insanity is much more seldom cured than any other form, and when the predisposing cause exists it is much more easily excited—when we first received him on board the hulks he seemed to have great terror—we came to the conclusion at that time that his embarkation had something to do with the attack of insanity.</p>

I decide that the question cannot be put as a matter of right, and I do not think it ought as a matter of convenience. The way to examine a scientific witness is to put general questions to him, such as 'What are the symptoms of insanity? 'In what way do you judge such a symptom to be one of insanity or the reverse? and the Jury will apply his hypothetic answer to the facts before them; if it agrees with the facts, they will apply the opinion; if not, it goes for nothing. If you wish to ask his judgment upon what he saw on the two occasions, you may; but my difficulty is, that your question implies that the facts are proved."</hi>

               <p>seven—I did not give the prisoner any more than three, and I did not give him any but those I had sampled, and on which T had placed the labels—I put the three samples into the prisoner's bag myself—there was no fourth parcel in the bag—I left the warehouse about twenty minutes past three, to go to the gate, but I was detained—the prisoner left about twenty minutes before I did, and he went through the western division of the warehouse—he would there have an opportunity of filling a sample-bag, if he had been so minded—when I got to the gate, I found the prisoner there; his bag was placed down, and he was walking by himself—I presented to the gate<lb/>keeper a pass for twelve samples—I saw the prisoner's bag opened; it contained the three samples which I had put in the bag, and one besides—I had not given him any other bag than the three, nor permitted him to take any other—I am not aware how he possessed himself of the fourth bag—the gate-keeper said, "How many ought you to have?"—I said, "Twelve; I have got seven, the other man two, and the prisoner three"—the gate-keeper said," There is another"—the prisoner then endeavoured to secrete this bag behind him—I took it from him—I heard him tell the gate-keeper that he knew nothing of it, that it was given him—I denied it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman at the livery stables of Mr. Bathers, who keeps the Red Lion, at Brompton. About four o'clock on Friday, 12th Oct., Fidler and the groom came there on horseback—the groom appeared as if he had had quite enough to drink—Fidler had on a plain coat and police trowsers and boots—Fidler got down and fetched a quartern of gin out—he gave the groom a glass, and took the remainder himself—the groom paid for it—they then parted, Fidler going towards town and Jebb towards Putney—Jebb appeared quite drunk—I did not notice the prisoner so much as Jebb, as he was one of my own cloth—I did not consider him so far gone as the groom—the Red Lion is a quarter of a mile nearer Putney than the clock-house—the horses appeared very nice quiet ones.</p>

About 11th or 12th Oct., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the parlour of the White Horse, kept by Mr. Fell, and saw Fidler and Jebb there—when 1 went in Jebb was sitting with his face towards the table—I cannot say where Fidler was—there was a silk handkerchief, a pair of gloves, a groom's whip, and a gentleman's cane on the table, and Jebb took four sovereigns, and I think a half-sovereign, and some silver and copper, I believe, from his pocket, and put it on the handkerchief—he then searched his pockets for something he appeared to have lost, and after searching two or three of them, he drew out what I afterwards saw was a check for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he placed them in a net purse at one end, and the gold at the other end, and put the purse into the breast-pocket of his coat—they then sat down, and had some dinner and ale—after that Jebb was intoxicated, and could not keep himself erect, and he fell forward with his head on the table—Fidler was then sitting at the table, on the other side of Jebb from me—he rose up to light his pipe I believe—he then came round the table, and sat between me and Jebb—I then heard him mutter something about 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was about a yard from me, and Jebb's head was still leaning forward on the table—I then saw Fidler put his hand under Jebb's coat, to the breast-pocket where I bad seen the purse put, and afterwards withdraw it, but I did not see him take any<lb/>thing—I went out, made a communication to the landlord, and then left.</p>

Mrs. Smith, what are you doing with my basket?"—the handle broke, and I heard the money drop—I said, "Help me look for it down the area," and a woman present said the prisoner had got it—she was given in charge, and taken to the station—the prisoner worked with me at 103, Wood-street, at bonnet-sewing—my husband had given me the money in the morning to take care of, as he was going into the country—there are from twenty to twenty-three persons working in the same place as us—it was the prisoner who wanted to go to the water-closet—my money was safe till we got to the court—I had not seen it from seven or half-past, when I left my work; I cannot say what time it was—we went to more than one public-house—I recollect nothing after I had the second glass of gin in Fleet-street—I was offered brandy, but I cannot say whether I had it or not—I cannot tell whether it was a freak, or whether she meant to steal it—she tried to take the basket from me, but could not, and then she took the bag—the basket was tied with twine—I heard the money <hi rend="italic">jink</hi>, and thought it fell on the iron grating and through the area—I saw her take it from my basket—I cannot tell whether she was sober—we searched the area—none of the money came out of the bag.</p>

I was called by Mr. Oddy; I went to the Court, and saw the prisoner and West, who was crying, and said she had lost her money, and asked me to go down the area and look for it—Mr. Oddy said, "Never mind, this woman (the prisoner) has got her money; take her away to the station"—the prisoner said she knew nothing of it—West was much the worse for liquor, and did not know very well what was going on—the prisoner had been drinking, but was not near so bad as West.</p>

Mrs. West, give me the basket, or you will do something wrong"—that was before she got the basket—West kept crying out, "Mind my money!" and I then saw the prisoner open the basket and take the money out—I said "You have got the woman's money," and then I heard it knock against some place, and I thought it had gone down the area—we got a light, and searched, but could not find it, and Mr. Oddy got a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, in the service of Messrs. Pontifex, coppersmiths, of Shoe-lane—they have also a factory at Millwall, where I have been employed between five and six years—Joseph Riddell was the manager of that factory—I do not know what William Riddell was; he was employed there—in March, 1848, I was employed with Harrison, at a house in Birnie-street, Greenwich, where the prisoners resided—I made a cupboard for the kitchen there—I received directions about it at different times, from both the prisoners—those directions were given at the factory at Millwall—the cupboard was made of battens, which I got from the factory at Millwall—William Riddell told me to take them—there was a stock of battens there, for the purposes of the factory—I took perhaps about fifty feet; it was certainly thirty feet, but I cannot say any further—that wood was used for the cupboard—Harrison assisted me in making it—we made it up at Millwall, and afterwards took it to Greenwich to fix—the prisoners saw us fixing it—I cannot say whether they saw us preparing it—I do not recollect when it was that Joseph Riddell first spoke to me about the cupboard; it was at Greenwich—I do not remember the precise words William Riddell used when he told me to take the wood—he said I was to go into the lead-works, and take some of those inch-and-a-quarter battens—the stock of deals that we had on the premises belonged to Messrs. Pontifex—there were four shelves to the cupboard—I also made some rough kind of shelves, of the same kind of material, for the wine-cellar, at the same time—William Riddell ordered me to make them—Mr. Joseph saw them after they were done, while we were fixing them—the value of both the cupboard and shelves might be about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including labour; the materials might be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while I was working on the cupboard and shelves I received my wages in the usual way, as we did every Saturday at the factory—Mr. Jones paid us; he always paid the wages—I</p>

Pontifex—the officer Hedington has since shown me some flannel, and the materials of which the cupboard and shelves were made—I went with him to Greenwich, and pointed them out—they were the same I had made by the prisoners' directions—I was not with Hedington when the flannel was found; I saw it afterwards; it was the same sort of flannel as that in which the furniture had been.</p>

Pontifex please—if we lose time we are not paid for it; our time is counted by hours; sometimes we do over-work, make more than six days a week—we do not account to Mr. Jones for our hours when we are paid our wages; it is not Mr. Jones's duty to inquire, but Mr. Riddell's—I never made known to Mr. Jones where I had been at work—he was not on the premises all the week; he was at Shoe-lane; he merely came down on Saturday evening to pay the men—I do not remember seeing either of the Messrs. Pontifex in the carpenters' shop while I was making the cupboard—they did sometimes come into the carpenters' shop—I never went off the premises to work, except on this occasion, and once when I went to Mr. Pontifex's.</p>

Pontifex to do so—I do not think any of the battens or shelves were taken away when Messrs. Pontifex were there—I believe they did not see me making either of the articles—I have no means of knowing whether or not they knew of their being made—the gate-keeper, like the other servants, was under Joseph Riddell's control—we got the things to take to Birnie-street; when we went at six o'clock in the morning, and went direct there after getting what we wanted—I did not mention anything of this to either of the Messrs.

                  </hi>. I have been clerk to Messrs. Pontifex nearly fourteen years—my general occupation is at Shoe-lane, but it was my duty to pay the wages of every person employed at Mill wall—every Saturday morning, Joseph Riddell forwarded a time-book with the amount of time due to each man—it was then reckoned up, to see what the total time of each man was, and on the Saturday afternoon I received the amount to take to Millwall to pay the men—in the following week I used to analyse the account to find what work the men had been on, and the amount of wages to each different portion of the manufactory—the analysis was then kept in the counting-house, and the time-book sent back to Joseph Riddell—I have not got that book—after I sent it back on the Tuesday or Wednesday I should know nothing</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother William; about five or six years since, we took Joseph Riddell into our employment, as superintendent and manager of the works we were then taking at Millwall—some time after, he asked permission for his brother to come and assist him—I consented to that—I think when Joseph first came, he received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—we afterwards added other branches to the business, which was a chemical one, and white-lead factory—at first it was only a business for making extracts of logwood; we added other things to it, and we then gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for some time—in 1846 the returns were not satisfactory, in consequence of which we reduced his salary to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I had an explanation with him on the subject; the agreement was not the result of a written correspondence—I told him that the concern turned out very different when we made up the stock account to what he represented, and that as the concern did not pay, I could not give him the same amount of salary that I had done under the idea that it was paying—he said he could not expect it; that I had been exceedingly liberal and kind to him, and whatever I thought was a proper equivalent for his services he should be happy to accept—I said I had talked the matter over with my brother, and that we would give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week, but that if he managed the concern so as to make it a profitable one, we would then increase accordingly—he said he was quite willing to accept it—I had long previous to that given instructions to him that not a thing should go from Millwall without an order from our couuting-house—we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184911260080"/>
               <p>gave William 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as assistant to his brother—it was his duty generally to assist his brother in the management of the concern—it was Joseph's duty to see that the time charged by the men was properly charged, and remit it to Shoe-lane to be paid—I received some information with reference to Joseph in 1846, in consequence of which 1 told him I had heard many rumours prejudicial to his integrity in carrying on the concern—he said he had many enemies, but he was ready to meet any accusation, and he hoped I should not give credit to anything to his prejudice unless it was proved—I told him that if there was no truth in these things, a course of integrity on his part would give the lie to these reports, and that I would not, unless I could bring something home to him, think of dismissing him, when I knew it would be so prejudicial to his character—he had authority as manager to make such alterations or repairs at Mill wall as were necessary for carrying on our business—when I say alterations, I mean minor things; of course nothing would be done on any scale without my giving him directions—he had no authority to sell anything from Millwall without an order from Shoe-lane; we had expressly prohibited it—I told him repeatedly that it was only a manufactory, and not a commercial place—he never asked my permission to work up any battens of ours on premises of his own—he never had any such authority—I received an anonymous letter about July; I did not speak to Joseph Riddell about it—I had suspicions about July in the present year, that our property had been used by the prisoners—I had no knowledge of our battens being worked up for the purpose of making either shelves for wine cellars or cupboards, at the prisoner's house in Birnie-street—I had never authorized him to do such a thing—I bad not expressly prohibited him from doing so; it did not occur to me to do so—I only gave him a general prohibition, that no property was to be removed without an express order—in March, 1848, I was dissatisfied with the wages account, and communicated that repeatedly to Joseph Riddell—I pointed out to him the number of carpenters employed, which I thought perfectly unnecessary for the repairs of the place—I told him the expenses were much greater than any business could afford to the extent that was being carried on—I mean carpenters and those kind of men, who were not employed in manufacturing any of the articles, but on in the general repairs of the premises—he made a great many excuses, and said they were necessary, and I insisted, and sometimes had some of them dis<lb/>charged—there was a stock taking at Millwall in July; in consequence of which, on 15th Sept., I caused a general inquiry to be made of the state of the business and premises there—in consequence of that I learnt something with reference to the prisoner's premises at Birnie-street, and the property that had been at the factory, and in consequence of that I consulted my solicitor, and went down with him and a policeman to Millwall—I do not think I had learnt anything from Spriggs or Harrison at that time—I called some of the men into the counting-house, and put questions to them; the prisoner Joseph was outside—after I had their answers, I called Joseph in and accused him of having falsified the stock accounts to a large amount—I said, "You have weighed refuse of sulphate of lime as tartrate of lime, and taken it into stock, making a difference of about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I am not sure whether I men<lb/>tioned the amount at that time, or subsequently; I think I mentioned the amount in the course of that conversation—he said, "I am very sorry I I have done so; I have been very wrong there"—I said, "But that is not all, Mr. Riddell; I fear that the reports that I have so long heard to your prejudice are true, and that you have been robbing us to a large amount;</p>

               <p>I find, from the examination of the men, that you have been using oar materials and our time, and converting them to your own purposes"—he said, "I am very sorry that I have done so, but it is not to a large amount;" or "it is a small amount," or some words to that effect—Mr. Debenham, my attorney, cautioned him in the first instance that there was an officer present, and that anything he said would be noted down—either Mr. Debenham or the officer then said, "It is no use speaking any further to him; you had better give him in charge"—and on that I gave him in charge.</p>

I was with Lawn, heard the gun fired, and went with him to the tree—in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour we saw a man about twenty yards off, and two more came up as fast as they possibly could—when they were within three or four yards of the tree Lawn turned his light on, and I saw the prisoners—I had known Allen and Lovegrove five or six years—Allen had a gun—he held it up towards us, but not to his shoulder—it went off—I was between three and four yards from Lawn—Allen and Love<lb/>grove walked away—Lawn caught hold of Emmett, scuffled with him, and knocked this stick out of his hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up, and struck Lawn with it by mistake—Emmett called out, "Give it him! give it him!"—he got away—I am satisfied the prisoners are the men.</p>

On 17th Nov., between eleven and twelve, I saw James come out with this parcel in brown paper tied up under his arm—I was in plain clothes—I followed him to the prisoner Lee's, 89, Fore-street, Cripplegate, it is a tailor's and trimmer's shop—they sell woollen pieces and cloth—James went into the shop, placed the parcel on the counter, and Lee took it off and placed it behind the counter, on the ground, without its being opened—the counter concealed it when it was on the floor—no money passed between them—I should say Lee's shop is three miles from Oxford-street, James went along the back streets—when James came out of Lee's I went in and asked Lee where the parcel was that the man had left who had just gone out—he said, "What parcel?"—I walked to the end of the counter and said, "That is the parcel," pointing to this one—he said, "O, yes, a man did leave it this morning"—it was still unopened—I asked him what he gave for it—he said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked him if he had bought any money—he said, "No," he had not, and he did not know the man only by his coming in now and then—I told him 1 should search the place—he said, "O, I have bought a little more calico of him"—I searched the place, and found altogether six parcels, which I produce, containing altogether 285 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8 yards—some of the parcels were tied in brown paper, and some loose—Lee said he bought the whole of them</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Richard Atkinson and another, oilmen, of Red Lion-street. On 14th Nov. Benjamin Masters came and asked for half an ounce of tobacco—while I was weighing it Mary Masters came in—I gave Benjamin Masters the tobacco—he tendered me half-a-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the tobacco came to 1¾<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I put down the change, Mary Masters endeavoured to attract my attention, by asking if I would give her a sixpence for six pennyworth of halfpence—I told her we had a till-full of halfpence, and did not want any more—I saw Benjamin pick up the two shillings I had laid down with the coppers, and put them into his mouth—Mary said, "You might as well oblige me"—I said we could give her halfpence for a sixpence—I saw Benjamin Masters put a sixpence to the 4¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was on the counter, and he said, "Halloo, master, this change is not right, is it? I gave you half-a-crown"—I said, "I am well aware, my man, what you gave me, and what change I gave you"—I left the counter and walked round, and the moment I moved he went out—he did not get anything from me—when he got two or three yards from the shop I got up to him—the moment I got up to him he made a snatch at my watch—I held him two or three minutes, and Mary Masters came out and endeavoured to rescue him—she said, what did I want with the man, he bad done nothing, and so on—she took hold of him, and endeavoured to pull him away—the money in the shop was Mr. Richard Atkinson's and his partner's.</p>

I am the wife of Samuel Pallant, I keep a fancy-neeedlework shop, in Halkin-terrace, Belgrave square, in the parish of, St. Luke, Chelsea—John Sleigh came to my shop on 2d Nov., between four and five o'clock—he asked what silk was a pound—I told him—he did not purchase any then—he went away and came about twenty minutes afterwards, brought a skein of silk, and bought another skein—after he was gone I left the shop to go to tea, about twenty minutes after five—I left Mary Bance in the shop—the shop-door leading to the passage was shut—a person coming into the shop must come through that door—there is only one entrance to the house from the street—persons go into the passage, and then go through the shop-door to get into the shop—I went to tea in a little room adjoining the shop—when I came into the shop again, about twenty minutes before six, from fourteen to sixteen pounds of purse-silk was gone, worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, and a bundle of wool—the value of all I lost was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this silk is part of what I lost—I swear to it by this tie—I tied it myself and put it in the window, and it got discoloured—the maker's name is with the parcel—I have some more of the same at home which I tied it up with—there is a great variety of silk, and in this parcel there are samples of all I keep.</p>

On Friday, 2d Nov., I saw John Sleigh come into the shop, between four and five o'clock—(I saw Charles in the shop in the course of the day of the robbery, or the day pre<lb/>vious)—he asked the price of wool—I was told to take his address—we take the address of persons who give an order—he said, "Williams, Sloane-street"—I was proceeding to write it down, and said, "Sloane-street"—he said, "Yes, you had better not put it down, they are waiting"—he then left the shop, and returned in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—he bought a skein of silk, and left the shop—when he left, the door that led into the passage was fastened with a latch—when it is so fastened, it is not possible to open it without ringing the bell—I left the shop at twenty minutes past five, to go into an adjoining room to tea—I heard the bell ring, as I was passing from the shop to the back-room—Sarah Cooper went out—there is a trigger attached to the frame of the door—it is possible for a person to open the door a small distance, and by passing their hand in, to move up the trigger, and prevent the bell ringing—it has been tried, in my presence—Cooper</p>

I am a carpenter, in the employment of Messrs, Pontifex, and have been so five or six years, at a lead and chemical factory at Millwall—Joseph Riddell was the manager; I received my directions from him—William Riddell was employed there; I do not know what as—he was in the habit of giving me directions in his brother's absence, which I obeyed, without referring to Joseph—about July or Aug., 1848, the prisoners resided in Birnie-street, Greenwich—they had previously resided at the factory it Millwall—about July or Aug., 1848, I was employed in making and fitting-up a green-house with Harrison and Miller—Joseph Riddell first gave me directions about it; William was not present—in consequence of those directions I prepared a plan and estimate, and about a fortnight after set about making it—I cannot say whether William Riddell spoke to me about it before I set about making it—I made it up of some deals that came in the yard—they were brought in during the time—they were not there previously—I was ordered <hi rend="italic">to</hi> select what I wanted from that sample that came in, and <hi rend="italic">to give</hi> Mr. Joseph an account <hi rend="italic">of</hi> them—those deals were brought in for die general purposes of the factory—I selected about ten twenty-feet deals, and ten twentv-feet battens—the deals were worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the battens perhaps 355.—I had to order two sawyers to cut them into the requisite thickness—the deals were about nine inches wide and three inches thick, and the battens seven inches wide and two and a half thick—I then began to work on them, alone in the first instance, in the carpenters' shop in the factory—while I was working on them William Riddell saw them—Harrison commenced working at them; it might have been the following day—William Riddell frequently saw me and Harrison working at them—I received direc<lb/>tions from both the prisoners on the subject at different times—some window-sashes were made for the green-house, about nine in front, and fourteen sky-lights; and rafters and doors besides—perhaps I might be occupied about ten or twelve days in preparing those sashes, and Harrison perhaps rather more—during those twelve days William Riddell came frequently—it was their habit <hi rend="italic">to</hi> visit us daily—it is not to be considered as twelve successive days, because there were other things to attend to—when the work was com<lb/>pleted we took it over to Greenwich—I believe it was Mr. William who principally directed us to take the things over—Harrison and I took them—we were occupied about fourteen days, or thereabouts, in fitting up the green-house at Greenwich—William Riddell was there every day, and Joseph also—I received directions from William as well as Joseph, in reference to the fittings-up—the value of the green-house, when completed, was between 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received my wages the whole of the time in the usual way in the counting-house, from Mr. Jones—William Riddell was not in the habit of being present when I received my wages; he might have been there at times, but he took no part in it—some iron brackets were necessary for putting up the green-house; that was for the internal fittings—I think Mr. William gave me directions to order Upstill, the smith, to make them—he made them in the</p>

I am partner with my brother in the copper-worki at Shoe-lane, and the factory at Millwall—Joseph Riddell was appointed our manager, about 1843; after that he requested the assistance of his brother William, and we permitted it—William had no particular duties, but was to give general assistance to his brother—he received a salary; he was a kind of joint-manager with his brother—I think William came into the employment very shortly after Joseph—I have given instructions to William in reference to his duties both in the presence of his brother and separately—I have re-peatedly given William instructions as well as Joseph, that not a single thing should go off the premises at any time without express orders from Shoe-Jane—we had generally a stock of timber in use at the factory—I gave no instructions to either of the prisoners in July or Aug. 1848, to use timber for the erection of a green-house at their house at Greenwich, neither of them told me they had done so—I received a letter from Joseph on or about 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> Aug. last—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had received no information from either of them about the timber before that—I never received any communication</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and watchmaker, at 9, Knightsbridge-terrace. On 19th Oct. last, at nearly half-past twelve o'clock, I was standing behind my counter, and the prisoner Rolls called me to the door, and asked me to tell him the price of three dressing-glasses that were placed outside one of my shop-windows, on an elevated step from the pavement—I saw no one with him—I went out, and he asked me the price of the glasses, and kept me talking for two or three minutes—there were no prices marked on them—he asked me the price of all—he said he dare say that either this or that (pointing to two of them) would suit, but he would bring his <hi rend="italic">old woman</hi> in the evening, and have one—I told him I had a great many more inside the shop, and 1 thought I might be enabled to sell him one then, and I induced him to enter the shop with me—I think I stepped on one side, and be went in, and I followed him—I took a dressing-glass from off a chair, and placed it on the counter, and at that moment 1 saw a row of gold watches in a different window to the one we had been out to, swinging about; it was not an open window—my shop stands at the corner of two streets; the door is at the corner, and one window in each street; it is immediately opposite the Albert-gate and Mr. Hudson's house—the looking-glasses were in the window in front of William-street, and the watches in the window looking into the Knightsbridge-road—the watches were in motion, as if the string was shaken; they were in full swing, giving strong evidence of having been recently disturbed—I discovered two tickets swinging without the watches, and this ticket, which I produce, had disappeared, with a gold watch, altogether—that ticket was found behind the counter—I missed three watches—a person behind the counter could get to the Knightsbridge-terrace window—whoever robbed me of the watches robbed my till also, and this ticket was found close behind the counter where the till was—the till was robbed at the same time I lost the watches—a person would have to go behind the counter to get at the watches—I have a key to the till, but never keep it locked during the day—it was a long distance from where the watches hung—the till was at the extreme end of the counter—when I saw the watches swinging, Rolls was in the shop—I said, "I have been robbed," and ran out in an agitated manner, and returned again, thinking I might see something, and on my return a man told me, in Rolls's presence, he was just at the door; that he had seen him in company with another man, and advised me not to let him go—I left the shop again, and returned, and the prisoner had then gone some distance across William-street, nearly as far as the shop on the other side of the way—I told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184911260124"/>
               <p>him I could not part with him, and brought him back to my shop—I had left him in the custody of my wife in the shop: there was no opportunity for robbing the till then—the man who had. advised me went and brought a policeman—the prisoner was taken to the police-office—after I returned from the examination my man asked me if I had paid the money away, as there was none in the till, and I then found the till empty of the gold—I am certain there were two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in the morning—I did not miss any silver; there was nearly 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth—the gold was kept in a bag, and the silver in a wooden bowl—the gold bag was not gone, hut there was no gold in it—the shop forms part of my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square.</p>

On 19th Oct., about half-past twelve, I was standing at the corner of William-street, in Knightsbridge, opposite the Albert Gate, about three yards from Mr. Killick's shop—I saw both the prisoners together—they passed by me abreast, went about six yards from me on the kerb, and stood together five or six minutes, about two yards and a half from Mr. Killick's shop, with their backs towards it, like men in conversation together—they then turned round and looked hard at me, as if they knew something of me—I had never seen them before, but I stared at them—I then saw Rolls turn to his left and go to Mr. Killick's door, and King walked leisurely towards the window in Knightsbridge as a person going to look at anything—I saw Mr. Killick come out and go with Rolls to look at some glasses under the window in William-street, and while they were so doing, I saw King walk leisurely into the shop, as a person going in to buy—I should say he might have been in a minute ora minute and a half, I cannot say exactly when I saw him come out, and he turned to his right and walked off at a brisk pace towards Hyde Park-comer—in about a minute I saw Mr. Killick go into his shop and Rolls follow him—he had been in the shop about a minute or a minute and a half, when I saw him come out again and run into the next shop in a frightened manner, like a man excited—he appeared alarmed, as if something was the matter with him—as he ran out I said, "Is anything amiss?" but he did not hear me—when he came out of the shop again, Rolls was outside—I said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. John Walker, who is in partner<lb/>ship with Mr. Brown; the shop forms part of the dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel. On 6th Oct., about a quarter to twelve o'clock, the prisoners, Rolls and Evans, came to the shop-door, and asked me the price of a brooch in the window—I cannot say which one spoke; the price was not marked—I went outside the shop, and they took me to the further end of the window from the door, and pointed to two black brooches on a card; they were about two and a half yards from the door—I was out-tide with them about a minute and a half—I told them the price, and they pointed to some more brooches, not black, and asked the price <hi rend="italic">of</hi> those; they seemed scarcely to know what to point to—I told them the price, and then returned to the shop-door—I bad left no one in the shop—when I went in I found the boy Richardson standing in front of the counter—he asked for a box of Mordan's leads, and while serving him, Evans returned into the shop, and asked if we had any sixpenny brooches—I said, "No"—I am sure it was one of the two men that had previously drawn my attention to the brooches outside—he came very near to where Richardson was standing—when I told him we had none, he made no remark, but left the shop directly—after I had served Richardson, he also left the shop—about half-au hour afterwards I missed a gold watch, worth twenty-eight guineas, out of a glass-case behind the counter, fixed up against the wall; it was shut, but not locked—I had seen that watch the day previous; a person must have walked round the counter to get it—I next saw Evans on 27th Oct., at the West<lb/>minster Police-court, when Rolls was in custody, and being examined—Evans was standing among the bystanders—on seeing him I told my master that I identified him as being one of the. men I had seen outside the shop, and he told the inspector, and he was taken into custody, and charged—looking at him now, I believe him to be the man that was with Rolls, but from what I have heard, there is a doubt in my mind—I have not the slightest doubt about Richardson—I would not speak positively as to Rolls.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the driver of the omnibus that runs from Sunbury to London. It arrives at the Goose and Gridiron, St. Paul's Churchyard, at a quarter-past ten in the morning, and leaves on its journey back to Sunbury at twenty minutes before eleven—the prisoner Evans was the conductor of that omnibus, and has been so upwards of two years—the omnibus clears London, that is, the White Horse Cellar, about five minutes past eleven. On 6th Oct. I drove the omnibus, and Evans conducted it—we left St. Paul's Churchyard at the usual time, and arrived at Piccadilly at our usual time-Joseph Clark was time-keeper there that day—Evans never left the omnibus from the time we left St. Paul's Churchyard till we got to Sunbury at half-past one—our route is through Hammersmith, over the Suspension-bridge, through Barnes and Mortlake, not near the Whitechapel-road.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer, of Fort-street, Spitalfields. I have three partners—the prisoner was in our employ, attending generally on the duties in the warehouse, and partly serving customers—on 29th Sept. I went into the velvet-room, and a piece of velvet was found by Hallington, in my presence, in a box, under a number of empty boxes—I had asked the prisoner, about two minutes before, if there was any velvet in any of these boxes—he said there was not; they were all empty—he then withdrew—I called the prisoner into the room, pointed to the velvet, and asked what that was—he said, "It is some of my doings"—I asked what he meant—he said lie had sent some of it away to Derby; he believed seven yards, or seven yards and a half—the piece of velvet ought to have been down-stairs, in the selling warehouse—there was a ticket and private mark on it—the piece was thirty-two yards and three-quarters long; it was marked to sell at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard—I examined my stock, and found this piece was missing from the place where it ought to be—I did not give the prisoner into custody then—on the Monday following he said he wished to have an interview with me, and he had made a mistake in stating the length of the velvet he had taken: it was only five yards, and not seven and a half—I had examined the piece of velvet on the Monday, and found ten yards and a quarter were gone, and when the</p>

On 26th June the prisoner brought this box, (<hi rend="italic">produced, containing a chronometer</hi>,) and asked if we took in chronometers—I told him "Yes," and asked him what he wanted on it—he said, "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said I would look at it, but that was more than we were in the habit of advancing—for any sum advanced above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the Act of Par<lb/>liament requires an agreement, and it is called a loan—I asked him who it was made by—he said, "Brockbanks"—I said I would take it in-doors, and show it to our managing man—I came back, and told him we could not advance more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Oh! it is a very valuable article, and cost a great deal of money"—I went in again, and our managing man asked the prisoner to step round into a private room, which he did—we then looked at the article again, and asked him about it—I said, "This is a genuine article, I suppose?"—he said, "Oh! yes; it was bought at Brock bank's, and cost 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."or" 80 guineas"—he was asked if it was an eight-day one—he said, "Yes"—there is an index denoting that—we do not understand them, and did not take it to pieces—I noticed this card on it, and said, "How is it this card of Mr. Carter's comes here?"—he said, "Oh! it has been lately rated by Mr. Carter"—I asked if he had a rate, and he said, "No," he had not</p>

Barker the following goods: an eight-day ship chronometer, Brockbank, 462, to be held by them as security for the payment of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., this day lent to me, together with interest, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent., &amp;c. &amp;c.

John Galley, 24, Liverpool-street")—on 24th Oct. the prisoner came again, and brought a silver watch, which appeared to be a chronometer—it was not given me first, but afterwards was brought to the part of the shop I was in—I looked at it, and said, "Oh! this is a regular <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>; who has offered it?"—I went down to where the man was, and said to Mr. Wholstenholm, "Oh! it is the gentleman who brought the <hi rend="italic">duffing</hi> chronometer"—Mr. Wholstenholm had the watch in his hand, and said, "We shall detain the watch till you take out the <hi rend="italic">duffing</hi> chronometer which you left in June"—the time had then expired, it ought to have been taken away in three months—the prisoner said, "Oh! you detain my watch, do you?"—Mr. Wolstenholm said, "Yes; I shall detain it until you do something about it"—he was about leaving, and Mr. Wolstenholm said, "Before you go, write your name, that we may know who you are," and he wrote on the back of this ticket—(<hi rend="italic">produced and read</hi>—"William Anns, 11, Laburnam-terrace, Kingsland—road")—Anns' person was known at our shop for years, and we should not have advanced him money on anything—I had the loan-book got out, and directly he had written it, I opened the loan-book to see what name he wrote there—I said, "You have given the name of Anns now, there, it is Galley; it is a decided fraud"—he made no answer, but left the shop, came back with a policeman, and said to him, pointing to Wolstenholme, "I give that person into custody, for detaining my watch"—I detailed the circumstances to the policeman, and he said he could not do it, he had better summons Mr. Barker before the Lord Mayor—the prisoner said: "Oh! you can't take him into custody?"—the policeman said, "Let us hear the case," and then he said, "Oh! it is a case of fraud, I should give him into custody," and the prisoner was taken—on 26th Oct. I went to 24, Liverpool-street, a coffee-shop—I did not find that the pri<lb/>soner lived there—he was known as occasionally frequenting it, but had not been there for three weeks—I afterwards went to Anns' premises, 11, Labernum-terrace, Kingsland-road—I afterwards showed this chronometer to Messrs. Brockbank and Co., of Cowper's-court, Cornhill, and found it was never made by them, and afterwards to Mr. Carter, the rater, and found it never was rated by him.</p>

The prisoners came to my master's office on 12tb or 18th July, and applied for the house—the female had been before, and represented her name as Steed, and when she came on 12th or 13th she introduced the male prisoner as her husband, saying, "This is Mr. Steed"—he said he had been employed a number of years in the Ordnance Department at Woolwich, and the person who placed him there had given him a superior situation at Somerset House—I said I should require the usual references, and he referred me to Daniel Good, the landlord of his house, at Woolwich, and gave me his address—I found him at the address, and considered his representations satisfactory—he also referred me to Mr. Boudler, of Jewin-crescent—in consequence of those references, I let him the house, and he entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him sign it,</p>

The female prisoner came to me about 27th Sept., and wished to look at that house, and appointed for me to meet her husband there at four o'clock that afternoon—I went, met both the pri<lb/>soners, and they agreed to take the house—I asked the male prisoner for his reference—he gave me his name as Blessington; said he had been in the Excise at Woolwich, and was removed to Broad-street, and gave me the name, "Steed, 13, Wynyatt-street," as a reference, who, he said, was the landlord of the house he occupied at Woolwich—the male prisoner accompanied me to the door of that house—I saw a person there who represented himself as Mr. Steed, and his statements seemed satisfactory—we then returned to the house, where the female still was, and I let it to them, and gave them the key—the rent was 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I happened to pass the house in Wynyatt-street two or three days after, in the beginning of Oct., and saw it shut up, and the windows plas<lb/>tered over with mud—my suspicions were then aroused—I found the whole statement false, and I left a message to that effect at my house, and wished them to leave it immediately—a man calling himself Keen, who said he lived in Smith-street, called on me directly after, said he worked for Mr. Blessing<lb/>ton, and he considered they were very respectable parties—I said I was not satisfied, and wished them to quit it—the possession was given up to me three or four days ago, since the prisoners have been in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, in the Goswell-road. About the end of Oct. the female prisoner, and a man she represented to be her husband, not the male prisoner, came to my shop—they stated that their name was Keen, and they lived at 5, Upper Smith-street, Northampton-square—they said an uncle of theirs had died, they wanted a little mourning, and wished credit for a short time—that he had left them 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was likely to be paid in five or six weeks—I required a reference, and they referred me to Mr. Leighton, of Remington-street, a builder—I agreed to call on him, and they were to call on me to know the result—I called that day or the day after, and saw Leighton, it was the male prisoner—I said, "You are Mr. Leighton, the builder?"—he said, "Yes"—I then asked if he knew Mr. Keen, of 5, Upper Smith-street, he said he did—I said they wanted goods on credit, and asked if he would give them a character—he said he would give them an excellent character; they had lost a friend, and he had lent them money—he gave me to understand they were husband and wife—I asked him how long he had resided at that house, he said, some consider<lb/>able time—I think he told me twelve months—I told him, in consequence of the character I had no objection to give credit; and he said it would be all right, it was quite safe—the parties came again that evening, and</p>

               <p>asked if I had been to see Mr. Leighton, I told them I had—they asked if I was satisfied, and I said I should have no objection to let them have the goods—the female said she hoped it would be settled in six weeks, and wished to look out the goods—I said it was late, and wished it to be postponed till the Monday—the female came on the Monday, and began selecting some twill merinos and other things, to the amount of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while she was selecting them, I called her away from the counter, and said, "You are Mrs. Keen?"—she said she was—I told her I did not like to go much above 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and she said I need not frighten myself, that her husband was a respect<lb/>able working man, and it was all right—she said her husband worked for Mr. Leighton—the goods were afterwards sent to the place she asked—she came again in two or three days for some more goods—I called her into the parlour, and told her the bill was between 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—she said, oh, she had done nothing but what her husband knew of—a short time after, I re<lb/>ceived this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I sent for Keen—he came to the shop, and I asked him questions out of the letter—I asked him if his cousin was a respectable man, as he wanted to have goods on credit—he said it would be quite safe to let him have the goods, he was a very respectable hard-working man, and lived in Shoreditch—in consequence of suspicion, I afterwards made inquiry at Smith-street, and saw only the servant—I went to Remington-street, and could not get admission—on Saturday evening, 10th Nov., I went again to Remington-street with a policeman—after a time we got admission, and there found the two prisoners—I said to the female, "You are the woman I want, as Mrs. Keen"—she said," This is my husband; he did not give you a false reference"—the male prisoner was at her side—I looked at the male, and recognised him as the man who had given me the character—I gave them both in charge—the male prisoner cried, and on going to the station, the female said, "I never had any goods of you—they both gave the name of Leighton at the station—on the Monday evening I went with the policeman and the two prisoners again to Remington-street, and on the way the female said, "I declare to God I have not got the goods; I gave them to Keen; if I was let go I could produce them easily"—when she first came to the shop she was very respectably dressed, better than afterwards.</p>

On this evening, I went into the parlour of the White Hart, and there were two or three gentlemen lying just inside the door on the top of each other—I suppose they had been fighting—Mr. Parry was stand<lb/>ing at the further corner of the room, and I saw him cane Mr. Moore, a very respectable old tradesman of Greenwich, with his stick—I think Mr. Parry was in his shirt-sleeves when I went in; I will not be sure; I know he was, some part of the evening—Walker went in with me, and be picked up a gentleman named M'Killan, a wine-merchant; the potman helped—after we came out of the parlour, and the scuffle had been quieted, Mr. French, the landlord, got Mr. Wilcox, another old gentleman, out, and put him in the bar<lb/>parlour, and the prisoner said, "I have picked up something; look here," and he rolled it along the counter: it was a tailor's measure, a round thing that wound up, like that produced—the prosecutor wanted to fight again two or three times, and wanted to get to Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Moore, and we would not let him—there had been some disturbance with them about some punch.</p>

On 18th Nov., Brown came in without hit jacket or bat, and asked for a quarter of a pound of Dutch cheese, and a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—I gave them to him—he threw down a crown-piece—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he took it up very quickly, and ran to the door—I followed him with the crown-piece, and saw him take his jacket and bat from Cronin—the two other prisoners joined them opposite my shop, and all four went up the street together—I marked the crown-piece, and gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor. On 28th Nov. about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners in a public-house at Dockhead—they asked me to treat them, and I did so, and changed a sovereign—I put my change in a bag in my right trowsers pocket—I then had sixteen shillings in it, in half-crowns and shillings; it was mostly shillings—there was one new one—when I came out, I met two women; I asked them where I could get a lodging—the pri<lb/>soners followed us—Cummins caught hold of me on one side and Morgan on the other—I said, "I will not have anything to do with you, if that is the way you are going on"—they said if I would give them a pint of gin they would keep clear of me—I went back and treated them—I came out again</p>

               <p>and they followed me—when we got to the lodging outside the door, Cum<lb/>mings struck me in the face—I fell with my head against the step of the door, and my senses were gone—I knew nothing more after that—when I came to, my bag and money were gone—I was not sober.</p>

I am booking-clerk at the Richmond station—it was my duty to receive the excess fares from the collectors—I did so on 25th Aug.—the prisoner did not account to me for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received by the thirty-five minutes past four train—there is no 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. here (<hi rend="italic">producing a book</hi>)—he did not on the 2d Sept. account for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the ten minutes past four train-there is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. entered in this book; but I do not know in whose writing it is—that is by the 7h. 30m. train—there is no 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the ten minutes past four train nor 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by that train—it would be the prisoner's duty, if he received these sums, to enter them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does it happen that they cannot always put the fares opposite the trains they come by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe that is sometimes im<lb/>possible—I do not know that it is customary to put them opposite some other trains; but I believe it to be almost impossible sometimes to put them opposite the right train. I can say there have been omissions, and they have said,"We omitted to put this as we had so much;" I believe that it has been often—Sunday is a busy day; and on Saturday evening, if it is fine, many persons go down and sleep there.</p>

I do not see any entries of excess fares by the ten minutes past four train from London—special trains would not be entered in this book—they would be put down in the next train that would follow at half-past seven—here is "2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." here, but not "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." by that train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am general traffic-manager on the London and South-Western Railway—I had been down to the ticket-collectors about a fortnight before 25th Aug.—I had seen the prisoner, and had some conversa<lb/>tion with him and the other collector—I did not give them any directions with reference to their keeping these books for the future—I merely made inquiry in what manner they were in the habit of entering the account of their excess fares—they both said they were in the constant habit of making the entries immediately after the departure of the train, and paying the money to the clerk; there was a train which left on Sunday, 2d Sept., and it would be the duty of the collectors to enter the fares received by that im<lb/>mediately after the departure of the train, whether it were general or a special train.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Mason, a hay-dealer of Bushy; on 14th Nov. he sent me to London with a load of hay, to sell. I went to Charing Cross—I saw the prisoner there—I had not known him before; he asked if I would sell the hay, and what I wanted for it—I told him three guineas; he said that was too much—I said, "Well, then, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a shilling for myself?"—he said, "Well, I will have it"—I said, "I hope you are not going to take me far?"—he said, "No, only just over the water"—I Said, "There is another thing; I must not go home without the money, my master gave me orders not to go home without it"—he said, "Do you think I mean to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you out of the money?"—he said he would buy it—he said, "Let us go over and have a glass of gin;" and asked me if I had any halfpence,—I said, "No, only a few, but I have a sixpence"—he said, "You may as well let me have that till the hay is sold, and then I will give it you back again"—I was to have the money as soon as the hay was unloaded—he took me to a butcher's shop at Walworth, where he talked about selling it—ten of the trusses were taken in there, by order of Mr. Williams, the butcher—he bought the hay of the prisoner—the prisoner told me to stop there—no one carried it in—we put the cart up, and put the hay in the loft—he bought a quarter of a load, but there was one truss more put in by mistake, and there was one truss he did not like; it was put down and we put another one up—the prisoner went to get the money, and I was to stop round the corner—the prisoner came back and offered me five shillings—he said, "You had better take that to bind the bargain"—I said, "I cannot take that, I must have it all"—a cowman came along and bought the remainder of the hay of the prisoner, not of me—I do not know what he was to give for it—we went down to his house—I do not know where he lived—I am no scholar—when we got there he helped to take out the remainder of the hay—I asked for the money—the prisoner said he could not pay me—we came along, a little way from the place—there was one man with him; he gave the man a half-sovereign, what change the man gave him I do not know—the prisoner then said I must stop in town all night; he put the horse up, and said he would pay the expense; he said he had to take 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Friday morning and he would pay my money and the expenses—I was forced to stop, for I could not go away without the money—I followed him very closely—he said, "I wish you would go home."</p>

I am clerk to Mr. John Ruck, who carries on business as John Ruck and Co., at Topping's Wharf, Tooley-street; he sells grease, lard, and butter; Butler and Finch were in his employ, as porters. In consequence of something we heard, two police<lb/>men were requested to watch the premises, on the morning of 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Dec.; I was also vigilant—on that morning I received a communication from one of the policemen, and I went to Wellington-street; I saw a cart there, which contained two barrels and three firkins—the prisoner Dipple was sitting in the cart—after a short time Merity came up the steps leading from my employer's premises to London-bridge; he got into the cart, and as he got in, Dipple spoke to him; directly he got in, the cart drove on—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and a constable who was with me got on the box of it; that was about fifty yards behind the cart—I observed Dipple point me out to Merity directly he got into the cart, and they drove on across the bridge—I then saw Dipple point out the policeman to Merity, and directly he saw the policeman on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he turned back, and drove over the bridge more rapidly than I could follow them—I followed as fast as I could, and the policeman followed in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; the cart went down Duke-street, where the front of our premises are—I took a short cut, and arrived at the back of the premises, just as the cart arrived—I saw Merity and Dipple jump out—Merity said to Dipple, "Look sharp!"—they wheeled two barrels out of the cart, and attempted to wheel them into the cellar; I prevented it, by seizing hold of Merity and Dipple, and the barrels remained on the pave<lb/>ment—Merity said, "Let me go, it is all right"—I said, "No, certainly not"—I kept hold of him, but was obliged to leave my hold of the othe—the policeman came up; Merity then endeavoured to get me off him—he said, "Let me go"—I said, "I will not"—he swung me round, and came over the cellar—he plunged into the cellar, and endeavoured to pull me in, but he did not—the policeman came up—Dipple had a barrel in his hand—the policeman took him—I went by another way into the cellar, and met Merity as he was rushing up; and he and I had another struggle in the cellar—Butler and Finch were taken immediately afterwards—one of the barrels was full of lard, and the other half full—one of the firkins contained butter, and the other two grease—the two firkins of grease had been paid for, but they were all in Mr. Ruck's possession—the other things were Mr. Ruck's—Merity said to Butler, "You know, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, you gave me these things to sell; I was to get a customer for them"—Butler replied, "I know nothing but what you paid for; I gave you a receipt for what you paid"</p>
