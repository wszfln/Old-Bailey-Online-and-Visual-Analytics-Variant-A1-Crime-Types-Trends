On 15th Aug., the prisoner and another person came and asked me if I would purchase a horse—I said, I would see it in the morning—next morning the prisoner came alone—I walked with him to the Fountain public-house, Mile-end-road, to look at the horse—there were three men there; one of them, I believe, had brought the horse up from the country—I told the prisoner I thought the horse was not worth more than 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was worth all the money which was asked, which was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I said to him, "Is it all right about this horse, you are not going to take me in?"—he said, No, so help him, Jesus Christ, he would sooner suffer his arms to be severed from his body than take me in—I bought it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told him to bring it home, which he did—he then asked me to let him put it in harness, that he might show it to a person, and he and my man put it in—he drove off with it—he said he should be back in an hour—he never returned—the cart and harness came back about eleven o'clock at night.</p>

                  <lb/>night, I was in Orchard-place—there was a crowd of people there, and I saw the prisoner among them—I saw a crowd round the door of No. 26, and saw Bewley telling the prisoner to go in—he was drunk, and swearing, and stamping, and grinning at Bewley, and said he would be b—d if he would go in—he went just on to the sill of the door, and was very violent indeed—I saw him make seven or eight blows at Bewley—I could not see whether he had anything in his hand—I was two or three yards off—he was standing with his left arm round the door-post, and with his right he was stabbing at Bewley, but could not get a reach at him—Bewley did not strike or offer any violence to him—after he was struck at several times he called out, "I am stabbed; he has got a knife; draw your staves"—I drew my staff—the prisoner still stood there stabbing—he would have stabbed me if I had not kept myself back—his room is the parlour on the right-hand side of the passage—while I was drawing my staff, Topp rushed into the room and took him into custody—he was partly in and partly out of the room at the time-there were several women in the room trying to pull him in, but he would not go—he was very drunk and violent—he was taken to the station, which was about a quarter of a mile off—a great mob followed us—there were four or five policemen—I was behind Topp, keeping the crowd back with my staff—the mob called out, "Go steady, go steady"—I did not strike the prisoner, and I did not see anybody else do so—I should have struck him, when I had got my staff out, if Topp had not rushed by me—it was unsafe to approach him without disarming him—it was dark in the passage—he got the blow over the head by falling down on the stones in the station—he was very violent, and would not be searched—the injury is not the result of any blow struck by the police—he threw himself down—I found this knife on him, with three blades (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Orchard-place is a low, noisy place.</p>

I saw Bewley—I examined his thigh, and found that he had received a stab in the upper part of it, corresponding with two cuts in his coat and trowsers—the wound was nearly an inch and a half deep and half an inch in width—it was exactly such a wound as would be the result of a puncture by a small knife—it was not bleeding then—his drawers were covered with blood, and they had also been cut—I have been in attendance on him ever since, and he is not yet well—he is not fit to be in Court now—it will be some time before he will be able to resume his duties—it is a very awkward wound indeed, and independent of that, he received several other blows in the scuffle.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living at 5, Glasshouse-street, White<lb/>chapel. On Thursday 14th Dec. I was in the Sir Sidney Smith public-house in Dock-street, in front of the bar, with a young man, a sailor—the prisoner came in with a jacket on his arm, and in a very improper manner asked the young man with me for relief—the words he used are not fit to express—I told him that was not the way to ask for relief, and if he asked properly I would not hinder the young man from giving him what he liked—he then offered his jacket for sale—the young man said he did not want to buy a jacket, and if he did he should not buy one of him, and told him to go about his business—he was told so more than a dozen times, but would not go—he called me a cow, a sow, and a mare, putting other dreadful words to it—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him, he struck me and knocked me down, and as I was trying to get up I caught hold of his arm and he struck me twice under the eye—I bled very much indeed—I could not judge with what instrument it was done—I felt him pull<lb/>ing it out of my eye—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there till the Saturday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a boarding-house, at 5, Glasshouse-street. On Thursday night, 14th Dec, I was in the Sir Sidney Smith—the prisoner came in, and offered a jacket for sale to a young man, one of my lodgers, who was with Connell—he said if he wanted a jacket he should not purchase one of him—the prisoner was repeatedly told to go away—some altercation took place between the prisoner and Connell, but I did not hear the words that were made use of—after he had used some expressions to her she pushed him towards the door, and he raised his hand and struck at her downwards—I was not aware at the time that the blow had taken effect on her eye—I afterwards saw it—his hand was closed when he struck her—she fell, and as I was in the act of picking her up, he struck her over my shoulder again in the eye—there were four or five foreigners standing there, and they very much illused the prisoner—I interfered to protect him, and he went out—after he was gone I heard that Connell had been stabbed with a knife or razor, and I saw the blood running, and went out after the prisoner, overtook him, and brought him part of the way back—he then made some resistance—I said, "You shall come back with me, and I will not leave you"—he then said, "Then here goes for life or death," and he made a hit at my head, but it fell on my breast, and it ripped my jacket open—I was not aware that he had anything in his hand, but when I got him to the house I found that my coat was torn—when I took him into the house he had something in his right hand—he was about to put it into the breast of his flannel-shirt, when I took it out of his hand; it was a razor; it was not open—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody—I believe he was the worse for liquor.</p>

The prosecutrix was brought there on Thursday, 14th Dec.—she had two stab wounds beneath the right eye, which penetrated to the bone—there was a great deal of inflammation of the eye and face on that side—she is suffering from the effects now—the blunt heel of the razor closed would produce such wounds, and if the wounds had been a trifle higher up the effect would have been very serious injury to the eye—it must have required considerable force to make the wounds; such a force as a downward blow would have.</p>

I was going through Judd-street about three in the afternoon of 27th Dec.—I saw Mrs. Glavin sitting on a step of a door—I saw her get up, and I saw a parcel lying on the step where she had been sitting—I suppose it must have dropped out of her clothing as she got up—I saw the prisoner pick it up—I knew him by sight—he must have seen Mrs. Glavin sitting there, he was close by her—I called out, "Mistress, you have dropped something"—she turned round—the prisoner walked a little way and then ran, and I lost sight of him—there was a woman with him.</p>

I saw Mrs. Glavin stooping down to the step, and a small paper parcel lying by her—I saw two women and a lad standing just against her when she was stooping—I saw the lad pick up the parcel and put it in his pocket—he turned to the two women who were standing on the pavement—the prosecutrix turned and missed the parcel—I saw her looking about for it—I spoke to her, she did not understand me—she went towards the New-road—the boy who picked up the parcel stood with the two women—they then parted, he walked with one of them a few yards and then left her and ran away.</p>

On Friday, 15th Dec., the prisoner came there, and asked for a packet of cocoa, which came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him two dark worn shillings and fourpence-halfpenny in change—he took them up, and dropped one behind some wood in front of the counter where I could not see—he stooped down, picked it up, and put two shillings on the counter, and said, "This cocoa will not do"—I asked him why, he said, he wanted a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packet—I told him I had none, there was no such thing as 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. packets, but if he took two they would be 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said they would not do, for they were not for him—I told him to take them, and if they would not do, I would return his money again—he then took the two packets, left the shilling and fourpence-halfpenny on the counter, and went out—directly he was gone, I took up the money, I saw one of them was a white one, quite different from either I had given him—I went to look for a policeman, and Bashford came to the door—I found the prisoner in his custody—I saw the shilling in Bashford's possession afterwards, I did not see him take it—I marked it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of St. Katherine's-dock. On 16th Dec., about a quarter before nine o'clock, I was there, with many others—the warehouses lettered D and F are both in Nightingale-lane—the labourers assemble at the gates early in the morning, waiting to have their names called over, to be set to work—I had been to the F warehouse that morning, and went from there to D, with about 200 others—the crowd extended into the road, as there was not room—I saw the prisoner driving a laden coal-wagon, coming from the wharf towards East Smithfield—that would bring him to gate F first—when I first saw him he had passed F, and was coming towards D—I do not know the width of the road at F—there certainly was room for the prisoner to have passed F without coming foul of any of the men there—I saw him pass F warehouse—I had advanced from F gate—I heard an alter<lb/>cation between the men and the prisoner, and they had been shouting to him because he had driven so close to them—he stopped his horses, threw down his whip and coat, in order to go back and fight with any of the men—I was then about midway between F and D—the prisoner went back, and was knocked down twice—he then took up his hat and coat, and went with his wagon towards D warehouse—I was then on the flag-stones, about twenty or twenty-five yards from F, going towards D, to seek employment there, at there was no chance at F—I was on the near side of the wagon—the prisoner was on the near side, driving towards D—the gates F and D are on the near side—as he advanced towards D warehouse I was close to the gate, waiting for Mr. Hunter, the wharfinger, to call the men on; and when the prisoner got there there were about 150 men waiting for work, and I saw him throw his whip over the wheel horse's neck, which brought the horse and the wagon nearer to him, and in closer contact with the men than there was any neces<lb/>sity for—in about half a minute the men cried out that a man was on the ground, and the wheel had gone over his head—I advanced, and saw the man lying on the ground—his name was Lewis Lewis—I used to work with him—the prisoner was going at a regular steady pace at the time—the body was six or seven feet from the pavement, quite in the middle of the road, which I think is about twenty-one feet wide there from one kerb to the other—there was room for the wagon to have passed without coming in contact with the men.</p>

On the morning of 16th Dec., about twenty-five minutes to nine o'clock, I was waiting for employment at the F gate, and saw the prisoner come with a coal-wagon and three horses—when he came to F gate he was about eight inches from the backs of the men—there was room for him to have gone further from them on the off side—when opposite F gate he put his whip over the middle horse, and drew his horses close in among the body of men, who were near run over, and after he passed F about two or three yards some words occurred between him and a dockman—there were angry words on both sides—they came to blows; the prisoner was knocked down on the broad of his back—he got up, and two or three more assisted in knocking him down again, and when he got up the second time he was bleeding from the face—he would have no more of the fight, and went away towards D gate, where there was a call for labourers—I walked about a yard behind the prisoner, on the same side of the way—he made an observa<lb/>tion that he would give it to some of the b—s at the next gate if they did did not get out of his way—I told him he deserved all he met with at F—he said, "Who the hell are you?"—I went on in advance of him to D—I had</p>

I was waiting for employment on 16th Dec., at F gate—I saw the prisoner with his wagon—he threw his whip over the shaft horse's head, and that caused the horse to bear in among the body of 4 or 500 men at F—he then went half-way up Nightingale-lane, stopped his wagon, came back, and <hi rend="italic">showed fight</hi>—two or three men <hi rend="italic">set</hi> on him and knocked him down—as he proceeded from where the wagon had stopped, to D, I heard him say, "I will run over some of the b—s at the next gate."</p>

I was waiting for employment at the D gate, on 16th Dec,—I saw the prisoner with his wagon within about two feet of where I stood—I saw him throw the lash of his whip across the shaft horse's neck, and by so doing he brought the horse in from a foot to eighteen inches on the body of men; and in less than a minute after, I heard a cry that a man was run over—the men were standing out into the road—there was room for him to have passed along the road and have avoided the men.</p>

I was at D gate on the morning of 16th, waiting for work—there were some horses coming up—I got from the mob on to the kerb, until the head of the wagon passed; then hearing a cry that a man was dead, I went into the road to see what was the matter, and saw the deceased lying with his head quite flat to the wheel, and blood gushing out from all parts—the wagoner was going on quite unconcerned, as if nothing was the matter—I went, took him into custody, brought him back to the gate, and delivered him to the Dock Company's officer—where the man was run over there was about ten or twelve feet of road—there was plenty of room if he had gone on the other side, to have avoided running over anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drayman, in the service of Hoare and Co., of Lower East Smithfield. On 16th Dec. I was driving a dray through Nightingale-lane, in the direction of Upper East Smithfield—I remember passing F warehouse, and then observed a coal-wagon—there were a great many people round the gate—the men said they would serve me the same as they had the wagoner—I turned round, laughed at them, and said I had been in the habit of driving over the road a great many years and I had never met with any accident, and I hoped I should not then—I went driving on seven or eight yards behind the coal-wagon—I followed it till it got to D gate—there were a great many people waiting there—just as the wagon got opposite the gate there was a rush back of the people—I saw the deceased—he was the outside roan of the crowd—he was knocked backwards against the shafts of the wagon—the shaft knocked him down, he fell on his face; and before he had time to recover himself both wheels passed over him—the prisoner was then between his first and second horses—he had three horses—he had nothing whatever to do with the accident—the deceased fell behind the prisoner—I saw the prisoner hold his whip in a proper way, to keep the horses off the crowd at his shaft horse's head—I have driven through these crowds for seventeen years—I did not see the scuffle at F—the wagon was moving on when I came up—I attended the inquest.</p>

On Saturday evening, 16th Dec., about a quarter or ten minutes past seven o'clock, I went into my bed-room, which is the front room on the first-floor, to make the bed—there are two chests of drawers in that room, rn one of which my husband always keeps his money—it is a small drawer, and is always kept loeked—it was to all appearance safe as usual at that time, and the window quite shut—it had not been opened that day—it is a small sash-window, with a catch at the side—I did not notice whether that catch was up or down at the time—I came down stairs, and in about twenty or twenty-five minutes a little girl, named Sarah Ann Sharp, came and told me something—I immediately took a light, and ran up to my bed-room—I could not get in—I called same men to <hi rend="italic">vay</hi> assistance, and afterwards got in—I found a chaif had been placed</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of William White, of 22, Brandon-street, nearly opposite Mr. Butler's, and am a milliner. On Saturday evening, 16th Dec, about half-past seven o'clock, I was going from the Kent-road to my own house, and had occasion to pass Mr. Butler's on the opposite side of the way—I saw a man looking out of the bed-room window, which was wide open—I was then eight or ten yards off—I looked at him, and I believe he saw me, for he drew back into the room—I saw another man on the pavement, under the window, with an umbrella—it was raining—I had an umbrella up, leaning over my right shoulder—I heard the man under the window say, "<hi rend="italic">Damme</hi>, be quick"—the man then came forward to the window again, and jumped out into the street—whether he jumped from the window, or first stepped on the ledge, I cannot tell—I had not an opportunity of seeing his face fully the first time; the second time I saw it perfectly—the prisoner is the man—I had very frequently seen him before at Mr. Butler's, where I was in the habit of going twice a day for my beer—I never spoke to him, and did not know his name—in the summer-time he was generally sitting on a form outside the bar-window—there is a gaslight in the bar-window; that threw a light up towards the first-floor quite sufficient for me to see the man, and when he jumped down, the man with the umbrella first ran, the prisoner followed him round the corner—I immediately went in, and described the man to Mrs. Butler—when the prisoner alighted on the ground I was not more than two yards from him—I was crossing the road, and I stood still when he jumped, by the side of a chaise-cart—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the person.</p>

               <p>since the summer, but I did not know where he lived—he used to be in com<lb/>pany with a stout man—I knew that stout man by sight, for I had to take home some dresses to a person at 25, Charles-street, Lock's-fields, and this stout man opened the door to roe, which made me notice him particularly afterwards—I have seen him sitting with the prisoner before that and after<lb/>wards also—I did not know his name either—the prisoner used to wear a hat; on this night he had a black shiny cap on, like oilskin, I cannot say whether it had a front to it—it was not over his face—it seemed on the crown of hit head—it was a darkish night—there was no light, except from the bar-parlour—I am certain that the shutters of the bar-parlour were down—I saw a little girl in advance of me; I do not know her name, the was nearer to Mr. Butler's house than I was—she gave the first alarm—the next time I saw the prisoner was on the Wednesday morning following, the 19th, at the station—the sergeant came after me, and told me he had got the man—he did not point him out to me—I was sent into the room—there were several men there—I was sent in to recognise the man that I had been in the habit of seeing at Mr. Butler's, and I knew him in a minute—I cannot tell how he was dressed, no more than the cap—I saw his features very clearly—the light was thrown upon his face from the bar<lb/>window, which is a bow<lb/>window—the gas<lb/>lamp outside was not alight, but the gas inside the window was, and I saw the prisoner's features from that—it is a large window, all glass—it is flat to the house, not a bow—I did not notice the man's face the first time, but the second time, when he got out, I saw it perfectly, as he was getting out, and at the window—those were the only opportunities I bad of seeing him—he had nothing on his face—his cap was on his head—I could see his face plainly—I did not notice whether he had whiskers—I had always seen him with whiskers—I did not run alter him—I am timid, and I imme<lb/>diately went in and told Mrs. Butler.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 82). I was called to Butler's house on Saturday, 16th Dec.—I saw some marks on the leaden ledge outside the first-floor window, apparently from shoe-nails—the ledge extends about eight inches from the wall over the bar-window—it is put to carry the wet off—it is level, so that a person could stand on it, and get from it in at the front window—a person could easily get from the ground to that ledge, it is only six or seven feet high—it is a very low house; you go down a step to get into it—if one man assisted another to get up, of course it would be easier—I received from Mrs. Butler a description of a person—I also received other information, in consequence of which I sought for the prisoner—I bad seen him before, but did not know his name—I went to 72, St. Andrew's-road, Kent-road, and with other constables watched that house from two o'clock on Sunday until Tuesday night, 19th, about nine, when I saw the prisoner come into St. Andrew's-road, come along on the opposite side to where he lived, and pass his house, 72—after he had passed it four or five houses, he crossed the road in a slanting direction, went into an a venue or court leading into St. George's-road, about a dozen or eighteen steps, then returned and went on the same side of the way as his house, and just as he got to the door he coughed—he did not knock—the door was opened almost</p>

               <p>immediately, and he went in—he remained there that night—I watched the whole of the night with two other constables—he was taken into custody next morning at half-past ten, by Davis.</p>
