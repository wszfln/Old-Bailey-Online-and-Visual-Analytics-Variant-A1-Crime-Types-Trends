                  </hi>. I am a widow. My husband died on the 26th of October, 1837—he carried on the business of a cheesemonger, in Ship-tavern-passage, Leadenhall-market, till his death—I have continued it since—the prisoner was in his employ, previous to his death, for nearly four years, I think, and he continued in my employ after my husband died—he bought and sold nearly all the goods—I dated some tickets, threaded</p>

               <p>them, and hung them on nails, in different parts of the shop, for conve<lb/>nience—the shopmen were to take these tickets down, and put on them the article sold, the weight, and the price received, and then they were taken the last thing at night, or the first in the morning, and compared with the till money, to see that it was right—on the 27th of October, I gave Mr. Osborne 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in half-sovereigns, half-crowns, two shillings, and one sixpence, but I do not know what number of half-crowns—I did not see him mark it—on the Saturday following I saw him come into my shop—after he made his purchase I went round to the tills, I looked into the first, and there were not any half-crowns in it, I opened the second till, and saw four half-crowns—I knew they were four of those that I had given to Mr. Osborne, because they were of one coinage—I put these four half-crowns into my pocket, which was empty—I then went to the prisoner—he was behind the counter making out the ticket—he was writing when he was called away to serve another customer—when he went away he left the ticket on the counter, which he had begun to make out—I looked at it, and read it for 11 shillings—I shortly afterwards took it up, and delivered it to the officer, and it was the weight, not the price—it was 11 ¾ lb.—I delivered the same to the officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a malt factor, and live in Queenside.

I know the Fletchers, the father and the three others-three packages were brought to our place by Butler—one was a large bale, which appeared to be soft like wool—one was a crate, which appeared to be china, packed with straw, and the other a hard package, which appeared to be cloth—it was a close, flat, narrow package—I observed a hole in the covering of the hard package, and saw dark cloth through it—after they had arrived, the elder Fletcher came with Mitchell, and a town cart, to take them away—that was about four o'clock in the afternoon, I think—he lives over at Temple Mills, towards Stratford—he helped to load them—he asked the carman if there was convenience to ride—Fletcher went away first towards the public-house, and the cart went after him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Fox-buildings, Kent-street, and have lived there since July last. Ellen Fletcher keeps the house-her husband John Fletcher also lived there—after I had been there a fortnight, Ellen Fletcher told me her father-in-law had some cloth in pawn, and she would ask him to get some out, and let me try to sell it—Fletcher, sen., called two or three days after, and after that she said she had asked him and he would get them out for me—in the course of two or three days after, Fletcher, sen., called and brought one piece of black kerseymere, and asked me to fold it up in a proper way—it was all rumpled then and not folded in a business-like way—I folded it up into the old folds which there had been—he then went away for about half-an-hour, and brought another</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260031"/>
               <p>piece something similar to it—I folded that up also—he said it was a very nice piece of kerseymere—I asked him if he had brought them for me to sell—he said no, he had sold those at the West-end—he stopped about half an hour, and took the two pieces away with him—he called again in two or three days-George Chappell was with him on both occasions—he brought a piece of cloth with him the third time, which he said I might try and sell—there was twenty-five yards and three quarters—Ellen was not in the room—she was in the back-kitchen at the time—she came in afterwards, but said nothing about the cloth—she said she had sold a pair of trousers to a young man at Walmsley's, the pawnbroker, if the old man would let her take the piece there, and have it cut off, and George Chappell was to go with her to represent it as his—he went with her—when they came back the old man was sitting in a chair by the side of the table—Ellen said she had sold two yards and a quarter, and George Chappell gave the old man 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—the old man went away with Chappell, and said he should come back in the evening about six o'clock to see what I had sold—they called about that time, and I told them I had sold none-old Fletcher then told me I must sell it by Saturday night, if I could, for he wanted the money—I was to meet him at the Star, in Gracechurch-street, on Saturday night, which I did—I tried to sell it on the Friday, but could not, and I pawned it at Attenborough's in Charlotte-street, for four guineas, in the name of John Bates, Berwick-street, and gave him the money on Saturday night-in the middle of the following week old Fletcher called again, and brought thirty-three lbs. of thread, which he asked me to try and sell—he afterwards asked if I would try and sell another piece of kerseymere, if he got it out—I said I would try—he told me to come with him, and he would give me a piece—I went with him to Cresswell's, a pawnbroker, at the corner of Trinity-street, Borough—he went in there, and I with him—he gave them a ticket, and while he was doing that I went out to try to sell some of the thread—when I returned he was waiting outside for me, with the kerseymere in his hand—I took it home—it had a ticket on it of twenty-two yards and a half, but he sent me for a measure, and it measured nearly twenty-six yards, or more—on taking it home I found Ellen there—she said if I would let her have it, she had sold some to Waterman, the publican, for a pair of trousers—I let her have it, and she went away to Waterman's—she came back and asked me to go to Waterman's, and cut off three yards for Waterman, and two and a quarter for another young man who was there—I went and cut it off—I have since understood the young man's name to be Spriggs, or Spinks—she told me to leave the cloth there, as some of Waterman's friends might come in, and he would see if he could persuade them to have it—I left it there for two or three hours, and then went for it, and took it out to try and sell it—Ellen met me when I came outside, and said she would take it elsewhere, and try to sell it—I gave it to her, and she returned it to me with ten yards only left, which I pawned at Walmsley's, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and took the money to the old man, at the Star, in Gracechurch-street—Chappell was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I hold the lease of three houses in Fox-buildings, Kent-street. The prisoner, John Fletcher, was a tenant of mine—I have seen the other prisoners at John Fletcher's house, and also at Temple Mills—on the Thursday before Good Friday last, I saw the witness Tibbs and old Mr. Fletcher in the back yard at Fox-buildings—I did not notice par<lb/>ticularly how old Mr. Fletcher was dressed—he seemed to have a brown coat on—I believe he was dressed as he generally was—there was a cart there—I did not see any thing taken out of the cart, but I saw a bundle in the back parlour-old Fletcher was then gone into the front parlour, and there was only Tibbs and Ellen Fletcher present—I took hold of the bundle, and said, "What have you here?"—Tibbs said it was a bale of goods that he had brought from the docks—I went into the front parlour to old Fletcher, and asked him for some money for the rent that was owing—he said he would let me have some in the course of a few days—I had frequently seen Chappell and old Fletcher there together before that—I had never seen Barker—in July last Ellen Fletcher called on me, in consequence of which, I went to No, 2, Fox-buildings, and saw Chappell, old Fletcher, and Midgley there, in the parlour, and I passed through into the back parlour—I saw Chappell and Midgley go out together-Midgley had a bundle on his shoulder, fastened up in brown paper-old Fletcher came into the back parlour to me—I asked him if he had got any rent for me, as he had promised me some several times, and had not fulfilled his promise—he said he had not got any money for me then, but in the course of a few days he would—he said he should have a piece of black merino in about a week, if I would purchase it—I asked him what would be the price of it—he said, "About half-a-crown a yard"—after they were all gone I asked Ellen if she did not intend to get rid of Mr. Midgley, as I thought she ought not to let him stop in the house, for I thought he had sold old Fletcher a duplicate—she said it was her father's goods, and not Midgley's—that was all that took place.</p>

I am an attorney-at-law, and live on Fish-street-hill, The prisoner was in my service—I perceive by the Law list that he has been an attorney himself—I agreed to pay him after the rate of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, but as he conducted himself well the first fortnight, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—(in consequence of an application from him I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he came into my service on the same day)—I received a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Peering and Mincett, late in the evening of the 7th of November—I placed it, with other cheques and bills, in my private iron chest, and locked it when I went away at night—it stood in my private room—the clerks had a right to go into the room for papers—it was my practice to open the chest in the morning, and unless I was going out for any length of time I left it open-no clerk had any right to go to my iron safe without my special directions—I had never directed the prisoner to go to it for this cheque—I did not examine my drawer till the afternoon of November 8th, and then I missed the cheque—I might have been fifteen or twenty minutes absent from my room on that day—my name is written on the back of the cheque, but it is in the prisoner's hand-writing—the prisoner was not at the office then—he had been there part of that day—I find by the book he had received in advance 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>the cheque out while I was there or not, but I never authorized you to take it out at all-your general authority was the law business of my office, and no other—the key of the iron safe was in it the whole of the day—the cheque was shut in the drawer—I am quite confident of that—it would have been a breach of trust for you to have taken cash out for office disbursements, without my special direction-you did not return the fol<lb/>lowing day—when you returned on the Saturday, I reproached you for your absence—I accused you of taking the cheque, and ordered you to make up your book—I do not recollect observing that I required all cheques to go through my bankers—I may have done it—I objected to your taking any thing out of my private drawers—I have got my letter book—I have no doubt there are many letters signed by you, of which I had no cognizance, but I saw them, and permitted them to go out in your hand-writing-you were managing clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing that I came to my duties on Monday, the 12th of November, would you ever have prosecuted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I had ex<lb/>amined and closely investigated your book, I should have followed up this prosecution-you have introduced two clients, one I have seen, the other I have not—I do not know whether they are clients or not—there was a policeman in the office when you returned, for some other purpose—I then taxed you with having robbed me to a considerable extent, and told the policeman to take note of it—I believe I requested you to call on the morrow, and you did, and having closely investigated your book, and seen a great waste of my money, I had you taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks in the London and Westminster bank. This is our cheque—we paid it—the cashier is not here, but I have his book to prove it has been paid, and charged to James Atkins and Son, who are customers of ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Under any circumstances I should feel extreme diffi<lb/>culty in addressing a Court in the humiliating position I am in-from his lordship's hands I expect every thing that justice can give, and from your hands, every consideration it deserves; be your verdict guilty or not, it is to me equally indifferent. If guilty, I shall receive it with that deep humility which I ought to feel: if not guilty, I shall leave this bar with the painful reflection that I have been here a criminal, which is to me the same as guilty. I avail myself of this occasion publicly to thank the prosecutor for the clemency he showed to me during the short time I was with him. I do not say this with any desire that he should recommend me to mercy, nor do I beg his Lordship to abate one <hi rend="italic">iota</hi> of the punishment due to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260042"/>
               <p>There are those in Court whom I know, and who would willingly have rendered me their assistance, but I would not accept of it; I only wish you to decide on the facts of the case, and if you consider that in this transaction I intended to injure or defraud Mr. Shaw, find me guilty; if you think, on the other hand; I did not premeditate an injury to him, your verdict will be, not guilty; but knowing the indictment is not true, I would not plead guilty; having done the prosecutor right, I feel I ought not to do myself wrong; and before Heaven I declare, I meant not to injure Mr. Shaw. The charge is, that I took out of his iron safe a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; when I entered into the employ I entered as confidential clerk, as one acting for him, and under all circumstances as he would have done if present; on many occasions I went to the iron safe, and very frequently while he was in the office, and he never at all objected to my doing so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES SHAW</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was on the 8th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it was paid the same day, which was Thursday—on Friday he did not come—he came on Saturday—I charged him with having taken the cheque out of my safe—he looked confused, and admitted he had taken it, and then it was put down-all the receipts were me, and for office purposes he had a cheque marked "Office"—that was my invariable rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Some observation has been made with reference to the time I made the insertion in the cash-book—I declare most solemnly that every evening when at the office, I made it up, and therefore I do not mean that Mr. Shaw intentionally says wrong in saying that it was not made up from the Saturday before, but it is wrong—I could not make the entry before I received it, and when I returned on the Saturday I entered it—the only observation Mr. Shaw made was in consequence of my making an obser<lb/>vation to him about two or three days before—I had made out the costs in a particular; action, and when I came on Saturday the 3rd, I asked him if the costs had been paid—the answer he gave was that they had been paid by cheque, and that that cheque was in his iron-safe—he went out in the course of the morning—on the 8th I had no money for disbursements at the Temple where I had to go—it was imperative that the business should be done, and I thought I could properly take it—I went and took it out, it was only over London-bridge a few steps, and I got it—I went to the Temple, and that is the head and front of my offending, no more-out of little things you may make great deductions—when I returned to the office, Mr. Shaw objected to my absence, very properly—I had been out—he looked over my book, and said there was a balance due to him—I said "Yes," and implored him to let me come to his office again—he said he would hot—I must, next morning, make up the balance due—I said I would do all I could—he said, "Call to-morrow morning," and he said to the policeman, "I shall give him into custody unless he brings the money to-morrow morning"—I said I was conscious I had not contemplated any injury, and I did return—that is all I can say—I am sure you will give the case that consideration it deserves, and ask yourselves whether I could intentionally have contemplated a fraud.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Clement's-lane. A bed and some bedding were found in my lodgings—Thumwood brought them there, I believe, but I was not at home-neither of the prisoners came to me after that before the officers did, but I met Thumwood in Drury-lane, and desired her to take her father's property away which was in my place, that was, the bed and bedding, and then Mr. James came and took the things, and asked if any duplicates were there, and he had some from a jug which were Mrs. Graham's, and I showed him some of my own.</p>

I entered his house on the 1st of July, and was to have two rooms for taking care of the house, and by so doing these things came to my house—he used to bring things to me, and brought the copper for one—I said I did not much fancy it—I continued there—my door was broken open, and my things taken away, and it was thought I had bad a hand in selling these things—I know no more of them than the man in the moon—my own mattrass and <hi rend="italic">kit</hi>, and leather, were taken by two men whom I have never seen since—I did not see the copper go away—I mended a pair of shoes, and made a pair of boots for the pro<lb/>secutor, which came to 18*.—I said I should take the drawers for it.</p>

M. Van Bergh, to J. Southgate, packer, Old 'Change, I truss, I V," in a diamond-"No. 1. 2 cwt 1 qr. 6 lbs. free," and signed "R.

On Saturday night, the 29th of September, about ten o'clock, I saw him by the Paviours' Arms, Ratcliff-high way—I saw him again about one o'clock on Sunday morning, in Bluegate-fields—he appeared pretty sober then—he had been drinking a little, but I do not think he was intoxicated—he told me he had been fighting—I went to have something to drink with him at the Bluegate-public-house—we were there about five minutes, and had some gin—I came up Bluegate-fields with him—I had my pattens on—he stood talking to a woman named Macey, who lives next door to the prisoner Collins's house—I went up to the top of the street, leaving him talking to the woman—he came up to me again, and we went to the Coach and Horses night-house, Ratcliff-highway—it was then between two and three o'clock—we had some more gin there—we went from there down Shakspeare's-walk—it was very dry there. he said he would carry my pattens, and I gave them to him to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer's servant. On the 27th of this month I was at the Blue-coat Boy public-house, in Dorset-street, Spitalfields, sitting in the tap-room, smoking my pipe—I had seen the prisoner in front of the bar—he came into the tap-room, and asked me whether I worked at Trueman and Hanbury's—I said no—he then asked whether I knew a person called <hi rend="italic">Long Dick</hi>—I said no—I did not wish to have any conversation with him, and went to the other side of the room—he came to me there, and forced his conversation upon me—I joked with him two or three words—he made use of some horrid vulgar expression—I did not know what it was, and he asked whether there was a poker in the room—I saw him stoop towards the fire-place, in the act of taking it up, and I almost instantly received a tremendous blow over the head—I was sitting with my hat off, leaning on the table, and did not perceive it coming—I lost my senses inconsequence of the blow—after I came to, I found myself all smothered in blood—I went to a surgeon—about nine or ten weeks previous, I had turned the prisoner out of the house for abusing the landlady—that was the only offence I had given him.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 27th of November, the prisoner Miles came to the bar and asked for change for a half-crown, which I refused-immediately after she went out, Hart came for a glass of half-and-half, and gave me a half-crown—I gave him four sixpences and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went out, and another female came in and asked for half-a-pint of beer—she put down a bad shil<lb/>ling—I said it was bad—she took it up and went out—I then looked in the till, where I had no more silver but the half-crown which I took of Hart, and found it was bad—I had apologized to him for giving him four sixpences, as I had no other silver there at all—I sent to the police-office and described the two prisoners, and the officer very soon afterwards took them.</p>

The house stands by itself in a small garden—on the 10th of November, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, while I was in my bed-room, I heard the fowls making a noise, and on looking out of the window, I saw a lad leaving the gate, with something under his arm—I ran down stairs in search of my servant, whom I found at the street-door talking to a woman—I sent the girl in one direction, while I followed the pri<lb/>soners—I met a butcher on horseback, and told him—he returned in about half an hour, with the two prisoners and a bundle, containing my servant's shawl-to the best of my recollection Griffin was the lad I saw go away from the gate—I only saw one person.</p>

                  </hi>—(<hi rend="italic">through an inter<lb/>preter</hi>.)I occupied the house, No. 4, Queen Anne-street; Admiral Donelly was my landlord. I paid 320<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—the prisoner was in my employment—when I came from France, he was my interpreter, and when I became acquainted with the profession, he became my assistant, and then my secretaire, as I cannot write. English—on the 30th of July, this year, he said to me that Admiral Donelly had told him I was again about going abroad, and that he would be much obliged to me if I would settle the quarter's rent about to be due—I replied, it was very strange that when I had just paid the quarter due during my absence, the Admiral should make such a request, and said, "I was desirous to prove to the Admiral that I feel the want of delicacy in his demand," and on that account, the very morning the quarter should be due, he should be paid—I said, "Write a cheque for him, and I will sign it"—the cheque being written, the pri<lb/>soner presented it to me to be signed, and I saw on the margin that that cheque was intended for the rent up to the 1st of August, 1838-here is on the margin, "30th July, rent to 1st of August, 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—this is the cheque—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I requested the prisoner to send it—he took it up, and folded it up in an envelope, and that was all I saw of it—I did not desire him to ask the Admiral's indulgence as to the rent—I asked him, shortly after giving him the cheque, whether he had remitted it, and he said he had given it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you and the prisoner been connected in affairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1830—I did not know him having any profession—he was introduced to me by Mr. Powell, a surgeon—I was living at No. 4 or 5, Parliament-street, at that time—he came as interpreter—Mr. Powell on introducing him said, "You have asked me for an interpreter, here is one"—he always remained with me as interpreter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter dated November</hi> 3rd, 1835, <hi rend="italic">commencing, "My dear Master</hi> ")—this letter is in the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. In the year 1835, and since, was the prisoner in the habit of perform<lb/>ing operations in surgery for you, on your patients? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not any other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260124"/>
               <p>than to introduce sounds or probes—that is a very small operation—it is not the custom in France to address an older, or superior surgeon, by the title of "master," but it is done—I have done it myself, not often—I have not counted how many times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you provide for the prisoner while he was in your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When he was first in my service he merely had his maintenance—after being with me a short time I told him, "I will not give you any employ<lb/>ment pay, but I will give you some compensation"—he did not manage my house-establishment, except as an intermediary, an agent, or in<lb/>terpreter, as I could not speak English—he paid bills for me after having permission from me—he did not act entirely for me while I was abroad—I left money with him, with express directions how to act, but I cannot give you the precise explanation thereupon through an interpreter—I left him some for the wants of the house, and that was also specified—so much to the butcher and baker, and other tradesmen—I never trusted to the pri<lb/>soner's discretion as to expenses—I had confidence in him, and I permitted him to receive money for me from my patients, but he invariably gave me an account of what he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to swear, when you went abroad, yon left sufficient money with the prisoner, and with sufficient directions for its appropriation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I swear it—that is, money that I left, or money that he might receive during my absence—I have remained abroad a longer time than I have said I should, when I left—when I left I did not always determine very exactly the time I intended to remain abroad—the prisoner had enough money for the expenses of the establishment in my absence, and he might draw on me—he often had more money than was necessary—I have never left him without money or the means of getting it—I do not remember it—I never left him without money—I departed last to go abroad on the 31st of March—the prisoner then had in his possession 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. White—he had it previous to my departure—(<hi rend="italic">referring to his papers</hi>)—on the 16th of February I had given the prisoner a cheque of 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he had 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 19th of March, and I know he received some during my absence—I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the butcher; 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the fishmonger; butter, eggs, &amp;c. 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; expenses during absence, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with requests to pay the servants, and finally to Mr. Biggs on his own account, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I went abroad, in March, 1837, the prisoner told me he had paid every thing, and I had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my banker's then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner in the habit of pledging things for you at the pawnbroker's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I have property now in pledge amounting to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and more—I have never employed the prisoner to pawn for me—I have not paid interest myself on things he has pawned—I cannot say what account I left at my banker's in March, 1837—it is an account to be in<lb/>quired into—I had overdrawn my account, but it was by a cheat of the pri<lb/>soner's—I had lent 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. White, with a condition that, when I should want it, he would return it—I had then requested Mr. White to send 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my banker's—the prisoner had written to me that Mr. Gooch, one of my patients, had sent me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I thought I had consequently at my banker's 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, for he had told me that 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was at the banker's, also the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-upon the faith of that, I gave the cheque, and overdrew the account, without being aware of it—I became apprised that I had no money at my banker's, but they honoured my cheque, although I overdrew them—I have asked Mr. White for money for other transactions—I had nearly</p>

               <p>1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. White, on a special agreement that the money was to be<lb/>come my own-in 1835, 1836, and 1837, I was not rich, but I had enough. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have not you told the prisoner repeatedly to raise money for you how be could, but money, money, yon must have? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember that at all—I can swear I have not—I never induced or requested the prisoner to obtain money for me by any means—I may have said I did not know how to procure funds, but I never told the prisoner to obtain it by any means whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it true that in 1837 you did not know how to obtain money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears I knew how to obtain it, since I did obtain it—I did not say I did not know how to procure funds, but that I wanted to procure them—I had always the intention to undertake some speculation—I have never been at a loss-a man who, like me, has a house, a carriage, and a horse, is never at a loss, as I can always reduce my expenses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not repeatedly told Mr. Biggs you must pawn or sell your horse or carriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but Mr. Biggs deceived me—he had in his hands 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. belonging to me, which he was spending-in 1836 he pro<lb/>cured 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from one Branfield, as a loan—I cannot say whether I received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that, and the prisoner the other while I was abroad, because I sent Mr. Biggs to Mr. Branfield to send the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot remember whether Biggs received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it for his general purposes—I never authorised the prisoner to borrow some hundreds of Mr. Borden, of Gros-venor-place—he did not decline, and refer me to the Lithontriptic Society—I will swear it never happened—I know Mr. Borden, of the Bank—I never applied to Mr. Borden to lend me money, nor desired the prisoner to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that the Lithontriptic Society voted you a gratuity of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, on the consideration of your distressed circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Had it been given on those terms, I would not have accepted it—I do not know in what year I received the first payment—I was not in distressed circumstances at the time I became acquainted with Mr. Borden—I am never in want of funds, as they come to me in an unexpected manner, and at all times—it depends entirely on my profession, which is fluctuating—I did not authorise die prisoner to borrow money of Mr. Gillet—I sent him to fetch money from my friends—Mr. Gillet told me, when I first came to England, whenever I wanted money to apply, and I should have it—since I have been in England I have borrowed money of him, and paid him, and I now owe him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I very likely borrowed 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him, but I cannot say—I have no recollection of applying that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by means of the pri<lb/>soner, to pay an acceptance that was overdue—I will swear I do sot re<lb/>member it—it is very likely I may have accepted a bill of £80 for a Mr. Taylor—I remember that bill was paid, but by what means I do not know—I was in the hands of the prisoner, for, in general, I did not read English—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I do not know how this piece came cut out of it—the last time I saw the piece in it was when I wrote it—I have never seen it since—my solicitor has had the charge of the letter for the last two months.</p>

               <p>

On the 8th of November, I saw the prisoner Squires's cart in Whitechapel—I then saw him with his cart in Wapping—I stopped him, looked into the cart, and saw some pig iron—I asked where he got it from—he said, "Oh, I bought it at a sale"—I said, "Well, perhaps you can show me the catalogue"—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a book, and said, "No, I did not buy it at a sale; I bought it of a man who did buy it at a sale"—I said, "Well, then, you can tell me who that man is, and I will go with you"—he said, "Yes, his name is Smith—he is a smith, and keeps a marine store-shop in Dog-row"—I examined the iron, and the mark "M" was on it—I then took him to Joseph Smith, the prisoner, and asked Smith if he had sold any pig-iron to Squires—he said, "Yes"—I told him there was a large square weight, with a mark on it—he said, "Yes"—I then asked Joseph Smith where he bought it—he said, "It is all right; I bought it of a man at the canal"—he said, "I bought it of the lock-keeper of the Old Ford Lock"—I said, "I will go there," and in going I said, "Perhaps he will deny it," and Squires said, "No, he cannot deny it, because we were all three together"—when we got to the lock, we found there James Smith—he was the lock-keeper—I asked him if he had sold this man any iron—he hesitated some little time, and said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "It is pig-iron; there is a large square mark, with R. C. C. on it"—he said, "I picked some of it out of the canal, and some fell out of the barge, on to the quay"—I said, "It is impossible for it to have fallen out in that way"—he said he hoped I would not let Mr. Golding know any thing about it, or else he should lose his situation—I then left him there, and desired him to attend the next day—I weighed the iron, and found there were thirteen</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable and porter at the Strand Union workhouse. On the 23rd of October I took a turn round the house, about tea o'clock—it was then all safe and fastened—I sleep there—about twenty minutes before five o'clock next morning my attention was called to the state of the house, and I saw the shutters of the clerks' office (which is the middle office) open, and one window raised above a foot—on looking round, I saw the collectors' desks and the clerks' desk broken open, and papers strewed about the floor—I then went into the board-room, and found the inner bolt drawn, and found a large hole perforated through the middle stile of the door, large enough to admit a man's arm—on a chair, in the clerks office, I found this clasped knife, and this centre-bit on Another chair—I should say the hole in the door had been made with a centre-bit—I compared the centre-bit I found with the hole, and they corresponded—I then went into the women's day-hall, and found a pane of glass broken and taken out of one of the windows which look into the burial-ground-a person, to have done that, must have been in the burial-ground—I found two pieces of glam lying on the sill, stained with blood, and there were marks or streaks in the wet paint on the hopper, such as would be produced by corded or ribbed trowsers; and on the sill of the window, in the wet paint, was a large foot<lb/>mark, such as would be produced by a man's foot—I knew the prisoner as an inmate of the house—on Wednesday, the 24th, from information I re<lb/>ceived, I went with Goddard to the prisoner's lodgings, in Tower-street, St. George's-fields—I believe his father and mother occupy the room as well—I took hold of the prisoner, turned him round, and observed he had got white paint on the legs and seat of his trowsers—they were ribbed trowsers—I have since compared them with the marks on the hopper, and they agree—the length, from the sill of the window to the mark in the hopper, exactly corresponds with the height of the trowsers—I asked the prisoner if he had any money—he said, "What money?"—we then searched the room, and while we were doing so, he made the observation two or three times, "Gentlemen, you may save yourselves the trouble, you will find" no money here'1—the last place I searched was a kettle, which was on the fire, full of water—I took it off the fire, took the lid off, and perceived something dark in the water—I put my hand in—the water was lukewarm—I pulled out this handkerchief, which is similar to those worn by the inmates of the workhouse—it is like them, but we do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260154"/>
               <p>not mark them—I found in that handkerchief one crown piece, seventeen half-crowns, twenty shillings, eleven sixpences, and one fourpenny piece—I then searched the prisoner, and found in his pocket four penny pieces, seven halfpence, and two farthings—he had a pair of new boots on, which Goddard took off, and asked whether he had not another pair—he said, "Yes, there is an old pair under the bed"—Goddard looked underneath, and found these shoes—there are marks of paint on the side of them—the ]prisoner said they were his, and that he gave 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—while the prisoner was at the workhouse he was employed in cleaning the windows inside the house, more particularly those of the clerks' office and the board-room—he had every opportunity of knowing the state of the windows and desks, and every thing, and I have seen him go out at the door of the board-room, where the persons entered to commit the robbery—I was with Goddard when he tried those shoes to the sill of the window, and they made an impression similar to that I had already observed—I produce the flap of the clerk's desk—that was quite whole, safe, and sound, over night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How did you try the mark of the shoe; did you put it on the mark that was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Goddard did—he did not make another mark beside it, as the paint was dry then—it bad been on two days and two nights—the house was broken into on Tuesday—we appre<lb/>hended the prisoner on Wednesday night, and tried the shoes, after we had been before the Magistrate on Thursday afternoon, more towards the even<lb/>ing—I compared the trowsers on the Thursday morning before I went before the Magistrate—I put them by the side of the marks, and the length and all exactly corresponded—I did not see the prisoner at Mr. Johnson's yard breaking stones—he had taken the hammers away to do it, but he brought them back, and acknowledged to me he had never been to the yard at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am collector of the Strand Union poor-rates. I have a desk in the board-room of the workhouse—on Tuesday, the 24th of October, I left about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my desk, but I did not count how much exactly—there were two cheques, which were not taken—there were about fifty half-crowns, and about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in shillings, a number of sixpences and fourpenny-pieces, the rest in gold, and about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in penny pieces and halfpence—I left the office about half-past six o'clock that evening—the money was then safe in my desk, and the desk locked—I found it locked in the morning, but the wood-work round the hinge was broken, so that it could be opened—the money was not in my desk in the morning-here is my desk, and where it was broken—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—having examined the desk, I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left among the papers-a piece is broken out of the flap, and it could be lifted up by the hinges—I went into the burial-ground, and under the hopper, where the pane of glass was taken out, I found a button, quite clean, lying on the grass in the burial-ground—I gave it to Goddard—it is a very peculiar one, and corresponds with the button on the jacket belonging to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am relieving officer of the Strand Union.

About half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of November, I was on duty in Oxford-street, and met the prisoner carrying some clothes under his arm, between King-street and Blenheim-steps, near Marlborough-street—I called to him to stop, and asked what he had under his arm—he kept walking on, and would not answer me—I overtook and stopped him—he said they were tome old things he had got from a friend of his—I asked him who the friend was—he said, "Mr. Abrahams, a Jew, in Houndsditch"—I said perhaps he knew what was in the pockets of the clothes, if there was any thing—he said there was nothing in the pockets—I showed him the outside of the pocket with a handkerchief, and then he said there was a handker<lb/>chief in it—I said, "What is the colour of it, perhaps you can tell?" but he could not, and I took him to the station-house—I searched the things, and in the pocket of the waistcoat I found two rings, and a child's whistle in the trowser's pocket, and in the prisoner's own jacket pocket I found a pair of spectacles—he said they were his own, and his sight was very bad—I also found a pair of gloves in his pocket which he said were his own, with 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 9 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he said perhaps Mr. Abrahams had made a mistake and left the ring in his pocket—he appeared quite rational, and as if he wished to account for every thing I taxed him with.</p>

I saw the deceased there—the cause of his death was inflammation of the throat and glands—it is impossible to say what caused that—the jaw was frac<lb/>tured, and suppuration had taken place, slight inflammation of the jaw—it was erysipelatous inflammation—I have seen that occur without any acci<lb/>dent whatever—I could not say that the inflammation in the throat was produced by the accident—I could not trace any connexion between the suppuration around the jaw and the state of the throat—I cannot assign any cause-inflammation came on—the man was old, and not having been able to take any Solid food for sometime, was unable to resist the attack that took place—I cannot say that the broken jaw was the occasion of hit death.</p>

(The cheque being read was on the East of England Bank, dated the 18th of February, at twenty—one days after date, payable to the order of James Gooch, Esq., without acceptance, signed by the agent and addressed to the London and Westminster bank in Throgmorton-street, and endorsed to T.

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I came to this country in the end of the year 1829, to practise my science on the stone—my practice was not very extensive in the beginning-subsequently it became so; but when I made my invention known to all the medical men of England, it became less exten<lb/>sive—the prisoner came into my employment, I believe in the beginning of 1830—he came at first to interpret-subsequently when I performed ope<lb/>rations, he was my assistant in those operations, and lastly he was my secretary, not myself being able to read or write English—his compensa<lb/>tion at first was five per cent, on the sums received, but when I came from Russia, at the end of August, 1837, he had a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—when I came back with 4400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said to the prisoner, "I am very happy that I bring some money for yourself"—my intention was to give him 200 louis as a recompence, in the same proportion as I gave him a commission—I gave him two or three sums of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, on account of the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I soon perceived, as the amount I brought with me was to be applied to carry out certain works I had to do, the proportion I allowed him was too large—I therefore said to him, "As there are not many patients now, I think it better I should allow you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year until we can make arrangements"—since that I have given him some amounts, as he asked me for them-10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—he thanked me for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Mr. Gooch, who has been examined, was a patient of mine, and was about six weeks or two months under my care—I had told Mr. Biggs I expected 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Gooch—Mr. Biggs told me I was to have 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Gooch, but never told me I was to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more out of friendship—I did not au<lb/>thorize Mr. Biggs to agree with Mr. Gooch for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner from Mr. Gooch at any time in February 1838—I never authorized him to write a letter to Mr. Gooch acknowledging the receipt of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or giving him directions respecting his cough and so on—he told me something in a letter which I unfortunately destroyed at Paris—Mr. Biggs did not tell me he had received the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but when I returned from Paris I asked him if he had received it—his answer was "Not yet, but I will go for it"—I asked him a second and third time the same question, and he always repeated, "I have not yet received it, but I will go for it"—atlast, the fourth or fifth time, I told him I would go there myself—I ordered my carriage—Mr. Biggs directed it somewhere in the city—I was with him in the carriage—when I stopped Mr. Biggs said to me, "Wait, I will go my<lb/>self"—out of delicacy I waited, and after about half-an-hour the prisone came and said to me, "The man who ought to pay me is not there, but the money will be sent to-morrow morning or this afternoon to your banker's"—I inquired two or three days afterwards, "Has the money been sent to the banker's?"—he answered, "Yes"—but when the prisoner ab<lb/>sconded</p>

               <p>I went to inquire my situation at my banker's, and to my great surprise the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had not been placed to my account—I returned from Paris on the 16th of July, and inquired of the prisoner respecting the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 17th of July, when he asked me for a cheque of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I gave him—I went to Paris on the 31st of March, 1838—I received no account from Mr. Biggs of this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., between the 13th of February and the 31st of March—he has never accounted for it from that day to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. Q. Are you aware that you indicted the prisoner on Saturday for having stolen money from you, being your servant or clerk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was asked on that occasion under what cir<lb/>cumstances, and with what remuneration the prisoner came into my service and continued in it, but it was asked in a manner so strange and altogether so foreign from asking questions by a gentleman, that I altogether lost my head, consequently I may have said that of which I had no consciousness, but what I say at present is correct—I could not on that occasion answer the questions put to me, because I was much more occupied with the inter<lb/>preter than with the questions, but if there is any doubt the books can be consulted, and traces of it found-all the questions put to me were received with the same confusion-what I then said was the fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if so, why did you not give the answer on Saturday you have given to-day, with reference to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and the five per cent. com<lb/>mission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because to-day I am accustomed to the manners of the tri<lb/>bunal, and to the manners of the counsel, and am better able to answer the questions than I was on Saturday—I made the pecuniary arrangement with the prisoner in the interval between my return from Russia, at the end of August, and my departure for Paris on the 31st of March—I cannot determine the period more precisely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> State to the Court the sums of money the prisoner has paid for you from the month of August to April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a question which you know well I cannot answer—it is a <hi rend="italic">catch</hi>, and I will give you the reason-you know perfectly well that pre-occupied with my inventions, I bestowed on the prisoner the care of my accounts, and I am so unaccustomed to accounts that any question of that sort I cannot answer—the prisoner has not given me any account of this sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this cheque was paid while I was in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you went to France, did you intend to go for three weeks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am never so precise as that—I do not recollect saying so before I left—I staid for three months—I cannot say whether the prisoner during part of that time had not the means of paying the obligations he incurred or not—he never communicated it to me—if he had debts, they were debts he ought not to have, and they arose because he had not paid them with the money I had previously given him for that purpose—I was not in difficulties while I was in France.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1835, 36, and 37, were your circumstances in an embarrassed con<lb/>dition? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would not have been embarrassed had not various sums I had received been dissipated—the day before yesterday, under the influence of the prisoner, you represented me as a man who had always been needy—I am now going to give you a proof that you were deceived-here is a book, written by the prisoner, while in my service-between certain dates, I received from my patients who I attended, in the space of twenty-five months, 4, 146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., according to the prisoner's account in the book kept by himself.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During 1837, were you not constantly, in letters to the prisoner, calling for money, and desiring him to raise money by any means he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—(<hi rend="italic">looking at tome letters</hi>)—all these are my hand-writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, and have lived there seven years. The prisoner, Aitkin, has been in my service three years and a half—when I reduced my estab<lb/>lishment, she left for two or three months, and then returned—she left of her own accord, then called and said she regretted it, and I took her again—she was in my employ when I discovered the robbery—the prisoner Gibb is her mother—Aitkin used to go out for a holiday about once a month—she might have gone out oftener without my knowledge—about the 17th of October, I was arranging my plate, and missed ten tea-spoons, and some large forks and spoons—I called Aitkin up immediately, and said, "Ann, I have lost some of my plate"—she said, "Impossible"—I said "It is gone: go down stairs, and think, and then come back and answer me"—she went down, and after some time I rang the bell for her, and said to her, "If you will restore my plate, I shall keep you in my house; how<lb/>ever own it to me"—she afterwards gave me two forks and a table<lb/>spoon—that was after I had the conversation with her-two days after<lb/>wards I missed a silver paint-box, and two active Spanish bonds for £170 each—the bonds have never been found—when I missed the paint-box, I</p>

               <p>said to Aitkin, "My paint-box is gone"—she denied knowing anything about it, but confessed it afterwards—when I asked her about it, she said, "What could I have done with it?"—I said "I really don't know what you have done with it, I only require to have it given to me"—I men<lb/>tioned pawning to her, and she seemed horror struck at the thought—I mentioned the bonds, and she denied all knowledge of them—she at last requested that I would wait till the next Tuesday night at half-past nine o'clock, when all would be made right-a gentleman named Finden called on that Tuesday evening, on the subject of some drawings—after he called, I laid to Aitkin, about five o'clock, "Ann, strong measures must be taken with you, for my plate and bonds are gone"—she again requested that nothing should be done till half-past nine o'clock that evening, and I gave her liberty till that time—she left my house once that evening for about ten minutes—I remember a ring at the bell that evening, and Gibb, Aitkin's mother, came in—I said to Gibb, "Your daughter has stolen my plate and bonds, give her good advice, and all may be well yet"—Gibb said, "What could my daughter do with plate and bonds? it is impossible"—I told her Aitkin had confessed about the plate—Aitkin then came in, and Gibb said to her, "If you have stolen anything from your mis<lb/>tress, own it at once"—I then went into the back parlour, and on my re<lb/>turn I found an officer there with the prisoner Richards—I said to Richards, "Do you want Mrs. Parke, or do you want Ann?"—she said, "No"—I asked her whether she was Ann's sister?—she said she was, and she gave up some duplicates immediately—the officers said they would search her—she said she would not speak to the men, but she would own the truth to me—the officers brought Aitkin into the room, and asked her, "Do you know that person?" pointing to Richards—Aitkin said, "As I hope to live, I never saw her all the days of my life"—Richards said, "Ann, Ann, am I not your sister?"—Aitkin then admitted that she washer sister—I heard another ring at the bell, and Berkshire came in—the officers then took all the prisoners away—on the Friday following I missed nineteen tea-spoons, and three dessert-spoons—I had tied them all up together in Aitkin's presence, she knew where they were, and had access to the place, and every place in the house, but they had been locked up.</p>

Mr. Walford, jeweller, &amp;c., from Liverpool, was recommended to Mr. Lawrence, as being likely to purchase a quantity of new plate, which Mr. W. has brought up with him from Liver<lb/>pool, for immediate disposal. It consists of tea plate in sets, and mugs, mustard-pots, &amp;c.; nearly all of which are gilt inside, and quite new, mo<lb/>dern, and about 200 oz. In explaining that it must be sold immediately, and at a great sacrifice, no doubt it is necessary Mr. W. should explain, that having a very pressing engagement to pay a sum of money on Tuesday morning in Liverpool, which will, after Christmas, yield Mr. W. an enor<lb/>mous profit, he is induced to make the temporary sacrifice, for one that will be so much more to his advantage. Mr. W. begs to say he must be in Liver<lb/>pool on Tuesday morning, with at least 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash; the remainder as might be agreed upon, Mr. W. would not object to a bill. Mr. W. only came in just now from Liverpool; and if Mr. L. will call on him at the Russell coffee-house, 26, Great Windmill-street, he can see the goods, and Mr. W. will wait at home this morning to see him."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Matthew Hesses, a shoe<lb/>maker, in Ratcliffe-highway. On the 29th of November the prisoners came to his shop, in company, about six o'clock in the evening—Davis asked if a pair of shoes that she had ordered about a fortnight previously were ready—(Nowlan was with her when she came before)—I said they were—I asked her to sit down, and gave her the shoes to try if they would fit her—she declined trying them on, and said she thought they would suit, and gave me a sovereign to pay for them—she then asked me to give her a pair of strings—I said I had not got any, unless I took them from another pair—while I was doing that I missed a pair of boots, which had been down right before me, hanging against the door-Nowlan was nearest to them—(I had missed two pairs the time before, when they came to order the shoes)—I called Barker to mind the shop, while I got a policeman—the prisoners remained in the shop—I got a policeman, and asked him to search them—he turned round, and found secreted in a corner the very pair of boots I had missed—I cannot say what had occurred while I was at the door—these are my master's boots—I had given them change for a sovereign.</p>

I was called in to attend Mrs. Campbell, on the morning of the 16th of Novem<lb/>ber—I saw the coffee, and there was cantharides in it sufficient to produce an injurious effect to any one taking it—Mrs. Campbell was very seriously affected by it for twenty hours, and is an invalid still.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business in Dunstan-court, Mincing-lane. On the 11th of September last, I went to St. Katharine's Docks in consequence of an appointment made by my clerk—I saw the prisoner there—he was a stranger to me—he said he had been told that I had some wines on the quay, which would suit his purpose, and he wished me to make a bargain with him for them—he wished to offer me a price for them—he had already seen them with my clerk in the morning—he looked at them again, and said they would suit him—he talked about other wines, saying he wanted to purchase very largely of other qualities—atlast it was decided that he would have these four butts, eight hogsheads, and four quarter-casks, which formed one parcel, and he would call on me next day about it—he told me he was a man of property, but was not much known in the market—that he had lately had cash left him, and he in<lb/>tended to pay cash for every thing he bought—he called on me next morn<lb/>ing, between ten and eleven o'clock—the price was then named, and fixed at 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per butt, which would be altogether 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him for a reference—he told me he always wished to satisfy parties he did business with—that he intended to name a party he had been travelling for, but he had had a dispute with the house, and consequently would not wish to refer me there, but he stated he had lately come into possession of property, which he had received as heir to his father—I told him he had said he in<lb/>tended it to be a cash transaction—he said he intended to pay cash, but that that day he was short, and he would give me the title-deeds of his property, of which he had lately come into possession, as security for the payment of the money in the course of a few days, and he produced to me this deed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—he particularly pointed out to me this part, that it was to be held by Thomas Trevethen, his father, his heirs and assigns, as absolute property, and stated that the property was waste land at the time the document was written, but it had been built on, and was then worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in accounting for the indorsement on it, he said that a short time before it had been in the hands of some party for an advance of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but as this would only be for a few days, it was not worth while indorsing it again—he depo<lb/>sited the deed with me as security for the payment—he then asked me for the transfers, as he could not get the wines, or transfer them to any other party before I had transferred them to him—I ultimately gave him the wine warrants, in consequence of the representations he made with respect to this instrument—I had refused to do so before—I parted with them be<lb/>lieving what he said was true—I have never received any cash since—I had occasion to leave town on the Saturday after I had parted with the warrants, the 15th, and Mr. Ramsay, a friend of mine, undertook the management</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260189"/>
               <p>of my business in my absence—I mentioned to him the transaction be<lb/>tween the prisoner and myself, under what circumstances I had agreed with him, and what had been deposited with me—I never authorised Mr. Ramsay to take bills of exchange in payment from the prisoner for the wine—it was arranged in the first instance that I was to be paid immedi<lb/>ately-subsequently, in the after part of the day, when the prisoner had got possession of the warrant, he said he thought he probably should not be able to pay cash so soon, but part of the property that would come to him on the 29th of September would be in cash—I remonstrated against this delay, but as I was obliged to leave town immediately, I had no alternative—some of the wine is gone from the Docks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you not had some of the warrants back again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not any, I believe the officer has three warrants for hogsheads, but they form a very small part of the whole, which was twenty hogsheads—some bills of exchange were sent under an envelope, during my absence, to my counting-house, but they have never been received as payment—some of them are on a Mr. Bragg of Bristol—Mr. Bragg has not given me up any warrants—Mr. Bragg waited on me some time ago, and made an offer to give up part of the wines he had, on my cancelling the bills against him, which he stated had been obtained by Mr. Trevethen under false pretences, but I have since discovered that Mr. Bragg has got an ad<lb/>vance on those wines, and they are no longer in his power to de<lb/>liver to me—I understand Mr. Bragg is a man of no responsibility at all—he told me he could not pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. towards the bills—he did not tell me his wife was a person of property—he said she had no property—the prisoner told me that Mr. Bragg's wife was a person, of property—that he had got a bond on her property—I believe he said so when we first talked about the parties to whom the wine was going—when I found that the money was not forthcoming, I called on the prisoner to know what he had done with the wines, and he gave a kind of history of what he had done or was going to do with them—he mentioned Mr. Bragg as a person to whom he had parted with some—he did not name him as a person whose bills he would give me—decidedly not—there was no talk about bills at all—he men<lb/>tioned Mr. Bragg as a highly respectable tradesman of Bristol-now I happened to know Bristol very well—I referred to the name of Bragg, and asked who he was—he said he had been for a long time with a house he named, which an intimate friend of mine had lately established—that he was going to be one of his greatest friends and correspondents, and that he had got security from Mr. Bragg to the extent of 4 or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a bond, I understood him to say, of some property of his wife's or family's—the bills on Mr. Bragg were one of 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the wine he had was worth 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner was apprehended on the 29th of October—I delivered him the warrant on the 11th of September.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a further shipment of wines agreed for between you and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not agreed for—he wished me to make an agree<lb/>ment for them, and of course if he had paid me the cash for these I should with pleasure have gone on in further business with him—this deed was not given as a deposit for any further shipments-nothing of the kind was mentioned—one of the bills that were sent was on a Mr. Phillips for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Phillips has never called on me and offered me the money on my taking off the discount—I never heard any thing of the kind—I have seen Mr. Phillips—the bill is payable at Smith, Payne and</p>

I did live at No. 41, Ely-place—I called at the request of Mr. Burton, on the prisoner Hobbs, at New Manor-street, Chelsea—(I cannot recollect when it was)—I found Hobbs at a beer-shop—I told him, that Mrs. Streeton, of the New Forest, Southampton, had given a reference to him as to her respectability—he said he did not like to give characters in general, but the was a very respectable woman—I asked him if she had rented a house of his brother for seven or eight years—he said she had, and had always paid her rent regularly—I asked him what establishment she kept—he said, a phaeton, a pair of ponies, and I am not sure whether he said three or four servants—I told him she was about taking a house of Mr. Burton, at 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year rent—he said she had rented houses of double that rent, and he should have no objection to let her one, only his own were not in a sufficient state of forwardness—he told me I should find her a close-fisted woman, but I should not have to call a second time for the rent.</p>

I have a cot<lb/>tage at Harlesdon Green and five acres of land attached to it—I know the prisoner Ann Norman—she came to me in that name, early in the month of August—she treated with me for the possession of that cottage as a tenant—I have the memorandum which I made with her—I let the house to her at ninety odd pounds a year, for three years—the memorandum was signed by her in my presence—the cottage was occupied by her from the Saturday till the Tuesday week—I then received a letter inclosing the key, by the parcel-delivery company—the key opened the cottage—I had delivered it to Mrs. Norman-a few days after I received the letter I went to the cottage—there was no furniture there—the acres of land were let to her with the cottage—she described herself as a widow lady of property, who had been living some years at Bath, that she had several children, that they were all provided for, and she wished to be in the neighbourhood of London, for the purpose of educating the children—I said it was necessary that I should have a reference—she said she could give me twenty references, but she thought she could not do better than to give me a reference to the brother of her late landlord at Bath, under whom she had lived five or six years, who was a builder at Fulham, and she named a man of</p>

               <p>the name of Hobbs, who was building some houses at Fulham, and said I should find him at Stamford Brook-lodge—I drove to Fulham, and found some houses being built, and upon inquiry I found the prisoner Hobbs—I told him the object of my visit, and he said he knew Mrs. Norman very well—that she was a widow lady, and had been residing at Bath—that she had had a house of his brother's five or six years, and that she had always paid the rent punctually—I told him my object in asking the reference was, that she was about to take a house of me at 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and I asked him if she was a person in those circumstances that would warrant that proceeding—he said, yes, she was, and that he only knew one thing against her, and that was, that she was rather near in money matters—he either said "near" or "close"—Mrs. Norman called on me the next morning or the morning after, and in consequence of what Hobbs had said, I let her the house.</p>

We are grocers and general-dealers—On the 29th of September, the prisoner Norman came to our shop—she gave the name of Norman, and ordered several articles, which were sent down—here is our bill, amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she had taken a house of Mr. Pontifex, and she would pay for the articles as we sent them down if we chose, but that she generally paid weekly—she had a book, and we entered several things—the prisoner Foster fetched several articles—the book was cast up on Satur<lb/>day night, and they were to be paid for on the Monday—Foster came, I believe, every day—I made up the book by the direction of Foster—he said he only knew the family since they came there—I was to go down on the Monday with the bill, but Mr. Pontifex's servant came to tell us they were gone—there was 1lb. weight of tea, 3lbs. weight of sugar, blacking, brooms, &amp;c., and such like things.</p>

I know the two female prisoners, and Foster—on Monday the 1st of October, I saw Foster sweeping the gravel walk of the house at Winchmore-hill, where Norman lived—I asked him if the lady was within, and if I could see her—he said, "Go to the door if you please, and you will see the servant"—I went and saw Grafton—I asked if I could see the lady—she said, "You cannot see her for an hour, if you come again you can see her"—I went, and Mrs. Norman made her appearance—I asked her if there</p>

               <p>was anything wanted in the carpentering line—she said she had received a card from Mr. Pontifex, and that I was the person she should employ, and she ordered two deal boxes to be made—she showed me a box standing on a chair—they were to be made similar to that, only larger, deeper, and a drawer at the bottom of each—she said she should wish to have them as early as I could possibly get them done—she said she wanted an ironing-board made and fixed in the scullery, and a clothes-horse and window-blind—she said there would be a corn-bin wanting, but she must have the other orders executed first—she told Foster to show me some jobs that were wanted to be done in the stable, Foster went with me to the stable, and gave me orders to make a couple of shelves ten feet long, to go behind the door—he wanted them in the course of the week—I asked him if they wanted any thing in the ironmongery way, and Grafton told me there were many things that were wanted in that line, and the would come up to the shop, and give me the order—in about a quarter of an hour after I returned home, Grafton came to the shop, and brought a list of the articles that she wanted—there were pails for the stable and house, dripping-pans, safes, and other things, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I delivered them the same evening—she gave me the measure by a piece of string for a brass fender, and fire irons, and a tea-kettle were ordered—I saw the dripping-pan afterwards in the cart, going away—I saw the house several times after they had left—there were none of these things left in the house or stable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Merton, in Surrey. On the morning of the 5th of November I gave directions to Hughes, my man, to take my chesnut mare to a meadow belonging to Mr. Milton—I missed it the same evening—she had a short tail, and had a white mark on the face—she was about five years old—I saw her again nine days after I think, in possession of West, at Buntingford, in Hert<lb/>fordshire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wagoner, in the employ of Mr. Coome, of Linfield, in Sussex. On the 21st of August I was with his wagon, going from London, home—I started from the White Hart, in the Borough—I got near the Elephant and Castle at half-past eleven o'clock at night, and had got into the wagon—the prisoner called me out of the wagon—I got out, and he begun to abuse me very much, and spit in my face twice, and asked me how I liked it—I said, "I do not like it much, but I suppose I must put up with it"—he then knocked me down—I had not said any thing to him—I felt I could not stand up against him, nor had I any disposition to do so—he knocked me down with his hand—whether he had any thing in it I can<lb/>not say—my mate was at the horses' heads driving the wagon—there were three men standing with the prisoner, very near him—they stepped back on the pavement as soon as I got out of the wagon—they remained there—I did not want to have any thing to do with it—I am fifty-seven years old—when I was knocked down I fell near the wheel—I was stunned by the fall—I understand the three men who were with him lifted me up into the wagon, but I was not in my senses—I came to my senses directly after, and found my pocket was turned inside out—I had had no money there—I found my watch and guard were gone—I had had the watch in my hand, just before, as I was late, and looked at it by Kennington-gate, against the time-piece, and it was exactly right—it was just by the Wagon and Horses, below the Ele<lb/>phant and Castle, that he called me out of the wagon—I had not sense enough to make an alarm, but when I came to myself I told my mate to stop, but we could not see an officer about, as it was Camberwell fair</p>

I want to see him"—I do not know why he should spit in my face—I never had a <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>—word from him in my life—I never raised my hand against him—I cannot say how long he has been in business—I have not lived at Linfield long myself—I lived at Brighton a good while—the last service I had was at the Catherine-wheel, in the Borough—I kept flys at Brixton, and kept a beer-shop in Kingsland-road, which I left because it did not answer.</p>

I was with Berry on the 21st of August—I went with the horses, and he with the wagon, and opposite the Wagon and Horses the prisoner came up, and asked me where my mate was—I said, "In the wagon"—he told me to stop the horses, which I did—he then called Berry out of the wagon—there were three more persons standing close to the prisoner at the time, I saw Berry come out of the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Llandilovawr, Carmarthenshire. I am a Magistrate for Pembroke—the prisoner is my brother-in-law—my sister is now dead—I had assisted him with money to a considerable ex<lb/>tent before her death—I ultimately found that he was committed to Car<lb/>marthen gaol for debt—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bill</hi>.)—the acceptance on this is not my hand-writing—I did not authorise the prisoner to sign it for me—I found that it had gone to Biddulph's bank—I went to Carmarthen prison to see the prisoner—I said, "I find you have forged my name, and you must abide by the consequences, for I will never pay one farthing of the money"—he made no reply—there was no one with me at that time—I left him—that was about the 8th or 10th of September, 1887—I went and saw him again five or six days afterwards, with Mr. Lewis Morris, the prisoner's attorney, but said nothing to him then—this acceptance bears a resemblance to my signature—the body of the bill is the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing.</p>

               <p>your brother-in-law, you answered, your sister was dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I do not consider him a brother-in-law any longer—there is still a tie by the marriage—he is a first cousin of mine besides—he is the son of a broths of my mother's—his wife died in October, 1837.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After that trial on which a verdict passed against you in Carmarthen, you paid for a <hi rend="italic">habeas</hi> to remove him to London, and being in custody on civil process, have you indicted him for this offence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—he has lived twenty years in Carmarthen, and carried on business in a large way—I have not obtained any property from him—he gave me a nominal security—I will show it if you wish it—I do consider it nominal, as it is worth nothing—it is a mortgage, but there was a prior mortgage, which exists to the full value—I had it given me on the 8th of June, 1837—I did not know of the prior mortgage at that time—Mr. Biddulph claims it—his clerk told me so yesterday—the mortgage was for money I became security for before—I know that a fiat of bankruptcy had been issued against the prisoner—this deed recites three prior mortgages for 1600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but there is another which I did not know of—there is 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cannot be sold—he has only a life interest in it—I cannot tell the value of it—I entered into a bond of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him, to a person named Moss—I gave a note of hand for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a person, which I paid—this mortgage was given as a general security for all debts I might have to pay for him—he owes me money now—there is a time limited in the deed—I have not sold the estate, as there is a prior mort<lb/>gage—I had become security at the time he executed this—1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is the amount he is charged by that mortgage—at that time I had not advanced</p>

               <p>more than 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I was security for more—there was a bond for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a note of hand for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Jones's, and a bill of 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Wilkin's bank—it was an accommodation bill—I never had a farthing of the interest paid me on this mortgage—it was about 1829 I was security for the 600.—I know the bond was before 1830—I found he was in difficulties, and got the security to indemnify myself if I could—I went to the prisoner's office on that occasion—I did not tell him if he would give me the security to enable at to cover the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would do any thing for him I could—he did not tell me he should want the use of my name for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cold him he must pay the securities off, for I would not be responsible for soy money for him—I make ft mistake—I meant to say I would not be re<lb/>sponsible any longer for the amount which I was security for—that he must pay them—what I meant to do was to go to the parties, and ask them to call the money in—I was not a creditor at that time, only a security—I lever knew that he had the signatures of three-fifths of his creditors to his certificate—I heard he was to be discharged from prison in September, 1887—he told me so when I saw him in prison—I heard it rumoured in; Carmarthenshire that he was likely to be discharged while he was in Lon<lb/>don—it was not on that that I came up and indicted him—on my oath, I did not come up with in a week of the time I beard it—I heard it on my way up from Carmarthen—I live twenty-five miles below Carmarthen—I was coming up to get these indictments preferred against him—it was some time in October, not before, about thirteen months after I had seen him in prison—I went to the different holders of the bills, to declare them as for<lb/>geries—I went first to him in prison, to know if the bills were still in ex<lb/>istence which he had forged—I knew of the bills by the holders apply<lb/>ing for payment—the first application was in September, 1837—that Was not about the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill on which the action was brought—the bill was not due at the time I went to him in prison, but I was told there were bills in existence with my signature, which I was not aware of—it was neither of these bills I was applied to for payment of—it was a third bill—that was at Carmarthen—I have kept some cases back—William Phillips holds one, and Posthumous Phillips the other—I am not aware that they are any relations to the man I gave the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to get the <hi rend="italic">habeas</hi>—Post-humous Phillips is a maltster—the bill be has is for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have been called on to pay it—I have not paid any part of it—I have taken no steps on it—the other is for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—William Phillips is the holder of that—those bills are signed by procuration—I do not know what drawing by procura<lb/>tion is—I have never seen those bills—I was called on to pay them twelve months ago.</p>

               <p>time he went with me to the prison was in September—that was not the first time I went—I asked him to go with me—there was no statement of the prisoner's affairs and accounts gone into then—the balance-sheet was not made—Morris did not ask the prisoner to explain an item of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stated to be due to Mr. James—he did not ask who the Mr. James was to whom the debt of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was stated—I will swear he did not ask it in my hearing—the prisoner did not reply that it was Mr. James, his brother-in-law, now present—Mr. Morris did not inquire of what the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was made up, nor did the prisoner state it was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a bill and note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to William Phillips, and another for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to Biddulph, nor any words to that effect—nor did he state, "In all of these Mr. James is liable as the acceptor"—I have seen his balance-sheet—it was about the latter end of September, or beginning of October, that the prisoner was brought from Carmarthen—Morgan Rice James is an attorney—he has been my attorney, he is not now—I sent him to Carmarthen gaol about this, in September, 1837, as I found there were more forgeries—I was applied to for another bill, which I knew nothing of, which was forged—that was the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill of Morris I have indicted him for—I went to Haverford West, and spoke to my professional man, and asked him to go up and inquire whether that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the extent of the forgeries—I had heard of two be<lb/>fore that, held by William and Posthumous Phillips—I had seen him twice in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why have you not preferred charges for those bills? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not care which, I left it to my professional man to choose—my present at<lb/>torney lives in London—I did not direct the two bills of Phillips's to be brought to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the bill on Morris, which induced you to send Mr. M. R. James to the prisoner in gaol, due in October? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was for another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I never heard any more of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there seems to have been thousands according to your state<lb/>ment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I did not send Mr. M. R.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray have you got any security besides that you have produced, either from the prisoner, or his family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have security from his mother—I got that, I think, at the latter end of 1837—I have not brought it to London—I received it, I think, in October, after I sent Mr. M.

Biddulph—I have heard it pronounced a forgery—I made a demand, both on the drawer and ac<lb/>ceptor, when it became due—we gave notice of the bill being dishonoured, which the prosecutor never attended to—he called some few months after<lb/>wards, and requested I would show him the bill, which I did—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and he told me it was not a forgery—I told him the prosecutor had said the bill was a forgery—he replied, there was a con<lb/>spiracy, he believed, got up against him, but it was no forgery—that there was an attempt to transport him, or something of that sort—I did not call his attention to the signature of the acceptor, and he said nothing about the acceptance—I do not know who brought the bill to us—it was passed to the credit of the prisoner's account—the prisoner, I believe, did not bring it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Nos. 15 and 16, Windmill-row, New-cut, and am a tin-man. These lamps, or some like them, were made in my place, three weeks ago last Sunday, by the prisoner—he does not lodge with me, but he asked my permission to make a pair of lamps there—I said he might do it—he came two or three evenings before, and on Sunday three weeks he came and finished them at my place—I went in a little before dinner, and saw him at work with lamps similar to these—I dare say they are them—they were all to pieces and bits on the bench—this come I had in my hand, or one I could almost swear was the same, and one of these lamps I can swear to—it was bruised in the nozzle in a bad way—this is the one—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)—I have never had the lamps in my hand since they were made till this moment—I said, "You have made a botch of this and spoiled it"—"No," says he, "it won't matter"—this was three week last Sunday.</p>
