I am single, and live at 3, Taylor's Cottages, Tooting—on 2nd September, about 9.15, I was in Hyde Park with my mother, Hudson, and others—we were busily engaged talking, and were certainly having a bit of fun—the prisoner came up from behind; I was struck and fell, and I remember nothing more—I was injured on my head, and was in the hospital three weeks—I have quite recovered now.</p>

On the night of 2nd September, about 9 o'clock, I was near Stanhope Gate—I heard cries of "Police!"—I went up and saw the prisoner pursuing Allom; I ran and stopped him, and asked if he had assaulted anybody—he said "No"—Allom told me he had assaulted a young lady, who was taken to St. George's Hospital—I took him into custody—he had his belt on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant house-surgeon at St. George's—the prosecutrix was brought there—I examined her head—on the upper part of the left side of the forehead there were two cuts about an inch long extending down to the bone; in one of the cuts the bone itself was fissured, or dented; a branch of the temporal artery was divided, which I had to secure—she also had a wound over the outer side of the left eye, which did not lead down to the bone—there was a great swelling over the eye, simply due to the blood which was underneath the skin—it was such a wound as a soldier's belt and buckle would produce, it was a serious wound, but she went on very well without a bad symptom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How would you suggest the mark came over the eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely by falling on the gravel—the other marks could not have been produced by that.</p>

I live in Red Lion Yard, Gray's Inn Road—on 1st October, about 12.20, I was in Chiswell Street with a friend—the prisoner Redding went up to my friend and struck him—he turned round and Reeves struck him likewise—I turned to pull my friend away, and Reeves struck me on my mouth—three or four persons came round and I lost my watch, chain—a policeman came up and I gave the prisoners in custody—Redding tried to pull Reeves away from the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber of 18, Suffolk Road, Dalston—about 3.45 on the day in question, I cannot say the date, I was in St. Thomas's Passage, and heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> between the prisoner and Georgina Peel—Mrs. Peel was the worse for liquor of the two—they had both been drinking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280017"/>
               <p>together in the morning as well as in the afternoon—Mrs. Peel called the prisoner a b—y rotten liar, and the prisoner shoved her up against a high fence with her hand, and. said "I ain't rotten, and never was rotten"—she did not fall, she only rolled against the fence and then walked away—the prisoner followed her, struck her, and she fell against, a barrow—she got up and said "Pray don't strike me any more, I am too drunk"—the prisoner hit her again on the head, and she fell against the upright flag stone of the urinal at the public-house—she then rolled over, and never moved or spoke afterwards—two men picked her up and took her into her own house—the prisoner lives in the same house in the front parlour—as the deceased was being carried in the prisoner was rolling her sleeves up, and she said she would kill her or anybody else that called her out of her name—two men who took some brandy to her said that she was dead—I saw no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 2, Duke Street—on Monday afternoon, 16th September, there was a quarrel between the prisoner and deceased about a man named Taylor in St. Thomas's Passage, and, after the quarrel, Mrs. Peel called the, prisoner a rotten whore—the prisoner said she would not be called such, names by her or any other, woman, and struck her twice—I cannot tell where the blow fell, it was so quickly done—Mrs. Peel ran behind a barrow, and said "Don't hit me, Moore, because I am drunk—she reeled from behind the barrow, and the prisoner hit her again; it appeared to me to be on the side of the head, and she fell down flat on her right side heavily—she did not speak or move—I thought she had fainted; the blow seemed so slight you would not think she was dead—she was tipsy—they were always good friends, and she lived in the house—they had been friendly to half an hour before—the deceased was married.</p>

I am a plasterer—I was in Eaton Square on the morning of 8th September, and saw a disturbance—a schoolmaster called me across the road, and I saw the boy lying en the ground—I lifted him up, and he was sick very much—the prisoners were a few yards up, but I did not go to them, I stopped with the boy—a few minutes afterwards the police went up to them and brought them, towards me and the boy—I heard Holt say that he belonged to the E Division—a policeman asked Finn if he had had any beer, and Finn said that they had had one pot between five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They asked Finn who had struck him, and he said no one had—I asked the boys whether they could point out the man who had struck Finn, and none of them were able to do so—the policemen asked Finn his address, and he said that he lived at Manor Gardens—that was after he said that nobody had hit him—the policemen asked him if he was incapable of walking home, and he said he was—I did not hear him say anything about tea—the other boys were not sober.</p>

I hereby direct and authorise, whenever convenient to them, to sell by auction, without reserve, the aforesaid property, and to repay themselves the money so advanced, with all costs, commission, and warehouse charges that may accrue thereon, and in case the aforesaid property shall not realise sufficient to pay the same, then, in default, to pay all costs and charges hereby agreed, and to make good such deficiency whenever called upon so to do"—Our charge was 10 per cent. commission on the sales effected, and a nominal sum of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when a lot was bought in—the defendant stated his object in getting money from me—I cannot say the date—he said that he had bills to meet, and required to raise money to meet them, and to pay wages—that was the subject upon every meeting—I believe he mentioned his partners; I cannot recollect what he did say, except that they left him, and he had bills to meet, as he was in business on his own account; he had to pay off his partners—he spoke about the stock at the time of the dissolution, and stated that he had taken it from his partners at reduced prices, and therefore he could sell at reduced prices—a marked catalogue was sent him for each sale—we sent him the difference after each sale by cheque on the London and Westminster Bank, St. Jame's Square—the cheque would be open "Payable to order"—this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated the 9th September, 1871, refers to three boudoir cabinets, a pair of large jars, a pair of smaller ditto, 31 yards of crimson silk, and three pairs of green curtains—we received those goods on that date, and advanced 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those goods were in our possession up to the 8th of November—they were in that sale—I cannot refer to the lot—I cannot say that lot 165 refers to them—the agreement of the 4th October (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to 76 yards of crimson velvet, on which we advanced 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those goods were in our possession on the 8th November, when we sold them by auction—the agreement of the 19th August (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to four pieces of brocatelle, on which we advanced 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement of the 6th Sep<lb/>tember (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to one piece of crimson tapestry, on which, with other goods, we advanced 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the brocatelle and this lot were in the sale of 8th November—the agreement of 11th September (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refers to one Pietra Doura cabinet, on which, with other goods, we advanced 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember selling one cabinet on the 22nd September, but I cannot say if that is the one—I produce another agreement of the 16th September which refers to a pair of cabinets on which we advanced 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold those on the 29th September—on the 14th October there is an agreement relating to twelve chairs and two easy chairs, on which we advanced 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were in our possession, and sold on the 8th November for 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the large Pietra Doura cabinet sold for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the two smaller were sold on the 29th September for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the two—the agreement of the 9th September relates to the deposit of an Axminster carpet—it is signed by Marler, on which, with other goods, we advanced 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was sold on the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. Nearly everything was sold in the sale of the 8th November by arrangement with the Receiver—he asked me if I thought there would be a profit, and I said I thought there would—he directed me to sell and pay the proceeds to him—if he had paid me the amount owing I would have given the goods to him, and I wrote to him to that effect—they were sold in the ordinary way—there was no reservation on that day—the Receiver had no one there to buy them in—in the other sales somebody attended to protect the goods or written instructions were sent—I have some of them here (<hi rend="italic">two produced</hi>)—when there was a reserved price we did not sell unless the goods reached those prices—on several occasions the goods were bought in—the cabinets were not bought in on previous occasions, but the dining-room suite was, on the 19th October, at 48 guineas—it was not put for sale between that and the 8th November—it then fetched 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot recollect whether it was soiled; to the best of my recollection the velvet was faded—it was on the first occasion I saw the defendant that he told me he had bills to meet to pay off his partners, and that he had taken the stock and could afford to sell cheaper—I also saw him afterwards—we were specially directed not to sacrifice the goods—I had an interview with him in August in reference to the silk; that was the third occasion on which I saw him—I believe those were the only three occasions on which I saw him—he then told me the silk was not to be sold, and we agreed to hold it over—that applied to all the silk that was sold on the 8th November—he said he would redeem them—there was not to my knowledge any arrangement with Marler to that effect when the silk was deposited—Marler came to us upon that occasion in August, and that was the reason I went to the defendant—the silks had accumulated from time to time, and I told Marler we should sell them the following week, and he said "Do not do so," and then I went to Mr. Pulling to know why we kept them, because they would sell at better prices by being sold in bulk—we never sold without having a price, or some one to represent the defendant at every sale—these things fetch good prices at our sales—the cabinets I consider fetched retail shop prices—on some occasions things fetch better prices than they would at a shop, and some<lb/>times considerably less—I should think thirty to forty lots were bought in</p>

               <p>—the 10 percent, included all expenses, and the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. included every expense when the lot was bought in—when bought in the goods are again carried into the account, which is swollen in that way—I cannot tell the amount of the sales previously to the 8th November without looking at the account—(<hi rend="italic">referring to it</hi>)—it is an extract from our books—on the 8th November the sale was 642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was by far the larger sale we over had—when I spoke to the Receiver about that sale he said he would consult the committee, and he took time for that purpose—I saw Mr. Hincks on the matter, I believe that was after the sale—I do not believe I saw him while he was acting for the prisoner—it is not an uncommon thing in the trade to put furniture into sales at our rooms—it sometimes fetches good prices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Sometimes it fetches very bad prices—the amount of 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the amount due to us the day the account was rendered—that sum represents the goods sold—those were not counted again in the subsequent part of the account—a portion of the sum of 229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be—that amount does not include the total of the buying-in prices, but only the prices of goods sold—the total in the account of 511<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nett for 2nd June is for goods sold—the same as to 440<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the next item—those are not counted over again—the amount of 2583<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. between the dates in the account represents all goods—deducting 642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the balance shows the goods sold without any negotiation with the trustee—the sale for the 8th November had been fixed originally, and the goods would have been sold in the ordinary course—the negotiation to hold them over was on a previous occasion—the interview with Mr. Stewart was whether, with reference to the interests of the estate, we should hold the goods further, or allow them to be sold—we agreed to do that provided we were indemnified or repaid our advances at once—if we had been repaid our advances we would have handed the goods to the trustee—the silks were, by the direction of Mr. Pulling, held over by us—we did sell some silks between August and the 8th November—the silks he told us to hold over we did hold over; the others we sold—we always had a mark on to protect ourselves—the two letters of instruction I produced are not the only letters I received; the others are on the file—those I produced were merely a sample of them—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read as follows:</hi> "September 28th. Dear Sir,—The under-mentioned lots should not be sold under the prices quoted below, but of course we will leave it to your good judgment to a pound or two up or down. Try and do the best you can for us, and oblige, yours truly, S. Marler.")—Then follow the lots—lot 100 refers to a walnut wardrobe, and the reserve price is 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—lots 1 and 2 are a washstand and dressing-table, price 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 172, a pair of silk curtains, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 186, a 17ft. side<lb/>board, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The second letter was read as follows:</hi> "Oct. 2nd.—Dear Sir,—I do not think there is anything in to-day's sale to reserve besides the sideboard, which we think should fetch 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The velvet suite I must leave to your judgment what to sell it for. Yours truly; S. Marler." Those two are a specimen of the directions we received; that is the "velvet suite bought in—pursuant to that letter it was bought in at my discretion—some goods were sold and some bought in—we should not deduct so much as if it were cash; we return the amount of the actual sales—we make no return of the amount that was bought in—we charge 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., then a nominal sum—there are lots unsold 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is the nominal charge for buying in—those goods go in the account of the following sale—the goods are not then carried out in the column as if they had been sold.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Harvey, Pimm, &amp; Co., and have been for six years—I have known the defendant about four years—Messrs. Pimm had transactions with him—I think all things were settled up to March, 1871—I remember calling upon him in the early part of September, 1871—I called upon him on the 8th, and asked him if he had any orders on hand that I could help him with—he said "I have nothing particularly on hand just now; but if you have a short length of any pattern, or any thing of new design, I might put it in the window; something different to what I now have"—I had not one 8 yards length, but two short lengths of about 13 or 15 yards, and I sent them the next day, the 9th September—they were brocatelle silks—I believe I saw tome silk goods afterwards in the window that I had sent—the next supply was on the 20th September, two lengths, one crimson silk and one blue, but one was returned—he retained one length of 54-inch crimson silk and one 63-inch of blue—the crimson was 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, and 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the blue—there were 75 yards of crimson and, I believe, 47 yards of blue—the value was 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—there was a short length of 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those goods were unpaid for at the time of the stoppage—the patterns are peculiar to Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is very hard to define a "job lot"—a manufacturer may have 5,000 or 6,000 pieces, and, as he wants to keep his machinery going, he would come to a house and say "Can you clear us out?"—we should say, "Yes, it is only a question of price"—that would be called a job lot—if a man was in pecuniary embarrassment and wanted to sell off all his stock, we should call that a "job lot."</p>

Bonham used to hand me a cheque, and I used to go to the bank and take up defendant's bills that were dishonoured—the cheques were payable to defendant's order, but I had authority to sign—I never sent any goods to Bonham's without instructions from defendant—the goods so sent when entered were entered at the end of the order-book—they were not entered in the day-book in the ordinary way, so far as I know—I cannot say whether the cash was entered—I do not know if defendant entered it—he used to keep the cash-book in his desk—most of the amounts are entered in the cash-book, I having paid bills with them—they were not entered in the ordinary way—the articles on the 9th September are different to the goods of Messrs. Pimm—there are 81 yards of crimson silk—in the invoice it is 46 yards—those goods went to Bonham's on the 16th—the goods sent on the 24th October were supplied on the 20th September—I recollect that was some figured cerise-silk—I was not present at the sale—there was a length of 75 yards—four pieces of brocatelle were supplied by Messrs.

Bonham 69 yards of blue satin—I see an invoice in the guard-book of 11th September, 1871, of 69 yards of blue satin—on 31st August there are some rolls of silk damask, and there is an invoice of that date—the silk had been ordered for Porchester Gate—on 7th September there were</p>

The house belongs to my father; it is one of a row—it was furnished so that a tenant might have it complete—the object was to secure my father's debt; defendant owed him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we had nothing like the blue Japanese silk—that was obtained on 30th August—I was with defendant between five and six years—he was formerly in business in Skinner Street—we always did a very good business in Holborn, and if he had not been so crippled for money he might have done a very good business—the crippling for money arose, I think, with the Suburban Hotel Company—there was a petition to wind it up—that cost him a lot of money—there was the Chancery suit with his partners also—he was always in the business, superintending it—I am not aware of any extravagance—the partners were paid off, I think, in March, 1870, and they claimed some<lb/>thing like 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Hincks came to the house first, when the liquidation was thought of, with Mr. Walker—he was a large creditor, and I believe defendant put himself in his hands—he was a creditor for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I know—I saw Mr. Hincks and defendant together; that was before the petition—Mr. Walker's advice was taken, and the petition arrived at—Mr. Hincks was there the morning the petition was filed, and two mornings afterwards—I thought he was acting for defendant—after the petition for liquidation, Mr. Hincks and Mr. Stewart were there—I believe they came the night before the petition was put on the file—the next morning Mr. Hincks, Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Lamb, his partner, came in a cab, and Mr. Walker was with them—on the following evening, after the petition, they took away some rolls of silk and some Dresden vases—they were very expensive silks—I do not know where they took them to—there was a discussion in Mr. Hincks' presence that some goods were at Bonham's—that was about three days after the petition—defendant was discussing it with them—I heard him tell them they were there—I did not hear him tell them why—I was present when the goods were sold at the sale by Mitchell—I only went in for a few minutes; I did not see everything sold—there were other goods besides defendant's goods—I only know what I heard from Mr. Walker—Mitchell put in some of his own, and Walker also—he is a cabinetmaker also—they were unfinished goods—I always went when goods were sold at Bonham's to bid, or sent them prices for the goods to fetch, to prevent them being sacrificed at low prices—I always used my own discretion—they very often fetched more than they cost; sometimes it was a good sale, and, at other periods, a very bad sale—I used to bid for the things, and run them up, if I saw anybody in the room wanted them—some goods deposited there were fetched away for the purpose of business, and others placed in their stead—defendant used to select the goods to be sent himself—he selected the worst, of course—I recollect the dining-room suite, in crimson velvet—I cannot speak to its condition now; I merely saw it in the upstairs room—I remember defendant starting for Vienna and Constantinople—that was last August—he went as to a large order to furnish a palace for the Sultan</p>

I am in partnership with Mr. Stewart, the trustee to this estate—we are accountants—I understand that, at the time of the liquidation, there was some property taken to secure the costs of the petition—they were brought back again, and sold in the bankrupt's premises—I saw every article sold—I did not see them taken away—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the stock account of the sale—the goods consisted of a pair of large vases, lot 102, and a pair of small vases, lot 107; a piece of crimson silk, and a piece of gold—those were sold at the sale, and the proceeds duly carried to the credit of the estate—the charges upon it, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Mr. Hincks and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to our firm, were paid—with the exception of those two sums the rest of the property has gone to the credit of the estate—I have looked at the books to see what they are; there is a cash-book, a day-book, a guard-book for invoices, a banker's pass-book, and some scroll diaries—all those books are here, and susceptible of being examined—they are not kept so as to show what was the bankrupt's condition at the time of his stoppage—credits were not posted in the ledger for a considerable time before the bankruptcy—the cash-book is not kept in an ordinary way; it is very badly kept, imperfectly kept—the invoices show the amount of purchases during the last four months, before the petition for liquidation, to be 6,535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is a statement prepared in our office—the statement of affairs shows a deficiency of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that does not include the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at which he overstated his stock at the time of the dissolution of his partner<lb/>ship—there was no notice taken of that in his statement of affairs which he prepared for the liquidation—I am not able in any way, by these books, to find out how that deficiency could have arisen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would add to the deficiency if it were taken notice of, but it is not; it would not make any difference in the actual state of affairs at present, but it is unaccounted for—he said there was 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more stock than there was—I was not present when the goods I have spoken of were taken away; I was on the premises, I believe, but engaged on the books—I understand that my partner was on the premises; I can't speak with certainty as to Mr. Hincks—I cannot explain why 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods were taken away to cover 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd due to Mr. Hincks and us—I understand they were taken to Mr. Walker's in Bunhill Row; he was not one of the committee then; he was one of the largest creditors—he was inquiring into the state of affairs—I believe the goods were retained at his place until they were brought back to the sale—I am not sure, I won't swear to it—I believe</p>

               <p>other goods of Mr. Walker's were brought into the sale—he is a cabinet-maker—I can't say whether they were new or second-hand goods—some goods of Mr. Mitchell's were also brought in, I understand; he is a cabinet-maker, and the petitioning creditor—I am not aware that any other persons put in goods—I cannot tell you how much the bankrupt paid to trade creditors in the last four months; it is impossible to find from his books—we don't consider the cash account filed by the bankrupt reliable—we have not been able to ascertain with certainty how much he paid away within the last four months; I have not personally tried to do that—the amount of the purchases in the corresponding four months in 1871 was ascertained, but I really forget it at this moment—I am sure they were not as large as those I have mentioned—it was apparently a very large business—I could not say that it turned over 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is quite possible—it is impossible that it could be making a profit during the last twelvemonths—I have not worked it out—I don't see how it is possible—I have not sent in any account yet against the estate, with the exception of the small account of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I am not aware that an account for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd has been sent in—my partner is trustee—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd has nothing to do with the trustee's personal work; that is the lawyer's charges—I can't speak to these accounts—I don't know about them—it is a very difficult question to answer what has been done—everything has been done with regard to winding up the estate—I have not made an estimate of the purchases for the whole year of 1871—possibly I could have done it—it is not possible from the bankrupt's books to make any estimate of the payments at any period—I was present part of the time at the meeting when lie was asking to pass his last examina<lb/>tion—I remember a document being produced—it was not to my knowledge put into the hands of the trustee and supported by affidavit—I can't say whether it was put into Mr. Hincks' hands—I will swear that I don't know that—I am not aware that trade creditors to the amount of 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. opposed the prosecution, and asked that he might be admitted to pass his last examination—I was not present on any occasion when such a thing was done; it has never been placed before the trustees.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, at 30, Moorgate Street—some goods were taken away to secure the costs of the petition for liqui<lb/>dation; they were taken to Mr. Walker's—they were two pairs of vases and two pieces of crimson silk and gold—they were afterwards returned, and received by myself—I was appointed trustee on 9th June—I was pre<lb/>sent at a meeting of creditors, where it was resolved that the defendant should be made bankrupt, and not be permitted to proceed in liquidation; it was somewhere about 23rd November—the matter was discussed, and the bankrupt himself was heard—I was afterwards present at a meeting when it was determined to prosecute him; the meeting was specially called for that purpose—I think it was on 10th May—it was then resolved by a considerable majority that he should be prosecuted—there might have been some dissentients in the room, possibly, but they did not give expres<lb/>sion to their opinions in public—the minutes were submitted to the Registrar in Bankruptcy before any steps were taken at all, and his advice and permission were requested to proceed under this resolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't tax my memory as to how many creditors were present; it is all recorded—there was a very large number—notices were sent to every one—I think there were about thirty-nine or forty—the notice was not that it was intended to prosecute; I can't recollect the exact</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280052"/>
               <p>wording of it—this is it: it is "a meeting of creditors to receive a report from the trustee as to what has been done, and to take the direction of the creditors as to the course to be pursued in the matter referred to in the report"—I do not know that a very large number of creditors wished not to prosecute, and to memorialise the Court to allow him to pass—I have not seen such a document (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I may have seen that, I can't say—it is asserted that a great number of trade creditors dissent from the prosecution—they never said so to us, with the exception of one or two—I do not know that creditors to the amount of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dissent from this prosecution; I swear that—the goods were taken away to pro<lb/>vide for professional expenses that were being incurred prior to the presen<lb/>tation of the petition—they were taken away jointly by me and Mr. Hineks—it is not correct that at that time about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to each of us; there was nothing owing, the expenses were being incurred at that time—I did not look to see whether they were goods that had been paid for or not; we requested the insolvent to give us some goods to protect us in any expense in the event of our not being appointed, and he gave us those goods—we did not know the value of the silk or of the vases—I was not trustee or receiver at that time, I was nothing at all—the goods were taken to the office of one of the creditors for safe custody, Mr. Walker, of 119, Bunhill Row; they were kept there until shortly before the sale in February—I think they were ordered back to the premises by me, and received by me, not by Mr. Hincks'; they were jointly mine and Mr. Hincks'—they did not come back with other goods of Walker's; I swear that—they came back with other goods, goods belonging to me in the first instance, because I had paid for them—I think they were silks or reps that I had redeemed and deposited with Mr. Walker for safe custody—they had been taken away under the Sheriff's warrant in execution—those goods were estimated at 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I advanced 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for them—I don't, of my own Personal knowledge, know that any of Walker's goods got into the sale—I believe some did, under an arrangement with the auctioneer—I am not aware whether or not Mitehell sent in any goods, my sanction was never asked—the lease of the premises is given up—the mortgagee had a claim for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—there was more than one mortgagee, two or three—I gave up the leases—as we had not the lease we did not try to sell the goodwill; we could not do one without the other—the furniture at the bankrupt's own house was not included in the statement of accounts—a Mr. Harris had a bill of sale over that to a certain amount—it came into the original statement of assets; the original amount was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was estimated at 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the proofs allowed amount to about 16,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—138 Proofs were admitted—I did not take any steps to ascertain the amount of purchases that the defendant had made during the year, because it was considered that there was no occasion to do so, only for six months—it was upwards of 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for six months—I don't recollect exactly; I believe that was for four months—I believe I made an estimate of the purchases in the corresponding months in 1870, but I have not a copy of that—the books have been so badly kept that I can't give you the correct amount of the payments in those four months in 1871—I can give you a summary—I can tell you, with reservation, that there was no accurate account ever kept of them, and never had been—as rendered by Mr. Pulling, they were about 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but to take the two together you must get the receipts as well—I must, as an accountant, put the two together—the accommodation bills</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280053"/>
               <p>and renewals were so treated that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to trace them at all—I can't answer what the trade payments were—I should say they were not 6,150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I can't tell you—he kept on paying some tradesmen until the day that he petitioned—I can't tell you whether, during the last twelve months, he was making a profit of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but I don't believe it—I can't say whether the business, taken by itself, realised 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the business might have been a good one, but as it was conducted certainly not—it might have been a paying one in proper hands and pro<lb/>perly conducted—my belief is that it was not a paying business as then conducted—I am taking the working account in—I can't tell you whether it was a paying business, taking the trade simply, stripped of the bills, the partners, and that sort of thing—I took steps to inquire, but I could not arrive at any conclusion—I was told by some of the neighbours that it ought to have been a paying business, but it was not—that was their impression, but I say they were not in a position to judge—I can't call to memory whether the defendant told me that goods had gone to Bonham's; my impression is that he did, either when I first went there, before I was appointed receiver, or very shortly afterwards—I don't recollect whether Mr. Hincks was there then; I won't deny and I won't admit, for I don't recollect whether he said he must send some goods to pay for the wages that were due, nor do I recollect Mr. Hincks saying he had better do so—I will not say he did not—I can't recollect these minor matters—I know the wages were not all paid at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The mortgagee foreclosed his mortgage—the creditors and myself went into the matter, to see what the lease could be valued at, and we found it was a great deal more than-we could possibly be justified in throwing away money to redeem—it was a lease, 10 years unexpired—somewhere about 1,025<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was charged upon it—the rent was 265<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, irrespective of taxes—I came to the conclusion that it would not be for the advantage of the estate to redeem the lease out of the hands of the mortgagee, and the result justified our opinion, from the amount realised by the sale—the bankrupt himself attaches 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value to the lease—at the sale it realised somewhere about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nett—the first mortgagee would make no offer for it—without the cash account, which I afterwards filed by order of the Court, there were no materials on the books by which I could see what money he had paid during the last four months—the answer I give about it depends upon whether he is accurate in his statement—I have endeavoured to check it, and I cannot—his banker's book would contain some—the cash account distinguishes the bank payments from the cash—the entire amount of the cash account for the four months is stated as 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—out of those payments 9,700/. has gone in cash, not through the bank at all—I have endeavoured to check those payments, but cannot—the cash account was not rendered till a late period, after he had had the assistance of Mr. Logan—that must have been some time in April, or somewhat later; I can't say—the meeting of creditors on 2nd May, 1872, was to receive the report of the trustee as to what had been done, and to take the direction of the creditors as to the course to be pursued—that report was considered by the creditors, and a case submitted to Counsel—on Counsel's advice the prosecution was instituted—we requested the sanction of the Registrar, and submitted the documents to him, and he sanctioned the proceeding.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Poplar Place, Bayswater—I have been employed by the Metropolitan Railway to watch the defendants and others—on 21st October, I went with a man named Cremish to Notting Hill Gate Station, where I saw Floyd with another man, who is not in custody—he left the other man outside, came into the station, and spoke to Parmenter—I then saw him go to a tray, where the collected tickets were put, in front of Parmenter—he selected some tickets, and put them in his coat pocket—Parmenter was looking at him at the time—Floyd went out and called the other man, and they then passed Parmenter, whose duty it was to click the tickets—I saw him clicking the passengers' tickets as they passed by; but neither of those men showed their tickets to be clipped—they passed Parmenter without his doing it—Cremish and I followed them—they got into the train and so did we—we got out at South Kensington, and so did they—we followed them up the stairs—there is a ticket-collector there—Floyd spoke to him, and the man who was with Floyd passed out without showing any ticket—Floyd gave a ticket up to the collector—on</p>

               <p>the 23rd I went with Cremish, and Walker, and Urban to the Notting Hill Gate Station—I left them there at 10.30, and went to St. James's Park—about 11 o'clock I saw Floyd and the same man I had seen with him before come out of the station, followed by Urban, Cremish, and Walker—Urban stopped Floyd—he said he was a detective, and asked what ticket he had given to the collector—he said the one he had come up with—Urban asked him where he had come from, and he said "From Victoria"—Urban asked him if he had any more tickets on him—he said be thought he had one more, and he took a half-ticket from his pocket and gave it to Urban—Urban said "You can't go back with that, as it is cancelled"—he said "Oh, yes, I can; I am known down the line, and I can be passed through"—Urban left Floyd with Cremish, and went up to a man named Cooper—shortly after he came back, and took Floyd to Cooper—Cooper was given In charge, but he was subsequently discharged by the Magistrate—Cooper said, in Floyd's presence, "That is the man; I know him well; he is up and down here three or four times a day"—Urban said "Then you know the man?"—Cooper said "Yes, I know him perfectly well"—Floyd said that he had given the ticket to Cooper as he came through the barrier—Cooper said "Yes, he did give me a ticket"—he was then told he would be taken in charge for conspiring to defraud the Railway Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Parliamentary agent, carrying on business in Westminster—I know the bankrupt, James Abraham Fox—this is his signa<lb/>ture to this agreement.

I have been served with a subpoena and notice to produce my title to this land—I have no documents here relating to it; my solicitor has the whole of my practice now—Mr. Rutter is my solicitor; he has had all the papers relating to this matter—under advice I do not produce any deeds relating to this land—I have not any—Mr. Rutter holds as my attorney, bus I am told that I am not bound to Produce anything at all relating to title—I decline to answer whether I have any deeds here relating to this land—I don't like to charge my memory accurately as to when I first became possessed of this land, but I think it must have been in '66 or '65—I received possession from a person of the name of Graham—I can't give you his address; he is in America—I gave him a sum of money—I purchased from him what interest he had in the land—I believe he was not the freeholder—I did not know at the time whether he was or was not—I paid him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I won't be quite sure about the date; I can give it you if you wish to see it particularly; but it must have been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280066"/>
               <p>'66 or '65—I have a paper here showing that I paid him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this land—as I have said before, I have no personal objection to produce it, but I am told I am not bound to produce it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) this will give me the date perhaps, it was earlier than I thought, it is 12th September, '64, I should not have thought it was before '65—I then purchased from Graham the interest he had in that piece of land—I had no other interest than I purchased from Graham—that was the only piece of paper that passed between me and Graham in respect of the purchase of this land—it is not in the nature of a conveyance at all; it is a receipt—I should tell you that Mr. Graham was at that time on the eve of leaving England; I think he went away the next day; I had no time to get any other document—that is the only interest I had in this land, for which I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Fox was not in possession at that time—I went on the land long before Fox was there—he certainly was not on the land at that very time; it was Simmonds I think, he was a grazier I believe—it was a meadow at that time used by Simmonds as grazing ground, and Simmonds paid me rent—at the time I got possession of the land he was paying to Graham, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the land—I knew that from Simmonds and from Graham both, and he continued to pay me that sum, and I let Fox in possession on the same terms—I let Fox in possession of the land—I don't mean to say that I actually went on the land and put him in in that sense—this is the only document I have respecting the land, "To John Charles Rees, Esq. In consideration of the sum of fifty pounds paid by you to me for the assignment of all my interest in the premises let by me to James Morphew, dated 12th September, 1864, I do hereby undertake to hold you harmless, and to indemnify you for any claim on the said premises"—the reference to this land is "the premises let by me to James Morphew," that is let by Graham—a man named Simmonds was in possession; I believe it was in this way, Morphew was Graham's tenant, and Simmonds took from Morphew; I believe it was Simmonds, I won't be quite sure about the name, it was somebody who was under Morphew—I did not mention Morphew's name to you before, because Simmonds was in possession of the land, and you asked me who was in possession—I did not give Simmonds notice to quit, he left without notice to quit—Fox was substituted as his tenant—I did not let Fox into possession; I believe Simmonds did—I said just now that I did not do so physically, but in the sense in which I entered into an agreement—I do not draw a distinction between the natural and the non-natural sense, but I drew a distinction at the time; I did not let him into the physical possession of the ground; he had possession under the agreement from me—I believe Fox was let into possession by Simmonds; I believe he held first under Simmonds before he held direct from me—I do not know when Simmonds gave up possession to Fox; I fancy it was shortly before the date of the agreement that Fox had with me—I did not go to Fox and represent that I was the freeholder; certainly not—I did not represent to him that I had a better title to the land than he had—I made no representation to him on the subject at all—Fox came to me; I believe Simmonds and Fox came together, and I agreed to accept Fox as tenant in place of Simmonds, that was the simple transaction, or the person I call Simmonds, I won't be quite sure that is the name; it is seven or eight years ago, and I cannot charge my memory; I believe the name was Sim<lb/>monds—I think Simmonds' name is mentioned in the agreement; I think you will find it in a memorandum at the foot that there is something about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280067"/>
               <p>Simmonds, if that is the right name—I am not aware that an agreement would be void by parol if it was more than three years; a lease is void, I believe, if not for three years—I don't know that that is void I really have not considered the question whether it is or not; I will not give an opinion upon it; more shame to me if it be, for I believe I drew it—it does not purport to create a term of years; it is a yearly tenancy for seven years, I think—I am not aware that it is necessary to have an agreement under seal—this does not create a term of seven years; it is an agreement to let—I cannot see that there is anything illegal in that—I was a witness on Fox's trial at Guildford, he was indicted there for perjury—I believe he was acquitted—I was not present at the acquittal; I believe he was acquitted by direction of the Judge—perhaps you will allow me to add that I was ordered by the Judge of the County Court to prosecute him for perjury—previously to this transaction of letting the land to him I had no acquaintance with Fox—I said then that I could not prove that I had received any rent from him, nor can I now—I am not in a position to give legal proof of it, I believe—I should say that when I sued Fox for the rent, I gave credit for the half year's rent—I was sent for and bound over by the County Court Judge to prosecute Fox very much against my will—I was not present when the Judge made the order.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I am generally aware that one of the assignments of perjury against Fox was with reference to the tenancy of this land, but I had never seen the indictment—I was called as a witness to prove that Fox had paid me rent—I never heard Fox state that he had never paid me any rent—I believe he did, but I never heard him say so—I did not go to Guildford for the purpose of proving that he had paid me rent; I was called as a witness, and I answered such questions as were put to me, as I have to-day—I gave the evidence that I have given here to-day, that I never received any myself—I have not brought my clerk here—I have recollected since how the rent was paid—I can't say whether there I was an assignment of perjury as to Elsey's debt; I really don't know I was only the nominal prosecutor—I brought an action against Fox in the County Court for his rent—I was asked to produce my title-deeds, or explain how I became possessed of the land—I was advised that Fox was not in a position, having accepted tenancy under me, to dispute my title, and I declined to answer or to produce any deeds—I have persistently done so up to to-day—the paper that I have produced, and which has been read, is the only document that I have showing that I derive my title from Graham, and for that I gave about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I have not the remotest notion of the value of these seven acres—I am not in possession of them now; they are not my property now; they have passed from me to the London, Chatham, and Dover Company—I made an arrangement with them, and gave them up possession—they stated that I was quite right in the contention—I have not received any money—I did not make them a present of the land; I gave them possession of it without requiring them to give me notice to quit, upon certain grounds—they did not repay me the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wish you to know all about it, as far as I am concerned—I have satisfied myself of that which I was totally ignorant of before, that the London, Chatham, and Dover Company bought that land, and are entitled to it, and had a conveyance of it years and years before, long before I had anything to do with it; upon being satisfied that that was so, as soon as I ascertained it, I said "I am very willing that you should have possession; I am satisfied the land belongs to you, the freehold;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280068"/>
               <p>I am perfectly well in possession as tenant," which they admitted; they were old clients of mine, and I said "You shall have possession at once, and Mr. Forbes, the General Manager, shall say what you ought to do, as far as I am concerned, under the circumstances;" that is exactly how it stands—Mr. Forbes has not yet settled what is to be done between us—he is my friend also—I was undoubtedly against Fox—this piece of land was not originally waste land, occupied by anybody—to the best of my knowledge and belief it never was—I don't know where Simmonds is—I don't know that he has gone to America—I don't know how long he was in possession; I found him in possession—I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Graham without calling upon him for any evidence of his title—he told me the circumstances under which the land was in his possession—he was a connexion of mine—he was going out to America, and I said "Very well, if you like to leave the land in my possession there is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you"—Fox was not then in possession; it was Simmonds or Morphew, I won't say which—allow me to add that I took very great pains to ascertain to whom the freehold of the land belonged; no rent had been paid for it for some years, and I could not, at that time, ascertain who the freeholder was—afterwards the London, Chatham, and Dover Company came to me, and satisfied me that they had the best right to it.</p>

Elsey, one to the proof of debt and the other to the proxy paper, which is in favour of Harvey; that would enable him to act for the creditor at the meeting of creditors—Deacon's proof was exhibited to me on 10th November, it is marked by me as exhibited on that day—the handwriting in the body of Elsey's proof is different from that of the jurat—I should think the body is Harvey's writing, I have seen him write in the meeting; the jurat is Condy's, I know his signature—the affidavit purports to be made at Battersea House, Battersea, on 9th November, 1871—there are two signatures of Deacon's one to his proof of debt, and the other to the proxy to Harvey—the body of that is Harvey's, and the jurat Condy's—I have on the file an affidavit of Condy's. of 12th March, 1872; it was sworn before me. (<hi rend="italic">In this affidavit Condy moore that Deacon and Elsey at the Wands<lb/>worth Country Court.</hi>) Three were sworn before me on that day, Harvay's, England's, and Condy's—I have also on the file of the proceedings, an affidavit of Condy's, dated 2nd January, 1871, but it ought to be 1872; it is a mere clerical error.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJHANT SLEIGH</hi>. All the proceedings which Became matter of record in Fox's bankruptcy are before me, with the Shorthand writers' notes; they form a portion of it—I have known Mr. Condy as a solicitor for some years, occasionally practising in our Court; I do not know anything against him—he appeared on behalf of Fox before the adjudication, and opposed it—I don't think there was any adjournment upon the adjudication—the petition was to be heard on 27th October, and he was made a bankrupt then—Mr. Rees' debt has never been reduced; it stands now to the full amount—at the first meeting of creditors it was objec<lb/>ted to by the bankrupt, and I marked it so, but it was afterwards admitted by the Court to the full amount—an application was made by the solicitor engaged in this matter for an order to prosecute Harvey, and granted; the order is on the proceedings—a similar application was made to the Judge of the country Court to prosecute Condy; that was refused; the ground is stated in the judgment-all the affidavits that were filed are here on the proceedings—I know Mr. Hughes—I have no recollection of his appearing in the proceedings until an application was made to remove the trustee; he</p>

               <p>was the managing man who then appeared on the scene—I was not aware that he was managing clerk to the solicitors of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway until quite recently—he acted as managing clerk to the petitioning creditor, Mr. Rees; he did not appear for the Company—here is the order of 13th February, 1872, also one of 27th October, 1871—I can't say whether some of the debts were expunged owing to the fact that Fox had previously been a bankrupt, that that bankruptcy was re<lb/>opened, and that these were proofs under the old bankruptcy; I was not in Court at the time the matter came before the Judge, Mr. Stonor; I don't know the fact—I think there was some subsequent proof of some other creditor whilst these proceedings were pending—the old bankruptcy did not come up for a long time afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. No doubt Elsey was examined, or his debt would not have been expunged—I was at Guildford; I heard Elsey examined there; I heard the Judge make a remark in reference to Elsey—I think Swinford was examined at Guildford—Patteson's debt was ex<lb/>punged, I can't say that it was on account of his non-appearance, having left the country; I don't think I was in Court at the time—the Judge made the order, and I drew it up—if a creditor does not appear in support of his claim of course it would be expunged—I don't recollect Patteson's case at all—England's was expunged and then restored, but afterwards expunged, I believe, on account of his bankruptcy, and his assignees would be the proper creditors—there are one or two affidavits of Mrs. Fox on the file—I think an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was produced on the trial of Fox; I did not see it; there was some document handed up—I think I heard Elsey say it was his handwriting.</p>

Hayward, Keele, &amp; Swan, of 5, Frederick's Place, Old Jewry—Mr. Keele, one of the firm, is attorney for the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company, he has the management of the land department of the Company—I was there five years and eight months—I am sorry to say that almost from first to last I have had the management of this prosecution, it has lasted a long time—there was a prosecution at Guildford, there were other persons before the Magistrate, and this prosecution now—during that time I was managing clerk to the firm—this prosecution is not promoted by the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company; the proceedings in bankruptcy were, in conjunction with Mr. Rees, the under tenant, so to speak; he appears to be the under tenant of Mr. Graham—Mr. Rutter is the attorney for Mr. Rees—inferentially I hare acted with him, and as<lb/>sisted him in this prosecution by permission of Messrs, Hayward, Keele, &amp; Swan, because from the first it was left entirely to me to exercise my dis<lb/>cretion as to what proceedings should be taken, with a view to obtain and secure the possession of this land—the body of Deacon's proof it in Mr. Harvey's handwriting, and the jurat in Mr. Condy's, and the same as to Elsey's—I was present at the County Court, Whet Deacon and Elsey, were examined as to their proof and when they Were ordered to be ex<lb/>punged—I remember Andrews being examined on two days, the 6th and 15th February—his proof was afterwards expunged by the Judge as fraudulent—I spoke to him on the subject of his proof several times—on 4th January he told me, after some considerable discussion on the matter, that Fox, the bankrupt, only owed him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was d—sorry that he had anything to do with the vagabond—this is Andrews' proof.

To Mr. Miller, Solicitor. Dear Sir, Mr. Hughes having left our office, we beg to return the enclosed subpoena, Hayward, Keele, &amp; Swan")—I thought there was something very denunciatory in it, according to your introduction—I first came on the scene with reference to this matter of Fox and the land, early in October, 1871—I had seen Fox once previously, I think I served him with a writ of ejectment in July, 1871, at the suit of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway—I had not pre<lb/>viously had a communication with Mr. Rees on the subject of this land; I believe Mr. Keele had—we did not go on with the action because we were too late for the then Surrey Assiees; it has never been determined to this day—I should have gone on with it if I had had my instructions in time, but I was just a day too late—I was not at the Wandsworth County Court when Fox was adjudicated a bankrupt; I was in the country—I knew of the proceedings—I advised them, in order, if possible, to obtain an adju<lb/>dication in bankruptcy against him; my employers called upon me to give my assistance, and I was bound to do it, I gave them the best of my advice, as I was bound to do; I could not refuse the service they appointed to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280072"/>
               <p>—I attended at the Wandsworth County Court on all the occasions after the first meeting for proofs—Mr. Rutter appeared, and took the active part in promoting the proceedings in bankruptcy—previous to their initiation, I was only once in communication with Mr. Rutter at my employers' office—I was present when an application was made to the County Court Judge to insti<lb/>tute a prosecution against certain parties, including Mr. Condy; that appli<lb/>cation, as far as Mr. Condy was concerned, was refused by the Judge, and he gave his reason for it—I was at Guildford, but not examined—Fox was prosecuted there for perjury and subornation—he was acquitted—the County Court Judge ordered that prosecution; Mr. Rees was the prosecu<lb/>tor, he was put under recognisances to prosecute by the Judge—I am the prosecutor of this indictment for conspiracy to-day—at the time I instituted this prosecution against Mr. Condy I was clerk to Messrs. Hayward &amp; Co., the solicitors to the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway; I was not acting under their instructions, I did it upon my own impulse; put it on the love of justice if you please; I did not like to see great rascals escape; I am not bearing the expense of this prosecution, I have been called on for nothing yet—I don't know who has found the funds up to the present time; that is a question that should be addressed to the solicitor for the prosecution, my mind is a blank on the subject—it has not always been a blank, we have had so many of these proceedings that I am surprised that I have any mind left at all; so many proceedings were initiated together that a necessary complication arises—I take it for granted Mr. Rutter has found the money—I, of course, have paid certain expenses—I have not been called upon to pay professional fees, a bill of costs, or anything of that sort—I know Mrs. Fox very well, I have only known her since these bankruptcy proceedings—I have been contributing 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to her support since the date of her husband's committal for trial, by direction of Mr. Rutter and Mr. Keele; they find the money—I suggested to them that this woman ought not to be allowed to starve—they find the money, and pay it through my hands; I have paid it to her personally, taking her receipt every week—I have paid it at various places, generally at my house; I have generally left it out for her to call, and the receipt to be signed; sometimes my wife has paid her, and sometimes my servant—I have seen her very frequently since her husband's committal, sometimes at my own house, never at other people's houses—I have seen her in public-houses, never alone; I have been very careful all through; it is very dangerous to be with another man's wife anywhere—I have not been paying money to any one else, only the witnesses; I have paid Mr. Elsey some, I have given him a subpoena, Mr. Deacon, I have paid him, Mr. Swinford, and other witnesses whose names I can give you, many witnesses; I never gave them anything only with the subpoena—I have stated that I took care not to give them too much for fear it should be suggested that I had bribed them—you don't know the company I have been in—I was in the employment of the Poor Law Board—I have not seen Mr. Glenn here to day, you mean a member of the Bar, and one of the officers of the Board—he was a fellow-clerk of mine for years, I see he is sitting behind you, I have not seen him for ten years—I was in the legal department of the Poor Law Board about twenty years—I was called on to resign—this is not my first appearance in the witness-box—you have not the honour of speak-to an ex-judge, that is a delusion of the other side; I know what is coming—the cause of my resigning at the Poor Law Board was this, I was fined 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Sir Thomas Henry, myself and another, for being the registered</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. I think I became acquainted with An<lb/>drews in November, 1871—the adjudication had taken place on 27th Octo<lb/>ber, and the first meeting was on 10th November; I had nothing to do with those—I first went to him—I was then acting as managing clerk to my late firm, and conducting the inquiry into the validity of the proofs; it was in pur<lb/>suance of that office that I called on Andrews—I had never seen him before—I then saw him at his house in Arthur Road, Brixton—I saw him several times afterwards, at the Windmill public-house, Lower Kennington Lane; that was his rendezvous, and I used to find him there at various hours in the evening; sometimes at 6 o'clock, sometimes 8 o'clock, and on one occasion I did not find him till about 11.30—the communications he made to me were not over our glass; I think we had finished our glass—on 4th January he told me; that was not the evening when I found him at 11.30, that was about 7.30 I think, a summer's evening—there were no other persons present on that occasion; I found him in front of the bar; there were no other persons where we were—the bar is divided into three bulk head compartments, and he and I were in one compartment together—there were other persons in the other compartments at a distance—I have also met him at his house, but never only on this business; I have been there once, twice, or three times—I did not see him on each occasion, only on one; he was alone then, in his front parlour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Fox was acquitted on the charge of perjury, but stands remanded till the next assizes on four indictments—he has not been out on bail; I offered to let him out on easy bail if he could get it—the reason I was called on to resign my office at the Poor Law Board was this, I was fined for an offence against the Refreshment Houses Act, the Act was then new; I was one of the joint lessees of a place in which this took place, and the proceedings were taken against me; of course I could not deny it, I was in the country at the time, and I paid the penalty—I was not called upon to resign; I resigned rather than have any inquiry into the matter; it 'was a matter that I could not congratulate myself upon; it was on account of the fine that I resigned; I did not think the Board should suffer any annoyance through it—a summons was taken out against me for detaining some books, papers, moneys, and so on, belonging to the society of which I was secretary, and the oldest member; it was called the Borough of Southwark Fifty Pound Provident Society—the summons was heard before Mr. Burcham and extended. over four months—the re<lb/>sult was that Mr. Burcham suggested that it should be referred—I said rather than protract the proceedings any longer, I would make the payment without prejudice, to the society of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,; they were satisfied with that—Mr. Burcham said it was a very handsome offer, and that my accounts were most correct—that was the close of the transaction between me and the society; they found out afterwards that they owed me money—there is no truth in the suggestion that I have been guilty of any im<lb/>propriety with Mrs. Fox—in what I have done with reference to her I had the sanction of my employers previously obtained—the allowance of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week has gone on from July to now—I had not the slightest personal know<lb/>ledge of the quarrel with her husband; I was quite surprised to hear it—I had never known Mrs. Fox before this matter, or Mr. Fox.</p>

               <p>I don't know whether he is to be a witness or not—I suggested that he should be brought here—I have been in communication with him during the time he has been in gaol—he has written several letters to me, asking me to get him out on bail; I promised to do so—I did not do so, he put it out of my power—he wrote to me certain statements that he was going to make as a witness, but before the Grand Jury he adhered to all his old former statements—I told him before, as the Magistrate told him that I would not believe him if he was to swear upon a stack of Bibles—I did not call him as a witness before the Grand Jury; I told the Grand Jury that I must call him, I suppose, because his name was on the back of the indictment—I put his name on the back of the bill, because I was bound to do so—I did not think him a favourable witness at that time; I was bound to put his name there, because his wife had made a certain statement to me; I relied on the statement she made—I did not believe anything of him—I put his name on the bill because he Would have an opportunity then of doing what the Judge of the County Court advised him, making a clean breast of the whole matter; that was not to retract what he had first stated and swore to; I did not know what he was going to say at all—I knew what he had sworn, and I was present when the Judge gave him the advice to put himself into my hands and make a clean breast of it—I thought he would make a clean breast of it, but I did not care whether he did or not—the Grand Jury examined him shortly, and would not hear any more; he did not say half-a-dozen words.</p>

I am a clerk to the St. Katharine Dock Company—I knew James Abraham Fox, the bankrupt, for three or four years—I knew Mr. Condy prior to the bankruptcy proceedings quite well; I have known him five or six years—I signed this proof in Bank<lb/>ruptcy and the appointment of a proxy, at the Wands worth County Court, at Mr. Harvey's request; he did not say anything to me as to why I should sign it—I signed the proxy at the same time, at the meeting of creditors, as one to be appointed for a committee of inspection, I under<lb/>stood; Harvey told me so, for the purpose of my being one of the committee of inspection—at that time Fox owed me about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not more—prior to this he had given me an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been collect<lb/>ing various moneys for him, and I could not get any settlement with him, and there were certain other moneys to collect, and he said "You had better draw upon me an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," which I did at his request—it was money that I handed over to him, that I had collected, not more; I had collected debts, and had further debts to collect, and in consequence of that he gave me an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sub<lb/>sequently returned that I O U to Fox as of no use—I never saw it again till I saw it at Guildford; I beg pardon, I saw it at the County Court, prior to going to Guildford; I got it from Harvey then, he gave it to me back; he did not say for what purpose—it was after he had given it to me, that I was called upon to sign these two papers—I never swore an affidavit before Mr. Condy—I know his handwriting—I have seen this proof of debt; it purports that I swore an affidavit before him at Battersea House, Battersea—I never was in that house in my life, and never swore an affidavit anywhere—I believe Battersea House is the joint office of Condy and Harvey; I don't know, I never was in the house—I had known Condy over six years previous to these proceedings—during the progress of the</p>

               <p>bankruptcy proceedings I had no communication whatever with Condy as to this proof of debt; no, otherwise than when I was leaving the first meeting of creditors, he stopped me on the stairs as I was coming from the County Court, and said, "You know that you swore that at Battersea House"—I said, "I never was at Battersea House in my life, and never swore that affidavit"—he said, "Oh, you know better than that, we can make that right"—my debt was subsequently expunged by the Judge—7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only was due from Fox to me—my proof after being removed, was subsequently re<lb/>instated on the proceedings for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I have not been particularly acquainted with Fox, but I have known him several years—I had not transacted busi<lb/>ness with him very long prior to his giving me the I O U, only a few weeks, that is all—I had never had any transaction with him before; I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of what I had done, so it was not long—I don't know what day of the month it was now; it was at the time he gave me the I O U—it is true that he gave me the I O U in consequence of what I had collected, and what I was to collect—he paid me the I O U for past services, and services that were to come, to the amount of the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote out the I O U my<lb/>self at his request, he could not write I suppose—my debt of 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was expunged, and I was put down as a creditor for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Judge; I explained to the Judge, as I have done here to-day, that the I O U was given to me for past as well as future services—Fox and I never had any dispute about the amount—I don't know what Fox swore; I was at Guildford—the I O U was put into my hands, and I admitted that it was all in my handwriting, except the date and Fox's signature—I don't know whether the Judge stopped the case against Fox or not; I don't remember what he said—he did not tell me that he could not ask the Jury to convict even a cat upon my evidence; he never made use of those words, or I should have heard it, and I don't think he did, nor anything like it—I don't know what he said to the Jury about me, I swear that; I only attended one meeting, that was the first, at which Mr. Harvey was elected trustee—I received two or three letters from Mr. Harvey to attend, but I never attended, and never took any interest in the affair—I don't know what they put me down as a creditor for—when I put my signature it was in blank and part print; the amount was in blank—I signed this paper of course for one of the Com<lb/>mittee of Inspection; the signature is mine; they are not my figures, I swear that; at the time I signed it the figures were not there, I swear that; I ought not to have put my signature to this of course—I never sent in any amount, for I was not in possession of the I O U—it was given to me by Harvey—I can't tell the day that Fox gave it to me, but whoever received the I O U when I gave it bock put a date to it—Fox gave it into my own hands, I kept it for some short time, and returned it to him again as useless—when he became bankrupt I did not send in my claim for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I never put it down—I deny the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I acknowledge to the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never admitted the figures on the I O U to be mine.</p>

I get 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sometimes 66<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 26<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., just according to what we have to do, piece work—I have been employed at Millwall Woolworks—I am not paid weekly, I am paid daily—I am not a dock labourer; I am paid so much per day, when I get work; a supernumerary, called in when they are busy, and paid according to the work I do, so much per hour—I am a check clerk, or I put the weights on, whatever may be required—I did live at Battersea; I don't live there now—I lived at Gladstone Street—I lived at Battersea between two and three yean—I think it is twelve months ago; somewhere about that—I know Mr. Thelenberg, the butcher there—I very likely gave him a cheque in payment of something that I owed him; I have done some hundreds, in the usual way of business—if it was dishonoured that was not my fault; it was through unforeseen circum<lb/>stances—he kept the cheque three or four weeks; the money was there at the time—there were funds to meet it when it was presented, but not sufficient—I can't tell you now how much it was for—it was more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he has had the money since—I know Mr. Hind, the baker, at Battersea—I gave him a cheque, and got some change—I don't think that cheque was paid—I can explain that; I supplied 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of things, and never got a shilling, in Battersea—I know Mr. Wigmore, of Fulham—I never owed him money; to the contrary, he owes me money at the present time—I was never in his employment; I never did a thing for him—I have had plenty of money transactions with him in the way of business—I supplied him with materials when I was a lime merchant—I don't owe him a farthing, and never did; the contrary, he owes me money now for goods supplied—I have seen Mr. Spence, of Battersea Square, greengrocer—I have never had any dealings with him myself, nor my wife</p>

               <p>Court, at Wandsworth, on 10th November last; that was the first meeting of creditors—I saw Mr. Condy there, Mr. Harvey, Elsey, England, and several others, but I could not say who they were—Mr. Condy did not stay there the whole time—he might have been there half or three-quarters of an hour—during that time he did not administer an oath to Elsey; I am positive he did not—I know, of course, what is meant by administering an oath, the same that I have done this morning—Mr. Willoughby, the Registrar, presided—I have been at the Police Court several times—Mr. England was called as a witness there—I don't think Clark was, I could not say for certain—he was not present at the bankruptcy proceedings on 10th November—when Mr. Condy left, he said he was going to some other County Court, Bow—I am quite sure that he administered no oath to Elsey before that, nor did any one else—I remember a transaction about a bill of exchange between my husband and Mr. Harvey; I had the bill myself up to 10th November, the day of the first examination; it was Swinford's bill, my husband gave it to me; I had it in my possession always; my husband asked me to give it to him for Mr. Harvey, so as he could claim a debt, and I did give it to him, in Mr. Condy's and Mr. Harvey's presence, at Mr. Harvey's office, Battersea House—my husband said then Mr. Harvey would be the largest creditor, as it was the largest amount, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he would be able to be trustee—once or twice before that Mr. Harvey had said, "Have you not got an old bill, or make out one, so as you can make me a creditor?"—that was in October, I think—I don't think Mr. Condy was present when that was said—Harvey alone asked that—when I gave him the bill at Battersea House, Mr. Harvey pinned it on another piece of paper, a large sheet of paper with writing on it and printed—then we came out of the office, and we had to meet him at the County Court, where the meeting of creditors was; this was on the morning of 10th of November—I then went to the County Court with my husband, and met Condy and Harvey there—I saw the piece of paper and the bill handed up on the top of the desk to the Registrar—on Saturday, 11th November, my husband had a letter from Mr. Harvey to meet him at his office at 71, Sloane Street, and to arrange about the bill, about the money—I went with him—Mr. Condy was there when we got there—he was asked if Mr. Harvey was in—he said, "No, he is not"—my husband said, "How tiresome; I was to meet him."—Condy said, "I know all about it, you must wait, he will not be long"—Harvey came in, shortly afterwards—Mr. Condy said, "As usual, all behind;" Harvey said, "Wait a moment, I must go and get the money for the bill, I will be in in a few moments"—he went out again, and came in and brought the money in his hand, and then he said, "You will be able to go and take an oath clear that you have had the money"—he brought in some money and gave it to my husband—he said, "Now you will be able to swear to the Court that you had the money," and he says, "You must give it me back again"—he gave some notes to my husband, and he gave it him back again—Mr. Condy was not in the room at this time, he was in the front office—when we first went in we were in the front office, adjoining the other, a little office—when Mr. Harvey came back we went out of the front office into a little office—Mr. Harvey said, "Come in here, come in this way, shut the door, we don't want those to hear in the front, you know no<lb/>body"—there were two persons, I think, in the front, Mr. Condy and a young lad—Mr. Condy was present when Harvey said, "We don't want any one to hear"—he heard it, because as we went in, he said, "Shut the</p>

               <p>door;" of course he must have heard it—then Harvey gave the notes to my husband, and said, "You can now swear that you have received money for the bill," and he said, "Give them to your wife first, then she can say that she has"—that ceremony was gone through and I put them on the desk, and he picked them up and put them in his pocket again—Fox said "Of course Mr. Condy knows all about it," and Harvey said, "Oh, yes, that is all right"—there were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes the first time, that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the first money—on Monday, the 13th, we went again and met Mr. Harvey and Mr. Condy there—Harvey said "I must go and borrow some money"—he went out again and borrowed some money, and came back in a few minutes with three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, that was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—Oh, I think I have made a mistake, I think it was three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes the first time, that would be 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—when Harvey gave Mr. Fox the three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, he said, "Give it to your wife, and if any one asks you what you have done with it, say you have given it to your wife, and she is an extravagant woman, and spent it in clothes"—Mr. Condy was not present in the office then—Harvey said, "You must give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back"—Fox said "I have not got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he said, "Well, I will give you the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and you can give it to me back," and he gave him two half-crowns and he gave it him back—the money was all given back to Mr. Harvey—that all passed in my presence—Mr. Condy was not present in the back office, he was in the front office, and when we came out of the back office Mr. Condy said, "Have you settled it?"—my husband said "Yes, and it is all right"—Mr. Condy and Harvey came out of the office, and me and my husband went away—I believe they went to a public-house below—nothing was said between Condy and Harvey, that I know of, as to the money having been borrowed—I did not hear anything of it—Harvey said he would have to borrow the money; he said that to Mr. Fox and Mr. Condy, in the front office, that was in the presence of Condy—I remember an inquiry made before the Judge at the County Court—in March afterwards I was at 71, Sloane Street with my husband, when I saw Mr. Condy, Harvey, and Harvey's son—Harvey gave my husband a piece of paper so as he should remember; that was after the first examination, I think—I can't say whether it was in March, it was after the first examination; it was in March—Mr. Harvey was very angry with Mr. Fox because he made a mistake about the money—I can't exactly say the words he said, but he was very angry with him, and told him he was a fool to take and make such a mistake—he made a mistake in the dates of the bill that Mr. Harvey told him to say when he had the bill; for having made a mistake in the date, in the evidence he had given before Mr. Stonor—Harvey wrote an affidavit, and my husband had to sign it, and he gave him a piece of paper to keep in his pocket, and he said, "Read it night and day, and don't forget when you go there again to remember the date."—there was an affidavit made at that time about making a mistake, at that very place, and Harvey wrote on a paper, and said, "Keep that, read it over day and night, and then you won't forget about the date, perhaps"—Condy was there at this interview—I don't remember a person named Carroll coming to the office; I never saw him at Mr. Condy's office—I have only seen Carroll with Condy and Harvey since this case has been on, about here and at the Police Court; I have seen them once or twice together—he was at the County Court on the day of the first examination, but he came in just after it was over—he wanted to make an affidavit or something about a debt Mr. Fox owed another gentleman, and</p>

               <p>he said, "You are too late, you should have been here before," that was on 10th November—I never saw Carroll after that, at any time, at Mr. Condy's—some papers were written out for me by Mr. Condy and Mr. Harvey when I nave gone there to swear affidavits about things; they read them down to me and asked me to sign them—I did so under the juris<lb/>diction of my husband, or else I was knocked about if I did not—my husband was present at the time; he wished me to sign them—I signed two papers—I was asked to sign others and I would not—I heard Mr. Harvey and Mr. Condy both tell Mr. Fox that he must say that he left Deacon in the fields (that is Battersea fields), and they must say that he came to the office, or some man like him, to swear his affidavit—I believe there was an affidavit made to that effect—I was at Guildford—Mr. Harvey was not there; he had not surrendered—yesterday afternoon, while I was down stairs, Mr. Harvey brought two rough men up to me in the street; he says, "You know her, that is Mrs. Fox, you will know her again, won't you?" and then again he brought up another one, a respectable-looking man, I think he was a policeman in disguise, I have been told so, and he said, "That is Mrs. Fox, that is her; do you know her, the cat," and he pointed his finger at me like that, and he said "Yes, I think I know her;" and I said, "I will lock you up if you insult me," and they walked away, and Mr. Harvey insulted another gentleman who was outside in the tame manner—he brought these two men up to Mr. Elsey, and he said "Do you know him? look at him from top to toe; that is the villain "—that was yesterday morning, before the Court was opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the shorthand writer appointed by the Judge of the County Court to take notes of this examination—I was sworn to take what passed—I have the notes before me—the transcript produced is correct—at page 127 in the examination of Fox, Mr. Condy, addressing the Judge, says: "Sir, in Elsey's last affidavit he swears that the money was due to him, but he swears that he did not take the affidavit before me. I see that I swore the affidavit on the 10th, therefore I must have made a mistake in the jurat, copying probably from one of the affidavits. I think it was before the learned Registrar arrived in Court. I am extremely sorry that such a mistake should have occurred, but it probably occurred from copying from another affidavit. But, at all events, he swears to the amount, and he was one of the committee of inspection; if, therefore, any one was imposing on the Court, it was Elsey himself. Mr. Stonor: Do you know Elsey? Mr. Condy: Yes sir, I know him, and I remember his taking the oath now—he does not dispute the amount that is due to him. Mr. Stonor: Yes he does; he swears that there was an I O U for 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that there was only 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. really due. His proof, therefore, will have to be reduced to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "Andrews was examined on 6th and 13th February, and his proof was expunged. In Harvey's examination he is asked:" <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, then, I believe that under this bankruptcy there is no estate whatever, save and except this land? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is none whatever, I believe—"A little further on, Mr. Stonor asks:" Is there a dispute as to the freehold? and Mr. Condy says: Yes, we have had possession of it since 1866, and now they</p>

               <p>are setting up a claim to it. Mr. Ribton: There is no dispute, and can he no dispute upon it; we have recovered our judgment debt against them. Mr. Condy: We have never attorned at all Mr. Miller: But you, as trustee, are very willing to give up the land if they can show a better title to it? Mr. Condy: Yes, a better title than I have got. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And has there been an action of ejectment commenced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I mean to try it—"At page 90 in the examination of Fox, Mr. Stonor says:" As the case stands, the creditor and trustee contradict him in every material part of the transaction. The transaction is almost beyond belief, and as to all the circumstances surrounding it, the bankrupt contradicts the trustee in every one of them. He says that the payments were made at three different times, instead of one. The trustee says you were present when he says you were not. Mr. Condy: You will not fail to perceive, sir, that the man is anything but a man of business, and therefore we must not read him too strictly. Mr. Stonor: If you go into the case further, you must put that straight about yourself. Mr. Condy: With reference to whit, sir t Mr. Stonor: Mr. Harvey says that you were present when 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid.

On Sunday night, 30th June last, I was on duty in Bermondsey New Road, about 1 o'clock, close to the top of Webb Street—I saw the prisoner coming up Webb Street from the direc<lb/>tion of No. 12—he could not speak, he made motions to me; I then saw that he was bleeding from a wound in the throat, and from the head—he pointed in the direction of 12, Webb Street—I said, "Show me where this occurred," and he took me to 12, Webb Street, to the first-floor back room—he was very excited; I don't think it was drink—he walked with me—I had my lamp with me—I found three persons in the room: a woman, a little child, and a boy, lying insensible in different parts of the room—there was a bed against the window, on the floor, but no bedstead—there was a smaller bed opposite the door going in, on the left—the little girl was lying on the smaller bed—there was about 3 yards between the two beds—the prisoner pointed out the beds to me—on the larger bed I saw the woman Susannah Hebden, and the boy Moses Israel—the woman was lying crossways on the bed, partly on the bed and her legs on the floor, and the boy was lying on her left, close to her—she was partly dressed—she had got on two petticoats and her chemise—I think that was all—I saw, from the state of the bodies, that they were dying; they were insensible, they could not speak—about that time the police-constable Bridgman came in, and I sent him for a doctor—I asked the prisoner for a candle, and he got one—I did not see where from—he was standing against the window, and he took the candle from somewhere close to him—it was not lighted—some-one lit it; there was no candlestick—I then examined the floor of the room—there were several places bloody, also on the bed-clothes—there were smears and splashes of blood on the floor—the greater quantity of blood was on the larger bed—I waited in the room till Dr. Cuolahan came—the prisoner was very excited, he kept pointing to the bodies and then to his throat—he could not speak—when the doctor came he directed that the prisoner should be taken to the hospital, and Bridgman tried to remove him from the room—he resisted—he was afterwards taken down stairs and put into a cab—he was taken into a front room for a short time—I did not see him again till the following Thursday—I stopped with the bodies—they both died while I was in the room—the two bodies were removed to the dead-house, and the boy was removed to the workhouse—on the following Thursday I was placed as guard over the prisoner in the hospital—he was then quite calm and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187210280101"/>
               <p>Sensible—I asked him how he was, but could not hear him answer; his throat was so bad he could not speak—on Wednesday, 10th July, he was able to speak a little—I could pick up words that he said then—he said he could not think he had murdered the little girl—he was very sorry for the little girl, for she was so fond of him—he said that the woman had driven him to this—he said before the Derby he bought her a new suit of clothes, and she went and pawned it, and got drunk—he said just previous to this she went away four days along with another man, on the Saturday, stopped four days, and returned on the Wednesday before this occurrence—he said he had been drinking, previous to that, for a fortnight; she drove him to it by going and stopping away—I remained with him from the Thursday, 4th July, until the 30th September, on and off—he seemed very sensible except when he had the erysepilas in his head; that was in August, then he was strapped down to the bed—he was delirious—with the exception of that he was usually calm—he conversed with me sensibly—on 30th "September he was taken away from the hospital by Inspector Walton and myself and taken before the Magistrate—he remained three months in the hospital, from 30th June to 30th September.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw that he was bleeding from the head—it was a very bad wound—he could not speak to me in the street when he first came up—he could only make gestures—I believe his throat was not dressed before he was taken to the hospital—he was taken there on the Sunday morning—I was directed by my inspector to go there on the Thursday—I believe he tore the bandages off after his throat had been dressed—I believe he did that on two or three occasions, but not in my presence—I have heard that he tore his throat open—I don't think that was before the Thursday, but I was relieved by other constables—I don't know what constable was there at that time—his violent conduct lasted about four days, I think—he was strapped to his bed during the four days—in consequence of his violence we could not have held him if he had not been strapped down, and all that time he was raving, very delirious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was on the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th August he was raving—that was when he had the erysipelas—he did not rave at any other time while I was there—he seemed quite calm—did not see him do anything to his throat.</p>

I am a costermonger and labourer, and live at 96, Bermondsey New Road—on Sunday morning, 30th June, I was at the corner of Webb Street, just before the clock struck one—I saw the last witness there—I saw the prisoner run out of the house in Webb Street and come towards me—I could see that his head was bleeding; the blood ran down his face and his shirt—he had nothing on but his trousers and shirt—no shoes, or stockings, or coat, or hat—he came and showed his head to the constable, and the constable said, "Come down and show me who <hi rend="italic">done</hi> that," and took hold of his left arm—the prisoner went to 12, Webb Street—I followed the constable—we went up to the back-room, first floor, and I saw the three persons lying there on the ground—the prisoner got a candle out of the corner of the room, and some one lighted it—I remained there until the doctor came, and another constable—I saw a bolt and a pocket-knife found in the room—I found the knife myself at the side of the bed—it was open—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave it Doctor Coulahan—it had blood on it—this bolt was found in the room at the right hand side going in—there was blood and hair on it—I weighed it—it weighs</p>

I was on duty in the Bermondsey New Road—I went on duty at 10 o'clock, and passed and repassed 12, Webb Street—I did not hear any disturbance or cries during the time I was on duty—I was at the corner of Webb Street just before 1 o'clock when I was called by a female—from what she said I went to 12, Webb Street, and listened—I heard nothing—I went into the back yard and listened, and heard nothing there—upon returning I was informed that some man had cut his throat—I went to 12, Webb Street into the back room—I saw March and the three bodies in the room—I was told to remove the prisoner to Guy's Hospital—he looked in a very wild excited state and he kept pointing up and down and to the side of his head where the injuries were—when we got to the head of the stairs to go down he resisted—he wanted to kiss the little child that was breathing just its last—we allowed him to kiss the child, and he then went quietly all the way to the hospital—when we arrived there he asked, by signs, for something to write on—he was handed a slate by the doctor and a piece of pencil—he wrote something on the slate which was afterwards rubbed off, but I took a copy of it; this is it—"A boy up stairs. I told you to go up. My two boys have not come home. I think they are stopped by the same party. They left home about 8.30: James Taylor and Alfred Taylor. Over at Mile End. Grandmother sent to Stone's End to fetch one. Uncle, March. Young Cone said he would do for me to night. He has been a soldier "—this was about half-an-hour after we got to the hospital—Stone's End mentioned there is the police-station in the borough—there are two detectives; one goes by the name of "Uncle" and another is Marsh or March—Cone, I believe, is the name of a person who lodges in the house—I did not wait with him after he wrote that on the slate—I think I was with him about three-quarters of an hour; he complained of thirst, and drank several times in the hospital—another constable took charge of him, and I came away—I went on duty there again the following Thursday morning, 4th July—I was in charge of him then for four weeks and three or four days—he was delirious the first week or ten days, and two or three days before be left the hospital he had a little swelling come in his face, from erysipelas—he was very delirious then—he told the night nurse when she came down that I threw three buckets of water over the day nurse—at other times he was sensible and right in his mind, and he could converse.</p>

               <p>Idea—for the four weeks and three or four days I was constantly with him—I had to go sick then and did not go after—during the time he was under my observation, he was not controllable several times—he wanted to kiss the little girl when we took him away from the house—he could not speak, but we took it from his signs it was the little girl he wished to kiss—I know that at the time this tragedy occurred, James Taylor was in the house—I don't know anything about his going on the previous Thursday to the Stone's End Station—when we were passing out I saw him pass with a constable going towards the station on the Wednesday night—why he went there I don't know—the constable is here that he gave himself up to on the Wednesday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> He wrote down very strange things on the slate; things that he would want to make use of—I did not copy all of them—he appeared very weak and ill—I have not copied those things from the slate, only what he wrote the first night—there was nothing else besides that—I did not judge from that that he showed symptoms of insanity; chiefly from his manner—he was very strange sometimes; he would jump up in bed—he was always very strange in his manner—there was nothing else—there were a few other things written on the slate, I believe—I saw one or two which did not refer to the crime, and I did not copy them—I could not remember them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D. and a surgeon—I live at 9, Grange Road, Bermondsey—on Sunday morning, 30th June, a constable came to me about 1.10 or 1.15—in consequence of what he said, I went to 12, Webb Street—I went up stairs to the back room first floor—the prisoner was there, and there were three persons on the floor—the mattrass was on the floor—a woman, about forty years of age, was lying across the mattrass, her feet resting on the floor—she was partially dressed, and unconscious—there were several wounds on her head, from which blood was issuing—she died in about half-an-hour on the same spot—a little girl, about five years old, was lying on another mattrass in the corner of the room, dying—she had a wound in the head, extending from the frontal bone to the occipital, and the brain was protruding—she died about twenty minutes after my attending—the little boy, about thirteen or fourteen, was not quite unconscious, he was crying—he had wounds on the head—he was sent to the workhouse; I accompanied him there—the other bodies were removed—I examined carefully the injuries they bad sustained—on the girl there was a wound extending from the frontal bone over the skull to the back-bone, only one wound; the side bones were broken in, and fragments were embedded in the brain, and the brain protruded—this piece of iron would produce the injuries—I sponged the woman's head, and partially examined her then; on the following Tuesday more particularly—on the left side of the head were two wounds, one above and one below the external angle of the left eyelid, with a fracture of the bones of the orbit; an irregular wound over the left temple, 2 inches in a transverse direction, and one in a vertical; a smaller wound, 1 inch in diameter, over the back<lb/>bone of the head, on the left side, 1 inch above and a little behind the tip of the ear, and another wound a little above the junction of the left ear with the scalp—there was blood issuing from the left ear, which was an evidence of fracture of the base of the skull—on the right side there was one triangular and two straight wounds of the scalp, penetrating to the bone: over the right lateral half of the frontal bone, there was a fracture</p>

               <p>Corresponding with the straight wound, contusion of the nose, discoloura<lb/>tion of the left wrist and arm, 4 inches vertically and 2 transversely, apparently the result of a grasp, and contusion of the right shin bone—the body was well nourished, but very dirty—a little above the left breast there were two punctures, not of recent date; they might have been inflicted by a fork; they were very superficial; possibly they may have been inflicted within a week or so—the little boy was lying at right angles with the woman, on the right side, his head resting on her shoulder—on the right side of his head there were two scalp wounds, with fracture of the skull; on the left side were two wounds over the occipital bone, and two wounds over the parietal bone, and con<lb/>fusion of the left thumb—the boy was suffering from concussion of the brain as well as fracture—he was unconscious for three or four days—the wounds, both on the woman and the boy, might have been inflicted by this iron bolt—the woman and the girl died of the injuries that I have described—I saw the prisoner in the room, standing in the corner at the feet of the woman, in a very excited state, very restless, endeavoring to talk in<lb/>constantly, but, in consequence of the wound in his throat, he could not articulate—I could not understand what he said—the windpipe was severed, the throat was bleeding—it was a very severe wound—I did not then notice the wound on his head; I did at the hospital—it was on the right side, at the upper edge of the right parietal bone, and about 4 inches long—it was a severe wound—there was fracture of the skull—I formed an opinion, such as it is, as to how that wound had been caused—I went back to the house to ascertain by marks of blood how such a wound could have been inflicted, and I found the box of the lock of the door was covered with blood, especially the edge, and I concluded it was that—it cur<lb/>responded with the length of the wound, and possibly in struggling with the woman he might have fallen or been pushed back against it—that is mere conjecture—the blow must have been very severe—I did not examine the head myself, but I understood from the house-surgeon that there was fracture of the skull—the room was exceedingly dirty, these was very little furniture in it—it was a dirty mattrass across which the woman lay—the wall near the child's bed was bespattered with brains and blood—there was blood on the floor, and on this bolt, and on this knife which was handed to me by the last witness—the bolt I found myself concealed under the mattrass; it was covered with blood and some hairs—the injuries on the throat could have been inflicted with the knife—I also found a Bible on which there was blood—the boy has recovered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the surgeons at Guy's Hospital—in June last Mr. Southey was house-surgeon there, and attended to this case; he has left, and I believe has gone to Peru—I saw the prisoner thirty-six hours after his admission; he was suffering then from the effects of a wound on the right aide of his head, also from a severe wound in the throat; he was in a semi-conscious condition, able to answer questions; he spoke with difficulty, on account of the wound in his throat—I could just understand what he said, but owing to the windpipe being divided it was with difficulty we could make out what he uttered—there was a compound comminuted fracture of the skull; that is, the bone was broken up in several pieces—that injury could not have been caused without great violence—I should think it impossible to have been caused by falling against the lock of the door—it would be accounted for by a blow on the head—I doubt very much whether it could have been self-inflicted—somebody must have hurled him with tremendous force against a projecting body to have done it, and I doubt even that being possible—the wound in the throat was not dangerous, it was very long and severed the windpipe—he remained in the hospital, I believe, up to 30th September—I went away about the 8th—up to that time I saw him every other day, on every third day—I did not notice any appearance of <hi rend="italic">delirium firemens</hi> about him from the time I first saw him up to 8th September—he was as conscious as you or I, of sound mind I should think—from the time I removed the pieces of broken bone he became perfectly conscious, and was in a sound state of mind from that time—he was admitted on the Sunday morning at 2.30—severe symptoms of com<lb/>pression came on, and on the Tuesday after, at 3 o'clock, I removed the pieces—he had a slight attack of erysepilas in August; and, as many patients are with erysipelas, he was a little delirious at night; that was simply from the erysepilas—remembering his antecedents we thought it advisable to strap him down—the deceased woman had been brought to the hospital on the previous Wednesday, and was under my care—she was suffering then from two slight punctures, such as may have been made by a fork—she was there two days—I saw her on the Thursday and Friday—I told her there was nothing very serious—she discharged herself, I think.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). On Saturday night, 4th August, or Sunday morning, I was on duty in White Street, Borough—there is a court called Collier's Rents there, and through that a court called St. George's Square, which consists of six houses, three on each side—it is occupied mostly by the lower class of Irish—in consequence of what I heard I went to a court which was at the back of this court, and heard voices as if persons were quarrelling and fighting—I was in uniform—I went down the place, and found a number of the inhabitants fighting and making a great disturbance, both in Collier's Rents and St. George's Square—it is a place where there is always a special man on duty, and constables do not go down there singly—Martin was the special constable on duty there that night, and Dale was on the beat—I found them there—the people seemed to be fighting in different lots; it was a kind of free fight; we term them faction fights—Mrs. Regan, the prisoner's mother, came up to me, and said "For God's sake, sergeant, put a stop to this disturbance, or there will be murder done;" at the same time I heard Timothy Regan, the prisoner's brother, call out from a first-floor window "Stand on one side, old woman, while I knock the b—'s brains out"—I saw him throw from the window a stone ginger-beer bottle, with very great force—it struck my left shoulder—it bounced up about 2 feet or 3 feet into the air, and then dropped on the pavement—it entirely disabled my left arm, I could not use it—the woman stepped on one side when he called out—she said "Oh, he has broken the sergeant's arm; he does not live in that house, he has only run in there to avoid the police"—I called <hi rend="italic">M</hi> 232, and we went into the house, he first, I following—the stairs were very steep and narrow—there are three floors, but only three rooms; I believe there are no back ones—when I was half way up the stairs, Timothy Regan rushed out of the front room, passed 232, and seemed to jump right down to avoid his catching hold of him—as he came past me I seized him with my right hand, but he was going with such force down the stairs that he dragged me headlong down, and him too—we both fell at the foot of the stairs; I fell on my left side—Regan jumped up much quicker than I could, and got away—Martin followed him—Dale was in the court close by the door—I heard a man's voice call out "Look out, policeman!"—I turned my eye round, and saw the prisoner—I had known her for very nearly two years by sight—she was close behind ma, and had an instrument in her hand, which looked like a lathrender's hammer, raised above my head—before I could get away from her she struck me a</p>

               <p>blow right on my shoulder, a dull heavy blow—she aimed at my head, but I ducked my head, and the blow came on my shoulder—it seemed to send a pain up into my head—my eyes flashed, and it seemed to knock me almost insensible for a moment—she struck me again twice after that very quickly on the back, one blow just at the back of my shoulder, and the other close by the corner of the bladebone—the third blow appeared to stick in my clothes—she could not get it out—she had to jerk it twice to get it out—I attempted to seize her, but she ran into the passage and up the stairs of the same house from which the ginger-beer bottle was thrown—I followed her into the passage, and about halfway up the stairs, but I became so faint from loss of blood that I went down again—she ran up stairs straight into the same room that she came out of—I went out into Collier's Bents, and met Dale—I made a complaint to him, and described the woman who had assaulted me—the blood was pouring down me between my shirt and skin and down the legs of my trousers, and you could track the blood right up into the Borough—I was cut right through two coats, my great uniform coat and another coat under that, and my shirt—I became nearly insensible, and was taken to the hospital—I remained there until the following Wednesday—I was then taken to my own house, and put under the care of the divisional surgeon—erysipelas came on, and I was confined to my bed for nine weeks—I have not recovered yet—the prisoner was brought to the hospital about half an hour after I was there, and I recognised her directly—I had a good look at her face, and I knew her so well previously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in Collier's Rents before to the prisoner's brother, when he has been making a disturbance there several times—I can't say the number of the house, but I think it is No. 1—it was out of that window the bottle was thrown at me; from the first-floor window—I was suffering a great deal of pain when I went into the house from the injury to my shoulder—the fall did not hurt me much more—I felt numbed—I should say not more than one or two minutes elapsed from the time Martin passed me to go after Regan and my getting outside the door—there was no one near the door when I went out but the prisoner—she was about a yard from the door—I was standing still looking round the court when I heard the exclamation, "Look out, policeman!"—there is a lamp at the end of the court; it may be 12 yards from the door, possibly, at the entrance of the court—that was about 12.30, as near as possible—when I first went up the court, I dare say there were fifty people altogether in the square and the rents together—I should say about thirty in the square—they seemed to be all in a heap, fighting and striking anyhow—I have seen that sort of thing there before—there were very few in the square when I was struck by the prisoner—they were retreating towards Collier's Rents<lb/>men and women were fighting, and children amongst them—I believe the prisoner had been employed at Mr. Leving's, the furriers, for a long time—I told Martin that I had been stabbed with a chopper—it was like a little hatchet on one side and a hammer on the other—I believe the prisoner lives at No. 1 with her husband, and the Regans also live in that house—I don't know in what rooms.</p>

I was on special duty on this occasion—Dale called me, and I proceeded with him up Collier's Rents to St. George's Square—I saw several of the Irish inhabitants quarrelling and fighting—Regan was there, and seemed to be the ringleader—I was in uniform—I went to lay hold of him, and he escaped into his mother's house, and almost immediately afterwards appeared at the first-floor window—he commenced using very bad language, and threw a piece of crockery-ware at me; I think it was a jug—it struck me on the breast, but did not hurt me—it fell on the pavement and broke—while I was endeavouring to quell the disturbance, Sergeant Woods came up; I saw a woman speaking to him—Regan at the window got a ginger-beer bottle, and exclaimed "Stand on one side, old woman; let me knock the b—brains out," and he threw the bottle and struck the sergeant—I saw him stagger against the wall—he called to me, and we went into the house—I went up stairs first on to the landing of the first floor, and saw Regan at the entrance of the room door; he had a poker or a piece of iron in his hand—he lifted it up as if to strike me, and I struck him with my staff—he then rushed past me, and jumped down the stairs—the sergeant was half-way up, and laid hold of him, and they both went to the bottom together—I saw the prisoner and a man I supposed to be her husband up stairs in the room that Regan came from—I Knew him by sight for some time—I ran down stairs, and pursued Regan; he was up on his feet in an instant and off—I pursued him through Collier's Rents, but lost sight of him—I then returned, and, at the entrance of Angel Place, I met the sergeant bleeding from two wounds in the back—he made a statement to me—t toot him to the hospital, and Dale returned to the court—I have never seen Regan since that night.</p>

Leving and Co, skin merchants and furriers, at this time, and has been for three years—she is a peaceable orderly woman—she lives with her husband on the first floor at No. 1—on this Sunday morning about 12 o'clock there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the court by the women—Downs came in and smoked a pipe with me, and after it was striking 12 we heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> was outside on some business, so I did not like to shut the door—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> came up the court, and <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan ran up stairs, and clapped the door too—the sergeant and four men came and broke the door open, and ran upstairs into Johanna's room—the court was full of people—she jumped up in her nightgown and petticoat, and came down into my room, and sang out "They will break all my things," and went out into the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, St. George's Square—about 11 o'clock on this Saturday night I was sitting smoking my pipe with Mr. Regan in the ground-floor room, and he was mending a pair of drawers at the same time—about 12.30, or from that to 1 o'clock, Timothy Regan rushed in, and three or four others with him, and went up stairs where the prisoner and her husband were—he shut the door when he came in, and bolted it—I can't say that I had heard any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on in the court before that—then the police came, and broke the door open, and rushed up stairs after <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan—the police were there about ten minutes, or it might be a little less, and <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan ran down, and the police after him—I was in the parlour all this time—when the police came in the prisoner came down in her nightgown and petticoat, and she says to me "<hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Downs, "she says, "they will break all my little bits of things;" "Hold your tongue," says I, "they will break nothing "—she stayed in there till the police ran out after <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan, and then she said "They will kill my poor brother," and out she ran with nothing on her feet, and her father followed her, and came back with her in about ten minutes—she had not a thing in her hand; no weapon of any kind—she came back into the parlour, and stayed there about half-an-hour with her husband, till the police came back and kicked the door in, relation of the Regans—he was not one of the men that ran up stairs with <hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Regan—I don't know how he came there—I believe he is the husband of the prisoner's sister, by what I hear; I don't know his name—the front door had been broken before; it was the front room door that they kicked in the second time; the other door was out in the yard, broken all to pieces—when the police came back, they said "Open the door"—they had their staves up, and came in and said to the prisoner "You are the woman we want," and took her away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was sent for to the Vauxhall Tavern the same afternoon—I went into a room there where there were three or four men, one of whom was the prisoner—he was not pointed out to me—I did not express a doubt about his being the man; I said I was certain it was him, but he had a different necktie on—the prisoner did not ask me whether he was wearing the same necktie—he asked me whether it was the same watch-chain, but he had none at all then—he had one when he came to me—Reynolds did not ask me anything about the chain, it was the sergeant—nothing was said about it at the Vauxhall Tavern, but there was a discussion at the station about his indentity—I said at the tavern that the prisoner had a coloured tie on when he came to me, and he had a black one afterwards—I am sure it was at quarter to 4, and I was at the Vauxhall Tavern near upon 5.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Somebody fetched me to the Vauxhall Tavern—it is about ten minutes' walk, or hardly that if you walk quickly—notwithstanding the different colour of the necktie, I have not the least doubt about his being the man who gave the half-sovereign.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer P</hi>). I took the prisoner into custody on Tuesday night, 15th October, at 170, High Street, Peckham—I told her I should take her for marrying Edward Pratt, her former husband being alive—she said "Very well, I will go with you"—I took her to the station, and Charged her—the inspector showed her the first certificate with the name of Benjamin Dorling—I received that from Pratt—the inspector said "This is the certificate of your farmer husband, Benjamin Dorling"—she said" That is right"—I afterwards showed her the second certificate of her marriage with Edward Pratt—she said that was also right—I have com<lb/>pared them with the register, and they are correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella-maker, at Railway Approach, in the Borough—I was present at St. John's Church, in the Waterloo Road, on 10th September, 1650, when the prisoner was married to Benjamin Dorling—they lived together, I think, for about fifteen years; I should think up to 1866, as near as I can guess—the prisoner worked for me as shopwoman from 1860 up to about April 1868—I received two letters directed to Mrs. Ashley at my place—I read those letters, and then I spoke to the prisoner—I asked her if she was married again to another person, I think I did name the name—she swore that she was not; she took an oath that she was not—she said "I am not; so help me God, I am not," and I showed her the letters and said "What do you mean by that?" and then she said she was married the second time to Mr. Pratt—I have seen Dorling nearly every day since that—he was at the Lambeth Police Court—he has been into me for money once or twice since the prisoner left my employment—he came to my place at the time she was working for me, and she saw him as late as three or four years ago—it was very shortly before she confessed she was married again—I should think it was about six years ago that she and Dorling separated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in business as an umbrella-maker, at 130, High Street, Peckham—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1867—I knew her as Ann Ashley, and ultimately married her—we were married by license at her wish—she did not tell me previous to the marriage that she was a married woman—I did not know till about twelve months after, when her brother came and told me—I was in the army at the time I married her—I was invalided afterwards, and retired on a pension of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left—I subsequently established myself in business with the prisoner in High Street, Peckham—after her brother came to me I spoke to her about her previous marriage, and she told me she was married—she did not give me the date or any particulars of her marriage—a sum<lb/>mons</p>
