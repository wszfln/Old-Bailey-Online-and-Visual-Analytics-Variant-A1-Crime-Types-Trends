I was alarmed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090004"/>by the watchman about twenty minutes after three o'clock, and got up; I found the kitchen window cut it was not light the window and shutters were shut, and a tablecloth put in the hole which was cut it was not cut overnight; so that if a person had a candle in the house, it could not be seen outside. The hole was large enough for a person's hand to get through, and they could reach to unfasten the window. I searched about the house, and found every place open, and a great many things taken. About half-past four o'clock we made another search.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was not light when I was alarmed. I had a candle to search the house. The watchman was in the house his lanthorn had a light in it.</p>

            . About twenty minutes before three o'clock in the morning, I found a liquor bottle stand, and a pair of trowsers, in which was a note directed to Mr. Dawson's house-it was not light. I immediately went there it had struck three o'clock when I got to the house it was then getting light. I went into the kitchen, and found a hole cut in the shutter, and the table-cloth put into it, which was large enough for an arm to get through. I suppose it had been cut with a chisel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If you had met an acquaintance in the street at the time, should you have known him A. The light would not have enabled me to have known his face. I found the things about twelve yards from Mr. Dawson's house.</p>
               <p>JAMES SMITH. I am patrol of the Skinners' Estate at St. Pancras. On the 22d of July, about half-past five o'clock in the morning, I took the prisoners,

             and James Mitchell, into custody, in Skinner-street, Somers-town. They each had a bundle under their arms. I found a skeleton key on one of them, and on the other I found some skeleton keys and a chisel there was a key in Higgins's bundle. The prisoners were coming, apparently, from their own house in North-terrace, near Cromer-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were they from the prosecutor's A. About a quarter of a mile; it was past five o'clock when I met them. I was told there had been a robbery, and was looking out. They were not walking in a direction from Mr. Dawson's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LACK. I am a pawnbroker. On the 22d of July, the prisoner, Edward Mitchell, pledged a coat and shirt with me, in the afternoon; he gave his own name, and said he pledged them for Mr. Smith, Kenton-street.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. When we came home we found every thing in confusion; I went into the shop with a rushlight, and there I saw a man. I immediately went into the parlour, and fastened myself in, and got out of the back window I gave the alarm. I came in again when I heard the watchman knock, and went into the parlour with them and Mr. Slack; the prisoner entered with us and sat down; I said he very much resembled the man I saw in the shop, but appeared rather taller; he said he heard the cry and entered with the gentleman, but he could not point the gentleman out; from the conversation he learnt that Mr. Slack had knocked at the door, he then said he came in with him. I had given the alarm in the yard, and desired the people to come round.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Bourchier. On the 3d of August, I was going to prepare the tray for supper. I was going into the parlour for some glasses, as soon as I got to the top of the kitchen stairs, opposite the street door, I saw the prisoner in the passage, as if coming out of the parlour, and going out at the street door. The street door was bolted inside at the time. He could not have got in at the door. He had some silver spoons and forks, in one hand, and the cruet stand and cruets in the other. I went quietly up to him, and asked what he was going to do with those things. He told me the house was being robbed, for he saw a man and a boy, get out of the parlour window. I wished him to return to the parlour, until I called the gentleman who was going to sup with my mistress, down. The parlour window was open, it being very hot weather. He gave the things to me, and went into the parlour. I went in with him, and gave the the alarm. The plate was kept in the parlour cupboard. I had not taken it out. A gentleman came down with my mistress immediately that I called out. The gentleman got a watchman, who took the prisoner and property.</p>

On the 24th of July, I lost 70l., out of a little box, which was in the drawer. I had seen it all safe, about half an hour before. I saw the officer find two 20l. bank notes, one 10l. Stroud bank note, one 5l., one 2l. and one 1l. bank notes, upon him - I lost more. I know the Stroud note by the number, which I took particular notice of when I received it.</p>

I sent them about eleven o'clock next morning with a permit in the name of Thompson, by her desire, as it was too late to obtain a permit that night; I agreed to send them at ten o'clock. About half-past ten o'clock Spain called to know why they were not sent; we told him we were too busy, and that they should be sent in half an hour, which was done; Jenkins, our porter, took them, with a strict charge not to leave them without the money, as they were strangers to us.

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. I took the articles stated in the indictment about eleven o'clock, to deliver to Mr. Thompson, No. 10, Grub-street. When I got into Grub-street the prisoner, Spain, overtook me, and asked me if I was come from Messrs. Simpkins' with some goods for Mr. Thompson? he said he was coming after me about them, and that he had been there half an hour before. I asked him if he lived with Thompson, he said he lived in the street, and knew him. We went on together untill we got to Chapel-street, Grub-street, he then said, "Thompson lives up here." I went up with him to a door in Chapel-street, he said Thompson was going to open a shop there; I went in and saw a woman, whom I believe to be Meredith; she said, "here is the grocery come, I am very glad of it, as I, or we, very much wanted it." Spain and she helped me down with the goods. Meredith asked me if I had got the permit, bill, and receipt; I gave her the permit and bill, but kept the receipt, and asked her for the money, having been ordered not to leave them without the money. She said,"my husband is not within, he is at a public-house in Fore-street;" and told Splain to take me to him, that he might pay me. I should not have left the goods in the house unless I had been told that I was to receive the money of her husband; I meant to fetch them back if it was not paid. Spain took me to a public-house in Fore-street, kept by Edwards; I asked the landlord if a Mr. Thompson was there, or had been there - He said he knew uo such person. I took the bill out of Splain's hand, as I began to suspect, left him there, and ran back to secure the goods, but found the woman and goods gone - I ran all over the house, but could not find the goods. I returned and told my masters.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see either of the prisoners - A.About two months after, on a Saturday, I saw the woman, running backward and forward in Wood-street, I thought I knew her, stoppsd her, and asked her if she had not lived in Grub-street; she said she never had, and asked where it was. I let her go, thinking she was not the person; two or three days after I saw her and Spain in custody at the Mansion-house, and knew Spain again very well. The goods have not been found.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WALKER. I am a Thames police-officer. On the 25th of August, about two o'clock in the morning, I was in the police-boat, near Rotherhithe church, and heard a man, between the tiers, who was on a float of timber, call sculler. We pulled towards the boat, and found the prisoner in a boat at the Middlesex side of the river, near Wapping-he was brought into my boat; I found a white shirt in his bosom, between his own shirt and waistcoat. I hand cuffed him. He was feeling about his pocket, and made resistance; I heard something drop from him in the boat, I found it was a comb. I took him to the office, when I found he had three coats, two waistcoats, and two pair of pantaloons on; he had a watch in his left-hand fob, and another down his thigh. I found a purse in his waistcoat-pocket, with six shillings, two sixpences, three pieces of foreign silver coin, a took pick, and a purse, in it; in his coat-pocket I found a pair of spectacles and case-the prosecutors claimed them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Edwards, who keeps the Basing House, in Kingsland-road. On Friday the 7th of August, the prisoner came into the stable with a bay mare; he said he had come up with some cows and calves, for Mr. Laycock, of Islington. He said he came to put the horse up there. After he had been there a little time, he said he wanted to part with her, and authorized me to take her to Dixon's Repository, in Barbican, to be sold by auction. I took her there, but could not sell her; I brought her away, and took her to Smithfield the same day; I could not sell her there, and took her back to the stables. The prisoner came next morning, and asked me if I had sold her? I told him I had not. He told me to take something less, and make the best I could of her. He did not come again until the Wednesday following. I bought the mare of him myself for six guineas, I paid him the money, and my master wrote his name and address down for me. He said he came from Deaton Hall, near York, from his brother's - He went away. I sold her the next morning to

I took him in York-street, Pentonville; I told him I took him for stealing Mr. Wilson's mare, of Deaton Hall - He denied it. I told him he must go to the office with me; he then said he would show me where the mare was; he said he had sold her to the hostler at the Basing House, Kingsland-road - I went there, leaving him in custody. I found she was sold to Walker, Baker's-row, Clerkenwell. I went there, the mare was out, it was afterwards brought to the office; I put it up at Dean's livery stables-the prosecutor claimed it, and took it back. The hostler gave me the bridle, which, he said, the prisoner delivered to him with the horse.</p>

            . I deal in harness, and live in Charles-street, Manchester-square. On the 9th of June, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going along Castle-street, Oxford-street, the prisoner, Bays, was trimming lamps, he asked me if I bought harness and hammer-cloths.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing particular to induce him to speak to you - A. I had a harness in my hand. I told him I did. He said he had seen me about several times, but was afraid to speak to me; I said he need not be afraid of me, I bought any thing; he then said he had a hammer-cloth and harness to sell, but they were on the cross, which means stolen - I said I would buy them. He put his ladder down, took me over to 14, Adam and Eve-court, which was opposite, he knocked at the door. the prisoner Stokes asked who was there? he said, "it is me," and went into the room, Stokes was there lying on the bed, he pulled the hammer-cloth cut from between the bed and the sacking; he was going to pull the bag which contained the harness, from under the bed, when Stokes said, "don't you touch it, your hands are oily." She pulled two cushions out; I asked for the harness, she said it was in the next room. I said let me see it, if you have got 20l. worth, I will buy them. She unlocked the next room, and Bays pulled out a sack from under a halfteaster bed, which was turned up, in which was the gigharness. I asked him if he had any thing else; he asked me if I bought shiners - I asked what he meant? he said glasses. I said I had a better sale for them than any thing else; he said he wished he had spoken to me before, as he had sold the glasses belonging to the hammer-cloth and cushions, for 16s., and that he had sold between forty and fifty pair within six months. He said the hammer-cloth and cushions belonged to him, but the harness was another man's, but he would sell them both - He asked 5l. for them. We went to where his ladder was, in Castle-street, and agreed that I should have them for 4l. 15s.; he asked me when I would fetch them away, and said that he should be at home to tea in an hour and a half. I said I would call for them then. He said he did not live there, but in Rebecca-court, Well-street. I went to Lord Denbigh's, gave information, and then went to Rebeccacourt, where I found him at tea in the parlour, with a woman; we then went together to Adam and Eve-court for the things, I found them put together in the same room-Stokes was there. While I was putting them into my bag Foy came and took them. The harness was there under the bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. You said you would buy it of them - A. Yes; I had heard Lord Denhigh's coachman had lost a hammer-cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You seem well acquainted with technical phrases, how came you to know cross meant stolen - A. I had heard so.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN WYATT. I am a constable. I went with Foy, having received information from Spendlove, and confirm his testimony.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am the landlord of No. 14, Adam and Eve-court; I let the apartments to Stewart's wife; Stokes rented the back room of them.</p>
               <p>BAYS'S Defence. I found the sack and harness in the road.</p>
               <p>STOKES'S Defence. I went out and gave Stewart's wife my key to feed my birds; I returned at one o'clock, went to bed, and found the cushions under the bed; Bays afterwards came into my room with Spendlove; he said he should come up again and remove the things.</p>

I was to let him know in an hour. I said, if he would give me a proper reference, I would let him know; he referred me to Mr. Nevin, No. 27, Bishopsgate-street. I went there, but could find no such person. I found my house had been robbed. On the 31st I was near Worship-street Office, and saw the prisoner coming with a bundle under his arm. I was going towards him, when he ran away. I think he saw me. I called out Stop thief! and he was taken immediately,</p>
               <p>JANE BURLING. I am the wife of the last witness. On the 28th of July, the prisoner came to see about the apartments. I saw him through the door, while my husband was agreeing with him; he called for a pen and ink, to write a reference. He came again in about a quarter of an hour-my husband was not at home at the time - I did not see him, but heard him in conversation with the servant in the passage. I saw him go out of the door, went to look after him, and saw him running very fast. I went up to the room, and missed some plate off the sideboard - I was in the room a few minutes before the prisoner came the first time-it was then safe. I missed the articles stated in the indictment. The silk scarfs, dress, and shawl, were taken from the bookcase drawer.</p>
               <p>HANNAH KING. I am servant to Mr. Burling. On the 28th of July, the prisoner came; I shewed him up to the apartments-my master went to him; in about five minutes he went away-my master went to him; in about five minutes he went away-my master went out. The prisoner returned in about a quarter of an hour after, said he had met my master in Finsbury-square, and that he desired him to wait till he returned. I shewed him up into the same room; he asked if I was the mistress of the house. I told him I was the servant-my mistress was engaged. He said when he came to live with us, if I was attentive he would reward me. I thanked him, and went down stairs; I did not quite shut the door; he remained in the room about five minutes. I then heard him coming down stairs, I went and asked him what he wanted; he said he wanted some snuff - I asked him to allow me to get it for him - He said he would go himself. He went out - I held the door in my hand - I saw him run the moment he got out. He ran very fast towards Chiswell-street. I went up stairs, and missed the plate off the sideboard - I saw it there when I shewed him into the room the second time-nobody else had been there. He spoke to me in English - I understood him, and he understood me.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. On the 31st of July, I apprehended the prisoner in the Curtain-road, and found several duplicates on him. I asked him to whom the property belonged, that they referred to; he said it was all his own; one was for the wine-strainer, and the other for the sugar-tongs, pledged at Peart's.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARK. I am servant to Mr. Peart, pawnbroker, who lives in Whitechapel. On the 28th of July, a woman pledged the wine-strainer, milk-pot, sugar-tongs and table-spoon, in the name of Franks,</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HURRY. Lewin informed me of the robbery; I took my horse and overtook the prisoner and another about four miles from Kingsland-the prisoner had a basket, the other man had a bundle; they turned back and went into a public-house, I called out Stop thief! they ran out, I pursued them across the fields towards Wilsden. I did not see them taken. I found the basket and bundle next day, in the way they ran. I am certain the prisoner is the man who had the basket.</p>

Mr. Williams claimed it; the tall man was stopped, but got away. We took the prisoner to my house - He asked me to intercede with Mr. Williams, saying, he had a wife and two children.

               <p>ROBERT SMITH. I am errand-boy to Messrs. Thomas and Co. On the 9th of July, Mr. Robert Birchall, who lived there, sent me to Mr. Potter's, flute-maker, Johnson's-court, Fleet-street, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, for a flute; as I returned with it, I met the prisoner in New-street; he staggered about like a drunken man, he was rubbing lemon over his cheeks, and said "my man you see I have had a drop too much, if you will carry a letter for me, I should not mind giving you two or three shillings." I said if I could do him any service, sooner than he should lose his place, I would, and asked him where it was that I was to go to; he said come to the public-house, while I write it. I said my master would be angry with me, if I waited long; he said he would not be two minutes. He called for a pint of porter, and a pen and ink. I drank some of the porter - He wrote in the paper, and called for a wafer, then asked for a quartern of gin; I told the kind-lady not to bring it. He took the letter to another public-house, and called for a pint of beer. He wrote Harris, on the letter, and would insist on my drinking some gin. He then went to shew me where I was to take the letter; when he was at the top of the court, he said "don't you see that house," and immediately snatched the flute, and ran down another court - I lost my place through it. In about five days after, I saw him in Leadenhall-market. I collared him, and told him he was the man who stole my flute, he said if I did not let him go, he would knock me down - He was secured.</p>

She said she had a beautiful doll for me at home, and she must have the handkerchief off my neck to put it in. She took me up some courts into a dark passage, then took the handkerchief off my neck, and ran away; I pursued, but lost sight of her. I had been walking with her nearly half an hour. Next night I saw her at the corner of Chapel-street, Grubb-street. I pointed her out to my father and mother, who were with me. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

On the 18th of July, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the road, coming in a direct line from Sir Francis Desanges's premises with a bag on his back, about a mile and quarter from the house; I went to him and asked what he had in the bag - He said clothes; I insisted on seeing it, I found seven dead ducks quite warm; he said a farmer at Enfield gave them to him. He could not tell me who it was, though he said he worked for him. He had a reaping-book in his hand. Harris described the ducks before he saw them, the prisoner afterwards said he found them.</p>

               <p>Q. Relate what occured towards the latter end of August - A. I asked her if she was not in the family way; she said she did not know that she was, nor did she know that she was not. I said, I thought her forward. On the 20th of August, she went to Camberwell fair. On the 21st her husband said she was poorly. I saw her in the afternoon - She said she had caught cold; she then appeared very big. Next night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I saw her go into the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a light with her - A. To the best of my knowledge she had not; she staid there about ten minutes. On her return she stopped at the butt drawing water in a saucepan - I desired her to come off the cold stones as she did not know what injury it might do her. I finished drawing the water, and I carried it up stairs for her; I noticed she was very thin and poorly - I did not go into her room. Next morning, the 23d, her mother told me she thought her daughter had miscarried. A day or two after she came down and asked me to send my boy to the mangler's. I then thought she looked very ill, and told her husband she was lost for want of proper nourishment; he went for some beer. While he was gone, I asked her how far she thought herself advanced in her pregnancy before she miscarried - She said about five months. I advised her to keep her bed; on the Monday following she went out with her mother. On the 1st of September my little boy gave me information - I went to the privy and saw something lying on its right side. Mr. Wyatt afterwards moved it-it was a child; the beadle was fetched. We sent for her husband - He declared he knew nothing of it. The prisoner was then in bed in her clothes; we asked if she knew anything of it - She said no, it was nothing of her's; I said I would get medical assistance to see her whether it was her's or not. She then said it was her's, and that she put it down the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say whether it was alive - A. I asked if it cried - She said no.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not fall down stairs about a week before - A. Yes, she said she had hurt her head, but did not complain of any thing else. She said she felt a beating at her heart in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS HALE. I was called in to see the child at St. Luke's workhouse, it was in a high state of putrifaction and swelled so that I did not open it, as it would have been be useless. I examined the external parts and could find no marks of violence; it appeared to have arrived at its full period. I cannot take upon myself to say whether it was born alive or not-the mother falling down stairs might probaby have killed it. It would in that case produce premature labour.</p>

They had words and quarrelled-the prisoner wanted to get away, she would not let him, she collared him and threw him down, tore his shirt and waistcoat. He then struck her somewhere about the belly, she fell down-how she got down I cannot say. I saw him strike her once after she was down; there was a heap of bricks where she fell, she might have fallen on them and hurt herself. She was lifted up, she was in liquor, and carried to the sand-house and put to bed. Next morning we sent for the doctor, he bled her.</p>
               <p>ANNE FISHER. I am the deceased's mother - She went into the field and told the prisoner to bring some money, at half-past twelve o'clock he brought her 1s.; about four o'clock they left off work, he had a can of beer - She asked him for half a pint about seven o'clock, he said she should have no more; they had drank a great deal before and were both drunk, but she was not so far gone as he - He said if she drank any more he would knock her down; they got quarreling, she told him to be off with his barrow - He was going away, and said he would give her a good hiding as soon as he got hold of her; she then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090015"/>got hold of him by the jacket and shirt - I told her to let go, which she did, he took his barrow. I got between them - I went away, returned in five minutes, and found her on the ground, just by the bricks; he was by her, and striking as hard as he could - I saw him strike her four or five very violent blows about her body. I told him to leave off - He said he would not; we parted them, he left. I took her to the sand-house - She died on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not she strike him first - A. I told her to get out of his way, she would not.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you if she did not strike him before he struck her - A. I never saw it before she was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Coroner you was quite sure before he struck her she struck him, and tore his waistcoat and shirt - A. I said she got hold of him and tore his waistcoat and shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. See that you do not make any mistake - You say that you did not say before the Coroner that before he struck her she struck him - A. Yes, I did not see her strike him.</p>
               <p>Mr. JAMES PARKINSON. I am a surgeon. On the 2d of July, I examined the body of the deceased, and could observe no external mark of violence; but on opening the body, I discovered that the bladder had been ruptured and the urine effused through the bowels, which were in a high degree of inflammation, in consequence of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say what caused the rupture - A. I am not. I believe it was from external violence, either a blow or fall might have produced it. I think it right to say, that when the bladder is so highly extended a much less degree of violence might have occasioned the injury than could be supposed. Her death was in consequence of the rupture of the bladder; her falling on an unequal surface, with her bladder in that state, is very likely of itself to have occasioned the mischief. She was in an unhealthy state at the time. She had applied to me the morning before the injury was received for a complaint in her bowels, which would make the rupture more probable.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FISHER. I was there all the while. I did not see him strike her more than once.</p>
               <p>JAMES CROCKWELL. I was before the Magistrate when

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on Monday morning, about ten o'clock. She only complained of her head. I examined, and found a slight mark over her left temple, which did not appear to me of any importance - She appeared scarcely sensible; I saw her again in the evening, her symptoms were aggravated, and continued to increase. On Tuesday morning, about five o'clock, I was called to her, and found her labouring under apoplectic symptoms, which increased until she died that evening at eight o'clock. She died labouring under apoplectic symptoms. I opened the body, and found the right hemisphere of the brain completely covered with coagulated blood; the heart was large and fat, and the liver appeared as if she was addicted to drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. From these appearances, of what do you say she died - A. From the bursting of a blood vessel in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you any reason to think she died from any external violence - A. Certainly not; there was no external mark on the side where the vessel was ruptured.</p>

            . I am clerk at the post-office, Bristol. I was on duty on the 10th of April, and made up the Wor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090016"/>cester bag; a letter for Erdsland would be put into that bag. I sealed the bag, and forwarded it by the mail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. There are two persons besides me who take letters in. The mail leaves at seven o'clock - I remain there until then. I might have been out at the door about four o'clock. Worcester is sixty miles from Bristol.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARRY. I was assistant to the post-master at Worcester. The Bristol mail arrives about four o'clock in the morning, it arrived on the 11th of April as usual; the bag was regularly delivered. This letter would have been put into the Leominster bag, which was forwarded there by a man on horseback, who leaves the bag-the distance is twenty-six miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person employed to carry the bag on that day from Worcester to Leominster - A. The prisoner's father is the contractor for carrying the mail; in the early part of April the prisoner himself frequently carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember whether he did or did not carry it on that day - A. I cannot be certain. I made a memorandum of some money that he owed me, and to the best of my belief, he paid it on that day, which was Saturday. He said his father lived at Leominster.</p>
               <p>SARAH NICHOLLS. I am the wife of the Post-master at Leominster. I and my daughter always do the business of the office in the evening. On the 11th of April the Worcester bag arrived about eight o'clock - I cannot say who brought it. Mr. Coates frequently brings it himself, though he did not ride that day. The post-rider takes the bag to Coates, he then either brings or sends it to my office. We generally send Mr. Whitby's letters to an inn where he puts up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether any arrived on that day-A. No; We cannot trace any as having arrived. Coates lives about a hundred yards from the office, and keeps a public-house. The prisoner assisted him at that time instead of a hostler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When the mail arrived did any thing appear unusual - A. The bag was sealed, and the word "Worcester" on the seal.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is that always the case - A.In the hurry of business the impression is not always perfect. I will not swear that there was an impression on the seal that day, as I did not particularly notice it.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Worcester heavy coach office. On the 16th of April the prisoner took a place for London, between eleven and twelve o'clock - He paid me a 1l. Leominster note for the fare. He afterwards came with his father, to the best of my knowledge. I gave him two 1l. bank notes for two local ones, as his father said he was going to London, and they would be of no use there. He started about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COULSON. I live at the King's Head, public-house, in the Commercial-road. The prisoner arrived from Worcester about the middle of April, and lodged with me till he got a situation. Three days after he came to my house, I gave him change for a 10l. bank note (looking at it)-this is it. I wrote "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was introduced to you by Lewis - A. Yes. The note was traced to me about a fortnight afterwards; the prisoner was taken some weeks after that. I am sure he knew that inquiry had been made about it. He remained in his place, which was at Mr. Templeman's, near me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. The mail comes from Worcester to me; it is then carried to the office immediately, without coming into my house-it is always sealed with an impression. My son sometimes carries it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried it on the 11th of April - A. He did not; but I will not swear whether I or my other son did. The prisoner never went out on a Saturday. He left Leominster on the 14th. He had been talking about going to town for three months previous, but I was not able to supply him. His mother gave him 5l., his brother 2l., and he had saved more than 3l. himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you see the money in his possession - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter-is it your son's hand-writing-(handing it to him) - A. I think it is (reads)</p>

               <p>MR. THOMAS HUGHES. I am cashier at the Worcester Old Bank. When persons change notes we always mark them-this note has no mark of its having passed through our hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Sometimes, by accident, a note escapes unendorsed - I have known instances of the kind. It is possible I may have given the prisoner a bank note for the value in local notes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS MONTAGUE. I am an officer.

Part of the property was in a basket which one of them had. I asked them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090017"/>where they got the property from? they both said they bought them the day before for 4s.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUCKLAND. I am a farmer, and live at Langley. I found the prisoners sitting down in a bye-lane, at Ditton-green. Suspecting them, I asked them where they came from? they said they came out of Kent, and were going to Reading. I said that as a robbery had been committed the night before, I should take the liberty of examining their bundles. I got off my horse, and told them I should look into all the bundles, and desired them, if they were going to Reading, to go with me. Nokes made off; while I was securing him Webb ran away, but was stopped about a mile from the place - I sent a boy, who was with me, after him. I am sure he is the man who got away. One of them said they bought the canister at Kingston, the other said they bought it on the road.</p>

            . I am shepherd to Mr. Newman. I saw the sheep all safe on Friday, the 28th of August, at eight o'clock at night; at six o'clock the next morning, I found one of them killed in the fold-it was alive overnight. One of the shoulders, and the hind-quarters were gone-the rest was left in the fold. I afterwards saw a hind-quarter, which appeared to be the same size; I cannot say whether it was part of my sheep or not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BUCKLAND. I was by when the hind-quarters were found in the basket, it was compared in my presence-Haines was there; from circumstances it appeared evident that it was part of the sheep. In taking the skin off the sheep, part of it was left on the leg; the hole in the skin corresponded exactly with that part. The tail was also cut in a very particular manner, which also corresponded. I have no doubt of it being part of the same sheep; these were the two hind-quarters. When I took them, they were eating mutton, which appeared to be a shoulder. In going from Cranford to Ditton-green, Harlington would be very little out of the way.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MONTAGUE. I am a constable. I saw the prisoners eating a shoulder of mutton. I saw the hind-quarters compared with the rest of the sheep, they fitted exactly. The prisoners said they found the mutton.</p>
               <p>JAMES HAINES re-examined. I saw both the hind-quarters compared with the sheep; part of the skin was left on the leg; the same part was missing from the corresponding part, and belonged to the other part.</p>

               <p>GEORGE PARRY. I live in Wood-street, Cheapside, and am a cooper. I know Mr. Piggot very well - He is now in France. On the 22d of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was with him, at Holborn-bridge, going into the City - We were walking arm in arm; Thompson came up, and asked if we had lost any thing? we each felt our pockets, and said we had not. Thompson produced a pocket-book, which I knew to he Mr. Piggots, I had seen him put it into his pocket about an hour before-Mr. Piggot claimed it when he saw it. The prisoner was then in custody. I never saw him before.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre's. On the 22d of August, I was going up Holborn, on the opposite side to the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner, in company with two others, on <placeName id="t18180909-44-crimeloc237">Holborn-hill</placeName>

Mr. Piggot and Mr. Parry passed them arm in arm; they got up immediately. One of them went up, and appeared to be trying their pockets. The prisoner and the other were about two yards behind; the other immediately left and joined them. They whispered together, and went up to the gentlemen again-the prisoner and the other appeared to be covering the first, who put his hand into Mr. Pigot's pocket, took something out, and handed it to the prisoner, who made a motion as if he put it under his waistcoat, and immediately crossed over. I seized him, and said, "You have robbed the gentleman," and asked him what he had got, whether it was a handkerchief, or what? he said he had nothing. I pulled him towards the gentlemen, and asked them if they had lost any thing? They at first said they had not. I requested them to feel again. I found the pocket-book in the prisoner's breeches-it only contained memorandums and a passport.</p>

Borradailes', with a bag. I followed him through a court into Basinghall-street. I stopped him, and asked what he had there? he said some old pieces of rope, which his master had given him. I examined it, and found five or six pounds of old rope, and three or four bundles of new. I asked him if his master gave him that? he said they might have been put in by mistake. I searched further, and found 5lbs. of old, and 60lbs. of new rope. He said he was sorry for what he had done, and hoped I would let him take it back and not go with him, which I refused.</p>

On the 12th of August, between twelve and two o'clock in the day, I was alarmed, went down stairs to the area, and found a quantity of silver plate strewed about the area, and the prisoner at the top of the area-steps in the custody of one of my servants, and another man. I sent for a constable, and gave him in charge; we found the property on him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD VINCENT. On Wednesday, the 12th of August, I was in Dorset-square; as I passed the prosecutor's iron railing, I heard a woman scream out, cry Stop thief! and saw the prisoner run along the area, and dropping the spoons - He let several tea and table-spoons fall in the area, and the sugar-tongs and more spoons on the area-steps. The moment he got to the top of the areasteps I collared him, took him into the kitchen, and locked him up while I fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>ELIZA TITCOMB. I am servant to Mr. Stephens - I was in the kitchen with my fellow female servant, and heard a spoon fall; I ran to the butler's pantry and found the prisoner coming out of the door; I am sure he is the man. I asked him what he wanted? he produced a sugar-sifter and a tea-spoon. I told him he had got more - He said he had not; I said if he had not got more I would not let him go; he immediately attempted to make his escape - I caught hold of him, and held him several minutes; he struck me and got from me, I run after him and caught him-again he ran from me. I gave the alarm, called out Stop thief! and went up the area steps after him, Vincent came up; as the prisoner ran along the area he dropped several things-the other servant ran and picked them up. I saw her pick up the silver cream-jug in the area near the kitchen-door; I saw him drop the six table-spoons, a large gravy-spoon, and some tea-spoons in the area. I afterwards saw the plate in my master's possession; I had seen it safe in the pantry just before.</p>

On the 11th of July, he came to the shop and bought some superfine cloth, some kerseymere, and four yards an half of olive velveteen, which came to 4l. 5s. 11d.; he paid me a 5l. bank note. I asked his name and address - He gave the name of Davis, No. 8, Crown-street Soho, he gave no Christian name. I gave him the change (looking at the note). This is it, I wrote on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write the whole of this, "Davis, 8, Crown-street, Soho, 11-7;" 
               <persName id="t18180909-48-person441">T. S. </persName>
            - A. Yes; T. S. are my initials. I have no doubt of its being the note he gave me. He took the things away with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. He had no acquaintance with him; he came by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no person near him - A. None. I am certain he is the man. I gave him 14s. ld., which was all he had to receive. I wrote on the note while he was in the shop. I had no other 5l. note, except one which I took the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say "my name is Davis, and I am known at No. 8, Crown-street" - A. No; Crown-street is nearer to me than Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any reason to doubt its being the note he gave you - A. No; I paid it away, with another 5l. note, the same day, to a Mr. Thomas, of the Strand-the other 5l. note was taken of a person named Jones, and had Jones's name on it.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD. I am landlord of the house, No. 8,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090020"/>Crown-street; it was empty on the 11th of July, and a long time before, and is so now.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Crown-street was formerly called Hog-lane - A. Yes. It is very irregularly numbered; there are two houses of No. 2.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MILNER. In July last I lived at the other No. 8, Crown-street, I lived there four years and a half. I never had a lodger of the name of Davis; the prisoner never lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not several new houses at the other end of the street - A. Yes. It is irregularly numbered. My house, No. 8, is in St. Ann's parish, and Shepherd's house, No. 8, is in St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CORDELL. I keep a public-house in Fashion-street, Spitalfields. On the 12th of May the prisoner came to my house in company with another man, who I understood to be Lloyd; I do not know that they came in together - They sat together in one box, and had a separate glass of gin and water and a glass of rum and water; they had liquor to the amount of 6s., the other man paid for it all. There was a third person drank with them, he used my house. (Looking at a 5l. note)-this is the note I received; I wrote "

            Clifton's friend" on it(meaning the person who was in company with Clifton) the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the other two come in together - A. I do not know, they might. Clifton paid me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Lloyd came into the bar, and gave you the 5l. note in the absence of the prisoner - A. Yes, the prisoner was in the tap-room at the time - They could not see each other.</p>

I am an officer of Marlborough-street, I received information, and went to the prisoner's lodging, in Lamb's-court, between Bunhill-row and Whitecross-street, with Plank and Mr. Christmas, on the 17th of July, a little before nine o'clock in the morning, and found him and his wife in bed-no stranger was there. I searched, and found some velveteen and cotton there. I found a rolling-pin among some rubbish and shoes, under the table. I asked whose it was? the prisoner made no answer, but his wife said it was her's - He heard it. I laid it down till the prisoner dressed himself. I then found that the top unscrewed, and in the cavity I found five 5l. notes, which I marked and gave to Mr. Christmas(looking at them) these are them; I marked them before I parted with them. I produce the velveteen and cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards hear the prisoner say any thing about the velveteen - A. He said his brother had left it with him about a month before.</p>

I found the velveteen and cotton at the top of the bedstead; the moment I took it off the prisoner said what do you want with that, it is my property. A few minutes before we took him away, he said, it is not mine, it is my brother-in-law's, he left it with me a short time ago to take care of; his wife contradicted him, and said she bought it of a hawker in the street, he made no reply.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe one to be part of the other - A. It may; it is the same colour, with some little variation. I think one is not so stout as the other; it is the same quantity as that I sold him-the cotton is not so long.</p>

               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am inspector of bank notes. I have been so for fourteen years (looks at the notes uttered to the prosecutor), it is forged, the paper is not bank paper, it is not struck from the Bank plate, the signature is not the hand-writing of the signing clerk, but it is his name. That uttered to Coulson is also forged in every respect, the paper, plate and signature are the same; but one is dated the 4th of August, 1817, the other the 5th of June, 1818; the plate has been altered in order to vary the date. The five 5l. notes found in the rolling-pin are also all forged in every respect-two are of different signatures; they are all off the same plate, and dated the 15th of June, 1818; the first note is also dated so; the hand-writing is the same, although the name is different.

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090021"/>asked him if he would let me have two for the watch? he said he would, and told me to sit down, and he would go and fetch them and bring them to me. He went backwards, and was absent nearly half an hour. I sent the boy belonging to the house for him; he came, and I asked him if he had not forgot me? He said No; but the woman was out, and he could not get them directly, but she would not be long. He went away, and I went out to my friend,

            , who was in the street (he married my husband's sister). I found him at the top of Atfield-street, which leads into Goswell-street; he had come as far as that with me, and I had left him waiting there while I went to the Cooper's Arms. I then returned to the Cooper's Arms, leaving Guy at the top of the street. In about five minutes, I saw Weller; he gave me two 1l. notes, and I gave him the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him besides - A. I asked him what was his usual price for the notes? he said 8s. each. I asked him if I could be supplied at any time? he said Yes; I should find him there, and if not, the landlord would send for him. We parted, and I found Guy where I had left him. We went to the Bank together, and gave Mr. Christmas the two notes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Weller - A. On the 14th of July; Guy went with me. I left him at the top of the street - we could see each other from the door of the house. I went to the Cooper's Arms, saw Weller, and asked him if he would let me have two more? he said he would in about half an hour, and asked me if I would wait? I said I had further to go, and would call again. I left him, found Guy where I had left him, and returned in about half an hour, leaving Guy as before. I looked into the skittle-ground, which is at the back of the house, and saw Weller there - I went into the back-parlour with him; there was a man asleep on the bench. I asked him who he was? he told me not to mind, it was all right. He then put two 1l. notes on the table, which he took out of his breeches-pocket; I gave him 16s. in silver for them, folded them up, and put them into my pocket. He asked me when I thought I should want some more? I said I thought I should be able to take half a score on the Saturday following, and asked him if he would let me have them for less? he said he would let me have them for 7s. 6d. each. I appointed to be there at ten o'clock for them. I then went to the Bank, but not finding Mr. Christmas, I kept them in my pocket till the next morning, when I gave them to Mr. Christmas, at a public-house in the Old Bailey. I had been to the Bank for him, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Weller on the Saturday following - A. Yes, at ten o'clock, as nearly as possible; Guy went with me, and I left him as before. I saw Weller in the skittle-ground - He came to me in the passage. I asked him if he had got them ready? he made no answer, but went into the skittle-ground; he returned into the passage in about two minutes, followed by the prisoner, Cashman; we all three went into the back-parlour, and sat down - They rang the bell, and called for sixpennyworth of shrub and water. Cashman then asked me how many I wanted? Weller was present - I told him half a score. He then asked for the money; I told him I had got it all right, and when he brought the notes I would give it to him; he said I must give him the money first, as it was a rule among them to have the money first, in case it should be marked, that they might put it away before they fetched the notes. I said they were both strangers to me, that it was all the money I had, and did not like to give them the money till I had the notes. Cashman said I need not be afraid, for it was Weller I was dealing with, and he would wait in the room while Weller went for the notes. I said I did not like to deliver the money till I had the notes. He said, if I was afraid I should have them, as they were then in the room. He put his hand into his breeches-pocket, and pulled something out, which I thought were the notes; it looked like paper. I then put two 1l. notes, and 1l. 15s. in silver on the table; Cashman took it up, looked at it, put it into his pocket, and said I must wait while he fetched them, and that he should not be gone above five minutes. Weller was present the whole of the time. Cashman went out, leaving me with Weller - He was gone nearly half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. While he was gone, had you any conversation with Weller - A. Yes; he asked me if I wanted any 5l. notes! I said I knew a man who had asked about some. He said he would let me have some at 30s. each, and I might charge 50s. I said I should see him on Sunday-nothing more passed. I told him it was a long way to come, and asked if he could bring them nearer? he said he could not bring them any where but there, as a young man, whom he had served nearly seven months, asked him to bring three to a certain house, and when he came there two officers were ready for him; that he was detected, and tried last Sessions, and since that he had been more careful, and would not deliver them any where else. I do not know that any thing else passed till Cashman returned.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed then - A. He came in, took off his hat, and took the notes out of it - They were, done up carelessly in a piece of brown paper. He threw the paper on the ground, and gave Weller the notes, Weller then gave them to me. They both said, if I came on Sunday I could see them there - I appointed Monday morning, at ten o'clock. I left them, and found Guy where I had left him. We went to the Bank, and gave Mr. Christmas the notes. I saw him open them, count and mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday morning did you go according to appointment - A. Yes; I went alone, and saw the prisoners together at the Cooper's Arms, public-house, and told them I had seen the man who wanted the notes, and asked them if they would see him and deal with him themselves, for I had told him where to come to them, and asked if they would charge him 2l. each for the 5l. notes, as he would not give more, and they must give me 2s. out of it. They both heard this, and asked me if the man would trust me with the money? I said it was probable that he would, but I had much rather they would deal with him themselves. They both told me to bring the man to any house in Goswell-street, and they would see him. I left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man named Sellers - A. Yes, I believe he is an officer. I met him at the Cart and Horse, public-house, at the corner of Sutton-street, Goswell-street, next morning; the Bank Solicitor introduced him to me; he was dressed in a brown coat and top-boots. I left him there, and went to the Cooper's Arms, which is about two minutes walk. I saw Weller first, told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090022"/>had left the man in Goswell-street, and asked him if he would go with me to see him? Cashman then came in, and asked me how many I wanted? I told him Weller was going to see the man himself. Cashman asked me how many I thought he wanted? I said, I believed he wanted six 5l. notes, but Weller was going to him. Cashman asked Weller if he was going? he said, Yes. Cashman said, "Make haste. and I will get them ready." I took Weller to the Cart and Horse, public-house, and introduced him to Sellers. I said to Sellers, "Here is the young man, will you speak to him? Sellers said, "I suppose you know what I want?" Weller said Yes. Sellers asked him how much the 5l. notes were a piece? he said 2l. Sellers said it was a long price, as he had never given more than 35s., but he did not mind, if they were good ones. He looked towards me, to know what sort they were. I said I could say nothing of the 5l. notes, as I had never seen any of then, but the 1l. notes he had seen. Sellers than said, if they were as good as the 1l. he did not care. He then asked him what he should give him for half a score of 1l. notes? he said 9s. each, which was agreed to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the money being paid - A.Sellers agreed to take four 5l. notes at 2l. each, and ten 1l. notes at 9s. each. Weller said he must have the money first. Sellers said, he thought it was time enough when he brought the notes-Wellers said he must have the money first, and that he would not bring them there, but I must fetch them as usual. Sellers gave Weller twelve 1l. notes. He looked at them, and asked Sellers if he should know any of them again if they were not all right? He said he should not, but that he would change any he disliked. Weller said he always had my money first, and that Sellers need not he afraid - I then said it was so. Weller took the notes from Sellers, doubled them up, and gave them to me, telling me to come with him - He told Sellers he should not be gone long, and that he should have the notes within half an hour. I went with him to near the top of Atfield-street, he then asked me if I knew the way to the Cooper's Arms? I said Yes. He left me and went to the left, which would lead to the back of the Cooper's Arms. When I got there, I met Cashman in the passage - He asked me how many the man wanted? I told him four 5l. and ten 1l. notes. He asked me for the money, I gave it to him. He asked me if I had taken my difference out of it? I said I had not had time to reckon it. Weller came in at that moment from the back of the house. Cashman asked him how many the man wanted, he told him. He asked Weller where I was going to wait for them? he said there. Cashman said I had better not, as the house was so full. Weller told me to go back to Sellers, and when he had got them he would come and tell me. I asked him for my difference. Weller said he would reckon it, and bring it with the other notes. I returned to Sellers, and remained with him nearly an hour, but Weller did not come. I returned to the Cooper's Arms, and saw him in company with another man, whom I did not know. I asked him how much longer we were to wait? he said Cashman would not be at the Cooper's Arms for a quarter of an hour, but as soon as he came he(Weller) would come, and let me know. I returned and waited nearly another hour - He did not come. I went again to the Cooper's Arms, and saw Cashman; he asked me if I had seen Weller? I said I had not. He said he did not know what he meant to do, for he had got the money, and, he believed, was looking after me. I then saw Weller in the skittle-ground, and told Cashman he was there, he went to him. Weller came to me, and asked me if I would take them? I said, "As you like." He then went to Cashman, in the skittle-ground - They both stood talking to another man for three or four minutes. Weller then came to me, and told me to tell the man to come for them himself, as he should not deliver them unless he did. I said I did not think he would come, but I would tell him. I went and informed Sellers - He sent me back. I told Weller to give me either the money or the notes, for the man would not come there for them, and would look to me for his money. Weller said he might for what he cared, for he did not take the money of me, I had given it to Cashman - He said he should not have either unless he came for them himself, and he must not come there to catch flats, and that I myself ought to have known better. He told me to ask Sellers if he did not know one Flecknoe. I returned, and informed Sellers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are a married woman - A. Yes; my husband was transported for passing had notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has nothing been said to induce you to belive that he would be pardoned if you convicted the prisoners - A. Nothing of the kind ever passed. I do it to detest those who would lead others into it.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, is Guy married to your sister-in-law - A. I cannot say - I have heard him say his wife lives at Wandsworth, and keeps a butcher's-shop; he and my sister-in-law pass as man and wife, and have done so for four years or more. He lives in Prince's-row, Lambeth - I live in Oakley-street, Westminster-road, and go out ironing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect to be paid for this - A. I expect to he paid for my loss of time, nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the money to buy the notes - A. From Mr. Christmas. Guy gave me the notes to buy the ten 1l. notes; Sellers furnished the 12l.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes, at the price you mention, would come to 12l. 10s. - A. We afterwards found we had reckoned it short.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not examined in private - A. I gave my deposition at the Bank, it was afterwards read over to the prisoner at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was it your money or Sellers's - A. Sellers's. I was afterwards examined before the magistrate, the prisoners were not present, but their attorneys and counsel were. What I said at the Bank was read over to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH GUY. I was formerly a butcher at Chelsea, and after that I was an occasional constable of Queen-square; I am now living with a woman at Princes-row, Kenington-cross. On the 11th of July, I was sent with Fear to Atfield-street, she went into the Cooper's Arms, and returned to me in a few minutes - She went back again there. She came out, we then went to the Bank, where she produced the two 1l. notes and gave them to Mr. Christmas. On the 14th we went there again, I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090023"/>mained outside; she then came out and we walked about for near half an hour - She then went in again, came out and went to the Bank with me. On the 16th we went to the Bank and enquired for Mr. Christmas, we found him in the Old Bailey; she gave him two 1l. notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her to the Cooper's Arms again - A. No; I went into the other house on the 18th, remained there about an hour when she came in; I knew the prisoners, I did not see her with them there - I believe she went into the parlour, I heard her voice there. I saw Cashman go to the bar-door and tell the landlord if he should be wanted he should return in half an hour, which he did, and went down the passage leading to the parlour. I remained and saw her go out, and joined her in about ten minutes - We went to the Bank, she gave Mr. Christmas ten 1l. notes. I went on the 21st with her to the Cart and Horse; Sellers was there first, dressed in a brown coat, top-boots and spurs, and had a horse. I remained in the house exactly opposite so as to see the entrance. I saw Fear go out towards Atfield-street, and return with Weller he stopped and looked at the horse and then went in; they came out together in about a quarter of an hour, and went towards Atfield-street; I saw Fear go in again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was not your business at Queen-square Office as an informer against hawkers and pedlers - A. No; I was constable there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in custody - A. I was put in Tothillfields one night and came out next morning. Fear is no relative of mine, her sister lives with me; my wife is at Wandsworth-Fear might know that, I think she did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your wife last - A. About four years ago. I told the Bank solicitors what I had found out; they said if I could bring such things to bear as what I told them, to bring the persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Is money an object to you - A. Sometimes - I am not short now. The father of the woman I live with has supplied me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not received money from the agents of the Bank - A. I have not, nor the promise of any.</p>

            . I am constable of Mary-le-bone - I live in Bell-street. In July last, I was employed by the Bank; I went to the Cart and Horse, Goswell-street, in consequence of an arrangeement between me and Mrs. Fear. I went there on horse-back, and had on boots and a great coat, dressed like a horse dealer. She came to me in five minutes; after that the prisoner Weller came in - I asked him to drink, and then asked Fear if that was the young man? she said, Yes. I said to Weller, "I suppose you know what I want?" he said, Yes. I asked him if he had got any with him? he said, No, he always had the money first. I asked what I was to give him a piece for the 5l. notes? he said 40s., and 9s. for the 1l. notes. I said it was a great price, for I had never given above 35s. He said he would not take less, and he always had the money first. I looked at Mrs. Fear and said, I did not mind the price if they were good. She said she never saw the 5l. notes, but I had seen the 1l. notes. I said if they were as good as the ones, I did not mind the price. I looked at Weller, and said, I hoped all was right? He said,"It was all right, for he always had Mrs. Fear's money first." He then asked me how many I wanted of each sort? I told him four 5l. and ten 1l. notes; I gave him twelve 1l. bank notes. He said, "I suppose you will know these notes again?" I said I should not, but if he disputed any, I would change them, and give him silver.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give him 12l. - A. They came to 12l. 10s. He took up the 12l. and did not ask for the 10s.; he gave Fear the money, and said, "Come with me and fetch them, as you have done before." He looked at me as he went out of the room, and said, "You will have them in half an hour." Fear went with him; I saw her again in a quarter of an hour. She went again to Weller, returned and staid near an hour with me. She went out again, and came back and staid about a quarter of an hour. I saw nothing more of the prisoners till they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Flecknoe - A. I bought some notes of him by direction of the Bank solicitor; and should have been witnees against him, but he pleaded guilty.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I know nothing of the notes in the indictment.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am inspector to the Bank. I first knew Fear in the early part of July, she came to me on the 11th and gave me two 1l. forged notes, (looking at them) these are them - They are forged in every respect, and both off one plate, On the 15th, she gave me two more (these are them,) they are forged in every respect, and both off one plate, but of a different plate to the first two. She gave them to me at a public-house in the Old Bailey; I had given her 1l. twice to buy them. On the 11th, 13th, and 18th, she gave me ten 1l. notes (these are them), they are forged in every respect, and all from the same plate as the two last.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she brought them to you, in what state were they - A. Quite new.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am certain they are the notes. I did not mark the notes I gave her - I thought it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PEARSON. I am signing clerk to the Bank,(looking at the note charged in the indictment) the signature is not my hand writing, there is no other clerk of my name; here is another note with my name to it, but is not my writing.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read.)</p>

               <p>JOHN TIMOTHY. I live at Lambeth; I had 170 flounders in a coff in a vessel on the river. I missed the coff about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 26th of July, the prisoners lived near me I went to look for them, and found them about four o'clock trying to get through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090024"/>London-bridge-their boat was fastened to the starlings. I found 170 flounders concealed under the bottom boards of the boat, which is not a place where fishermen would put them. I asked them to go to the Thames-police Office with me - They refused; they challenged me to prove the fish to be mine. I charged them with stealing them, they said, "Rather than be accused wrongfully they would pay for them." I said they ought to have known my boat - They said they did not. I believe the fish were mine, because one had been wounded in the water; and so had one of them.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER MITCHEL. The prisoners were given into my charge. They said they got the fish in Greenwich.</p>
               <p>BLAKE'S Defence. Flounders are often speared, which would bruise them.</p>

I received information and went to the pawnbroker's, where I found two pieces of printed calico. Brand went with me to the prisoner's house in Baltic-street, near Old-street, where I found the male prisoner. Brand told him we were come to search again - We had searched before but found nothing. He said"I will not have it yet." While Brand was searching his wife, he desired to speak to me privately. I went into the passage to him, he said he had taken part of one piece, which was missing; on the 24th, the day on which we had searched before. He begged I would show him mercy. I said I should do no more than I was compelled. We returned to the parlour - I told Brand he had confessed to taking half a piece. Brand asked him when he took it, he said in the morning of the day we searched before; he said he took it from above. Brande asked how he got it, he said by letting down the ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all the things at the same time. - A. No; at different times. The male prisoner was a watchman, and employed to protect our property inside the warehouse. The prisoner, Eliza, used often to bring his supper.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BRAND. I am marshalman of the city of London. On the 12th of August I found the prisoners at home and took them into custody. I found several pawnbroker's duplicates on the woman, and several about the house; the man said he took one piece. The prisoner, Eliza Ellis, came in, I told her her father had acknowledged taking one piece; she said she pledged it after dividing it.</p>

On the 14th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in and asked for a skein of sewingsilk, which came to 3d. and one yard of twist; he paid for them, and took a piece of twist out of the drawer, and kept it in his hand. He had a piece of cloth in which I saw him attempt to wrap it up; he put both into his pocket. He pulled the cloth out again, and put it on the counter, leaving the twist in his pocket. I went round the counter and charged him with having put a piece of twist in his pocket. He said he had not, and almost pushed me down. I went up to him again, he then took the twist out, which I caught in his hand. He begged me to let him go, saying he had a wife and four children, one of whom was dying, which induced him to do it.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police Officer. On the 30th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at Limehouse, with a bundle; I told him I was an officer; he said it was old iron, I found it was lead; he said he worked at Mr. Cotton's, close to the river. I took him to the gate-keeper, who said he was one of their workmen. Prisoner said he took the lead to put over his door, and was sorry for it.</p>

About the beginning of May the prisoner bought a pair of shoes at my shop, which came to 7s. or 7s. 6d.; he ordered a pair of dancing pumps; I measured him; they were to be done in about a week, and sent to 25, Seward-street, which is a short distance from my house. He paid for the shoes with a 1l. note, I asked his name, he said Pask, which I put on the note, and put my initials to it, I did not write his address on it. I sent out for change, while he was there, and gave him the difference, and wrote his address on the measure. This is the note (looking at it).</p>

I searched, and found 18d. and a few halfpence on him, and in his fob I found a bank note. I inquired where he got it, he said he should not tell me, but he would satisfy the magistrate. I had said nothing to him about the magistrate. I had told him I thought it was a bad one, as we went along in the coach, he said he found it in the City-road, a week ago, with 2s.; I put my name on it in his presence (looking at one), this is it.

On the 17th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop and bought a handkerchief which came to 2s.; he tended to me a 1l. bank note, I looked at it and told him it was a bad one - He said, "here is another," which I took and requested his address - He said, "

I had the first note by itself - I wrote the address on the good one; I wrapped the bad one in it, and put both in my pocket (looking at the notes), this is the first he gave me. I put his name on it at the watch-house before I parted with it. This is the second note he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him - A. I told him that having had so many forged notes, I should see if he had given me a right address; he made no objection to it, but went out of the shop towards Queen Anne-street. When we got into Crawford-street, Montague-square, I had not got hold of him, he said he had taken the note at the Green Man and Still, and wished me to go there with him; I said I should go to the first address. He then said he lived in Castle-street, and I must go there with him; I said I would go nowhere till I had been to the first address; but that I thought it very strange that he should prevaricate in that manner, and if he did not choose to go to the first address he had better surrender himself; upon which he ran from me; we were then at the end of Crawford-street - he ran as fast as he could. I attempted to pursue him, but a man ran against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear by accident or design - A. It was designedly, he crossed directly in front of me, saying-"Which is the thief;" he must have seen the prisoner runing before me. I had called out "Stop thief! stop that man."</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man who ran against you knock you down - A. No; I stumbled, and then pursued the prisoner; he was stopped by a soldier and taken to the watch-house, I never lost sight of him. The watch-house-keeper asked him his name-he said it was Thomas

The prisoner came to my shop, and bought a leg of mutton, which came to 5s. 6d.; he tendered a 1l. note, which my housekeeper took from him in my presence. I asked him for his address - He said his name was Brown, and that he lived at No.6, Green's-court, which is about two hundred yards from my house. I wrote it on the note immediately (looking at it)-this is it. On Tuesday morning I found it was a bad one. I went to No.6, Green's-court-there was no person of that name there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. On the Sunday following he came about the same time, bought a leg of lamb, and tendered me another 1l. note. I knew him again immediately, and asked his address. He said his name was Childs, and he lived at No. 6, Green's-Court. I said, "How is that? why, you have changed your name since last Sunday!" he said he had not; I told him he had, for he bought a leg of mutton of me last Sunday, and paid me with a bad note, He at first denied it, but afterwards said he did. I told him I thought the second note was also bad. He asked to look at it - I returned it to him, and he paid me for the lamb. He asked me to let him see the first note, which I gave him - He then had both notes, and held them in his hand. I 
               <persName id="t18180909-57-person523">drew</persName>
             the first note out of his hand, and said I must have it. He said he would give me the money for it if I would go with him. I refused to let him have the lamb, as he seemed confused. I went to Green's-court with him. As we went along, he offered to go into a public-house and treat me - I refused. When we got to Green's-court, he at first looked on one side and then on the other. I asked him what he was looking for? he said he did not exactly know where No. 6 was. We got almost to the end of the court. I said I thought it very strange that he should give his address at No. 6, and not know where it was. He then said that his brother once lived there, and that if I would go home with him he would give me the money for the note. I asked him where? he said he lived in Crown-street. We turned to go there, but I took him to Crown-court, as I knew a butcher who lived there. I told him I should go no farthnr, took him into custody, and sent for a constable, who searched him. The note which he offered me for the lamb was not found on him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any thing said to him about the note not being found - A. He said I had not returned it to him - I am certain that I did, and he did not give it back to me. He was stripped at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not return silver for one of them - A. He had but 18d. in his pocket, which he took out of the note, and said he had no more silver. He gave me none.</p>

On the 5th of June, the prisoner came into my house about twelve o'clock in the morning, and had a quartern of gin, which came to four-pence. She tendered me a 1l. bank note; I took it. Mr. Lewis who was sitting near me, told me to be cautious as I had only been in the house three days; he requested to look at the note, which he did, and said it was a bad one - She heard it. She had a child in her arms. I asked her by what means she got the note? she said a man at the corner, had given her the bottle, and the note to get changed. I, Lewis, and the prisoner all went out to look for him - She led us to the corner, which was twenty or thirty yards off - We saw no one there. She said she did not know the man. We told her we must detain her - She said she hoped we would not, for we might keep the note if we liked. I went for a constable. Lewis had the note; he did not return it to me.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 25th of July, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a shoulder of lamb, which came to 3s. 1d. He tendered me a 1l. bank note, I asked him his name and address, he said, "John Sergeant, 15, Ratcliff-highway." I told him I supposed it was a bad one, and questioned him farther where No. 15, Ratcliff-high way was; he then said he lived up a little street, near the Black Dog, public-house, but the name of the street he did not know, as he had not been there long. I asked him where he took the note? he said he took it of a gentleman on Tower-hill, for work; and that he had worked very hard for it. I rubbed the word London, and told him again I thought it a bad note; he told me not to deface it, but to give it him again. I told him I did not think it prudent to return it to him, as it was bad. I sent my boy for an officer. I took him myself to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attempt to run away - A. No; he went out of the shop, but did not attempt to go away - He knew I had sent for an officer. I was near enough to prevent it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090029"/>if he had attempted. I left him at the watch-house. As I returned I met Jackson, the officer, and returned with him to the watch-house, and put my name on the note. I had kept it in my pocket all the while. I then told him I should send an officer to see if it was his right address; he then said I had bullied him at the shop, and therefore he was terrified, and that his name was Jeremiah Bryan, and that he lived at No. I, Little Prescott-street. He said he had found the note on Tower-hill, about thirty or forty yards from the pump (looking at the note), this is it; the prisoner put his mark on it, and I and Jackson signed it. Jackson told the prisoner he had better mark it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not stop in your shop twenty minutes and outside, when you sent for the watchman - A. I sent to a person at the top of Old Gravel-lane, to come and see if he knew the prisoner - He came, and said he did not know him. I do not know whether the prisoner was outside or not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the time you intimated to him that you thought it bad, was you near enough to see him if he ran away - A. I think I was. He told me I had better go to his address; I thought proper to go to the watch-house first. He offered to go any where with me. I never parted with the note till I had marked it.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he gave you the address had you told him you suspected it was bad - A. No. I had said nothing to intimidate him before he gave me his address.</p>

            . I am constable of St. George's in the East, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house. I saw Curtis sign the note, and requested the prisoner to mark it-(looking at it)-this is it. I asked the prisoner where he took it? he said he took it of a gentleman on Tower-hill for work. I asked him what part of Tower-hill the gentleman lived at? He gave me no answer. I asked him the gentleman's name? he said he did not know it, and then told me he did not get it of a gentleman, but found it on Tower-hill. I asked him why he said he received it of a gentleman if he found it? he said he thought it better to say he worked for it than that he found it. I took it to the Bank Inspector.</p>

On the 22d of July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop with two other soldiers, and asked for some silk handkerchiefs, I told my man to serve him. He sat on a stool, and put his cap on the counter. I saw him take something off the counter, put it in his cap, and put his handkerchief over it, he then put his cap on his head. In a few minutes I said, "Is not your cap very heavy this warm weather?" and asked him to let me feel the weight of it. One of his comrades presented his cap to me to feel - I pretended not to see it, but took the prisoner's off his head, lifted his handkerchief out, and found the shawl under it - He attempted to escape, but I gave him in charge. He wanted to compromise the business; I refused.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Haynes, a butcher in Chapel-street. On the 5th of September, I saw the prisoner Kaylock, get over the prosecutor's area-railing into the street, he ran as fast as he was able; he had a great coat on. I rang the bell, and told Quin, he ran towards Westminster.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure he is the boy, I saw him again four days after.</p>

Mr. Bradbury produced two seals to me, which I knew to be mine; he said he bought them of a person who sold old clothes, and that he thought he lived in Barbican. We went to Play house-yard; and found the prisoner at a house there. He appeared to be a general dealer in old clothes. Mr. Bradbury immediately said he was the man. I asked him if he had any more of the seals which he had sold to Bradbury, he said he had not; I immediately beckoned to Humphreys to come in, he began to search, the priosner's wife, a girl, and a boy were in the room; the prisoner pretended to faint, and wanted a little vinegar, his wife also expressed the same inclination, and was apparently fainting; I thought it a trick, and sat against the door to prevent any body going out; I heard a noise in the passage and thought they might be moving some of my property, and opened the door a little way to see what was going on, at that instant his wife passed her hand through the aper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090032"/>ture, and gave something to a person outside; I pulled the door to; Twenty or thirty Jews came round the door, and made a great noise, we were literally beat out of the house.

I saw Taylor open the door, and take a sirloin of beef and bring it out. Ellis then went in and took off a piece of the ribs. Ellis must have seen Taylor go out, as he waited at the door. I pursued Ellis, and brought him back with the meat on his back. Taylor was about 100 yards before him. He was never out of my sight.</p>

I am sure it was fast; the room-door was fast and the key in it. I was up stairs; my watch hung over the fire-place in the room. I heard the street - door open, ran down as fast as possible, and saw a man go out of the outer door and pull it after him. I looked into the room and missed my watch. I immediately ran after him; I did not see the prisoner stopped. The prisoner was brought back in less than a quarter of an hour, by Daily. I do not know whether he is the same person that I saw in the house. I had had the watch eight years, it is worth 30s. A person could see the watch hang up through the window. I tried the door before I went up stairs.</p>

She had been to the shop before that morning, for half an ounce of tobacco. The silk bag belonged to me; my sister gave it to me. There was some silver in it which belonged to my father.</p>

I saw the prisoner throw away a bag in the middle of the street, I picked it up; it was empty; it was a striped bag; I was going to give it to the person, and saw the prisoner throw something more away, under the door of the wine-vaults. at the corner of Field-lane; I picked it up, it was a piece of paper; which contained counterfeit shillings.

On the 21st of July, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I missed a 5l. note out of my cash-box in the bedroom - I had put it there the evening before, when I went to bed. I got up at seven o'clock next morning; I had left my wife in the room - She came down about eight o'clock. I sent for an officer, without saying any thing to the prisoner - nobody else had access to my bed-room. The constable came, I called the prisoner down to the kitchen, told her I missed a 5l. note, and I suspeeted her - She denied it. The constable searched her box; while he was searching the prisoner went to some small drawers, where some other things were kept, took something out, and endeavoured to put it in her pocket! I caught her hand, found a very small box in it, and the 5l. note in the box; I knew it to be the same, by four figures at the back of it, which I had particularly noticed the night before - They were 1797. I had a particular reason for noticing what I put into my box. I found my box locked as I had left it. There are two keys to it, my wife keeps one, and I keep the other; my wife had lost her key for two or three days; we found it in the prisoner's box after she was taken to the office-it was not there when the constable searched the first time; we had left the prisoner in the kitchen for half an hour, to pack up her things, While the officer went to Bow-street on the business, she had an opportunity of putting the key there (looking at the note), this is it, I know it by the figures.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 27th of June, I and Smith were employed to watch the prosecutor's premises; we had been watching two or three days before - We had been there from seven o'clock, I was in Lawrence-lane, and Smith was at the end of Milk-street, to watch both doors; a little after eight o'clock I saw the prisoner come out of the court into Lawrence-lane, he appeared confused when he saw me; we followed him down Aldermanbury, and lost sight of him in Force-street. He appeared very bulky, and much larger than when I saw him go into the warehouse. He had seen us, and started off. We lost him. We immediately went to No. 13, Newcourt, Moor-lane, where the prisoner Roberts lived. I looked through the window, and saw the prisoner, Walker, there - We waited about two minutes, and then saw him come out, tying his apron on, and go down the court, he did not appear so bulky as before; he saw us at the bottom of the court, and went into a public-house - He appeared very confused. I went in, took him, and found 5s. 6d. on him; we took him back to Roberts's, we found Roberts and his wife at breakfast in the room where I had seen Walker, I asked them both to produce the property which Walker had brought in - They denied his having brought any. I said it was all nonsence, for I knew better, and was sure something had been brought in. His wife immediately went to the drawers in the same room, and produced two table-covers. I asked them if they had any thing more there? they both said, No. I found two more in the same drawer, and under a turn-up bedstead I found a rug. I secured the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you saw Walker in the room was any other person there - A. No; I went to the bottom of the court, which is a thoroughfare. I could not see the house. When I returned I found Roberts there-his wife was the principal person who answered me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Roberts appear as if he had been out - A. No; they both answered, almost together, that nothing had been left.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>ROBERTS'S Defence. When I married my wife, I found her house furnished, and I did not know what was there. I never opened the drawers.</p>

On the 7th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and bought a piece of Irish linen, which came to 3l. 2s. 10d., and paid me a 5l. Bury and Suffolk bank note - I did not ask his name; he gave me the name of Jones, Deptford; which I wrote on the note in his presence. This is the note he gave me (looking at it)-it was after banking hours. Next morning I presented it at Lee and Co.'s Lombard-street, for payment, and found it was forged. In consequence of which Mr. Hine, one of the clerks of the Bury bank, came to town on the Monday following, the 10th. We went together to Deptford, and were there nearly all day, searching for every person of the name of Jones, that we could find. We found four or five of that name, but not the person who gave me the note.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information did you go into St. George's-fields - A. Yes; on the following Friday, the 14th, I went to Joiner's-place, near Westminster-road, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning. Mr. Hine and Walton, the officer, were with me. Walton knocked at the door, a boy opened it, he asked if Gracey was within? the boy said he did not live there. We went in through a room, which was the shop, it was shut up-this led us to a bed-room, Walton said, "Good morning to you, Gracey." I did not hear him answer. I said,"Good morning, Mr. Jones." He said his name was not Jones. I told him I understood it was not, but I wished him to go with us - He dressed himself, and went with us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say anything more - A.He asked what I wanted with him. I told him he was the person who purchased a piece of linen of Mr. Walmsley, in Gracechurch-street, and I had given him change for a note; he then said he did not know Mr. Walmsley, that he had not been in Gracechurch-street, nor purchased any Irish linen, nor had he given a 5l. note to any person. We took him to the watch-house. As we were going along I asked him what he had done with the cloth he bought, he said he had not had any. We went to the watch-house to him at eleven o'clock - He wished to see his mother; Walton went for her, leaving me with the prisoner. He returned with his sister.</p>
               <p>Q. While Walton was absent, had you any conversation with him - A. I told him I thought he was wrong in denying it, as I was sure he was the person who gave me the note; I said I did not wish to hurt him, I only wanted to recover my 5l. He was searched, and this pocket-book found on him; here is a memorandum, against the 7th of August (reads) "Jones, 2l." I had given him a 1l. note, and 17s. 2d. for his change. He was taken before the magistrate; I heard him make a statement there, which was taken down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Look at him again, and see if you are positive he is the man who paid you the note - A. I have not the least doubt of it; he gave me the name of Jones voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say his name was Jones, of Deptford, or that he received it of Jones, of Deptford - A. He only said, Jones, Deptford.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he state to you how he came possessed of the note - A. I think it was at his second examination, I said nothing whatever to him - I took very short minutes of what he said - He spoke too fast for my clerk to take it down, but my minutes will enable me to state what he said; he said he would not sign any examination (reads),"I did live at No. 12, Kent-road, am a carver and gilder; I lodge now in Joiner's-place. I cannot say what is the person's name who keeps the house. I received this note when I lived in the Kent-road, about three weeks ago, for two dressing-boxes, which came to 2l. 14s., and put the man's name on the back of the note-he said he lived at Greenwich; he drove up with a horse and cart. I will not say whether he did not write the name himself. I did not take it to the banking-house. I left the shop in the Kent-road last Monday, and took my goods with me." He had seen the note; there is the name of "Howard, Stratford," on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I kept a carver and gilder's shop in the Kent-road. About the 27th of July a man drove up in a chaise, bought two boxes, and paid me the note. On the 7th of August, as I came home, I bought the linen at Walmsley's, and paid him the note, after having looked at the Directory, and saw there was such a bank. They did not ask me for my name, nor did I give any. I moved to Joiner's-place - They took me there. I did not know the note was bad.</p>

On Monday, the 10th of August, at eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, and bought a pair of Wellington boots of me, which came to 1l. 12s., and gave me a two-guinea Grantham bank note, payable at No.56, Lombard-street. I asked him to favour me with his address; he said his name was Smith. I gave him a pen to write it on the note - He said his name was on it. I asked him where he lived? he said, in Paul-street, which is not far from my house. I saw the name was on the back of the note. While the boy was gone home with the boots I forgot the number of the house, and omitted writing the address till he returned to tell me the number. I gave the note to Amelia Lownds, whom I saw write "Smith, T.A." on it. I had no other two-guinea note at that time or before. I sent my boy with the boots, and to bring back a pair of shoes, which the prisoner said he had, to sole and heel. This is the note-(looking at it).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go next day to Lombard-street - A. Yes, and found the note was bad. I went to Paul-street that morning, inquired for Smith at two or three houses, and was informed that if I had not got the number it was useless searching, as there might be many Smiths.</p>
               <p>Q. From information which you received, was your attention called to Crown-street - A. Yes. On Tuesday, the 11th of August, which was the same night, I watched a house there belonging to Mrs. Gracey, and waited there till almost twelve o'clock, I then saw the prisoner in Crown-street, coming towards the house. I went up to him, saw he was the person I wanted by the light of the lamp, collared him, and said, "How do you do, Mr. Smith? I have been looking for you sometime." He said,"My name is not Smith, but Gracey, and what do you collar me for? I bought a pair of boots of you, and paid you. - (I had said nothing about the boots, nor told him who I was, or where I lived). I said, "Yes, you paid me, but you know in what manner." - He made no reply. I took him to the watch-house - He resisted. When he came to his own door he said his name was Gracey, and he would go no further, as he could be found there at any time. I succeeded in getting him to the watch-house, and gave him in charge to Walton. He said there that he took the note of a friend in the shop, and he knew who it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. He was a stranger to me. I had no particular reason for attending to his conversation at the time he bought the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not say that the person's name who endorsed the note was on it - A. No; he said my name is Smith, the name is on the back; Paul-street, is a few yards from Crown-street. I asked him the name of the street twice, and could not mistake him-my attention was called to what passed when my boy came back.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FARQUHAR. I am servant to Mr. Archer, I remember the prisoner buying the boots - I was to take them home with him, and bring a pair of shoes back to sole and heel. We went across Moorfields, just as far as Lackington's; he walked first, and looked back three or four times. When we got to Lackington's, he said,"My lad, I will not take you any farther." He felt in his pocket for some halfpence, and said he had none; but he would bring the shoes next morning, and give me some - He did not call next morning. I had seen him before at his father's in Crown-street, Finsbury-square-his father was alive when I knew him. I did not recollect him when he first came, but I knew him better when he spoke to me at Lockington's. When his father was living my mother lived close by, and used to go charing for his mother - I knew all the family; I used to see him working. I often told my master that I knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I had spoken to him before, we knew one another - He did not call me by name.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long ago have you known him - A.Between three and four years ago. I have no reason to suppose he knew me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear him give your master the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090037"/>name of Smith - A. Yes. When I saw him at Lackington's I thought it was Gracey.</p>

            . On the 10th of August the prisoner moved from the house in the Kent-road. He lived there with his brother, the last prisoner - They left it about five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You mean you saw him often at his brother's house - A. Yes; I do not know that he lived with his mother. I saw him in Kent-road as often as I saw his brother. I saw him there at five o'clock in the morning when they moved. I do not know that he slept there.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the note from my mother. I gave the man the name of Gracey, and told him I believed it was on the back of the note. I asked him to let the lad go with me. When I got to Finsbury-square, I recollected I had to call on a person. I took the boots from the lad, and told him that if I came that way in the morning I would call and leave the shoes. I had to go another way, and did not leave them. It is very unlikely that I should have gone into a neighbourhood where I had been known for fourteen years, if I knew the note to be forged. I entered into conversation with the prosecutor at his house, about the neighbours who knew me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ARCHER re-examined. Q. Are you sure he did not say his name was Gracey, and that he believed it was on the back of the note - A. I am sure he did not. The boy went with the prisoner by my desire, as I wished to know where he lived. He did not ask me to let the boy go. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you did he go in the way to Crown-street - A. Yes, and in the way of Paul-street also. He talked about the neighbourhood, and said he knew Donaldson, Scott, and Williams.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FARQUHAR. I was within hearing at the time, and am certain he did not mention the name of Gracey.</p>

On the 9th of July about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house, and asked for a quartern and a half of gin, which came to 6d; he gave me a 1l. bank note, I asked him his name and address? he said his name was Johnson, and that he lived in Hare-court, Aldersgate-street. It struck me that the note was bad, by his coming so far, and passing several other public-houses before he came to mine; there are several between mine and Hare-court. I wrote his name and address on the note in his presence(looking at it)-this is the note he gave me. I gave him 19s. 6d. in silver. Mr. Cornish was in the next room. Before the prisoner went out I communicated my suspicions to him, leaving the prisoner in the shop. I showed Mr. Cornish the note, I was five or ten minutes before I returned to him, I put the name on the note before I left him; I gave him the change after I returned from Cornish. I requested Cornish to follow him, which he did, and brought him back about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I asked him what he had done with the silver, he said it did not matter to me what he had done with it. I told him it did matter, as it was my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you took the note to Cornish he returned it to you, you came and said you could not give change. When I said I could not have the gin, you returned to Cornish, and then sent your daughter out for change - A. I only went into the room to Cornish once, and returned in five minutes, I sent my daughter out for change while I was with Cornish, I returned and gave the prisoner the change; I never said I could not give change; when I first took it, I said, "I was afraid I could not," and then showed the note to Cornish - He said he thought it a good one, I said I thought it was not; he advised me to take it. I sent my daughter for change, I went out of the private door myself, and gave her the change to bring in. The note was never out of my possession. I did not want change.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing that - A. I thought it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>JOHN CORNISH. I am a butcher, and live in St. George's-market. While I was in Mrs. Taylor's house, the prisoner came in-Mrs. Taylor requested me to look at the note; I said I would follow him - I went out and saw him - I did not see the bottle with him. He went into Aldersgate-street, and went up to a man who stood at the corner of Hare-court; both went down the court together. I followed him; when they got to about the middle of the court, his companion looked round at me-they then quickened their pace. I was within ten yards of them, and asked a woman if that was Hare-court, his companion again looked round. They went out of the court into another alley on the right, and there I saw the prisoner give some silver out of his hand into the man's hand, it appeared about 16s. I went up to the prisoner and told him I wished to know something about the note that he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090038"/>passed; his companion walked a little way, and then ran. The prisoner said, "Search me." I then repeated my question; he again said, "Search me." I told him he should go back with me, he refused. I took hold of him, we had a scuffle and I tore his coat. He then said, "You have torn my coat, I will go back with you; but do not handle me." When we got to Mrs. Taylor's, I said here is the man; I gave him in charge of a man while I went to look for the other man. I returned and searched him, but found nothing particular on him.</p>

On the 11th of May, the prisoner came to my shop and bought a piece of cheese, which came to 2s. 8d. or 3s. 8d.; he paid me a 1l. bank note. I asked his name and address, he said, "Chapel, No.22, Mitchel-street, Brick-lane;" which I wrote on the back of the note in his presence (looking at it), this is the note. I have no doubt of his being the person. I did not know him before.</p>

            . I am clerk to the magistrates at Guildhall. I was present when the prisoner was examined about the note uttered to Mrs. Taylor. I wrote his examination down, he did not sign it - He was told he need not say any thing to commit himself. I read what passed over to him at the second examination. I cannot say whether the first examination was read over to him on the first day (reads). "1st examination, Thursday, 9th of June. The prisoner admitted that he went to buy the gin, and said he took the note last Friday of a man named Johnson; he did not known him, but he said he lived in Hare-court. He denied speaking to any body after he left Taylor's. On being asked where he lived, he said he lived no where at present, but slept last night in Drury-lane." On the 13th of July, he was examined again, Taylor and Cornish were examined (reads)."Prisoner admits that he had the bottle, and it was in his bosom at the time he was taken. He does not deny having the note, but did not know it was bad. He does not know Johnson, but he took it of him in Smithfield-market." King was then examined on that day (reads)."Prisoner said he does not know him at all, he is mistaken; he never wore a frock-coat in his life; that he was at work mending harness on Whit Monday, and then lived with his father, who is an aged man, but he did not wish to tell where, lest it should come to his ears."</p>

I went into two wine-vaults with him, when he tendered the note; he went into another in Aldersgate-street, and came out laughing and said it was droll that he could not get change. He sent me to get change at the prosecutrix's; he said he did not like to go in as he owed her a score, gave me the bottle and told me to get a quartern and half of gin, and put my own address on it, I refused - He told me to put his, which I did. The prosecutrix took the note to the gentleman, I observed him hold it up to look at it; she brought it to me and said she could not change it. I said I could not have the gin, she returned to the gentleman, and sent her daughter for change-who returned without it; her mother sent her again, she brought it. When I came out I observed Johnson on the opposite side, he beckoned to me, I went to the corner and offered him the buttle and change - He told me to wait there till he returned; the man came and took me. I did not know it was forged.</p>

On the 25th of August, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and bought two ounces of tea and a pound and a half of sugar, which came to 2s. 6d.; he took a dirty linen bag out of his pocket, and took a 1l. note out. He asked for the change; I told him I thought I had not got it. I suspected it was a bad one, but did not tell him so. I gave the note to Jones, my shopman, to go out and get change. The prisoner heard me sent him. I had observed the name of"Hoares and Co." on the right side of the face of the note.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you asked the prisoner any questions about it - A. Not any. My young man was gone ten or fifteen minutes. I kept the prisoner in conversation, by talking about the country, as he appeared a countryman. He said my young my man was a long while gone. I said I was obliged to send across Smithfield for the change, and it took some time. He went towards the door, I followed him to see if my man was coming, not seeing him, he said he would walk round Smithfield, and come back for the change and goods, then left. Jones afterwards returned with the note, and gave me information about it. I locked it up by itself, but did not mark it. I took it to the Bank that afternoon, where I ascertained it to be a forgery. I then marked it at the Investigator's office (looks at in), I am sure this is the note the prisoner gave me.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rickett. The prisoner came into the shop. my master gave me the note to get changed (looking at it), this is it. I had observed" Hoares and Co." on the face of it, and "Willian and Co., Bull and Mouth-street," on the back, before I took it out of the shop. I could not get it changed; it being a bad note.</p>
               <p>JOHN MASTERS. I am a bookbinder. On the 28th of August I heard Mr.Rickett had taken a bad note, and the description of the man who uttered it led me to suspect the prisoner, whom I had formerly known, by his going about with earthenware. I went round to where he resorted, and saw him in a coart in West-street, on the right hand going out of Smithfield; he was with another man; I heard that man say to him.</p>
               <p>"The note is up yet in the grocer's window, and I thought you was out of the way." The note was then up in Mr. Rickett's window. This led me to suspect he was the man. The prisoner said he was going out of the way that evening, he then pulle a bag out of his right hand pocket, opened it, and took a 1l. bank note out, and put the bag in again, doubled up the note and put it into his fob. The other man walked away. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"I presume you are the man that passed the note to Mr. Rickett," he said he was the man, and told me if I wanted any, to appoint any public-house, and kept him in conversation for about an hour. We walked to the corner of Jewin-street, Aldersgate-street; he said he would not walk any further diwn Aldersgate-stree, for he knew Aldersgate-street very well. He wanted to go down Jewin-street. I immediately called a coach which stood in the road oppsite to Jewin-street, and told him I apprehended him for uttering the note to Mr. Rickett, and having one then in his possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How came you to know that the note in his possession was a bad one - A. He told me that the note he had in his bag cost him 8s. and the man whom he had it of paid 7s. 6d. for it. I forced him into the coach; he resisted a good deal, at last when he saw a mob) coming round, he went quietly into the coach. I got in with him. He threw the dirty bag out at the door; Payne picked it up, and gave it into the coach to me. I found the note in it, which I afterwards put my name on (looking at it).</p>
               <p>MR. RICKETT. (looking at the bay.) it is the same sort of bag that he liad at my shop. I believe it to be the same-this is it. I had never spoke to him before. I do not know how he came to be so free with me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PAYNE. I work at a glass-house in Aldersgate-street. On the 28th of August I was selling fish about the street and saw the prisoner and the las witness hustling together. I put down my tray to see what was the matter. Masters asked him to go back to the man where he passed the note, if he was innocent. I tried to peersuade him to go back, and so did a gentleman who got out of a gig, and others, but he would not. I saw him put into the coach. Masters and another amn got in with him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090040"/>I saw the prisoner, with his left hand, throw a dirty bag out of the coach, I picked it up and gave it to Masters at the coach-door, in the same state as I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not drop it - A. No; he threw it out under the hind wheel, while Masters was getting in. It must have come from his hand, as neither Masters nor the other had got in.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am Inspector of bank notes.(Looking at the notes.) That uttered to Rickett is forged in all its parts, paper, plate, and signature. That found on the prisoner is of a different plate, and is forged in every respect, and is not the signature of the signing clerk.</p>

            . I am cashier in Messrs. Spooners' hanking-house. I was standing at Messrs. Coutt's door, in the Strand about half past twelve o'clock; I saw the prisoner pass and repass two or three times. I then saw Mr. Currey come by and the prisoner close upon him, and a young man behind the prisoner. Just as the prosecutor came to Norfolk-street the prisoner quickened his pace, got close up to him, and got the pocket-book out of his pocket; his companion joined him in Norfolk-street, and they turned into Howard-street. I informed Mr. Currey, we pursued and overtook them in Howard-street. I collared the prisoner, and told him he had something that did not belong to him, he strongly denied it, I said it was useless, for I would swear that I saw him do it. I took him to the watch-house, and sent for a constable, he then took the pocket-book from under his waistcoat, put it on a table, fell on his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>

               <p>JAMES FLETCHER. I had the prisoner in custody; he escaped from me, and ran down Swan-yard, while I was pursuing him somebody got the pocket-book out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>MR. CURREY re-examined. The pocket-book produced by the prisoner at the watch-house, I am certain, was that which I had lost.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SHEPHERD. I am a constable. I was sent for, and found the prisoner in Mr. Fountain's custody-the box stood between them - He charged the prisoner with bringing it down from the garnet, the prisoner said he was told to fetch it; he said he went up, found the garret door open, and took the box.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SHEPHERD re-examined. The prisoner at first said he was sent to the Dog and Duck; afterwards he said it was the Black Horse.</p>

I asked him when he meant to fetch it away? He called at my lodgings a few days after, gave me a 1l. bank note, and told me to take the price of my coat out of it; he asked me to get it changed. I went to a publican, whom I knew, he said it was forged. I took it back to the prisoner, who remained at my lodgings. I called him at the door, but he did not come down; I went up, gave the note to him, and said, "How came you to send me with a bad note?" He said he did not know that it was bad, having just taken it of a Jew, and that a person was present who saw him take it. An officer came in, and took the note out of his hand.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 20th of July, I was at a public-house, in Tothil-street, Westminster; Crosby came and offered a note in payment for a glass of gin. Jones returned it to him, he went out with it - I and Betts followed him to his house, in New Pye-street - Betts was before me. I saw Betts take the note out of the prisoner's hand; we both marked it, this is it (looking at it).</p>

            . I was with Silvester. When Crosby got to the door he called somebody, no person came. He went up, I followed, and heard him say it was a bad one; I found the prisoner in the room, and took the note out of his hand. I took both of them into custody. I went to No. 10, St. George's-place, St. George's-row, Chelsea; but could find nobody of the name of Smith there.</p>

On the 14th of July, the prisoners, Reading and Sanders, and another person, came into my shop a little after two o'clock in the afternoon - They both asked to look at some blue prints; I showed them some - They objected to the pattern, and asked me if I had any more? I showed them others; they objected to them also, and asked me if I had any like a gown which Sanders had on? I said I had not. They said they were sorry they had given me so much trouble, and went out. I turned round to put some things in the window, and saw them standing before the window; they then came in again with another person, who is not in custody, and asked me if I sold stockings? I showed them some white cotton; they then asked for some black worsted. While I was doing that Gould came in, and asked me for a 3s. 6d. shawl, I showed her one - She objected to the pattern. I pointed to one in the window, she said she did not like it, and went away. I showed the other three some more black stockings - They bought none, and went away. In about ten minutes after, I missed thirteen yards of printed cotton, and went in pursuit of them across Finsbury-square. When I got to Mr. Cater's, his young man ran out - I went with him, and saw Reading and Sanders about one hundred and fifty yards off, with one or two others; when they saw us, they began to run, and dispersed in different directions.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090043"/>Wood took Sanders and Gould, and I took Reading. Mr. Cater took the print out of Gould's apron - I said it was mine; it has my private mark on it. I saw it in the window while they were looking in.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Gould go near enough to take it herself - A. No, Reading and Sanders were both near enough to take it-Reading was nearest to it. No person was serving in the shop but me. I did not see it taken; it is worth 26s. - it was some distance from the door. They must have been in the shop when they took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The prisoners were strangers to me. It was impossible to take it outside the shop. The window is inclosed in front about four or five feet high; they could not see it except through the window - They must have put their hands through the things which hung before it to get it. I went from behind the counter to get the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your family in the shop - A. No, my wife was in the back-parlour, but she could not see what was passing in the shop without standing up - She gave no alarm.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Cater. The prisoners, Reading and Sanders, came into the shop with another girl. In consequence of what had happened, I pursued them about five minutes after they left the shop. As soon as I got out I saw them coming out of the next linen-draper's in Chiswell-street, which belongs to Mr. Spurrier, and is about twenty doors from ours. When they got about ten doors farther they saw me; Gould and another woman was with them talking together. I got up to them, tapped Sanders on the shoulder, and told her I wanted her-the others immediately ran away. I gave her into Mr. Spurrier's charge, pursued and took Reading, and gave her in charge to Mr. Hodgett's; I then pursued Gould, and found her behind a watch-box in Moorfields, where she had concealed herself; she had something in her apron - I asked her what it was? I pulled her apron on one side, and saw it was a piece of print; she said it was given to her. I took her to Mr. Cater - She dropped his property in the shop. The prisoners were all searched in my presence. No money was found on either of them.</p>

On the 3d of July they came together to the office-the woman presented a share of a ticket which was drawn in the last lottery - She handed it across to me; I had at that time a number of whole tickets, which were arranged for entry for payment-No.3,824, was one of them; it was the uppermost of the pile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman near enough to have taken it - A. She was. After examining her share I returned it to her. She asked a question which I did not understand-her husband said it was of no consequence, as it was a blank. Almost immediately after they left the office I missed the ticket-no other person had been there. Six days afterwards, the male prisoner came to the office to inquire the fate of a ticket, and presented me with a piece of paper, with No. 3,824 of the 2nd Lottery for 1815. I told him the examination would be attended with an office-fee. He said he knew that, for he had been there before. On looking at the number I immediately recognized as like the number I had lost. I asked him if he had the ticket of that number? he said No. I communicated it to another clerk, and he fetched the secretary, who came out, and asked the prisoner if he had a ticket of that number? he said No; he had a sixteenth of it. We sent for an officer, who took him into custody - He said he was innocent. When he was going to be searched at the office, he said, to prevent trouble, he had got the ticket, and immediately produced it from his pocket. He said his wife found it in St. Martin's-lane. His wife was sent for - She came and said she did not know how she came by it; that she found it accidentally in her pocket as a piece of waste paper-that she picked up a piece of paper in St. Martin's-lane about a fortnight ago, and supposed that was it. I produce the ticket, and am certain it is that I lost-it tallies exactly with the cheque. I refer to the Benefit Book, by which it appears that it is a prize of 10l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were a very short time there. The man was not near enough to take it.</p>
               <p>Q. This being the uppermost ticket it might have slipped from the pile - A. It is possible. I returned him the paper she gave me-that would not resemble a whole ticket; it is the same size, but different ink. He could have learnt the fate of the ticket at any office in town, without coming to me, and they would have paid him the money for it. I do not know whether the woman can read or not.</p>

On 1st of July, I saw a crowd of people at Epps's shop on Holborn-bridge, the prosecutor and a gentleman came towards the crowd, the prisoner and another man followed them. The moment Mr. Vickridge came to the crowd and looked in at the window, the prisoner closed behind him, put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a silk handkerchief, put it under his coat, and turned to go away. I collared him and said, "What have you got," he trembled very much, opened his coat, and the handkerchief fell out. I picked it up and alarmed the prosecutor, he claimed it; the prisoner begged of him not to prosecute him.</p>

She asked him how I was, upon which I went into the shop; she gave me a 1l. bank note, I asked her name, she said it was Brooks, and she lived in Mary-street, Fitzroy-square; my son immediately said that he had taken a bad note in December last, and he believed she was the person who gave it to him. She seemed very much agitated at the time, and said she did not live in Mary-street, but in Mary's-place, and then afterwards said that she had left Mary's-place, and had gone to live at No. 11, George's-street, Fitzroy-square. We asked how long she had left Mary's-place, she said about twelve-months; that her husband was a painter and glazier, and had taken a little shop there. This was after she had said she lived in George-street. I gave her 12s. 11/4d. which was her change; she had bought tea, sugar, and soap. I marked the note before she left the shop (looking at one), this is it. I wrote Mrs. Brooks, No. 11, George-street, Fitzroy-square, on it. I desired my son to follow her. My house is rather more than half a mile from Fitzroy-square; it is at the corner of Upper Baker-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I put the note in my silver till; there was no other note there; I kept it by itself; I marked it as soon as I received it.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 21st of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop. I served her with one pound of sugar, a quarter of a pound of tea, and two ounces of pearl ashes. She then asked how my father was; he had not been ill. He came out of the parlour, hearing her ask for him. She offered him a 1l. bank note; he gave her the change before she gave him the note. She then handed it to him at the desk, he asked her name, she said it was Brooks, and that she lived in Mary-street, Fitzroy-square. I remembered taking a bad note some months before, of the same address, and told her I had taken a bad note of a woman so much like her, that I thought she was the woman. She changed colour, and appeared greatly agitated, and said she had formerly lived in Mary's-place, but now at No. 11, George-street, Fitzroy-square; that her husband was a painter, and kept<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090047"/>a shop there. She faultered in her speech very much, and said if my father did not like the note she would give him another; he said it was quite a new one, and declined returning it, saying he dare say it was as good as any other. She asked me to cut the soap, as it was too large to go into her basket. She broke it herself and put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. After she left, did you, by your father's desire, follow her - A. Yes. When she got out of the New-road, I lost sight of her; I ran as far as the New Church, but could not see her. I returned and saw her go down Alsop's-place. She kept looking back, to see if any one followed her. She then crossed the top of Upper Baker-street, which is on the other side of the New-road, looked up the street towards our house, and went down Park-place to Park-street. I do not think she saw me. She came into Gloucester-place and the New-road again, and looked down towards our house. After crossing the road she ran all the way to York-street, Gloucester-place, I there met Slade, he joined in the pursuit; he kept behind her, and I kept at a distance, fearing she would know me. We followed her into Crawford-street, and through different streets into Marylebone-lane; she went into the Cross Keys there, Slade followed her in; she came out in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q.When she went in, had she her basket - A. Yes; she brought it out again. We followed her into Oxford-street, where she went into a chemist's shop by the Green Man and Still, came out in about five minutes, and we followed her through several streets to the Seven Dials up Longacre. I left Slade to watch her, and ran to Bow-street, got an officer, and found her in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. The officer apprehended her there.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you leave your father's house - A. A quarter before four, it wanted about ten minutes to five when we took her. Her basket would weigh about six pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your object was to see if she lived where she said - A. Yes. She became agitated when I said she was like the woman who had passed a bad note to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. While she was going through the different streets, did she look back - A. Yes, as she ran down from the New-road to York-street, not after.</p>

            . I met White in Gloucester-place, and followed the prisoner through the different streets he has mentioned. I followed her into the Cross Keys, in Marylebone-lane; she had half a pint of beer there. She did not know me; she paid for it out of some silver and halfpence which were in her hand, and came out.</p>
               <p>JOHN TOWNSEND. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. I took her to the office. While we were waiting for the magistrate she appeared agitated. I asked what made her uneasy, and told her if she had given her right name and address she had no occasion to be afraid. She said she had given her right name, as she had given her maiden name. I said I suppose then you have been married. She said she had. Whether she mentioned her husband's name or not, I cannot say. She mentioned some name which I do not remember. She said she had been an unfortunate woman, and had received the note from a gentleman; that the gentleman walked that way with her towards Marylebone, where he left her. She saw the shop and bought the things. I found a good 1l. note on her, 11s. 6d. in silver, and 4d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You did not find silver on her sufficient to buy the things without changing - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a gentleman in Leicesterfields, who took me to a house, asked me to meet him again on Saturday, and gave me the note. I was going to the Edgeware-road, and went into the prosecutor's shop, where I had frequently been before. for grocery to take to my daughter. I turned towards the Edgeware-road, but thought it was too late to go, when I returned, and was making the best of my way to Blackfriars-road, where my daughter was apprenticed, and the officer took me. I told the prosecutor I had lived in Mary's-place, but now lived in George-street, Fitzroy-square. I did not give the right address, not wishing to disgrace my family, as I knew how I got the note. I did not know that I was being followed.</p>

On Sunday the 12th of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090048"/>to my shop in company with another woman, and bought a boy's corderoy dress, and a pair of shoes and stockings, which came to 1l. She gave me a 1l. note. I asked her name, she told me to put her husband's name on it, Conger, Golden-lane, but she did not know the number. She said her husband took the note for his pension. I wrote the name and address on it in her presence. She said it would not be long before she might return again, which she did in ten minutes, and bought a gown for 4s. 6d. and two pelisses which were to be 16s.; she paid 1s. deposit on them. She said she should prevail upon her husband to give her more money, or else he would spend all his pension, as she had left him at the public-house. She returned in a short time, inquired for the pelisses, and bought a man's blue jacket for 9s., she said it was for her husband. She owed me 15s., for the pelisse, she paid me a 1l. note and 4s.; I again asked the name and address, she said she had told me before; I wrote Conger, Golden-lane, on it. She was about a quarter of an hour each time with me, and tried one of the pelisses on. I have not the least doubt of her identity. (Looking at the two notes), They are the same she paid me.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see her again - A.Thirteen days after. I was cleaning the window, and my girl pointed her out to me. I followed her to the corner of Whitecross-street, and then lost her. Next day I saw her at the watch-house, and knew her to be the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. There was no other customer in the shop. She came in three times, all before twelve o'clock. I did not see her again till thirteen days after, when Hudson pointed her out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from following her, did you not ask Hudson if she was sure she was the woman - A. I did not. I have not the least doubt of her being the person. I followed her and looked in her face, and knew her; I did not take her, as I wanted to see where she lived. I lost her.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday you were told she was taken - A. Yes; Vann and Hudson came together. I wished to look at her again. I do not recollect saying I was not sure she was the person. She had a blue gown on, and a black bonnet with red ribbons.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Farrow. I remember the prisoner coming to his shop and buying the things; she came three times, I saw her each time. She gave the name of Conger, Golden-lane. Thirteen days after, I saw her passing the door, and pointed her out to my master as the woman who had laid out so much money. I did not know the notes were forged then. She was taken the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am fifteen years old. I was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When your master returned from following her, did he not say, are you sure she is the woman - A. He did. She was taken next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went to see her at the watch-house, did he not say he should go and see if he knew her again - A. Yes; he asked me again when he returned, if I was certain of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say before he went to the magistrate, "I am not certain of her, and I wish you to be certain before you speak to her" - A. Yes; I am certain myself that she is the woman; she had a bonnet on. I pointed her out to Vann, in Crown-court, Grubb-street. He took her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell your master that the same woman was taken who had passed the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MARY FARROW. On the 12th of July I saw the prisoner in my husband's shop twice; I was not there the third time. I am certain she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see her for a fortnight after - A. No. I never remember my husband saying he was not certain of her. We only had the door-shutter down on Sunday; the house is not very light.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VANN. I am a constable. I went with Hudson to look for the prisoner. She pointed her out to me in Crown-court, Grubb-street, I took her, and found she lived in Little Crown-court, which leads out of Crown-street. I went to her house and found a bonnet there. She was dressed in a blue gown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know a woman of the name of Driscol, she has been in custody, but is now at large. She lives in Farrow's neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she in size and figure something like the prisoner - A. I think her a little taller and more bulky.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find at the prisoner's lodging any of the things which Farrow sold her - A. No; I examined particularly for them, and found twenty-five duplicates, none of which related to them. I believe the prisoner has no son.</p>

I told him they were ready. He said he should feel obliged by my returning the money, as he was going out of business; I returned to him the same notes I had received. I thought it was his as he signed the letter-he gave me a receipt for it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of August, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prosecutor in Fleet-street, going towards Temple-bar, and saw the prisoners, standing together, leaning over a post at the corner of Salisbury-court; I had been following them before. They followed the prosecutor, when he passed them. Avery went behind him just at Water-lane, he put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket-Oliver was close behind him; Avery pulled the prosecutor's handkerchief about half way out, the prosecutor still went on; Oliver went up and took it quite out. I laid hold of Avery, and told the prosecutor to hold him while I fetched the other; I followed him through several courts with the handkerchief in his hand, it was red with white spots. He turned to the right into Bouverie-street, and Fleet-street again; crossed Fleet-street into another court and went into a house there, he shut the door, I opened it, but lost sight of him. I returned to Fleet-street, took Avery from the prosecutor and took him to the Compter. I returned, and saw Crouch in Fleet-street with Oliver, I had informed him of the circumstance; the handkerchief has never been found. I was on the opposite side to the prosecutor.</p>

            . I was captain's steward of the ship. On the 24th I locked Capt. Lamb's plate up in the cabin, part in a chest, and the remainder in a box, which I did not lock. Next day, about eleven o'clock, I took it down to the gun-room the two mates, Capt. Johnson, and a boy were on board, and about twelve revenue officers. The prisoner was there as a custom-house officer. I was going to put the plate under the batches, which had an excise and custom-house lock and our own lock. I put it in the steerage while the officers unlocked the hatches; they then called me down to open the store-room door; I left the box close by the hatch, and went down-it had a canwas cover three times round it. The prisoner staid near it, and an excise officer named Cass. In about three minutes I heard the plate rattle; I ran up the ladder immediately, and found the box moved on to a chest in a darker place; the canvas was forced in on one side to make room for a hand. I saw the prisoner's hand in, and drawing it out as fast as he could no person was near him. I asked him if he put his hand in that box? he said Yes. I took the tin funnel out of his hand, and said it belonged to the box he said, "Does it?" He being an officer, I did not like to take him. I took the box into the cabin, missed five table spoons and two forks, and told Capt. Johnson. I missed the prisoner in about ten minutes he returned on board in about twenty minutes. Capt. Johnson then asked him how he came by the funnel? he said at first that he did not know, then that he found it in his hand, and afterwards that he took it out of the box. He said he had taken no silver.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Will you swear that the prisoner went ashore - A. No; he said he had been ashore. He told Capt. Johnson that he put his hand in the box, as he had a right to search.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Arnold that you thought the prisoner was innocent - A. No; I said I hoped he would be found innocent, as he said he was.</p>

            . I am the ship's husband. Glover gave me information of the prisoner; in about ten minutes afterwards I saw him come on deck from the shore. I asked him how he came to have the funnel in his hand? he said he did not know. I told him that Glover had said that he caught his hand in the plate-box, and saw him take the funnel out - He said it was so, but he took nothing else. I took him into the cuddy, and told him in private that it was a very serious thing, and that I should be under the necessity of giving him in charge, but I would first give him an hour to produce the plate he said he was innocent. He was taken into custody, as he did not produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say he ever left the ship - A. He told me he had been ashore to get something to eat. I saw him with two plates.</p>

I returned two days after, and found the house had been robbed of 60l. or 70l. worth of property. I lost the articles stated in the indictment, which were worth above 6l. 10s. I received information, and went to Mr. Moser, the magistrate of Edmonton, about twelve or fourteen days after the robbery-the prisoner was there in custody. In consequence of what I heard, I looked at his feet, and found a pair of boots on him, which I knew to be mine; they were the same that were taken from my house - I examined them, and claimed them as mine. He said he had bought them, and had had them soled since.

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his wearing a pair of hoots shortly before he was taken up - A. I think I have seen him wearing them; he bought the stuff and made them himself. I am a ladies' shoemaker. I could not swear to my own work.</p>
               <p>MR. ARABIN. Q. Most of the trade make their own boots - A. Yes; I never knew him buy them I cut them out for him. He lived in Tash-street, Gray's Inn-lane. I think it was about the middle of June that I saw him wearing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was a week before he was taken up - A. I think it was full a week before.</p>

We missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live opposite to the prosecutor's I can see his house from my window; on the morning in question, about three o'clock, it was daylight, I saw two men walking backwards and forwards, and looking over into the prosecutor's premises; I came down stairs, and saw the prisoner attempting to hide a bundle in the shrubbery he came in a direction from the prosecuter's house. I did not see him come out of the house - I am sure he is the man, he was not ten yards from me; there was light enough to distinguish him. He returned towards the prosecutor's. I asked him what o'clock it was? he said it had just gone three. I went into my house to fetch my victuals, and when I came out I met him again in the road, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's, going to the same place where I had before seen him carrying the bundle. As I passed the prosecu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090053"/>tor's house I heard a noise, as if they were breaking doors or locks; I went on further, met Butterfield, and asked his assistance, we went down to where the prisoner had put the bundle - I took it out. As we returned towards the prosecutor's house I saw a man coming in a direction from the house, it is a corner house, there is a lane runs down by the side of it; the man went towards the village, we went in pursuit of him, and found two others in his company-the man who came out of the house was putting his shoes on-as soon as they saw us they all ran away as fast as they possibly could; one of them threw away a bundle. We took the prisoner nearly a mile from the house, he was one of the men - We had been pursuing him all the while, and had them in sight all the way after they came together - We took him in the middle of a field; he struck at me with a stick, and called to the other two for help, but they did not come to his assistance - He struck at us once or twice, and hit me on my neck. We took him back, and gave him in charge. We told him he had got the bundle at Catchpole's. He said he was not the person, but that he had been at Waltham-cross to seek for work. I left the bundle that I found in the shrubbery, and the one they threw away, with Mrs. Catchpole, in the presence of Cresse.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I saw Main. As we passed the house I heard a noise as if somebody was breaking locks. We went to the shrubbery, took the bundle out, and returned towards the house; I saw a man come out of the door, turn to the right, and go towards Winchmore-hill - We pursued him - He saw us coming, and turned back, I saw an iron hook in his hand. As we ran in the pursuit we saw three men, the man who came out of the house was one of them - They ran as fast as they could; one of them threw a bundle away; I saw a man named Tootey pick it up. We followed the men about a mile, and then the prisoner was taken; he defended himself with a stick, and called to the other men by name to help him - They ran away, and one of them shook the iron hook at us.

            . I am constable of Edmonton. I know the prosecutor's house, it is in that parish. I produce the bundle which Mr. Catchpole delivered to me. When the prisoner was taken, he denied the charge, said he was a shoemaker, and was coming from the country to look for work.</p>
               <p>PARTHENIA CRESSE re-examined. I saw the bundles delivered to my mistress. Here are three shirts, we lost seven, a table-cloth, a poplin gown, five napkins, and a piece of silk, all of which I know to be my master's property. We lost thirteen table-cloths. There was a great deal more property in the bundles than what is now produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from the country, where I had been looking for work, and met two men, who offered me 2s. 6d. to carry the bundles (which were as large again as those produced), to town; they told me to put one in the shrubbery and return, which I did; as I returned I saw two men outside the prosecutor's gate. I went away, and afterwards met the men again at the door - I thought it was not right, and went away; shortly after they overtook me, and we walked together. I was afterwards taken.</p>

I hired the prisoner's coach in Oxford-street, to take me home - He drove it - I was rather forward in liquor, but not drunk. I am certain I had eleven 1l. notes in my pocket when I got into the coach; I felt them safe when I got in; he drove me to the Green Man, at Ealing. I got out, and sat on the box with him at Notting-hill, as he did not know the way. We had a dispute with the turnpike man. I emptied my pockets to find the ticket, and my notes were then safe; the prisoner held a light while I shook the ticket out of the notes, I was then in the coach; when we got about a mile from there I got out, and sat on the box; he then drove to Ealing. We went into the Green Man, he demanded 1l. for his fare, I said it was too much. I put my hand into my pocket to pay him, I missed my money-this was before I sat down. I told him he had robbed me, he denied it. My brother was with me in the coach all the time; he insisted on being searched, and having the prisoner searched also, but the prisoner refused; there was a piece of work in the house, he then took two notes out and threw them on the table, the publican took them up, and asked if there were any marks on my notes. I said if they were mine Mr. Spencer's name was on them, in my hand-writing. They were produced, and they had that name on them; the people crowded round, he then threw another note on the table. The constable came and took him to the watch-house, without searching him-it was about eleven o'clock. Two notes were left in my pocket - He only took nine. The prisoner said he had had them in his possession for a fortnight.</p>

            . I keep the Green Man, at Ealing. On the 27th of August the prosecutor and his brother came to my house in a coach, the prisoner drove the coach; they disputed about the fare, and referred it to me; I said I thought it was right. Brady put his hand into his pocket to pay for it, and immediately charged the prisoner with robbing him. Brady's brother went into the backparlour to be searched, we found nothing on him. The prisoner refused to be searched, said he would shew all his money, and pulled out two 1l. notes and some silver, and put them on the table; Brady said, if they were his they had "H. Spencer, Drayton-green;" on them-which I found on both of them. I told the prisoner if he had any more, he had better give them up, or I must send for the constable; he threw another note on the table, which had the same name on it. I sent for a constable, who took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the prosecutor - A. He was rather intoxicated, but he knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say he found them on the floor of the coach - A. Yes.</p>

            . I keep the toll-gate, Duke-street, Westminster. On the 2d of July, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, Britton, drove two pigs through my gate, the prisoner, Newman, stood on the other side of the road; I knew they belonged to the prosecutor, but thought he might have sold them. In about a quarter of an hour I was asked about them, and went in pursuit; I overtook the prisoners in Charles-street, Westminster, and found Britton had got on a smock-frock, which Newman was wearing when I first saw them. I followed them to Whitehall chapel, Newman left Britton, and then joined him again. I took Newman in St. Martin's lane, and gave him in charge. I followed Britton, with the pigs, to Golden-square, asked him where he was driving them to, and told him they were not his. He said, "if they are your's, take the whip and drive them while I fetch the person who owns them." I took him to the office. Turner claimed the pigs.</p>

I got put into two watchhouses before this, but upon my telling them what I did it for they descharged me I attacked the prosecutor, but did not mean to do him any harm.

            . I am a clerk at the West India Docks. My brother was mate of the Isabella, which laid in the London Docks. On the 24th of July, I was on board, on a visit to my brother. The prisoner, Rowley, was a mariner on board. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw him coming on board from the quay, dressed in a smock frock, which he usually worked in. He went down to the forecastle, and came up again in about a quarter of an hour. He had changed his trowsers, and pulled off his smockfrock. He appeared very bulky. There was a ship between us and the shore. My brother stopped him as he was making his way towards the bows to get ashore, to avoid us; we took him into the cabin; my brother told him to strip; he appeared unwilling to do so. My brother stripped him, and took two pieces of printed cotton from him, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the officer came did he say any thing - A. He said he hoped my brother would look over it, and offered him all the money he had in his pocket, and said he would tell where the remaining pieces were, that they might be recovered. My brother refused, in consequence of a circumstance which happened before. The second mate brought in four pieces of cotton, which he said, in the prisoner's presence, that he found them under his bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell where the goods were - A. He said as my brother would not forgive him, he would not tell; he knew the worst of it, that he should be transported, and he did not care for that, for he would not stop long.</p>
               <p>ROWLEY. Q. Did you see your brother take the cotton from me - A. I did. The Isabella has sailed, and my brother with her.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 24th of July I was fetched on board the Isabella. I took Rowley in charge, and the cotton and the trunk, which contained only thirty-seven pieces. As I was taking Rowley to the office he asked me to let him go. After the examination, as I was taking him to the New Prison, he asked if it would do him any good to say where the prints were. I told him it would not, but he might do as he pleased about it. He asked me to order the coach (which we were in) to go up Rosemary-lane. I did so, and he pointed to the prisoner Chambers's door, and said, "there is where I have sold them," and that he had got 1l. a piece for them. He said he took the first piece into the parlour. Next day I went to Chambers's and found Burton at the door, he appeared to be the servant. I asked for Chambers, he came out of the back parlour; I told him I wished to speak with him; he appeared reluctant to speak to me, and wished to go to the side door; I told him I must go into the parlour, as I had a warrant to search his house. I opened the parlour door, and immediately saw nine pieces of printed cotton in a trunk. I found a piece in a drawer which appeared to have been cut off the other pieces. He said he did not buy them, but that his man, Burton, did. I brought Burton in, he said that his master's money had paid for them, and they were both present. I took them and the goods to the office. I found some gown pieces had been cut off the cotton, and told them of it; they said some had been sold, but they should be recovered again. They were recovered again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not Rowley say that the man who stole them had not been paid his wages - A. Yes; he said he carried them out of the Dock. He said he got at the trunk through the ballast port, which was left open at night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether the goods were taken at once or twenty different times, you cannot say - A. No.</p>

            . I was with Maidmant and searched. I went to Chambers's brother's wife and got two pieces of cotton, which correspond with the others. Maidment has spoken correctly. There was no linen in the shop. It is a clothes shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was there any women's apparel in the shop - A. I did not particularly notice.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WILLIAM SOMERS. I am a clerk at the Thames Police Office. I took down what the prisoners Chambers and Burton said on their examination. (reads)."Chambers said, the man brought six pieces to sell. I did not like to buy them, but Burton came in and said, he dare say they were got honestly, and agreed to give 1l. a piece for them. I paid him. We cut off pieces and sold them to different people." Burton said he was shopman to Chambers. He saw the man with him, and bought them for 1l. a piece, which Chambers agreed to give; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090057"/>said it was agreed; that he should have a third of the profits of what was sold, instead of his wages.</p>

               <p>ROWLEY'S Defence. My shipmate, Herrington, delivered me six pieces of printed cotton to sell, I sold them in Rosemary-lane, and gave him the money; as I was going to sell more for him I was taken.</p>

               <p>BURTON'S Defence. I am Chambers's servant. I was to have a third of what I got and sold myself. I bought them of the man, not knowing they were stolen.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Bedford-street, Strand. On the 31st of July, the prisoner, Grubb, came to my shop with a paper, which had the title of the book written on it, and asked me if I would buy it. From his manner I suspected it was stolen. In order to get it into my hands, I said if it was cheap I would. He went away, and joined the prisoner, Clark, at the corner of the street. After some conversation, he left him for about ten minutes, and then returned to him again, with the book under his arm. After some conversation with him he came over to me, and asked 3l. for the book. He said a gentleman had left it him for a debt of 3l. I told him if he would give me his address, and I found it was right I would buy it. He took me then to Of-alley, and recommended me to a woman there for his character. She said she had known him a long time-Grubb was present. I asked her if she knew any thing of him that would induce me to buy a book which I thought came out of a nobleman's library? she said it was all right, which strengthened my suspicions. Not knowing that I had authority to detain him, I told him to call next day, and I would give him the money-Clark was at the corner of the street all the time. Grubb called next day, and was taken into custody. While he was in the officer's custody Clark passed him. When he saw Grubb in custody he ran away. The book is worth seven or eight guineas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Grubb said he had it to sell for Clark.</p>

On the 4th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty, and observed three men loitering about, which excited my suspicion; I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them or not. I omitted calling the hour in consequence of it. About two o'clock I went towards the prosecutor's house, and heard a crack like the wrenching of a shutter or pane of glass. I went closer, to hear more distinctly. When I came to No. 12, which is opposite the prosecutor's, I heard glass breaking. I attempted to get over the rails into the area-my foot slipped, which made an alarm. The prisoner came up out of the area, up to the iron gate where I stood, and attempted to get over. I struck at him with my stick - He fell back into the fore-court; I attempted to get over after him, but found he was clambering over the next wall. I returned back, and kept in front of the area outside, on the footpath. He got over the wall from No. 12 to No. 18. He told me if I got over the railings he would murder me - I told him I would take the chance of that; I secured him. He struck at me with an iron crow. He at first made a stab at me with the sharp end, then turned it, and made two blows at me with the other end - I caught it in my hand, and took it from him. I found a dark lanthorn, a piece of wax candle, six skeleton keys, a phosphorus-box, and an open knife on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go back to examine Mr. Phillimore's house - A. Yes. I found the servants up, and a tub (with the bottom uppermost) against the window, for a person to stand on. A pane of glass was broken, and the sash of the window down. The inside shutter was partly open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you would have shot me if you had had a pistol - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Phillimore, he keeps the house. I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock on the night stated in the indictment, after fastening the house. I left the window-sash fastened down with a catch, and the inside shutter closed, and secured with an iron bar across (the shutters fold). After the alarm was given, I found one of the leaves of the shutter broken, and falling down, it hung by one hinge; the glass of the window was broken sufficient for a man to put his hand through-it was in the middle of the bottom frame.</p>
               <p>Q. When a man got his arm in, could he get at the fastenings, so as to get the window down - A. Yes; he could not have got the window down without putting his hand in; he could then undo the fastening, and pull the window down; the shutter was then forced open, the top hinge broken, and the shutter hanging by the bottom hinge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Could not the fastening be undone with an instrument as well as with a man's hand - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in a public-house in Lei<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090059"/>cester-fields. Two men asked me why I was so low in spirits? I told them that I was poor and had no friends. They said they were servants to a gentleman at Kensington. One of them said he would give me some clothes-and proposed that I should go with them, and have them in the morning - I went. One of them asked me to let down the window and let him in. I went over with them, they began opening the window. I began to think I had done wrong, and atttempted to escape. The shutter would not open, and they left it. I picked up the crow, as I was determined to fight to get away. I did not go there to commit any offence.</p>

On the 15th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner asked me to let him go into the yard to look at the water-pipe, which he did; he then went into the kitchen, and asked me for a piece of string, to measure the pipe under the fire-place - I gave him some. He said he was going to take up that, and put a new one down - He pretended to be a plumber. He left, and said he would come at one o'clock to do it. He went into the kitchen, and took a brick from the fire-place with a hammer which I lent him. I said he should have brought his tools with him; he said he would fetch his mate, who was just round the corner. He returned after that, and told me to move a chest; while I was doing it, I turned towards the fire-place; the young man whom he brought in, was assisting me - He let go, and told me to move it farther round-both ran up stairs. I immediately missed the watch from the fire-place, and have never seen it since. I saw the prisoner on the Friday following - I am sure he is the man. I gave him in charge.</p>

He could not open it without a drop latch-key. I saw one found in the boat by the river-side, where he was stopped, and suspected to have thrown something over. I tried it to the door, it opened it.

Windall alarmed me; I ran out of the back parlour, and overtook the prisoner and another woman, who had a basket, the prisoner had a bundle under her shawl, I insisted on seeing what was in it, she gave it to me, saying she had just found it. I found the articles stated in the indictment in it.</p>

            . On the 1st of August I was at my window, which is opposite to the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner, and a man, at his window. The man drew his righ thand from the window, and gave the prisoner something white - They went away together. I went over and told Mr. Hunter. I am sure she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know her before. I did not see her face, but am positive she is the woman.</p>

On the 31st of August, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was going up the court; there was a crowd at the bottom of the court; I asked what was the matter; the people said the prisoner was beating his daughter. I said he ought to be ashamed of himself, and returned to my own door. Soon after I heard the women say, he would murder her. I went and stood there some time. The prisoner came out. I was standing in the next yard, which is separated by open palings. He did not speak. I stood there, talking to the women, and saying he ought to be ashamed of himself for using his daughter so, as she had got a young child with her. He said I had no business to trouble my head about it. He went to his gate, held it in his hand, and said to me, 'Come here; I am your man; I will do your business for you." I remained in the next yard. Several words passed between us. I stood within two feet and a half of the rails, in the next yard. He got a cutlass, and made a stab at me through the rails, which entered my thigh about three-quarters of an inch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you strike at him - A. No; I immediately jumped over the rails, he then made another cut at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing when he stabbed you - A. Only that he would do my business for me; a man behind prevented the second stab from touching me, by striking his hand with a stick, I caught hold of the cutlass, we struggled together and both fell down. I got it from him, went into the yard, and the watchman took me into custody, seeing the cutlass in my hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The prisoner was in his own house - A. Yes; I was in the next garden, several people were round. I was sober enough to know what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say let us go and pull the old fellow's tongue out - A. No; I never attempted to go into his yard before he stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to the magistrate and complained of an assault - A. Yes; I did not feel the stab at the moment.</p>

I am the prisoner's daughter, my husband is at sea, my father was scolding me - He used no violence to me; Black's bad language disturbed us, he called my father several bad names; I had not called for any assistance or made my father any answer. I passed my father, who was on the threshold of his own door, and went to Black and begged of him to have nothing to do with the family concerns, but to go home; he was in liquor. He said he would go and get half a pint of beer, and forced himself from me and his wife who were holding him. He went into the next yard and said he was determined to pull my father out of his house, and called him bad names. My brother begged of him to go home; my father said if any man entered his premises he would knock him down. Black immediately jumped over the pails and collared my father, my father had not made a blow at him till then; he then made two blows at him with the cutlass, which struck the stones, and pushed him off. Black ran up and struggled with him again, Athel knocked my father down. Black got the sword from him; in the struggle, I got cut, I felt it immediately.</p>

On the 24th of August, about eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner called me up, I found him standing in the street without his coat - He occasionally worked for me; he said he had been robbed of his coat, and treated very bad, at a public-house. I let him in to sleep in my shop, and lent him my coat to cover himself. In the morning, between six and seven o'clock, I heard him unlock the door, and go back again; I heard the parchments rattle; he went down stairs gently and did not return. I got up, and missed sixty skins of parchment, and my coat. About eight o'clock, I saw him playing at skettles at the Coach and Horses; I told him I would take him before a magistrate if he did not say what he had done with the parchment. He said he had left it with a friend in Smithfield; as we were going there, he attempted to escape. He then took me to his mother's, at Stepney, and asked her to lend him 10s. to get it from where he had left it; he tried again to escape. I gave him in charge.</p>

On the 19th of August, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for unlf a yard of cotton, at 1s. 6d. a yard, I served him. He then asked to see some silk handkerchiefs. I went to the window to get some, when I returned I observed the corner of the shawl between his coat and waistcoat, I went to the back-shop, and told Mr. Williams, I then went back and told the prisoner I had no handkerchiefs that would suit him. He was going to leave the shop, I followed him to the door, stopped him, and took the shawl from him. It was on the counter, close to him. I did not see him take it; this is it (producing it). I know it to be my master's.</p>

One had a bag, with part of the poultry in it, and the other had the remainder in his hands, tied together, and all killed. When they saw me they threw it down. and ran through a hedge into a wheat-field. I pursued, and took Parker in the middle of the field.

I missed a watch from the window where I worked, and asked Jones what he had done with the watch? he said, "Search me; I know nothing of it." Mason said "I know nothing of Jones; he was in the shop before I came in, and if he has got it he must have taken it." The officer came to the door, I called him in-Jones told him to search him, which he did, and found the watch on him. He did not then deny taking it.

About nine o'clock in the evening, I was at the two pair front window, and saw Chapman go out and join a man about the same size as himself; they walked away together, and returned in about a quarter of an hour. Chapman went in, and came out and gave him something, he then returned to the shop, and the prisoner walked away. About eleven o'clock there was a gentle knock at the door, my father went down, I looked out of the window and saw the prisoner go from the door, with a roll of cloth under his arm.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I was at home when the prisoner brought the linen. I told him my mother was gone to look for him; he went out. About nine o'clock at night, I met him in the Kingsland-road, and told him my mother wanted him; he said he knew very well what it was for, and would not come. I followed him to Mr. Tipple's workhouse, where he was taken.</p>

I ran after him, and saw the prisoner turn up White Lion-street, with the two jackets under his arm. I stopped him; he resisted very much, and refused to go back with me - He attempted to strike me. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I was coming out of the Park and saw Harley's child by Lady Dacre's almshouses, at the top of York-street, with the a basket in her hand. I saw the prisoners, Williams and Murphy, go up and speak to her, they took the basket from her, and went down York-street, it was between ten and eleven o'clock. I came up again and saw her crying; she said the basket of linen was taken from her; I took her home to her mother's. We then went to the prisoners lodgings and found them there, and the basket. I said they were the persons that I saw take the basket from the girl, they said nothing. I am certain it was the same basket, as I noticed it being sewed with white thread.</p>

I asked them how they could rob a little child. Williams said it was not her but Murphy; the basket was sewed with white thread.

I went in, told her it was mine, and that it had been stolen the morning before. She told me to go about my business, for I should not have it; she said she had bought it on Saturday, for sixpence-it was not stolen until Sunday. I offered her sixpence to return it - She refused. About half an hour after I saw the prisoner Whitty, and gave him in charge. I asked him where he sold it? he took me to Hibbard's. I again claimed it, but she would not return it. It is worth 2s.</p>

On the 3d of September, about eight o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in the Bayswater-road, about a mile and a half from Tyburn turnpike, with three other persons; I followed them all the way to Tyburn, and then asked the prisoner if the hog was for sale? he said, No; and that he was going to take it to his master's, who was a cowkeeper, at Islington - He would not tell his name; he said he brought it from Acton, but he could not tell who from. I followed him to St. George's-market; he was driving the hog, the others were with him. I ran towards the watch-house to get assistance, and saw him turn down Wigmore-street. I met two watchmen, and asked them to assist, which they refused. The serjeant of the watch-house went with me, and took the prisoner and hog, the others ran away. The prisoner said none of them were with him when he got the hog.</p>

            , and have been married four years. I lived in the service of Mrs. Daniels, Devonshire-place, Portland-place. I left her service on the morning of the 8th of August - I left my clothes in the coachman's loft until I could remove them. I left the coachman's wife about nine o'clock in the evening, to go to Marylebone-street for some things I had bought. I had a large bundle of clothes, and some potatoes in my cloak. When I got into Upper Wimpole-street, the prisoner came up to me, and said, "It is a pity so slender a figure as you should be so heavily loaded." I made no reply. I had no acquaintance with him. He then said, "Madam, allow me to treat you with a coach?" I said, "I do not want you nor your coach either." He then said, "Don't be frightened - I am a gentleman of unlimited fortune, and do not wish to set a foot in the coach with you." I told him I would take care that he did not. I had then got to the end of Weymouth-street. I was afraid to cross the end of Portland-place, it being so wide, and he kept so close to me. I had 16s. in my pocket, and a pocketbook, which contained four 1l. notes, a brooch, and some memorandums.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Portland-place, what did you do - A. I turned back, and wanted to cross over to No 38, Weymouth-street, where I was going to sleep, but the prisoner took hold of my arm, and pulled me down as far as Weymouth-mews; he then forced a purse into my hand, and told me there was a 20l. note and a sovereign in it, if I would go into the mews with him for a few minutes, which I peremptorily refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he, upon that, put a very indecent question to you - A. He did. I gave him an answer which led him to suppose that all proposals to me were useless. He then took hold of me in a very indelicate manner, and I left his other hand take up my gown, and feel about my right-hand pocket. He saw somebody coming up, let me go, and ran away. I felt in my right-hand pocket, and missed my pocket-book. I was much alarmed - I called out the moment he left me; I was afraid to call out before. He was stopped immediately, and never was out of my sight. I am certain he is the man. When he got to the watchhouse he wanted to make it up, which I refused. I saw my pocket-book and money at the office. My husband is in Mr. Cooper's service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was it a dark night - A. Yes. I was going to fetch some things which I had bought in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not take the things then - A. Business prevented me. I had to call about a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you walk together arm-in-arm - A. Not far; I could see no watchman, and was afraid to call out.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. While he was walking with you, was his manner decent and eivil - A. Yes. When we got to the mews he was indecent.</p>

            . I am a stable-keeper at Beaumont's-mews, Marylebone. I was coming up Wimpole-street, and heard the cry of "Stop thief!" in Weymouth-street. I looked round, and saw the prisoner coming across Wimpole-street, towards the same side where I was. He ran towards me as fast as he could. I turned round to stop him; he crossed over again. I ran after him, and pushed him against the rails of No. 57, and stopped him. He turned round and asked me what I stopped him for, putting his hands behind him, near the iron rails. I told him there was an alarm, and seeing him run I stopped him. In a moment the prosecutrix came up, and said the prisoner had robbed her of her pocket-book. I gave him in charge of two watchmen, who took him to the watch-house. I went to No. 57, and asked the footman to look in the area, he went down, and I saw him pick up a purse. I desired him to see what was in it. He opened it, and found some pieces of blank paper, like bank notes, and a piece of coin. I went to the watch-house and asked the prosecutrix to describe her pocket-book. She said there was four 1l. notes, and a brooch in it. The prisoner claimed the purse, and said he would pay her any compliment to make it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There are very few shops in the neighbourhood. It is a very dull place. He crossed over just by No. 48.</p>

I sprung my rattle. Liddard stopped him. I took him to the watch-house. The prosecutrix said he had robbed her of her pocket-book. He said he had not got it, and desired me to search him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They separated quickly. As soon as he got into the middle of the street, she cried out. He had not left her half a minute, he then ran very fast.</p>

We went round another way, and came into the Carlisle Arms, where we could see the door; in about an hour the two prisoners passed us and knocked at the door; they were answered from the window by Bruce's wife, and both immediately left the house, and came down towards us, as soon as they saw us they ran in different directions. Cooper took Bruce, and I took Neil. We took them to the public-house; and then went back to No. 23, Carlisle-place, and found a hat in the back parlour, with Cole's name in it. We found a parcel of matches in Neil's pocket.</p>

            . I live at Stangate, and am apprenticed to my father, who is a waterman. On the 6th of August, about two o'clock in the morning, I returned from Vauxhall. Neil hired me on the Surry side of Westminster-bridge to take him to the Gravesend boat, which I did, and put him on board the King George packet at half-past four o'clock in the morning. I saw him sail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you hear Neil, at his examination, say, he went to Gravesend by the coach - A. No.</p>

On the 27th of June, about half past six in the morning, the prisoner came and asked if I bought harness; I said I did; he produced the articles stated in the indictment. I asked him where he brought them from; he said his master was at the Bull and Mouth, and had sent him to sell them, as he was going out of town, and he was to take him the money. He wanted 2l. for them, and said he had lived nearly three years with his master. I told him to call again. I got a constable ready, who took him when he came. He left the things with me.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Union court, Chicksand-street. On the 4th of August, I saw the prosecutor coming along Brick-lane, he appeared to be intoxicated. The prisoner had hold of one arm, and another woman the other. I saw the other woman lean over the prosecutor's shoulder, and whisper to the prisoner, which excited my suspicion. I saw the other woman put her hand into his pocket-nothing was taken at that time. They forced him down Hanover-court; I went to the end of the court, and saw the prisoner pull his pocketbook out. I said, "You shall not rob the man while I am here." Two men came up immediately, and wanted to know what business it was of mine? and asked me why I wanted to hinder the girls from getting a shilling? They kept before me. The prisoner and the other woman rushed out-the men prevented my following her. I told Hardy, and we both followed her - She got away. One of the gang threw half a brick at me. Next day the prisoner was taken. I am sure she is the woman - I knew her before.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3d of August, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner in White Lion-street, with a bundle on his shoulder; I followed him to Great Prescot-street, and stopped him-the parcel was tied up very carelessly; I asked him what he had there? he said what was that to me; I said I was an officer, and insisted on knowing; he hesitated, and then said he bought it of a poor man, coming along; that he himself was out of employ, and he bought it to make a few shillings of. I found it was soap and pepper, and took him to the watch-house. Next morning he said he found it under the wall of the London Docks.</p>

I returned from work about half-past eleven o'clock, and found my husband asleep on the step; I went up stairs, made my bed, and then went down to wake him; I found his clothes unbuttoned, and the prisoner sitting by his side. I told him he had got my husband's watch - He denied it. I gave him in charge. The watch has never been found.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JACKSON. I am a watchman. At half-past eleven o'clock on the night of the 14th of July, I saw the prisoner and another man (not the prosecutor) on the steps, of No. 36, opposite the prosecutor's door, pretending to be asleep. As I came down the other side I met the other man running from the prosecutor. I found the prosecutor's breeches unbuttoned, he missed his watch. I took the prisoner to the watch-house; I found nothing on him.</p>

I left the company, and went and sat on the other side of the tap-room. I had not sat there above a minute, before the prisoner came over and sat on my left side, then shifted to my right-and said, "Well old man, will you give me a drop of beer;" I said, "I have none to give away." He took up the pot and drank, and then knocked my pipe out of my mouth; as I stooped down to look for it, I found his hand in my pocket - He said he would light me to find my pipe. While he was looking down, the notes fell out of his hand-he picked them up, and went out immediately. I could not stop him; I am sure his hand was in my pocket.

I followed them, and sprung my rattle-each of them threw away a live fowl, they were stopped; another person caught the fowls. I am sure the prisoners are the boys; Maroney was never out of my sight; another boy was with them, who got away.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter after four o'clock in the morning, I was in Park-lane, under the Duke of Gordon's wall, and heard somebody moving; I looked up and saw the prisoner - I asked who was there? he made no reply, but went away whistling in a low tone. I sprung my rattle, the patrol came to my assistance; he got into Green-street, and concealed himself behind a doorpost. I took the prisoner and put him in the watch-house. I returned to the premises, and saw the lead cut off, but could not find it; it was taken off the roof of the water-closet, and put inside, rolled up in an apron. The prisoner was just by the water-closet-door, and looking over the wall when I saw him. I am sure he is the man.</p>

I got up, another man held me and threw me in the mud, and said it was no use running as he was gone before now. I got up, and called"Stop thief!" the watchman took the prisoner. I am sure he is the man; the articles, stated in the indictment were in the bundle.</p>

I desired him to go away; he put his hand to his hat, as if he wished to speak; I went to him; he asked if I had a spelling-book; I told him I had not; he asked if I should have one by Saturday; I said we might, and he went away. About five minutes afterwards, a boy came and asked if I had lost a telescope; I missed one from the bench in the fore-court, close to the books. I went to the public-house and found the prisoners in custody. The constable produced the telescope. There is no railing to the fore-court.</p>

            . I am constable of Pancras. I saw the prisoners at Battle-bridge, about half past four o'clock. I observed Jones point to the prosecutor's fore-court to Hunter, who immediately went up. Jones stood at the corner of the wall; Hunter returned, and slipped something under Jones's apron. They separated. I told Goodhall to follow Jones. I followed Hunter, took him about thirty yards off, and asked what business he had up the yard; he made no answer. Goodhall brought Jones back. I searched him, and found the telescope in his breeches. Jones could not be seen in the shop.</p>

I had two half-crowns, three shillings, and a penny-piece in my waistcoat-pocket. I had sent home for some money to pay the fine. The prisoners were confined in the same place with me. I was sober. I went to sleep about two o'clock in the afternoon, as I had been out all night with my master's chaise. I felt somebody touch my waistcoat while I was asleep, and asked what it was; Blyghton, who was next to me, said it was a dog. I went to sleep again; when I awoke I found my pocket turned inside out, and missed my money. There was another man in the watch-house. I said I had lost two half-crowns and a penny, and one of the three must have them. The man produced his money. The officer found a half-crown in each of the prisoner's mouths.</p>

We met the prisoners - I went to some stones by the church-yard for a necessary purpose. I fell over one of the stones; while I was down, the prisoners picked my pocket of my watch and money. I called out for help. Rooks came and asked me what was the matter? the prisoners said that two men had just left me. I am certain no person was near me but the prisoners. I had not been in company with any person before, and am certain my watch and purse were in my pocket. The prisoners were taken to the Temple-tap.

            . I am Tournay's shipmate. I was in his company from six o'clock; we were at two public-houses - He was rather intoxicated, I was quite sober. When we got by the Temple-tap, we met four women; one of our shipmates, who was with us, went in with one of them, but not with the prisoners; Tournay and I waited at the door for him-the prisoners asked us to treat them. I went in and treated them, Tournay did not go in. When I came out Tournay went over to the stones - He was gone sometime. The prisoners asked me what I was waiting for? I said I was waiting for him, and told them where he was; they went over to him. In a few minutes he called for help, and I went over. They told me two men had just run away from him. I am certain no other person went to him - I had him in sight all the while - He missed his watch and purse. I took the prisoners into a public-house, under the pretence of treating them. I saw a watchman, and told him to come in, which he did. I then told them they must be searched. Allen pretended to tie up her stocking - I saw her take the watch, and put it under the seat - I gave her in charge. The purse was not found.</p>

I turned round, and saw the prisoner with my pocket-book in his hand. I charged him with taking it, which he denied. I took him into a shop, and sent for a constable. I am certain he is the man. When I was in the shop I said I saw it in his hand - He then took another pocket-book out of his pocket, quite different from mine, and said that was the one I had seen, but it was not. While we were in the shop a footman brought my pocket-book in, and said he picked it up. There was a 1l. note in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was at the close of the poll. There was not half a dozen persons at the window. I am certain it was my book that I saw in the prisoner's hand. Mine was red morocco-the one he produced was brown russia.</p>

The prisoner came into possession of it at the latter end of last year, and lived in it-my property remained there, locked up in two rooms; I had the keys. I had agreed to pay him 4s. per week for the rooms. I lived at Westminster. In consequence of information, I applied at Marlborough-street office on the 13th of August, got an officer, and went and found the house empty, no person was there, nor any furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find your two rooms - A. The door of the outer room was opened, and the articles stated in the indictment gone - They were all safe on the 14th of June, when I saw the prisoner, and paid him the rent; I have never found any of it. About the 17th of August the prisoner was apprehended. My property was worth above 50l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Between the 14th of June and the 13th of August, you do not know how the property might have gone away - A. No; I belive he let part of the house out.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and belong to Bow-street. On the 12th of August, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I was returning home to Little Chelsea, I saw the prisoner in company with a man, and listened to their conversation; she went towards the turnpike, before she got there she tried the gate of a house, but could not open it. She went to the toll-house, and said, "Halloo, tollman, have you got any porter?" He made no answer; she then went on. I passed her, stood at the corner, and heard her say, if you will give me two-pence I will get some porter, I have got the rest; they are up at the Princess of Wales, which is about two hundred yards off. Hearing no answer, I came back, and stood where I could see her and the prosecutor; she put her hand into his apron pocket, and took something out; she made use of a very indecent expression, and said, I shall go and get the porter, and immediately come to the door. I took her, and said she had been robbing the man; she said she had not. He awoke while I was struggling with her. I found five shillings, two sixpences, and 81/2d. in copper, an old halfpenny, and a pocket piece, in her hand. The man said he could swear to the old halfpenny, the pocket-piece, and a crooked halfpenny.</p>

I went in and awoke the prosecutor, I could only hear halfpence rattle in his apron, I could hear no silver rattle-this was at ten o'clock at night; he could not have taken 5s. from that time until one o'clock. Next morning he told me he had lost 5s. in copper; I said I had taken it over to my lodgings to take care of - He was very drunk.</p>

            . I am beadle of Whitechapel. On the 31st of August, about eleven o'clock at night the prosecutor came to the watch-house, I went with him to Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields; as soon as we got to the corner we heard the cry of watch; I immediately ran down the street, and saw the prisoner in custody of another man, who charged him with stealing the butter. I took him into the Red Lion, public-house, searched him, and found the key of a street-door on him, which the prosecutor said would open his warehouse. I took him to Lemon-street. I asked him where he lived, he said over the water, but he could not exactly say where; I asked where he slept the night before? he said on this side of the water. I put him in the watch-house. I got information of the property, and went to Duke's Head-court, Chamber-street, knocked at the door twice, a female asked who was there? I asked who lived there, she said Wheelhouse. I said I wanted to speak to her, as her brother was in trouble; she refused, saying she was in bed. I tried the key, it opened the door; I found his mother there, also two casks of butter, one of honey, and two sacks of hams, containing twenty-six, which I took to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOLMES. I am a bootmaker, and live at No. 28, Chamber-street. I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner coming towards me on the left-hand side, and three or four others on the right. I saw the prisoner speak to one man, who was loaded; one of them said to the prisoner go on; the prisoner crossed the street, and ran-each of them went on; the last man let a tub of butter fall, it struck me on my right arm. He went away, leaving it in the kennel. They were all loaded, except the prisoner. The landlord took the butter into my lodgings, and the prosecutor claimed it. I said I knew one of the party; the prisoner passed the door at the time, I said here is the man that I saw speak to the persons who were loaded. My landlord asked him if he knew any thing of the butter? he said No. I went for Plunkett, returned, and found the prisoner in the custody of my landlord. When I saw the prisoner run he went down Duke's Headcourt; I did not see the others go down the court. About an hour after I found the property there.</p>

            . I keep the Fountain, public-house, opposite the prosecutor's. On the 30th of June, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man pass the prosecutor's door about three yards, and look to see if any body was in the shop; they then returned-the prisoner laid hold of the dress, tore it down with great violence, and gave it to the other man, who put it under his Guernsey-frock; both ran away together. I run over and alarmed the prosecutor, who pursued and brought the prisoner back; the other got away. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>MR. RICHARD HODGSON. I am in partnership with Christopher Burrows, we live in Little Eastcheap. On the 8th of August the prisoner called at our house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, desired me to send half a dozon of wine so the Strand. I said we did not sell less than a dozen - He then ordered a dozen, and said he would send the money by the porter. I asked him his name? he said it did not signify. I gave Haines (my porter), the wine to take with him, and told him not to deliver it without the money-he returned without either the wine or the money.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's porter. I went to carry the wine with the prisoner. When we got to Devereux-court, he said I must not go into the house, as he was a dealer in wine, and they would ask me where I brought it from. He took it from me with the basket, and went into the Sun public-house. He gave me 6d., told me to get a pint of beer, and wait five or ten minutes, and he would bring me the money, bottles, and basket - He never returned. I waited a long time, and then went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090088"/>into the house - He was gone. I found there was a passage through the house into Essex-street. I heard nothing of him till the 13th of August, when he was taken. I would not have delivered the wine without the money, if I had known he meant to take it away. I am certain he did not come out of the front door.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in the pit of the theatre, it being a benefit night, and saw the prisoner, and several others in his company, feeling people's pockets. Some person intimated that he suspected the prisoner. I laid hold of him, searched him, and found a handkerchief concealed in his breeches, and one which the prosecutor claimed, in his hat. He said they were both his own, and that he bought the one found in his hat in Liquorpond-street of a boy for 2s., just before he came to the theatre that evening. I put him in the watchhouse. I saw the prosecutor that evening, and showed him both the handkerchiefs and my own-he selected his own from them.</p>

On the 25th of July, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners in the kitchen-passage, which communicates with the area. They were dressed like sweeps, and had a black sack with them. They ran away when they saw me, leaving the sack on the area steps. I pursued, but lost sight of them. A soldier stopped them. I found two pair of my master's sheets in the sack, which I had put in the housekeeper's room just before.</p>

On the 2d of September, about half past nine at o'clock night, my children went up to bed. Suspecting the prisoner, I watched her, and saw her leave her room and go into my bed-room, where my money was. She had no business there. My little girl came down and went up again, I followed her half way up the stairs, and my little boy gave me some information. I had told him to watch; I then went into my room, and missed two papers of halfpence which had been safe half an hour before. I immediately went into the prisoner's room, and told her I was sorry to accuse her, but I missed two 5s. papers of copper, and nobody but her and my children had been in the room. She strongly denied it. I said I would send for an officer. She then gave me 10s. worth, and said my son gave them to her. She said she had two more papers, which her husband had given her. He was sitting in the room. He told her she must have spent all the money he gave her. I asked her to show them to me, which she did. I told her I could swear to them, and that she had taken all four that evening. I had marked them with a cross. She then said my niece gave them to her.</p>

             MAHONY. I lodge opposite the prosecutor. I saw the prisoners and another boy standing at the corner of Church-lane, about one o'clock in the morning; when they saw me, they went away. I was attending a sick person. Between two and three o'clock I saw them again. Jones went into the prosecutor's passage, the door was open; I saw the pigs come out, he let them out of the yard. Crouch and the other man waited at the door, Jones and the other man each carried a pig, Crouch went away with them. I called out "Stop those young men with the pigs." I was at the door at the time; I had gone out to get some cloves. The watchman was at the top of the street, he did not hear me. I saw the prisoners next day at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am a patrol of St. Giles's. At four o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoners and another man going up High-street, with two black and white pigs. I knew them before, and did not stop them. On Sunday night I saw Crouch and took him into custody. I asked him if he hurt himself much with the pigs; he said no, not much. I had seen him fall, and the other fell over him, He said he only drove the pigs out for a bit of lark, and he did not know what became of them.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On Sunday morning, about ten minutes past four o'clock, I saw the prisoners, and another man dressed like a butcher, driving two pigs. The prisoners went after the pigs, as they went a contrary way. Jones ran against Crouch and pushed him down, as he ran after the pigs. I went up and asked what was the matter; Jones said the pigs had broken out of a pound; that Crouch knew the owner, and was driving them home. Crouch made no answer; he appeared hurt. I did not suspect him. The pigs were black and white. I saw Jones in Dyot-street, at ten o'clock that night, and took him. He denied the charge.</p>

As soon as I got into the room she put her hand into my pocket, took my money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090091"/>out, and ran off with it. The prisoner Haswell and three others were in the room at the time. There was no light, and I was afraid to make any noise. As soon as it was daylight he took me down stairs, and told me to go away. I asked him for my rule, he went up stairs, returned, and said it was not there. I saw it in his bosom, and went for a watchman; he followed, and gave it to me. I gave him in charge. I found Hopkins under the bed, and gave her in charge also. I was not with her a moment.</p>

He asked me what I wanted, and let his sack fall on my hand, which broke my hold; he ran up the street, I followed, several watchmen tried to stop him, but he passed them, I overtook him in Duck-lane, the watchman had stopped him.

I was at my window, up two-pair of stairs; I saw Gower take the handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket and throw it to Bruce, who tucked it into his waistcoat. I ran down, went out, and found them with the other man in Drury-lane. I took the prisoners into custody; the other man got away. I found the handkerchief in Bruce's waistcoat; I found another in Bruce's hat, and two others in his pocket. Somebody on the opposite side called to them to resist.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. They were on the opposite side to me.</p>

I examined my drawers, and missed these things; I asked her about them, she said they were being mangled. I had got my things from the mangler's the Friday before. I told her to fetch them; she returned, saying, I should have them in half an hour. I went to the mangler's; in consequence of what I heard I examined, and missed all the property stated in the indictment. I got an officer, and the prisoner gave me about sixteen duplicates, I told her she had more; she then gave me a purse containing thirty-three, eight of which were her own, the rest related to my property, by which means I found it. She said she spent the money in gin.</p>

               <p>STEPHEN BOSSY. I live in Lower Thames-street. On the 14th of September, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18180909-296-crimeloc1632">Finsbury-square</placeName>

I turned round, and saw the prisoner, with three others much older than himself. I saw the prisoner drop my handkerchief - I immediately seized him, and said I would take him to the watch-house-the other three immediately made off. He resisted very violently, and said I should not take him, as I was not an officer - He denied the charge. Vann immediately told him he had been watching him, and he would take him, which he did.</p>
               <p>THOMAS VANN. I am constable of the night. I took the prisoner in charge. I found a handkerchief on him, marked 
               <persName id="t18180909-296-person2059">T.S. </persName>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Several boys were behind him. I saw one of them take it, and throw it down.</p>

I charged him with it, he denied it, but afterwards said he would pay for them if I would say nothing about it.

On Sunday, the 9th of August, at half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went into the Docks, which are enclosed by a wall twenty feet high. I went to the back door of the office, and unlocked it, but found I could not open it when it was unlocked. I looked through the glass of the door, and found a piece of wood placed under the lock, to prevent its being opened. The watchman, Holmes, got in - I then entered the office, and found a spike-nail by the door, which was not there at half-past eight o'clock that morning. Several of the desk locks were broken open, and a drawer, where I kept money, was forced open, and a 1l. note and 8s. taken out. Every thing was safe in the morning when I was there. The key of the door, which is always left inside, was taken out. I went to the lodge, where the iron chest is deposited, the sash of the window was closed. I found it had been forced, there were marks on the iron-chest, apparently, as if it had been attempted with a crow. I went up to the room above, and tried to force the door, but found it resisted. I called Holmes to force it. I went to get a ladder, returned, and found the prisoner in his custody; he had been a labourer in the Company's service for two years, and knew where the property was kept; I have paid him from the very drawer where the money was taken from. He was not in the Company's service at the time, and had no business in the Docks. A grappling-iron and a piece of rope were in the room where he was found, which was not the right place for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see two men come into the Dock - A. I saw them leave it - They had no business there.</p>

I went to the upper room with Holmes, and found the prisoner getting off the floor; I asked him how he came there? he said he came in in the Lord Castlereagh, and got drunk, that he saw two men up there, and went up to them, but they swam away. I told him it was impossible for him to see that; he then said he did not see them swim across, but they said they were going to swim; that they beat him very much, and ran away. He did not appear to have been beat.</p>

I asked him if he had been employed on board the ship on Saturday? he said No. He said the window was open when he came there. I asked him who the two men were that he spoke of? He said there were no men, nor any person with him at all; that he told the people of the Dock that there was, but it was a lie,</p>

               <p>HANNAH HALL. I live at Mr. Fairfax's. in Hosier-lane, and <rs id="t18180909-311-viclabel1713" type="occupation">sell fruit in the street</rs>

The prisoner came up to me with a little girl about seven years old - She asked the price of my fruit, and then asked if my name was Lindsay; I said, No. She said she knew a poor woman of that name whom she wished to employ, and asked if I went out to work. I said I was glad to do any thing; my child was in my arms, his name is Thomas - He was then nine months old. She then took me to a cook-shop, and treated me with a dinner; she and the little girl eat with me. While we were in the shop, she asked me to fetch her a bundle from Mr. Smith's, No. 35, Oakley-street, Lambeth; she gave me 1s. to go, and said she would take care of my child while I was gone. I left my child with her in the cook-shop, which was near the Horse Guards. I went to No. 35, Oakley-street - I could find no such person, nor could I hear any thing of the prisoner. I returned to the cook-shop, the prisoner and my child were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl, who was with the prisoner, appear sensible - A. Yes; I had bills printed, describing my child and the prisoner, and made my loss as public as possible. I heard nothing of it till about two months after; when Mr. Betts took me to Aylesbury prison, where I saw the prisoner with three others; I immediately knew her to be the woman. I afterwards saw my child with six more children, about the same age, and knew my own immediately. Mr. Betts brought the girl to town with him, who was with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not find your child better dressed and better fed, than when it was with you - A. Yes; I found by the neighbours that she had behaved very well to it-this is the child which I have in my arms.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEGATE. I am a waiter at a cook-shop at Charing-cross. I remember the prosecutrix being there with a woman and little a girl, she had the child in her arms. She afterwards returned and complained of losing her child - I cannot swear to the woman.</p>

In July last, she came to Wootton with a child about eight or nine months old; in consequence of an advertisement, I went to her about the child. She said it was her's, and that she was delivered of it on the 7th of July; she said she was taken unwell in her journey to town, and when she got to town, she was delivered of it. I knew her before, and understood that she was pregnant before she left. I took the little girl, who lived with her, to Mrs. Hall, in town; I then took Mrs. Hall to Wootton, and showed her the child in Aylesbury gaol. I showed her the child with six others, and she immediately knew her own.</p>

On the 11th of July, a little after one o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners pass my box - They had nothing with them then. My box is at the corner of Clipstone-street, next to Portland-street. As soon as they had got round my box, two other boys passed - I immediately went round to watch them, as I knew Page before. I lost them all in a moment. I listened sometime, and then heard a talking in the prosecutrix's yard, which is only fenced off by an hedge. I remained there till half-past one o'clock, then went round part of my beat, and returned and listened sometime. I heard something come down heavily, as if somebody had jumped down into the garden - I heard nothing more for sometime. I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090098"/>round my beat and called two o'clock; returned, and heard persons talking in the yard. Nobody came out. I waited there, and omitted to call the half-hour, as I thought they might have seen me. I called the hour of three up Carburton-street, and the middle of Norton-street, and returned without finishing my round. When I came to the corner of Carburton-street, I saw two persons come in a direction from the prosecutrix's premises; they were about twenty yards from the house. I drew back and concealed myself, that they might not see me. They came up and passed me; they were each loaded. I followed and asked them what they had? they said Nothing; I desired them to stop and let me see, and laid hold of Turner; he dropped a piece of lead at my feet, which was rolled up. He had another piece and ran away with it. I had taken Page and kept him. I sprung my rattle. Turner was stopped in about five minutes. I am certain he is the man. I found two pieces of lead on Page also, rolled up under his coat. I took them both to the watch-house. I went to the prosecutrix's house that day, and took one piece of lead. I found the balcony partly stripped of its lead. The lead fitted; it appeared fresh cut. I found a knife on Page, which appeared to have cut lead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The transaction began about one o'clock-Yes. I waited there till three o'clock. I am sure they are the men who passed my box. I stopped them in Cirencester-place, which is two hundred yards from the house. I saw the lead dropped.</p>

I saw the watchman take one of the prisoners. Soon after I saw a third man come up the street, with his hands in his pockets, as if he had something heavy in them. I saw him go towards Mr. Morris's house.</p>

The prisoner had formerly been employed to work there. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I was going along Broad-street, opposite my slaughter-house gate, and saw him. He crossed over the way from me. He had a cloth on his shoulder. I saw some fat in it through a hole. It was in a butcher's round frock; the arms were tied up, to make it serve for a bag. I followed him up Poland-street; he went into Dring's melting-house, in Wardour-street. I then went into Mr. Dring's shop, in Oxford-street, and told his servant my suspicions. He took me to the melting-house, and showed me the fat which they said the prisoner had brought; from its appearance I knew it was stolen. It consisted of what we call toungs and shoulders of tripe, which is never cut away with the fat, it being always sold with the tripe. There was also about 21lbs. which had been taken in a hot state from the internal part of the bullock. Some pieces had the entrails on them. It was not cleaned in the usual way for sale. I got an officer, took him to Dring's shop, and found the prisoner there, with a note to receive his money for the fat. I gave him in charge to Plank, who asked him how he came by the fat. He said it was his own property; that he bought it and paid for it. He said he would not go without his money. Plank took him into custody. As we were going along, he said he would tell me where he got the fat; that he had it of two men, who were sitting at the Maidenhead public-house, New-street, close by. Plank and I went there, and found two men who worked for me. They denied it, and the magistrate discharged them; they promised to appear at the next examination, which one did, and the other absconded.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner at Dring's; he said he bought the fat. I asked him where, he refused to tell me. As I was taking him to the office, he said he received it of two men, who were at the Maidenhead, and that the prosecutor knew them. I found two of the prosecutor's men there and took them to the prisoner, who said they were the men. They were all three examined before the magistrate. The prisoner then denied that they were the men, or that he had said so.</p>

            . I am a servant at Dring's melting-house, in Wardour-street. On the 25th of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought two parcels of fat at two different times, which weighed six stone. I gave him an order to receive the money for it at the shop. I showed the fat to Jackson in the same state as he had brought it.</p>

I went to breakfast with Bailey at the public-house; the prisoner came in; Bailey said, "There is a parcel left for you, up in the corner." The prisoner took it up; he did not say who left it. I do not know what it was, or who brought it in. Bailey helped him up with it. He has since run away. I do not know what colour it was, or any thing about it.</p>

On the 26th of June, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners go up Mr. Rhodes's field, with a bundle in their hands, which they put into a ditch, and then got into the ditch themselves. Pretlove and I went and took them. They said they had found a prize. There was a bundle of wet linen, some lead, and a brass cock laid between them. I saw them shift the bundles from one to the other, as they appeared heavy.</p>
               <p>DAVID PRETLOVE. I am a watchman. I went with Dean, and found the prisoners in a ditch, One of them had his breeches down; just opposite to him was a quantity of leaden pipe. I tied up the lead. I turned aside, saw the bundle of linen, and took them to the watchhouse.</p>

I felt him draw my watch out, and immediately secured him; the others closed upon me. I took the watch from him. The gang demanded of me to let him go. I refused and held him fast. I had another person with me, or they would have rescued him. They wanted me to take him into a house to search him. I held him about ten minutes, when Limbrick and Read came and took him. I never let him go.</p>

I told him of it, and pointed the prisoners out to the prosecutor; he took one, and I took the other to Bow-street - He gave them in charge to an officer, who found the handkerchief in Ruffen's breeches. I had seen them in company before. The prosecutor attended before the magistrate, and swore to the handkerchief in the presence of the prisoners, they said nothing to it.

I went and informed the prosecutor - we went in pursuit of him; I knew the prisoner before, we took him in White Hart-yard. I pointed him out to the shopman there. The property was not found.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Garner. Weaver informed me the print was taken, I immediately missed it. She went with me - We found the prisoner in White Hart-yard coming out of his house; he denied having been in Long-acre that evening, and said his name was not Bates. He broke from me-the watchman took him.</p>

               <p>-HAWELL. The witness, Weaver, works with me in Drury-lane. I heard her say she did not see the prisoner take the cotton, for it was taken while she went in to tell the shopman that there was a suspicious character at the door.</p>
